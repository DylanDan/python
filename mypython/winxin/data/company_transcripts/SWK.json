(NYSE:SWK) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2017  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Greg Waybright - VP, IR", "Jim Loree - President & CEO", "Don Allan - EVP & CFO", "Jeff Ansell - EVP & President, Global Tools & Storage Business", "Analysts", "Chris Belfiore - UBS", "Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities", "Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital", "Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs", "Tim Wojs - Baird", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna", "Liam Burke - Wunderlich", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays", "Operator", "Welcome to the Q1 2017 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chelsey and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright", "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO; Don Allan, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, our Executive Vice President and President of our Global Tools & Storage Business.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, Jim and Don will review our first quarter 2017 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session and consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing.", "I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree. Jim?", "Jim Loree", "Thanks Greg and good morning everyone. As you saw the first quarter was an excellent start to 2017. All our businesses came out of the gate strong with each contributing to our robust 5% organic growth for the quarter. Revenues were $2.8 billion, up 5% versus prior year on strong organic growth.", "Tools & Storage continued to lead the way up 6% in the quarter with all regions contributing. Industrial posted a large positive top-line surprise with 4% organic growth on strong automotive system sales in Engineered Fastening and solid performance from the Infrastructure businesses which are finally beginning to see signs of life in their various end markets. This is an eight point positive sequential swing for the segment.", "And while it's still too early to conclude definitively, we're cautiously optimistic that we may begin to see the positive trend continue as the year progresses. Don will provide some more color on that when he goes through the segment details and our updated 2017 outlook in a few minutes.", "Finally, our Security business started the year off right posting 1% organic growth in line with our expectations. It was good to see the top-line expansion driving impressive operating leverage throughout the P&L expanding our operating margin rate by 110 basis points to a record first quarter rate of 14.2% excluding M&A related charges.", "This reflects our consistent focus on operational excellence as evidenced by a 160 basis point increase in our gross margin rate overcoming an adverse impact from currency and some commodity inflation.", "Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.29, as strong operating performance, more than offset the aforementioned currency and commodity headwinds, higher restructuring charges as well as an unplanned event based environmental charge related to a pre-merger closed facility. On top of these excellent financial results, we also closed three major capital allocation transactions in the quarter.", "Finalizing our acquisition of new tools, our acquisition of the craftsman brand, as well as the divestiture of our commercial hardware business, which I'll address in more detail in just a moment.", "Finally, based on the strong start and our improved outlook for the Industrial businesses, we are raising our 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to $7.08 to $7.28. This is inclusive of the previously disclosed impact of the three transactions I just mentioned and will be covered by Don later during his remarks.", "Turning to our recent portfolio activity and what made for a very busy quarter here, the Newell Tools acquisition with the iconic Lenox and Irwin brands closed on March 10, the day after the Craftsman deal closed. As you would expect our experienced integration teams are up and running full speed on the Newell integration and building out the Craftsman brand. On Craftsman the majority of our efforts are now focused on supply chain activities to initially support sales into non-Sears Holding channels. In parallel, we are developing commercial strategies for the brand and remain very excited about the potential growth opportunities. We continue to see a clear path towards annual growth of approximately $100 million a year for the next decade.", "Our initial conviction has only been reaffirmed since closing, as numerous customer interactions continue to substantiate our growth assumptions. This is reinforced by the powerful name recognition and consumer buying intent associated with the Craftsman brand. Suppliers are also positive about the opportunity to participate in reinvigorating the growth of this iconic brand.", "As expected, there is a lot of excitement and positive energy around our stated intention of bringing manufacturing for the Craftsmen brand back to the United States. Our plans for a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility are starting to take shape, so look for more to come on this front in the coming quarters.", "And as previously we expect the Craftsman brand transaction to generate approximately $0.08 of earnings accretion in 2017 excluding charges buildings of $0.35 to $0.45 accretion by year five. On Newell Tools our focus is now on integrating employees, suppliers, and customers into our existing operations. The team is focused on achieving the substantial cost synergies identified during due diligence. And as a reminder, we expect to achieve $80 million to $90 million in cost synergies with this deal, and will also soon begin tapping into the significant revenue synergy opportunities. Overall customer feedback has been extremely positive with many customers voicing a desire to expand the relationship and add new product lines. Work is well underway to accommodate these expansions including new distribution channels for the Lenox and Irwin brands into previously underserved markets where Stanley Black & Decker has a strong and established footprint.", "We continue to expect Newell Tools earnings accretion of approximately $0.24 per share in 2017, excluding charges, building to approximately $0.80 by year five. So as you can tell, we are excited about the prospects for these acquisitions, both for the strategic benefits as well as their financial impact.", "Regarding the total company, we believe we are set up well for a strong 2017. As always, we benefit from our deep and agile leadership team, our commitment to and focus on operational execution and our robust SFS 2.0 operating system. We're also benefiting from relatively stable exchange rates and for the first time in four years, we are not facing escalating FX headwinds at this stage of the year. The result is a healthy start to 2017 with a focus on maintaining the momentum behind our organic growth and margin expansion efforts, while also tapping into the significant value opportunities presented by Newell Tools and the Craftsman brand acquisitions.", "I'll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed discussion of first quarter results. Don?", "Don Allan", "Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. I would like to take a deeper dive into our business segments, which all performed very well in the first quarter.", "Tools & Storage revenue was up 9% in the quarter, as 6% organic growth and four points of acquisitive growth were offset by a point of currency pressure. The operating margin for this segment was up an impressive 16% year-over-year to 16.4% operating margin, as the Group achieved strong operating leverage and a solid top-line growth. Each Tools & Storage region and SBU posted positive organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America led the way and was up 8%. This strong performance was due to our U.S. commercial and retail channels which were up low-double-digits and high-single-digits respectively.", "Additionally, Canada posted solid organic growth of around 10%. New product introductions and successful field conversions drove growth in the commercial channel. Strong e-commerce volumes and continued momentum from the FlexVolt launch, field growth in the U.S. retail channel as we did overcome some modest channel inventory tightening.", "We expect the momentum surrounding FlexVolt which by the way did meet expectations for the quarter will be maintained and bolstered by our commercial teams launch strategy, which has a well-designed roadmap of promotions and new FlexVolt tool and accessory SKUs hitting the shelves regularly over the next few years.", "North American POS data remains healthy throughout the quarter, as it was up high-single-digits. This is particularly impressive given we were comping a mid-teen POS growth rate in the first quarter of 2016.", "The above-market growth trend in Europe continued in the quarter, with the region posting 6% organic growth. The outperformance was widespread across the region with almost all markets contributing. The European team continues to provide picture perfect examples of commercial excellence at its finest driving mid-teens growth on average among its top 10 customers in the quarter.", "Additionally, in the first quarter, we continue to see customer wins in the UK and strong market share gains in Italy and Iberia.", "Finally, the emerging markets were up 1% organically, as solid performances in Latin America and Asia were weighed down by continuing but improving pressure in the Middle East and North Africa. We are undergoing a transition to a direct model in Turkey which will weigh on growth within that region for the first few quarters but should ultimately provide a much better mid to long run opportunity in that country.", "Performance in Latin America was mixed with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador more than offsetting declines in Colombia and Argentina. Asia delivered strong performances in Korea and Japan which more than offset pressure we saw in Thailand and in the Philippines.", "The diligent pricing actions that we've been taking as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets is continuing to drive growth.", "Just one last comment on emerging markets. We are really beginning to see a lot of excitement from our customers around the potential future Irwin and Lenox rollout, more to come on that later this year.", "Within the SBUs, all lines were positive in the quarter. The power tools and equipment group was up 9% led by power tools and home products, both of which benefited from new product rollouts and continued strong commercial execution.", "Our hand tools, accessories, and storage organization delivered 3% growth on a strong performance within hand tools and storage, which benefited from a bounce back in industrial end markets. The overall industrial businesses within Tools & Storage were up mid-single-digit. In total, the Tools & Storage organization continued its momentum in the first quarter delivering solid above market organic growth and robust operating leverage driving 110 basis point margin expansion, while at the same time accelerating integration and commercialization efforts around the Newell Tools and Craftsman brand acquisitions.", "Let's move to Security. The Security segment had a nice start to the year as well, coming in right on top of our expectations posting 1% organic growth. North America, organic growth was up 2%, its highest organic growth quarter since the second quarter of 2015 led by higher volumes within automatic doors, which continues to perform very well as well as solid healthcare growth. Europe was flat organically in the quarter with mixed results across the markets as gains in the Nordics and UK were offset by declines in France and Central Europe.", "In terms of profitability the segment contracted 120 basis points year-over-year but was relatively in line with our expectations. The sale of the Mechanical Locks business which was finalized in the quarter drove approximately 70 basis points of that contraction, as this was an above line average business. The rest of the operating margin rate decline is a combination of channel mix and strategic investments within the sales organizations of Europe and North America.", "On the whole, the Security segment delivered a solid quarter starting the year on the right foot from an organic growth perspective, at the same time executing seamlessly on the Mechanical Locks divestiture. Additionally, they had a strong orders trend in the quarter and therefore backlog is positioned well going into the second quarter.", "Now turning to Industrial. We are extremely pleased with the segments outperformance this quarter as both the Engineered Fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered positive organic growth in excess of expectations. This top-line performance generated significant operating leverage and drove a 180 basis point improvement in operating margin rate for this segment as volume, productivity, and cost action more than offset currency headwinds.", "Engineered Fastening delivered 4% organic growth on a strong performance from the automotive business up low-double-digits, which more than offset lower electronic volumes, which were down 20% for the quarter. Auto fasteners sales continued to outpace light vehicle production numbers globally by a ratio of about 2 to 1. Additionally auto system sales were also a highlight in the quarter, up significantly versus the prior year on the back of previously won business beginning to translate into new model production.", "The Engineered Fastening team posted a record operating margin rate in the quarter in the low '20s as top-line growth combined with recent cost out actions delivered significant operating leverage.", "The infrastructure businesses posted a solid quarter as well in their own rights, up 2% organically. Our hydraulic tools business which has been revamping its commercial execution and go-to-market strategies for the last year or so is starting to see some momentum build posting its second consecutive quarter of organic growth due to higher volumes across all regions.", "Meanwhile, oil and gas was flat in the quarter but also ahead of expectations as this industry begins to experience accelerated onshore pipeline construction activity within North America. However, this is being offset by a continued low offshore project activity factor. While there is still lot of risk and uncertainty in our operating environment today both geopolitically and economically we are very encouraged by the collective performances across the portfolio in Q1. As we move deeper into 2017, we will remain focused on driving outsized organic growth and operating leverage, while also integrating the Newell Tools and Craftsman acquisitions into our world-class Tools & Storage franchise.", "Now, let's briefly take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. We were down slightly year-over-year mainly attributable to higher working capital as the large swings in net income and other were primarily driven by the gain on Mechanical Security divestiture.", "As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality for our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. However, keep in mind working capital turns in the quarter were up 0.9 turns versus the prior year when you exclude the impact of the portfolio move, a very solid start to the year. We remain on track to deliver 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. Just a reminder, this guidance is excluding the impact of the gains on the recent divestitures.", "Now let's turn to our 2017 guidance. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for 2017 to a range of $7.08 to $7.28 which is an increase of 9% to 12% versus the prior year. On a GAAP basis, this results in a range of $7.95 to $8.15 earnings per share, inclusive of various one-time charges and also the gains from the first quarter divestitures I previously mentioned.", "This $0.10 increase to our outlook comes through as a combination of slightly higher organic growth within our industrial-related businesses which contributes approximately $0.08 and incremental cost and productivity actions of $0.10 primarily within Tools & Storage. In the aggregate, this more than offsets the previously mentioned one-time first quarter environmental charge of $0.08. Additionally, we are maintaining our combined FX and commodity inflation headwind estimate at $100 million to $105 million.", "Additionally, we still expect $50 million of core restructuring for the year. However, keep in mind that $50 million is inclusive of the $12.5 million charge we took in the first quarter relating to the settlement of a legacy Canadian defined benefit plan.", "Finally, note that we expect second quarter EPS to be approximately 27% of the full-year 2017 guides.", "Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single-digits as healthy construction markets in the U.S. combined with a relatively stable Europe and a still volatile emerging market setup should allow us to continue to take share around the world. That top-line growth will translate into improved margin rate year-over-year. We are maintaining the organic growth view on Security as well up low-single-digits in 2017. Note that the margin rate for the segment will be down year-over-year as we begin the process of lapping comps inclusive of the Mechanical Locks business just divested this quarter. Excluding that sale however, the margin rate for the year will be flat to slightly positive.", "Finally, we are raising the top-line outlook for our industrial segment from previously down low-single-digits to now relatively flat. It's still little too early in the year to make any more aggressive predictions in this space, but we are seeing some positive signs, both in the Engineered Fastening end markets as well as within the infrastructure businesses. We continue to see operating margin improvements in this segment driven by the previous identified cost actions, but also due to the improved revenue outlook. As I noted before, there is still quite a bit of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty across our operating landscape in 2017. However, we remain cautiously optimistic as we are seeing signs of growth across all segments of the business in the first quarter and we believe we have a solid path to delivering the full-year revised guidance and outperforming the broader market from an organic growth and margin expansion perspective once again.", "We will remain focused and disciplined in our pursuit of that goal, particularly as we integrate and begin building momentum within our newly acquired tools businesses.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Jim to summarize this morning's call.", "Jim Loree", "Thank you, Don. Well as you've heard Stanley Black & Decker is hitting on all cylinders. The first quarter represented a solid start to the year as we continue to build on the momentum underlying our organic growth and margin expansion initiatives. As a result of the strong operating performance and a reasonably favorable operating environment, we raised guidance excluding charges and the gain on sale of the Mechanical Security business to $7.18 at the midpoint, a 10% increase on a year-over-year basis.", "Apart from our focus on organic growth, we're very excited about the opportunities to drive value within the Newell Tools and Craftsman brand acquisitions. And as I mentioned earlier, integration activity is well underway for both transactions and we received nothing, but positive feedback from all constituencies.", "And finally, I want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in the morning of May 16 in New York City. This will be a great opportunity to communicate our strategic and financial objectives and discuss the next chapter in the Company's evolution. We're also looking forward to showcasing numbers of our business unit and other key functional teams and we look forward to seeing you there.", "We're now ready for Q&A, Greg.", "Greg Waybright", "Great, thanks Jim. Chelsey, we can open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions].", "Chris Belfiore with UBS is online with a question.", "Chris Belfiore", "So I guess I just wanted to kind of -- kind of touch a little bit on the strength you guys in industrial -- in Industrial segment the Engineering -- the Engineered Fastening business with the automotive systems performance there. Is this something that can kind of be like lumpy through the year? Just kind of, I know you said you're kind of looking to see well how things are going to play out and that's why the organic pressure is still at relatively flat for the year. But I mean that wouldn't kind of imply that it could be may be more first half weighed than second half weighed just getting to like the -- the annual guidance there. So is it kind of a lumpy thing or is it specific like a project.", "Don Allan", "Sure, this is Don. It is somewhat lumpy in the year where we do have like we experienced in the first quarter, we'll probably have a similar dynamic in the second quarter around system sales within Engineered Fastening but in the back half right now, we really don't see a lot of those types of system sales occurring as a lot of the new model launches are happening here in the first half of the year, back half of the year. Right now, that's not the case so that's part of the reason that we're being a little more prudent and balanced in our view of the full-year for that particular business. Those dynamics can change a little bit every once in a while, but at this stage, we think that's the most appropriate perspective of the full-year.", "Operator", "Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities is online with a question.", "Rich Kwas", "Hi, two questions. One, I guess Don on just a follow-up on the industrial question from a mix standpoint what are you assuming for auto for the back half of the year when you look at from a production standpoint, there is some concern with North America and may be even China, that things slowdown. And then just a broader question for Jim around the manufacturing facility for Craftsman how are you looking about the expansion into the U.S. with the new facility, given that there seems to be increased uncertainty regarding the VAT and that sort of impact on your manufacturing position. Are you -- how committed you are or do you, are you committed to what I should say, and then any implications from anything that doesn't go on tax wise?", "Don Allan", "Okay. I'll start with the first question, Rich, and continuation of the previous question, which on the automotive business with Engineered Fastening, we do see a really some strong growth here in the first half of the year, just like we experienced in the first quarter. But right now, we do see light vehicle production slowing in the back half in particular North America but even slowing in some of the other regions compared to what we expect to experience in the first half. So that's part -- that is really what's kind of factored into our guidance when we look at first half versus second half in the industrial business, in particular, we have a combination of the -- the auto systems, and then you have a secondary factor of just a slowing of production in the back half of the year versus the first half based on current projections.", "Jim Loree", "Okay. And then on the second question, and just to reiterate how committed are we to our USA manufacturing strategy related to Craftsman given the uncertainty, but certainly the lower probability of the implementation of a border adjustability tax. And frankly we just comment on that that it's good just see that the government seems to be coming around on that one and understanding that that is not a good idea for the United States of America and many, many companies within the United States as well and really pretty much everywhere.", "So offsetting that aside for a minute as it relates to the facility expansion plans there was never a contingent on a VAT being implemented, it was really a function of the strategy for re-Americanizing Craftsman and just so everyone is aware we manufacture about 30% of all tools that are sold in the United States of America today and we are able to cost effectively do that with today's manufacturing technology and our intent is to increase that for the total tools business including Craftsman but in particular Craftsman. We have 11 tools plants in the United States and those tool plants, probably the majority of them will be expanding capacity in addition to the facility that we've discussed.", "And in the end it maybe -- it maybe more than one facility in the U.S. we will have to see how it all shakes out, but we're looking at various scenarios, so answer to your question we're very committed to manufacturing in the U.S. for Craftsmen and for the rest of our United States sales.", "Operator", "Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital is online with a question.", "Saliq Khan", "Yes, with the increasing strength in your Tools & Storage metrics, what are you hearing right now from your distributors and your channel partners about the state of your product offerings. But also have you've been able conduct a review of the talent as well as the temperament of all the employees within the recent acquisitions.", "Jim Loree", "Would you repeat the first part of your question, please?", "Saliq Khan", "Sure. If you take a look at the strength that you have within the Tools & Storage business what you've been hearing from the distributors and the channel partners about the state of your product offerings?", "Jim Loree", "Okay. We're going to have Jeff Ansell tackle that one since he is right on the job.", "Jeff Ansell", "Thank you. To this point that the response that we received from both end-users and trade customers globally has been outstanding, they want favorability on the Craftsman news was 90%. From Irwin, Lenox or Newell Tools perspective similarly positive feedback from customers and employees. So they want to be onboard 3,200 employees to our system seamlessly and we spoke with over 1,000 customers in the first 48 hours of the integration and the feedback has universally been great brands, great opportunities they have struggled free acquisition Newell Tools they struggled to serve their customers in terms of availability of products, service levels. And that's the number one thing, the customers have said to get that right and we can grow this business.", "And I'm pleased to say that in the first -- less than the first month of ownership, we've improved that backlog position reduced it by over 70%. So we've met the number one objective of the customer. So the feedback from our customers has been outstanding globally and from employees as well and we think it really strengthens our portfolio and opportunities to serve our customers unlike anyone in the world.", "Operator", "Jim Ritchie from Goldman Sachs is online with a question.", "Evelyn Chow", "Hi, good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow on for Joe Ritchie. How is it going guys?", "Jim Loree", "Great, Evelyn.", "Evelyn Chow", "I was hoping if you could just give us an update on your gross margin performance, which has been incredibly strong not just this quarter but really for the past four, is there anything kind of significant happening at anywhere internal actions, mix, maybe just any other items that are kind of driving that kind of year-over-year expansion?", "Don Allan", "Sure, I will take that. But there's nothing unusual, I think it's a continuation of all the things that we do under the SFS 2.0 operating system model which is focused on appropriate pricing actions, driving cost productivity, transforming our back office et cetera, et cetera all those different things, commercial excellence where we're really trying to make sure that we're providing new products at the right price points to gain market share all that that entire operating model is really what drives that on an ongoing basis.", "So when I look at the first quarter in particular, you've got that dynamic of just continued trend of trying to drive operating leverage as we grow. And so the way that we drive operating leverage as we grow is that we look at various things excuse me that I just described but then we also try to reinvest along a portion of that along the way, so we can continue to stimulate future growth.", "And so we don't necessarily let all the leverage drop through but we had a large part of it drop through along the way. And the only way you're going to get operating leverage is to do the things that I just described, which is focused on pricing mostly focused on cost reduction, driving productivity for the supply chain offset any inflation that you're experiencing et cetera, et cetera. So you combine that with a factor that this is the first year we don't have $200 million of currency pressure. We have a number that's 50-ish roughly on an annual basis at this point, all those factors combined with that are resulting in a continued trend of strong gross margin.", "Jim Loree", "And Jeff why don't you tackle that same question and give them a little insight into how you think about it in the Tools business as well?", "Jeff Ansell", "Sure Jim, thank you. Inside of Tools, if you look at last year's period this time last year, we had grown about 8%. This quarter in the emerging markets, we grew another 7% in total 6% and as you know Tool P&Ls volume are very volume-dependent. So with that volume growth, it's given us a lot of degree to freedom inside of our supply chain, it's driven great productivity, while at the same time, tremendous quality improvements drove -- lowering our warranty return rates and the volume growth that we've had has been profitable growth meaning we targeted specific promotional opportunities in specific categories, seasonally adjusted for the right retail environment around the world and we've been successful.", "And in addition to that, we fought around the world with all this currency pressure we faced now for four years to be very, very frontal facing there. And if you look at places like the UK, we grew 16% this quarter, 8% was volume, 8% was price given what's going on there. And so if you take all those things into account, we better served our customers and in the same time been more reliable and more profitable while we've grown the business at unprecedented levels.", "Jim Loree", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Tim Wojs from Baird in online with a question.", "Tim Wojs", "I think I was on mute there. Good morning guys. Nice job.", "Jim Loree", "Good morning, thank you.", "Don Allan", "Thanks, Tim.", "Tim Wojs", "Hey just on I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the discussions that you're having with customers just around Craftsman and the distribution strategy there now that you guys know that asset, maybe where the most interested and just how do you leverage the entire Stanley Black & Decker portfolio to really benefit kind of drive the maximum benefit for the total company?", "Jim Loree", "Jeff?", "Jeff Ansell", "I will take that. So it's really too early, early to declare the commercial strategy, we are that is not to say we're not working on it. We're working on it feverishly and we have been since March 9. But what we could tell you early read from this process is, we have an incredible demand for the Craftsman product across our U.S. customer base even in some other international geographies like the UK and Australia but in particular in the U.S. In terms of its opportunity within our stable of brands, if you look at our absolute share today although we are number one by all accounts and growing faster than the market, we still only we own about 20% of the total global market. So 80% of it is still out there for us to go after across 10 or 11 different marquee brands.", "And if you -- if you look at Craftsman in particular, it still represents nearly a couple of billion dollars in the marketplace today. And while we have grown our Tool business from $600 million to over $8 billion that Craftsman franchise has survived and that tells you what a loyal installed base that is, the customer however says that they would much prefer to find that brand in a lot of other more convenient locations. So our opportunity to take an installed base we've unable to dislodge make it available across other -- other retail options is exactly what the customer is asking for and we'll give a little more clarity May 16 but not full, we are working feverishly on this and as soon as we are able, we will tell you more about it, we can't wait to get started.", "Operator", "Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan is online with a question.", "Michael Rehaut", "Couple of quick -- couple of questions if I could squeeze them in, first if you could give any update on the M&A landscape particularly in terms of what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint, what people are asking and if you still see valuations are reasonable and should we think about timing that 2017 and perhaps some of your other segments are something that's possible or if you know you're going to be focusing mostly on Tools & Storage. And then just secondly on the breakthrough innovation front, any update there as you look at your other segments augmenting what you've done so far in FlexVolt. Thanks very much.", "Jim Loree", "Hey, Mike. First of all on the M&A landscape we just spent $3 billion or almost $3 billion and are integrating feverishly as Jeff says, two major acquisitions in Tools. So this is going to be a year of digestion for the most part and I think everybody should understand and can understand why that would be both from a financial balance sheet point of view as well as an operational bandwidth point of view.", "So having said that, I would say the pipeline for M&A is about as robust as we've ever seen it with valuations and in its own, I think is manageable with good synergies not cheap by any stretch, but some really interesting strategic assets out there that are of a decent sized, decent enough to move the needle. So we're coming through those right now and doing a lot of analysis and thinking strategically about what makes the most sense. We may do some very small acquisitions yet this year but there won't be -- there won't be anything which I would call material in size but be on the lookout in as we get into next year for something in all likelihood in one of the other segments, other than tools wouldn't rule tools out, but I would say that in all likelihood, it would probably be in either industrial or security which is where we see the action today. So that's the M&A picture, we can talk more about that at the Analyst Meeting for people that are interested.", "As far as breakthrough innovation I have never been more excited about the opportunities that we see across the company and we have about 10 teams up and running. We have every business in the company has at least one team and our emerging markets group has a team and we're all using all those teams are using the same formula that we use for FlexVolt under the global Tools & Storage model that we have identified as part of SFS 2.0. So you'll see more information about that at the Analyst Meeting, but I can tell you that we don't expect a 100% batting average on these. But I would think that if we have 10 teams up and running and have been up and running now for us anywhere between a year-and-a-half to six months in that timeframe, there will be some innovations coming out of those teams that we've already seen some. One of the challenges for us will be some of those require commercialization in places or in ways or channels that we don't necessarily have access to today.", "So another one of our challenges related to breakthrough innovation will be getting some channel access to for some of these innovations that are a little bit out of the fairway, if you will. And I think you see a combination of human resources additions to tackle those challenges as well as some integration of M&A activities with our breakthrough innovation activities and synergizing up both of those. So really exciting times here at Stanley Black & Decker as far as breakthrough innovation goes.", "Operator", "Dennis McGill from Zelman and Associates is online with a question.", "Dennis McGill", "Hi, thank you guys. I was hoping you could may be expand a little bit on the first quarter margin within Tools & Storage I think going into the quarter extracting both currency and brand investment to be some pressure on margin and a very strong margin performance there so little color there. And then as you look at the full year the positive year-over-year some different factors going on, especially with the acquisitions specific to Craftsman can you just maybe put some numbers around it given the royalty payments and things might impact margin there and how we should model that business?", "Don Allan", "Sure. So let's start with the first quarter gross margin, which was, as I said, very strong. We clearly did experience commodity inflation in the quarter, we experienced some year-over-year FX pressure as well, but we did have some nice pricing benefits Jeff mentioned some of things that we've done in particular in Europe and some other markets around the world that have been positive for us, he is referring more the last year, but we also some saw some of the impact this year in the first quarter.", "And then we also had focus on cost actions and productivity that came in very nicely throughout the quarter and then we -- we put a little bit investment back into the P&L. So I think the probably difference was as we didn't put quite as much investment back in the P&L as we originally were anticipating at the beginning of the quarter, but frankly, the rate was not dramatically better than we anticipated it was just modestly better.", "As far as Craftsman goes this year as we said it about $0.08 of EPS impact for us. The margin impact will be relatively modest, not a big number. There is a, which many of you're aware of their accounting aspects related to the royalty stream or the free royalty basically that we provided to Sears that does have an annual impact. This year that will drive frankly a large part of the operating profit here in 2017. And then as we move into 2018 and beyond it will be more about the activities associated with driving organic growth, driving more profitability in the business through our supply chain in our manufacturing etc cetera, etc cetera. And so I wouldn't expect a large number here in 2016 -- 2017 I'm sorry based on what I just described and also just keep in mind, a large part of the operating margin will come from that accounting dynamic.", "Operator", "Robert Barry from Susquehanna is online with a question.", "Robert Barry", "I had a question on Tools margins, I guess in two parts. I mean big picture up over 100 basis points in 1Q. I mean do you think you can maintain something close to that degree of kind of year-over-year progress, a lot of those drivers, you mentioned seem like they could carry forward. And I think you were expecting even better performance in the back half due to lower launch costs. And then just kind of a sub-question related to Newell synergies what's the cadence of that $80 million to $90 million of cost synergies. I think that was by year 3. How much is coming in 2017 versus in 2018 and 2019. Thank you.", "Don Allan", "Yes, so the gross margin, yes the trend I expect. I expect the trend to continue throughout the year. Can I guarantee every quarter will be perfect based on what we did in Q1? Absolutely not. But because there is timing of when we make investments and various other factors, but the Tools & Storage business right now, although they have some headwinds, the headwinds aren't quite as large as what we've experienced over the last few years.", "Currency is much lower number; commodity inflation right now is a reasonable number. We'll continue to watch that as the year progresses. But in total, those numbers are about $100 million to $105 million with a large part of that, probably 80% of that hitting the Tools & Storage business. So when I think of the business trend and as I mentioned as I went through guidance I think the trend is going to continue to be accretive year-over-year as we go throughout this year. And I want to say be of the same magnitude every quarter based on what we had in Q1. So we definitely expect solid accretion.", "As far as Newell cost synergies we as Jeff mentioned, we've just started that process and about 30 days good news is we had a fair amount of planning, leading up to the closing over about a 90 to 120 day period of time. So we were ready to go day one, and which was -- which is always great to be an acquisition, and so this year, we think we're probably going to get about $20 million to $25 million of cost synergies from Newell in 2017. And the rest of it will kind of pace a little evenly over the next three years. So that would be what you should expect for 2017.", "Operator", "Liam Burke from Wunderlich is online with a question.", "Liam Burke", "On the industrial tools side of the business Jim, you mentioned strength was that across the board or were there any particular verticals that did well?", "Jim Loree", "I'll let Jeff tackle it since he has got industrial tools under him.", "Jeff Ansell", "We were up strong mid-single-digits about 7% in the industrial business that was pretty pervasive across all of our industrial tools businesses. The Tier 1 folks were up double-digit in the -- in the quarter. So that recovery looks -- looks promising and we believe our growth in that market certainly with a share gain more than just a market improvement although the market did improve concurrent with our Q1 results. We did -- we did see some, some industrial tools folks actually exit the market, which we very quickly converted over to our brands, which was fantastic.", "So things like that as well as the flexible introduction in those industrial channels has been really high, really well done well accepted in that technology really performing in that marketplace so all those things come together for a market that has improved a little more than we expected and our growth is greater than that market itself. So that's kind of the way we see it going forward.", "Jim Loree", "So Jeff while you're on the topic of FlexVolt may be you could just expand a little bit on the program right now. I know there is a little skepticism out there from a couple of people who probably have a vested interest and skepticism. So why don't you just tell give them the ground fruit about FlexVolt right now.", "Jeff Ansell", "What tends to be in this marketplace competitors are violent and if your competitors don't have a response they tend to -- they have a negative view on what you -- what you're doing and how it's performing. The reality is we couldn't be happier with FlexVolt and if you think of 7% growth in this first quarter 8% in North America, 6% in Europe. We're very pleased with that. But half that growth came from FlexVolt half came from the core, so what it says, our core business vibrant we comped a very big quarter from last year and grew the core at the same time while allowing FlexVolt to provide the other half of the growth.", "Our retail execution of FlexVolt is now more than double-digits ahead of what the customer expectations work, which is fantastic. And the uptick and uptake in industrial channels every bit is good if not better. So if you consider those things and you look to the fact that we are loading new flexible products as we speak in this quarter and we will continue to load new introductions throughout 2017. And as Jim said, in the next several years that has been the real, the real driver behind what you do with this breakthrough innovation team. We have to continue to keep this fresh and we feel that we are quite, quite nicely doing that.", "The last point I would tell you is, while it takes time to introduce new systems and power tools the fact that this does leave the old system behind has led to a much faster adoption than most new power tool platforms. As such, our growth in FlexVolt, the ramp in FlexVolt is 10 times faster than the ramp in brushless as an example. So we couldn't be more pleased and we are we know it's a competitive advantage and the average of five stars. The average user rating of FlexVolt is 4.9, so if you get the product right for the user everything else takes care of itself. So we feel great.", "Operator", "David MacGregor from Longbow Research is online with a question.", "David MacGregor", "Yes sir, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter.", "Jim Loree", "Thanks, David.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, thanks. Just around FlexVolt if you could may be go back to Jeff and just talk about the development of 16 and 120 volt cordless tools and then how should we think about kind of the growth performance and the timing of those products?", "Jeff Ansell", "Well, the beautiful thing about FlexVolt is we are able to develop 20 volt tools where they're appropriate, where the max watt outperformance is appropriate. At the same time, develop 60 volt tools where the max watt outperformance is required and obviously there is a cost difference right the 60 volt tool is more expensive proposition for the user and for us that delivers unprecedented performance, at same time the user wants the right tool for the right job, at the right cost.", "So all those things come together and what you'll see over the next 36 months we'll be presenting this to Jim and team in the next few weeks and then you'll see some of it at the May 16 session, you'll see fresh introductions of both 20 volt and 60 volt tools coming within the FlexVolt range and I will tell you that the users pick up on them has been equivalent. The user likes what they can do with FlexVolt batteries under 20 volt system but they really have also embraced the 60 volt performance. Circular saw in particular is absolutely killing it. The portable you mentioned 120 volt, the portable products like miter saws which are 120 volt absolutely killing it. So the user has embraced all those various platforms and because it gives them the performance of coated in a cordless package. So more to follow but yes we are very, very active in development of 20, 60 and even 120 volts going forward.", "Operator", "Robert Wertheimer from Barclays is online with a question.", "Robert Wertheimer", "Congratulations on getting all the deals done, obviously a lot of work and rapidly done. On Craftsman is there and what's your sense of scenarios and contingencies if Craftsman at Sears declined for whatever reason faster than expected. Do you have a current channel to absorb it; do you think that the additional channels you might add are going to be in place in the near term?", "Jim Loree", "I think we're planning for a more rapid ramp than $100 million a year over 10 years. We can probably handle a ramp with our current planning at about 2X rate of that clearly that's hypothetical at this point in time and it's a contingency but it's certainly definitely something that we are planning for in the event that that were to occur.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright", "Chelsey thank you. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call and obviously please contact me if you have any further questions.

My name is Nicole and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I'll now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2016 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO; and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our second quarter 2016 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren. John?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Greg. Before we get started, it's with both a sense of accomplishment and admittedly some sadness that we're announcing my retirement today as the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, effective July 31, 2016. I say there is some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees, since the first quarter of 2004. But, I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm. For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our board of directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization, as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have come to expect from this company. And, to that end, Jim is uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things, given his tenure with the company and his role in leading the transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so.", "Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any point during my 12 year tenure with the company. There are strong, competent leaders in place across our various businesses and we're not anticipating any major changes to the strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement. I'll be staying on as Chairman of the board through the end of the year, and I'll continue as a special advisor to the company through the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim, and the rest of the management team in any way that I can.", "I'm proud of everything the company has accomplished over the last 12-plus-years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12%, and a total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include, among other things, serving on a number of boards as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world, to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper.", "I'll turn 65 in September. And rather than thinking of this as going out at the top, I think of it more as a long distance relay race where we've built a good lead and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead. And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best days still lie ahead of us.", "So, let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Here's some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%, that continues an incredible trend with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter.", "Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth \u2013 the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off 6% mainly due to single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business, and the well expected lower Infrastructure volumes, as Oil & Gas and Hydraulics remained challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets, respectively.", "Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus same quarter a year ago. That is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while Industrial declined marginally, but to a very respectable rate of 17%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year, on strong operational performance along with a lower share count.", "Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform and you'll have your own well-informed views. I've participated in several of the major introductions, and the words \"game-changing\" have been a common reaction from our customers. The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create the cordless jobsite.", "Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50; that's up 6% to 10% versus 2015, and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40 and, concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.", "Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad-based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%, we got a positive 1% from price, for 4% organic growth, currency was a 2 percentage point offset for a revenue growth of 2%.", "All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%, Europe up 10%, emerging markets flat, rest of the world up 4%, for again, total organic growth of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later that baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4%, to an estimate of 4%.", "There were lots of puts and calls within the emerging market group, volatile markets as you know, but our Latin American group was up 9%, with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low-teens, Tools and Security growth was offset by Industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening consumer electronics business. But, all in all, really strong growth in the quarter.", "Let me turn it over to Jim, who's got an update on our game-changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program as well as some of the details on the segment.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you, John. Before that I just want to thank John for being a trusted colleague and a mentor, and a friend, and also for all that John has done for this company and our stakeholders over the years. He and I have enjoyed an outstanding business partnership for over 12 years, teaming up to lead the company through a transformation from a small cap building products company to a large cap diversified industrial. It is no coincidence that John's arrival in 2004 marked the beginning of a growth renaissance period for Stanley. And I'm honored to be named as our next CEO, succeeding John, with a mission to lead us through the next stage of our journey. The company has never been stronger, with all its well-established global franchises, agile and deep leadership bench, and strong and evolving SFS2.0 operating system.", "Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company. They have supported me all the way, through both their words and their actions, and have thus enabled us to effect a smooth leadership transition.", "The impressive results you've seen quarter-after-quarter from this company are a direct result of this team's experience, commitment, and passion for winning. What better way to highlight the immense opportunities present in this next stage of our evolution than to introduce you to the first output from breakthrough innovation, our SFS2.0 initiative.", "The patent-protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the jobsite. It allows users to switch from 20 volt to 60 volt to the never before seen 120 volts of cordless power, using the same battery pack regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards compatible with our existing line of DEWALT 20 Volt tools, and when used in these products, the FLEXVOLT battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant runtime and performance advantages. FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord on the jobsite, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools. And at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind, as the FLEXVOLT battery packs used on their new 60 volt and 120 volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20 volt products.", "FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally-enabled, and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors, and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tool subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October. We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets and we will be conducting a massive end user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds.", "This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near-term, we will focus on delivering the end user's long held dream of the cordless jobsite, and over the intermediate to longer-term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities. This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation in several other businesses across the company, so stay tuned.", "I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both FLEXVOLT and SFS2.0, as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard.", "Now moving on to 2Q. I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum delivering another high-single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8% and equally as impressively improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%. Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3 point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions and SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%; followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets up 4%.", "The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low-single-digit growth environment in those markets and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share on the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities, and new product development initiatives such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course of business innovation. This all important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and a hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above market growth, thus enabling SFS2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base.", "Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10% with consistent strength across Professional and Consumer Tools and Tools & Storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high-single-digits, driven by our new line of DEWALT and FatMax measuring lasers offsetting pressure in Proto industrial hand tools.", "Taking a regional look at the segment, in North America, momentum was good across all major retailers, with high-single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms. And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth on the heels of two years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double-digits including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains in Professional Power Tools. And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way, both up in high-single-digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America which was down.", "Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP cordless Power Tools. E-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region. Asia also delivered a notable performance with good organic growth in China, South Korea, and Indonesia. And as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America, however efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions, amidst geopolitical turmoil.", "So, in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro in several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward.", "Shifting over to Security, Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013. Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth, and strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations. The unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve, as volume leverage productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter.", "North American Security also made progress, solid organic growth in healthcare and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in electronic security or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio with orders and backlog in a healthy position heading into the second half of the year and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold.", "In total, Security improved on almost every front with order rates, backlog, and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America and the team is well positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress.", "Moving on to Industrial, Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening combined with anticipated pressure in Infrastructure resulted in a 6% organic decline. Expense de-leveraging on lower volume, combined with negative FX, drove a corresponding profit decline although segment margin continued to be at impressive, well above company line average levels. And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower than expected volume with one major electronics customer.", "The general industrial business was down modestly in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe. Infrastructure was down 11% organically as a slowdown in offshore oil and gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines.", "Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year.", "So while Industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price. Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries.", "So, in summary, like all multi-national businesses in today's environment of slowing global growth, an unprecedented geopolitical volatility, and an ever more rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins, and do it all with a capital efficient approach. SFS2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence, and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front.", "We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. Today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8%, and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum.", "And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide a financial update.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million for a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and continued improvements in working capital, which generated a positive $58 million of cash in the quarter for a meaningful $108 million of year-over-year improvement. Our working capital turns were 8.2 times at the end of Q2, which was a 1.2 times improvement versus the prior year second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, this leaves our free cash flow $256 million ahead of prior year, again with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement.", "As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate. This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5 times for working capital turns.", "Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit, on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million in pound sterling denominated revenues in the U.K., and more than $1.7 billion in euro denominated revenues across the euro region in 2016. To-date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It is likely too early to speculate on the demand side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low- to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region, as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier. As you might expect, we are monitoring this situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly, as a more definitive picture materializes.", "From a currency perspective, however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision, both with regards to the mechanics of their exit as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency related pressure to our operating margin.", "I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to $1.20, the combination of these moves would generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured at spot rates that I just mentioned. Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst case impact for 2016.", "On that note, let's move on to page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the incremental pound and euro pressures I just mentioned as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated.", "Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of a statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the size of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary.", "One last point on currency: our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond. And we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures such as the Canadian dollar and the euro to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017.", "Let's turn our attention to the next page and our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents a 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income.", "As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year, moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS2.0 initiatives. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence, and breakthrough innovation activities to help drive above-market growth beyond 2016.", "These two positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwind and one-time new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q, with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter.", "Moving to the right-hand side of the page, you get a better sense of the drivers behind the organic growth increase, as Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high-single-digits for the year on the great momentum we have seen in the first half combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment as we continue to see pressure in the general industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low-single-digit declines in 2016.", "The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low-single-digit growth expected for the full year.", "Finally, we expect the Tools & Storage and Security segments to deliver positive year-over-year improvements to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower in 2016 versus 2015, as the impact from lower volume and FX pressure more than offsets the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams.", "In summary, the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward. Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4%, and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage. On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance to the range of $6.30 to $6.50, as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures.", "In June, we introduced the world to DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction jobsite, delivering the power of corded with the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world.", "And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO is the impact he had on building our high integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team and, as a result, we are well positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization motivated toward achieving these goals.", "On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for the support over the past decade. That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to Q&A.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Great. Thanks, Don. Nicole, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey, guys, good morning. John, best of luck to you going forward and, to Jim, congratulations.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I was wondering if you could provide some detail on what your assumptions are for growth in the various verticals within fastening and for industrial infrastructure in the back half or for the year.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. I'd be happy to do that. So, in the Industrial segment, we were down 6% here in the second quarter. We don't expect the decline to be as severe in the back half of the year, probably low-single-digits, with it being a little larger in the third quarter and smaller in the fourth quarter as the comps get easier, in particular related to the electronics business. When you look at the different pieces, we do feel pretty good about our automotive fastener business in the back half of the year. It's seen a strong performance in the first half, up mid-single-digits as far as organic growth. And then in the back half, we expect that trend to continue as we get over a more difficult comp related to some of the equipment sales that we had in the first half related to the automotive systems business.", "The electronics business will continue to be a pressure point in the back half, although as the comps will slowly get easier as time goes on. We would expect that to be a rather large negative V in the back half as it has been in the first half and the general industrial business will kind of be a low- to mid-single-digit decline, as well, in the back half.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Hi, good morning, guys. And I guess congratulations to John and Jim both.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "On the Tools margins, clearly strong execution this quarter. I think a host of things, productivity and likely price cost included. Can you maybe give us a bit of a trend line? I know you have FLEXVOLT launch costs here in the second half and FX, but maybe excluding those out, how should we think about incremental margins or how should we think about the margin from here and maybe the line of sight beyond some of the 2016 launch costs? Just given the outperformance that we saw in this quarter.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I think obviously the second quarter was an outstanding margin performance and organic growth performance, as Jim mentioned, for Tools & Storage. As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as you mentioned, is an area that is an initial pressure point to gross margins as we roll that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margins as we get deeper into the launch next year, and then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of 2016, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between the 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics.", "The ongoing margins, however, from an incremental margin perspective will continue to be healthy and consistent with what we've said in the past, that as we see organic growth, incrementally we would expect 30% to 35% drop through in margins, sometimes affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments or if there's certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year close to 17% operating margin, if not slightly over. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve from that on a go-forward basis.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Evelyn Chow - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, John, Jim, congratulations. This is actually Evelyn Chow pinch hitting for Joe. Maybe just focusing on the gross margins for the company as a whole. They were incredibly strong this quarter. In your release you cited a few different factors and you mentioned commodity deflation has helped. Can you provide some more color on the relative contributions of the drivers you cited and the sustainability of this kind of expansion?", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, sure, I'll take it. You want to take it Jim?", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, I'll take it because this is something that we work really hard on at this company. You think about the gross margin performance this quarter in light of the FX pressures that we had, which almost totaled $40 million, it is really remarkable that we've been able to achieve this kind of accretion in the gross margin rate and what it really derives from working on everything that we possibly can to impact the margin rate in a positive way. And that starts with productivity and working hard on four wall cost productivity, working hard on vendor productivity, G&A productivity, our functional transformation initiative starting to pay some dividends, the commercial excellence initiative from SFS2.0, we're driving price realization, price optimization, all these things kind of combined, we are very, very focused on managing mix, focused on managing the lifecycle of new products, or products in general, and introducing new products at higher margins as the more mature products kind of margin has a degrading tendency over time. It's a combination of all those things, and we continue to target gross margin improvements over the medium-term, as well, and I think you'll see that over the coming years as a result of everything I just mentioned.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations and best wishes, John and congratulations, Jim.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Rich.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I'm going to squeeze in a couple here. Just on the inflection in margin and Security. Just thoughts around if this is a true inflection, any puts and takes as we think about the back half, sustained momentum, comments along those, and then on electronics with the one customer being such a headwind, what's the focus on progress in terms of trying to diversify the customer base? Thank you.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Don, go ahead. Let me just say, Rich, you're talking two different businesses: Security and then you're moving to Fastening. We'll get them both. But the sequential consistent improvement in Security, it's real and it's here to stay. In Europe, the team has really embraced the need to grow organically and they've done it consistently in a very tough market. U.S., the focus has been more on operational excellence, field efficiency, and both teams focusing on what we've asked them to focus on and they're doing a great job on both fronts. But I'll let Don answer your question specifically.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, so, John is absolutely correct that the Security business continues to generate a positive momentum around various initiatives, specific to profitability. We've talked about several of them over the last year or so on different occasions as driving more efficient field productivity, really trying to streamline their SG&A, to achieve certain objectives over the long-term as a percentage of revenue, and they continue to make progress in that regard.", "And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right levels of profitability on new business, have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability. And you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12%, just under 12% profitability in Q1 and then 12.6% in Q2, and we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half, and for obviously the full year, with hopefully being close to 100 basis points improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing in all three regions. Obviously, emerging markets is relatively small, but in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis.", "As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and Industrial, yeah, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with, and around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business, but as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has shrunk dramatically and now represents close to $70 million on an annualized basis. And we think, for the long-term, that's probably a reasonable number somewhere between $50 million to $70 million, but we'll see where we go from here but that's kind of how we're viewing the business at this stage.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And also, I'd like to add my congrats to Jim and John. My question is focused around raw materials. If you could just kind of remind us what the changes in raw materials has impacting 2016, if that's changed at all with the move in steel prices, and I know it's obviously very early on right now, but maybe how to start thinking about, with the recent move in steel, how that may or may not impact 2017 and if there's certain hedges or pricing offsets that you think are in your wheelhouse to offset any pressures into next year.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure, Mike. This is Don. I'll take that. We think this year we're probably getting about $40 million to $50 million of benefit from commodity deflation, and a lot of that primarily is in the first half, as we're really starting to anniversary some of those benefits that we started experiencing last summer. And so, in the back half of the year, we don't expect incremental improvement and we might even see a little bit of pressure in certain commodities as you just touched on a couple of them but we don't expect that to be material in the second half of the year.", "We have mentioned previously that we had locked into a lot of commodity-based contracts with certain key vendors earlier this year for the remainder of 2016. So that will clearly probably create a little bit of pressure in 2017. At this stage, we think it's a manageable number, below $25 million for the full year, but obviously we'll continue to monitor commodity prices as we always do throughout the remainder of 2016, but that's kind of where we are at this stage.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs of Baird. Your line is now open.", "Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, good morning, everybody, and I'll add my congratulations to Jim and John as well.", "I guess just quick, a two-part question on Security. First, in North America, that business has organically been declining for the past few quarters, and I noticed that the tone was a little bit more positive on orders and backlog. So, maybe if you can just talk a little bit about when we can see an inflection in growth in the North American part of Security. And then second, just given your improvement in Europe, could you talk about what the margin differential is now between North America and Europe?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Jim is going to take that. We've had the good fortune of spending a lot of time with both those businesses, Tim, just very recently, so we're really up to speed. And, Jim, why don't you take it?", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. The simple one is the second question which is about 400 basis points of difference at this point in time. And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I'd say the one thing that gives us the ability to be at what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America, so we actually haven't had that much of an issue generating the orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. And so that's really the answer, is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in electronic security in North America is because the field execution is improving, and the field capacity is, therefore, improving.", "Now, just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine, in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and mechanical security, so this is the third leg of the stool, if you will, and once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe, where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi, thanks, and congratulations, John and Jim. Wanted to also ask about Security, and it looked like there were some small bolt-on recurring revenue acquisitions in the quarter. So just wondering if you could give a little more color on that, and if we should interpret this as kind of a sign that you feel comfortable enough that this business is on solid footing that you'll embark on \u2013 or you'll re-embark on some inorganic growth initiatives within Security?", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "We actually do feel that the business is on solid enough footing in both North America and in Europe to digest a few small bolt-on acquisitions. And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on \u2013 RMR acquisitions, basically, is what they are \u2013 will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR, and that one of the keys to success in electronic security is to get the RMR portfolio, that's recurring monthly revenue for those that are unfamiliar with that term, but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies. And the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions \u2013 we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in the Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones.", "As far as major acquisitions in Security, no, there's nothing on the horizon in the medium-term \u2013 short- to medium-term, for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to \u2013 at the customer level in particular, to ensure that while all this consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible. And we think that we can continue to gain share \u2013 we're gaining share already in Europe and I think we can continue to gain share in Europe, and in the North American business I think we can begin to gain some share along the way with that as a strategy.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron of CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Good morning.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC", "John, Jim, congratulations and all the best in your new roles.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jeremie.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC", "Have a question on the Tools business. I think you made some pretty positive comments regarding the inventory situation in some of the large distributors and also point-of-sale data, so if you could come back to those comments and maybe provide a little more color here. And also, I'd like to hear how we should think about quantifying the impact of the FLEXVOLT launch going into the end of the year, and the next year. What kind of numbers and benchmarks are you looking at to measure the success of FLEXVOLT? Thanks.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Jeremie, it's John, I'll start and turn it over to Don. In terms of inventories, inventories are in great shape, both from our perspective and our customers'. I think it's important to note that our large customers have done a really, really good job mining data, working with us in a collaborative \u2013 with all their suppliers, but certainly us among their largest, in a collaborative manner, to get weeks at retail down to the 8 to 9 range, when historically 10 to 12 was as well as they could do without being out of stock.", "So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory \u2013 for us and our customers \u2013 retail inventories are at about their lowest levels that they've been in years, but despite that sell-off or decline in inventory, we've been able to grow nicely, and from the customers' perspective, in-stock is as good as it's been. Our fill rates are as good as they've ever been. So it's really the power of sharing the data on a collaborative basis, and sell-through remains good. So we see no issues in terms of inventory adjustment going forward.", "What I'll say on FLEXVOLT so far, and Don will quantify it to the extent he feels comfortable, so far so good. The customers have responded really, really well. We're capacitized to fill a tremendous amount of demand to the extent it exceeds our expectations. But I'm going to let Don quantify that to the extent that he's comfortable doing so.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, John. So...", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You get the hard ones.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I appreciate that. As we mentioned related to breakthrough innovation, just as a reminder to everybody, when we have major programs like this, our expectation is it will generate at least $100 million of revenue over a three year period, and clearly we think FLEXVOLT is going to exceed that, probably exceed it in a very significant way. As we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the product. We expect, as Jim said, for it to hit the stores in late September, early October, and as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016, as a percentage for the total company, about a half a point of growth when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and could become closer to 0.75%, so we'll see how that progresses, but that's kind of the range you should look at initially.", "As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-hundred million dollar program next year, likely around $200 million, but we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we'd be looking at is the sell-through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns, and we've clearly positioned ourselves through all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, gentlemen, to you both. My question was with respect to the European Tools & Storage growth. You talked about new products, you talked about expanded retail distribution. I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the sustainability of that growth and maybe how much runway is left with the retail distribution side of that or just deconstruct the drivers and talk about the sustainability.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, and anybody that had 14% organic growth in Europe and said it was sustainable would not be credible. So I mean, I think that's a very special performance. And we're on the heels of the two years of 7% comps which makes it even more challenging. But having said that, the European Tools team is literally on a rampage, a growth rampage, and the environment is the big unknown over there and the success of FLEXVOLT is also a big unknown. So it's difficult to say \u2013 peg a number. But I think the one thing that we can say for certain is that whatever the market is, we will continue to outperform it over there and continue to gain share for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie. Your line is now open.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi. John, I hope you enjoy your retirement, and, Jim, congratulations. My question is on the innovation in Tools. Is the 1% or so price gain that you've been reporting sustainable and part of your internal goals going forward? And is there any potential for bigger innovation in Hand Tools to move the needle on the 2% growth there that is well below the growth you're seeing in Power Tools? Thank you.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Starting with the innovation in Hand Tools, the innovation in Hand Tools is quite robust, actually, and it is really remarkable how much innovation there is in products that are relatively simple \u2013 seemingly relatively simple. The reason the organic growth in Hand Tools is a bit lower right now is not because of any lack of innovative growth because there is a fair amount of that, most notably the lasers in this past quarter. The pressure in the Hand Tools business derives largely from the weakness in the industrial channels, in particular, our Proto branded products are relatively \u2013 have negative offsetting the positive growth in the other area. And then the first part of the question? Why don't you just repeat the first part of the question?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Probably can't... (54:23)", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Can you remember what it was?", "Operator", "One moment.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "2%", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I think it was more around... (54:31)", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It was just Hand Tools, 2%. Could we ramp up organic growth on Hand Tools, which is 2%, which is below Power Tools. And I think you got it.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. I hope so, if not, Mike, obviously you can follow-up with Greg, because I know after your question you didn't have access to speak again.", "Operator", "All right. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.", "Dennis Patrick McGill - Zelman Partners LLC", "Hi, just a quick two-parter, I guess just on the transition. Jim, is your COO role going to be backfilled either immediately or over time? And then just looking for an update with respect to how you guys would phrase the Security strategy now. I think we're about a year past the initial review. It sounds like status quo, but just wanted to hear how you're thinking about it.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I'll answer the first part of the question and then I'll turn it over to Don who will give his regular answer to that question. The answer is, no backfill for the COO role right away. There may at some point in time as the succession plan for me is developed and so on, it may be filled, it may not be, that all remains to be seen at this point. And then, Don, on the Security portfolio strategy.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, absolutely. So, you're right, Dennis, we made an announcement a little more than a year ago about our evaluation of this portfolio. We, frankly, really began that evaluation in the early parts of this year, with last year more focused on continued improvement of the operational performance across the board and we're starting to see some of the fruit from that labor. And we had a good discussion at this board meeting and we will likely have another one in October, hopefully that will solidify our discussion and we'll be able to announce something post-October.", "But we've looked at obviously the three options we've discussed previously, which is keeping the entire business, potentially selling or spinning the entire business, or divesting a portion of it and we specifically had mentioned our mechanical lock business as a potential candidate for that. So we continue to evaluate those. I would say that, it's getting very close to the finish line, and I would imagine in the next 90 days to 120 days, we'll have something very clear to say on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.", "Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC", "Thank you. And it's interesting \u2013 firstly, congratulations to both John and congratulations to Jim. Keeping the Security questions going, which is kind of unusual for all these \u2013 after all these years, looking at the various components of what makes up the electronic security side of your business, and looking at some of the smaller parts of it, that have been added and you've been showing off at tradeshows such as healthcare, and Sonitrol and tracking, things like that. You're talking still about fairly slow growth, but consistent growth, on the electronics side. Is there going to be a point at which some of these higher-growing areas begin to start affecting the overall growth of electronic security, particularly in North America, or indeed in Europe if they begin to add to that, as you begin to try to start adding more value, and offering more value to your customers out there?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The answer is yes, but I'll let Jim give you a little more detail.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "This industry that we're talking about, electronic security, is in very rapid flux right now, as I think most people know. And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. And, in fact, our industry is extremely well positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including healthcare and retail in particular in the United States, and in Europe we're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those, generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the healthcare and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket.", "The growth from those activities in the higher end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability and, therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in healthcare, and now, in healthcare, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling, and being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments. In fact, healthcare is one area where we're doing it, retail is another one here in the States. Now, the fundamental growth model in traditional electronic security is always very challenging to grow it quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base, which means that \u2013 and also the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue, and it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see, over time, an improvement in a more consistent \u2013 in the growth rate and a more consistent growth rate coming out of electronic security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction. And that's what we're really attempting to do right now.", "Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC", "Is what you're doing in healthcare and in retail, is it portable to other verticals?", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I would say it's probably 60% to 70% portable. Lots of times there's platforms that and certain technologies like IoT, cloud, analytics that you have those capabilities within the organization, but then there's application-specific activities that have to be tailored to specific applications, whether it's in a hospital or whether we're working on electronic article surveillance in a retail establishment. So that part of it, I'll call it the other 40%, is not portable.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Jeff, said differently, and you know this as well as anyone, in any vertical about 50% of what we do is standardized across every vertical, but about 50% of what we do in a vertical is unique to that vertical, which is why we go to market that way. But to Jim's point, a whole lot of what we're doing is portable and we're looking forward to leveraging those opportunities.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Greg Waybright for any closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Great. Nicole, thank you very much. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning, for your participation on your call and your questions and your comments. And, clearly, please contact me if you have any further questions, and thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Gregory Waybright", "Thank you, Lorraine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, John and Don will review Stanley's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session.", "As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Normally, for -- those of you who follow us know, normally, I would kick this off and turn it over to Jim to deep-dive into some of the segments. And Jim's with us this morning, but he also -- he's recovering from a bad case of the flu and a modest case of laryngitis, so Don and I are going to share the formal part of the presentation. Jim is here and we're going to try to save his voice for Q&A and get him back on the field in full force by Monday.", "Don?", "Donald Allan", "Thanks, John. I'd like to start with the summary of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. The fourth quarter revenues increased 9%, which were driven by a 4% organic growth performance, and the majority of the difference between the 4% and the 9% was the addition of Infastech, as we continued to see a good performance in that business in the first year of acquisition.", "The fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.32 before M&A and other restructuring charges, so within our implied guidance range of $1.24 to $1.34, the higher end of the range. And then the GAAP EPS was $0.41, as we recorded several additional restructuring charges that we communicated in December related to some cost actions across all our businesses to improve our operating leverage.", "CDIY and Industrial posted very compelling top and bottom line growth performances, with CDIY achieving a solid robust organic growth of 6% at a 14.6% operating margin rate. Industrial posted over 16%, a 16.1% operating margin rate and an 8% organic growth story as they continued to see gains across all of their businesses. Our Security recovery is underway, and we delivered margins that were consistent with our expectations, which were relatively consistent with the third quarter at 12.2%.", "The full year results for 2013 were solid from a revenue performance, with revenues being up 8%, 3% organic growth, which was driven by, primarily, our CDIY and Industrial businesses, which saw 4% and 5% organic growth, respectively. Diluted EPS prior to M&A charges for the year were $4.98, again at the higher end of our guidance range, which was $4.90 to $5 that we provided back in October, and a GAAP EPS of $3.26.", "Another positive that we saw in the fourth quarter was a very strong free cash flow performance. Our free cash flow for the year before M&A payments was $854 million, and we achieved 8 working capital turns associated with that. That was slightly ahead of our expectation that we communicated in October of $800 million, and most of that out-performance was driven by a stronger working capital turn performance.", "We also will be reiterating our guidance for 2014 today, with a full year range of $5.30 to $5.50 before approximately $25 million of restructuring, which will be a dramatically lower level of restructuring in 2014 versus 2013. Free cash flow is expected to be $675 million, which is inclusive of about $250 million of onetime payments. I'll provide a little more detail on that later on in the presentation. So overall, a very solid top and bottom line performance in our CDIY and Industrial segments, and we feel our Security recovery is underway.", "So let's spend a few more minutes talking about our revenue performance, and then I'll hand it over to John to talk about the growth initiatives in the 3 segments.", "So looking at sources of growth. In the fourth quarter, I mentioned organic growth of 4%, which is a trend that's positive that's continued now for 3 quarters, where we saw the second quarter organic growth performance of 5%; third quarter, 4%; and then as I mentioned, fourth quarter, again, at 4%, for a full year equal to 3% performance. Acquisitions, primarily Infastech, contributing the 6% and then a modest negative of currency, primarily being driven in countries of Canada, Brazil and Argentina.", "To the right side of the page, looking at the regional revenue performance. You can see that we continue to see a positive trend in our United States revenue performance, up 4% organically in the fourth quarter, 3% for the full year. European performance was flat for the year, up slightly, up 1% in the fourth quarter. And there's various stories within the European performances as you'll hear about from John later on. But some very healthy performances in CDIY and our Industrial segments as we saw mid-single-digit organic growth in those particular segments in the fourth quarter.", "Emerging markets, as we expected, was a little slower in the fourth quarter, up 5% organically, with a solid 8% organic growth performance for the full year. Resulting in the total performance, as I mentioned, of 4% organic growth for the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. So we definitely feel like that our organic growth initiatives are getting traction, and we are focused on making sure that we turn our European Security business into a positive organic growth story as well.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to John.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Don. The organic growth initiatives that Don talked about were a real focal point for us in 2013. And this chart captures some of the key highlights of those initiatives, which are taking hold and in fact, driving approximately 2 percentage points or 200 basis points of growth in 2013.", "From a geographical perspective, our global emerging markets business is growing at 2.5x the rate of the combined market average. That's the market weighted by our 2013 revenues, which reflects our higher-than-normal Latin American concentration. We hired 300 new people. That included key country leaders and key sales positions, primarily feet on the street, but with the focus, again, on customers and driving growth. We dedicated SBUs and business teams versus the specific markets, and we launched approximately 300 new SKUs.", "Our Tier 2 distributor expansion is progressing. We added about 1,500 new distributors. And last but absolutely, certainly, not least, we're preparing for a mid-product -- mid-priced product launch, and that will be significantly accelerated through the completed acquisition of GQ that Jim talked to you about several quarters ago. It will really allow us to make an in-market specifically designed product for that fast-growing and highly important mid-price-point product in the emerging markets.", "Our M&A revenue synergies continued. The focus there was in CDIY, where we continued to leverage some Black & Decker synergies, as well as the synergies from the Powers acquisition. Together, they outperformed what we proposed as an original plan by almost twofold in 2013.", "And as Don suggested, our Security verticals are certainly gaining traction, with about $40 million of 2013 revenue attributable specifically to this activity. The order momentum is building. We've got about $100 million of annualized orders as a result of these initiatives, with the greatest success so far with our global customers in our health care and education verticals. And with these verticals, one of the drivers is to differentiate ourselves, and we're doing that versus competition with these unique offerings. And as a consequence, we're able to command, in most cases, a premium due to the meaningful value proposition. So the most important point to note is these initiatives are margin accretive as a consequence.", "Let's look now at some of the segments in a little bit more detail, starting with CDIY, where organic growth was up 6%, with all regions delivering solid growth, 6% for the quarter, 4% for the year. North America, up 5%; emerging markets, 8%; and Europe, 7%, consistent with total company. This represents about half our revenue, as you know.", "Organic growth is posted essentially everywhere, all SBUs reflecting market share gains, driven by both product innovation, introduction and great channel retail partnerships. And as Don mentioned for the total company, it's important to note in the CDIY trend, 4% for the year, CDIY was flat to marginally down in the first quarter, followed sequentially by second, third and fourth quarter organic growth of 6%, 5% and 6%, respectively, leading to 4.3% for the year. So it's on a very solid path, very, very strong trend, and exits the year and enters 2014 in a very, very good place.", "Looking at segment profit. It's up 7%, and margins up about 10 basis points, with the improvement reflecting both volume and productivity and those impacts offsetting some serious foreign exchange headwinds, as well as the expense of our growth initiative investments.", "And looking at organic growth in the fourth quarter by our various SBUs, a lot of positivity. Our Professional Power Tools business is up 5%, driven by new product introductions, as well as great performance in the emerging markets. The Consumer Products Group is up 6%. Great success in Europe with steam and hand vacs, good sell-through on North American holiday promotions and again, good performance in the emerging markets.", "Hand Tools and Storage up 8%. DeWalt Hand Tools being a strong driver. Emerging markets and very good quarter in the U.K., with -- where our business is doing well in an economy that seems to be turning the corner, which hopefully is a good positive indicator for the rest of Europe. And last but certainly not least, in fastening and accessories Bostitch's expansion and Powers revenues led to 8% organic growth in the quarter. So strong both top and bottom line growth in the face of currency headwinds and a good solid quarter for CDIY in the fourth quarter.", "Moving on to Industrial. Solid quarter, again, delivering 27% revenue growth, of which 8% came from volume. Pricing was flat. Acquisitions, primarily Infastech, contributed 20%. And currency was a 1% negative. The OM rate of 16.1% was strong as volume leverage was offset by the expense from the growth investments, as well as foreign exchange. Looking with inside -- within the segment, IAR had strong European growth. We had the EQUIP AUTO fair, a very important event in Europe. We had strength in MRO and vending , as well as Mac Tools. And those positives were partially offset by weak government sales, which are normally strong in the fourth quarter, particularly in October.", "Greg and Dennis have fielded a lot of questions on just what is the magnitude. And for clarity, it's about $6 million, we felt, of lost revenue, which is about 2% globally but 4% for our North American IAR business.", "And the EQUIP AUTO, to which I referred, is a very important event that takes place in France, but it's a European automotive and industrial tool event, contributed about 3% -- $3 million, excuse me, which is about 1% globally and 4% in Europe to our IAR business. So even without EQUIP AUTO, European IAR would have shown positive growth and again, another really good sign for the performance of that business in that market.", "Good strong quarter for Engineered Fastening. Automotive share gains leading to organic growth, again, for the third or fourth consecutive quarter, in excess of light vehicle production. Light vehicle production grew about 4%. We grew 5-plus organically. The Infastech integration is on schedule. It's tracking well versus expectations.", "And a great turnaround story in our infrastructure business. Oil & Gas up over 35% organically, driven by a combination of the North American onshore growth, as well as offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico and in Brazil.", "So a good solid quarter in Industrial. Margin rates are strong despite the investments and some foreign currency headwinds that we'll continue to deal with through 2014, and Don will talk a little bit more about that in the outlook.", "Moving on to Security. The improvement is underway. Margins were consistent with the third quarter. But I think, ultimately, it's helpful to separate North America and Europe because they're on very different improvement trajectories. Going across the top of the chart. Globally, revenues were down 2%, 3% organically. And segment profit is down 27% or 400 basis points. Looking sequentially, segment operating profit of 12.2% was flat versus the third quarter, making second half margin rate up 160 basis points versus the first half.", "But I think, importantly, let's look inside the 2 different businesses. On the left, our North American and emerging market businesses were flat in terms of growth, with a strong 17.4% operating margin. The emerging markets and automatic doors growth, which was strong, was offset by a comparison versus our fourth quarter '12 commercial lock distributor loading. Jim has discussed in a lot of detail, the change in our operating model. I'll touch on it a little bit more in a minute. But for perspective, for all of -- the fourth quarter was down in SMS about 5%, which meant they were plus 1% for the year. If you adjusted for that load-in, it would be about plus 14% for the fourth quarter and about plus 11% for the year. We got the benefit a year ago, call it pipeline, so it shows up in the comps this year. But we think it was an absolutely critical change to make and the business seems to be in the right place.", "The sequential operating margin rate improvement also continues in North America. Measurable improvements in field efficiency led to stronger install margins. Our backlog conversion was up 2 to 3 points. And as I mentioned earlier, the vertical solutions have been accretive to margin. We've shown a lot of price discipline. If we've lost any business, it's been due to price. But we feel that we're commanding a premium for our value proposition, and we're getting it. And it's demonstrated in a 265-basis-point increase to 16.1%, if you look at the entire second half of the year when those programs started to gain traction. And as I discussed a second ago, the commercial lock transition it is complete. The distributors have replaced the direct sales model, which was a significant change for us in the last 12 months, but we think a very important one relative to our long-term growth objectives.", "Turning to Europe. Volume down 8% organically -- or sales down 8% organically and 4.3% operating margin. Lower backlog conversion and RMR attrition continued to be the issues. That being said, we had a double-digit order rate improvement in the fourth quarter, and RMR attrition has slowed to the mid-teens. It's down about 200 basis points from the level of the first half of the year and continues, we think, on the right track, albeit at a pace slower than we'd like to see it. And as I'll say in a minute, our objective, long -- intermediate to long term, is RMR attrition at about a 10% rate. We've announced cost reductions to resize the business. We've applied a lot stronger centralized daily management model, which is perfectly applicable to Europe, some of the best practices from our U.S. business. Again, improve backlog conversion efficiency and managing RMR down to 10% from the mid-teens level where it is today.", "Importantly, not mentioned on the chart, our health care business is included in our external reporting for Security. We've not spent much time on it. It's a relatively small business but had a very solid fourth quarter in terms of its performance against -- advancement against its strategic objectives. Revenue performance, an 11.7% operating margins. So continuing its upward trend in a business that we think could -- we continue to think could have great prospects for growth, margin and shareholder value creation in the future.", "Let me turn it back to Don to talk about the fourth quarter cash flow, with which we were quite pleased. And then we'll get back to an outlook and open it up to Q&A.", "Donald Allan", "Thanks, John. So let's spend a little bit of time on the fourth quarter free cash flow, as well as the full year. You can see that our free cash flow did exceed our revised expectations. In October, we provided guidance of free cash flow for the full year of $800 million, as I mentioned earlier. Also, embedded in that expectation was that working capital turns would probably achieve about 7.7 to 7.8 turns for the full year. As you see, our turn performance is actually 8 working capital turns, which was a solid performance year-over-year, up about 0.5 turn versus 2012.", "So where we expected, in October, a slight negative from working capital for the full year, we actually saw a slight positive of $13 million. That drove the vast majority of the improvement, as many of our business teams were focused on enhancing the working capital performance through making permanent long-term changes to their business, in line with the Stanley Fulfillment System and staying focused on those objectives, along with achieving the right level of earnings and organic growth performance.", "Overall, when you look at the GAAP performance of free cash flow, was $500 million for 2013 versus $580 million for 2012, and we expect that number to be $675 million for 2014. To make it comparable, excluding the M&A payments in 2014, it will be $925 million versus the $854 million. So as we -- we would expect continued modest improvement in working capital and obviously, earnings accretion as well associated with our EPS projections. We believe that the free cash flow of this company continues to be an area that we can differentiate ourselves versus other companies. And as we move away from many of the large M&A and other restructuring charges over the next 2 years, we will begin to approach that $1 billion objective on a GAAP basis.", "So with that, I'd like to spend a few minutes reiterating the 2014 outlook. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the EPS to be $5.30 up to $5.50 of EPS on an -- before the M&A charges. On a GAAP basis, we expect it to be $5.18 to $5.38, so approximately $25 million of restructuring charges, down dramatically from the approximately $400 million we saw in 2013. I mentioned the free cash flow projections for next year, so I won't touch on that again.", "Some of the assumptions within the guidance have remained consistent with what I mentioned in December. So 4% organic growth is expected approximately for next year, which is relatively consistent with what we've seen over the last 3 quarters in our company. 150-basis-point improvement in Security margin, so all those things that John touched on that we're seeing come to life in the North American business and the expectation of what will occur in our European business as the year goes on will drive that improvement.", "We also discussed in December some surgical cost reductions we did across our other businesses, in CDIY, the Industrial segment and then some corporate actions that will drive about $0.20 of EPS improvement year-over-year. And then of course, in year 2 of our integration of Infastech, we expect some synergies and accretion in that business that will drive about $0.10 of EPS improvement.", "On the headwind side, as we mentioned in December, we have -- we do expect carryover pressure of foreign currency. And so where we saw about $60 million of negative currency effects in 2013 in the -- primarily in the back half of the year, we would expect a very similar number to occur in the first half of 2014, which would equate to about a $0.30 negative in EPS. Tax rate will be slightly higher versus our 19 -- roughly 19.5% tax rate we saw in 2013, we're somewhere between 21% and 22%. There's a few onetime items that occurred in '13 we don't expect to repeat. And then a little bit higher interest and a few other costs will drive a slight negative of $0.10 to $0.15 as well.", "One other item of note I want to just have people focus on is just the timing of the quarters for 2014. As usual, we do have a seasonality impact in the first quarter, but it is slightly lower than normal history based on 2 factors: one, the foreign exchange impact that I mentioned carrying over from the back half of 2013; and then two, we do have a slightly higher tax rate in the first quarter this year versus the first quarter last year, as we did record approximately a $10 million benefit, onetime benefit, in the first quarter of 2013. So as a result, we expect the first quarter to be roughly between $0.95 and $0.98 EPS.", "A little bit of segment outlook to the right side of the page. We expect mid-single-digit organic growth in both our CDIY and Industrial businesses for 2014, again, very consistent with what we've seen, especially in the last 2 or 3 quarters in these businesses. The Security business, from a revenue perspective, will be flat to maybe a modest increase as we expect North America and emerging markets to continue to demonstrate some solid organic growth, especially as we see the organic growth initiatives become even stronger in North America. And then the European business will probably be down slightly versus prior year as we expect to see a little bit pressure, especially in RMR attrition, in the first half of the year, as we begin to see that flatten out in the back half and achieve the 10% RMR attrition rate that we'd like to see in that business going forward.", "Operating margin. We expect increases year-over-year in the operating margin rate for both CDIY and Industrial, as we see the leverage effect of the organic volume. Of course, that's partially offset by the FX that I discussed. And we also see a benefit of some of the cost actions that we've taken that are surgical in nature. And then the operating margin rate for Security I touched on, with 150-basis-point improvement year-over-year. The last thing I would say is, as I mentioned earlier, the M&A charges go down dramatically in 2014, from a level of $400 million approximately in 2013 to $25 million in 2014, dramatically closing the difference between U.S. GAAP and EPS on adjusted basis, which is one of our primary objectives for 2014.", "I'd like to spend a little bit of time on the next page going through emerging markets and foreign exchange. As many of you are aware, we had significant impacts in 2013 and as I discussed, expect some more significant impacts in the first half of 2014 related to this. In the page we show the currency trend versus the U.S. dollar, for really the 4 major currencies that tend to have a significant impact on us. The first 3 have historically had a large impact on us since the merger: the European euro, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. The Argentinian peso has become more challenging over the last few years, as that country continues to see governmental challenges and economic issues.", "If you look at the euro, it's been relatively flat over the last 12 months, actually a slight improvement, about 3% versus the U.S. dollar. However, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real has seen 11% and 15%, respectively, devaluations versus the U.S. dollar, with a lot of that happening since June of 2013. The Argentinian peso, approximately 40% in that same time horizon.", "To give you some context in the size of the businesses in these countries so you have a sense of that. Our European business is just under $3 billion, about $2.9 billion in revenue. The Canadian business is approximately $0.5 billion in revenue. Our Brazilian business is $230 million in revenue, and our Argentinian business is $115 million in revenue. That gives you some context of the size of the businesses that you start to look at some of the magnitude of these changes.", "Now when we look at where does this impact our businesses, it impacts primarily our CDIY business. About 80% of these impacts go into CDIY, with the other 20% hitting our Industrial businesses, which is mostly Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening. It's driven by the global supply chain that we've created, where we do have a lot of business that is imported into, in particular, Latin America and Canada. So it's manufactured in other countries and imported into those regions, and as a result, it's U.S. dollar-based and can drive a significant currency impact when that -- when we have a shift in currency either way.", "What do we do from a mitigation perspective related to that? Obviously, there's many things that we do. In Latin America and Canada, we're always looking at potential for price increases with our customers as the currency moves. If we use Latin America as an example, over the last 2 years as we've seen the effects of shift, we've had numerous price increases in many of the countries over that time horizon to offset the impact. Obviously, the timing is a little different than the shift that you see related to currency, but overall, we try to do our best to pass on as much as we can to the end user and our customers.", "We're also focused on cost controls in those particular areas. We do look at localizing production where we have enough mass in certain countries. In the case of Brazil, we do have certain levels of production down there, and we continue to evaluate moving more production into that country, but we have to make sure we balance that against ensuring that we have the lowest cost possible when you factor in the currency as well.", "And then last but certainly not least, in some countries, we are focused on what hedging activities we can do against the currencies. In the case of Brazil and Argentina, it's very difficult to do that. It's either very cost ineffective or in the case of Argentina, it's almost impossible to do it due to certain regulation.", "The last thing I'd like to touch on is just the estimated financial impact of some of the movements of these currencies. So over the last few years, I've provided you some detail on this, and I just like to reiterate that. I already discussed what the dollar impact is for 2013 and 2014 of these movements. But if you look at the 4 different currencies, you can see here that a 1% movement of the Canadian dollar has about a $3 million to $4 million annual impact in our P&L; the euro is about $1.5 million to $2.5 million per 1% move; and then the Brazilian real is a $1.5 million to $2 million movement on an annual basis; and then you see the Argentinian peso as well, which is a much smaller number.", "This is really more for you to be aware and educated based on how these movements can impact us, both in the history but also on a go-forward basis. And our guidance is predicated really on where rates are today, and we'll continue to be focused on what actions we can take, as I mentioned, and the mitigating factors as we see shift beyond where these rates are today and how we can respond to them to ensure that we achieve our guidance for 2014.", "So with that, I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning. The company remains committed to driving both long-term and near-term shareholder value. We discussed that in great deal -- detail in our December call. The fourth quarter was the first step forward in really delivering on those operational commitments we laid out in that time horizon. CDIY and Industrial posted very strong revenue and growth, which we were pleased with. And we're also very pleased with our Security recovery. It really is underway, and we saw notable improvements in our North American business that John discussed. And all the actions are in place to drive the European business in a similar fashion over the next 12 to 18 months.", "For 2014, we're very focused on improving our near-term returns and enhancing our operating leverage. And as a result, our organic growth initiative is still a very significant part of our priorities. But we're really trying to leverage the investments that we've already made. We're not looking to make new investments in 2014 beyond those investments. The Security margin improvement, 150 basis points, is a key priority as well. We've taken surgical cost actions across our other businesses to ensure that operating leverage that I mentioned in the CDIY and Industrial segments.", "And then we'll never forget about the importance of staying focused on working capital and ensuring that we continue to show improvement year-over-year. We are, again, focused on making sure that our capital allocation is a bit rebalanced for the next 2 years as we will continue our acquisition moratorium, be focused on deleveraging our balance sheet and repurchasing our shares of up to $1 billion over the next few years. This really positions our company, we believe, to deliver on our long-term financial objectives.", "Gregory Waybright", "Great. Don, thanks. Lorraine, we can now open the call to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. On the Europe -- on the Security margin improvement, Don, can you give us a framework within the full year guidance of what you expect European margin to be? So it's 4% in the fourth quarter. At the low end of the range, how should -- what do you need to get to the low end of the range in Europe? And then what do you need to get to the high end? And then for '14, are you -- how much of a recovery in nonresidential construction in the U.S. are you assuming in what's embedded in the guidance?", "Donald Allan", "Yes. So Rich, it's -- European Security, as I mentioned, I think the first half will continue to see some challenges, although we expect some modest improvement in the operating margin rate in the first half of the year. But many of the cost actions, first of all, will not be implemented till June and July time frame given the process of the European Union and the work councils that we discussed back in December. However, we are very much focused on the revenue attrition side, RMR attrition, making sure we slow that down in a significant way. So we expect to see improvement in that in the first half, which will help the operating margins. So I would say we see a modest improvement in the first portion of the year, and then the back half of the year is where we see a more significant component of improvement in that particular business.", "John F. Lundgren", "Don, that might be just -- because Rich will get cut off. We're not going to forecast margins by business by quarter, Rich. You know that. But it's a very fair question given the focus we've put on it. To help you in your modeling and your thinking at least, for the year, we've said we're modeling and planning 150-basis-point increase in our Security business.", "Donald Allan", "In total.", "John F. Lundgren", "And the U.S. is operating -- it always can improve, but it's operating at or near historical margins. And Europe is 40% of the business, so -- of our Security business. So you are more than capable of doing the math. And as Don said, it will be more backloaded than front loaded because things take time in Europe. I hope that will help you without us getting into dicing and slicing the businesses that we have no intention of doing.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. And then on your second question, Rich, about non-resi and what we've kind of put in our outlook for 2014. We really haven't factored a dramatic improvement in the non-resi industry within our guidance. Most of our guidance is focused on general market performance today, as well as, in the case of Security in North America, it's very much focused on the vertical organic initiatives that John touched on. We're really trying to continue to enhance those, push those forward and make more progress than we saw in 2013. The progress we saw in '13 was very encouraging, but our expectation is that it's going to continue to really leverage the organic growth story within the North American business.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Baird.", "Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. I was wondering about your North American margin performance this quarter. Do you consider that to be sort of a long-term run rate? Or do you see a further improvement in that level ahead? And if so, what will be the driver for further development even from this level?", "John F. Lundgren", "Don will take it. North America consists of 3 different businesses, so we're going to -- we'll have to take it piece by piece.", "Donald Allan", "You're talking about North American Security, specifically? I would...", "Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Security margins, yes.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, so that helps clarify. So I think, as John mentioned, we are closing -- approaching kind of historical levels for that. So although we do expect it to get better slightly beyond what we saw in the fourth quarter in 2014, we did take some cost actions, as I mentioned, in this business that will help that performance. We are going to continue to move forward on the vertical organic growth initiatives, which are margin -- gross margin accretive to that business and enhance the margin performance. So all those things that we're doing, and of course, the SMS transition, as we continue to work through that and leverage up that business, as the volume improves, would also improve margins. So we would expect it to improve. But you also have to recognize that it's at a high level, but it's probably at the low end of the range of historical level.", "John F. Lundgren", "Let me just supplement that to remind you. Don -- when Don talked about first quarter guidance in fourth quarter, remember, first quarter, for our company, has some seasonality. In CDIY, as everyone knows, January is a very soft month because that's when our large retail customers end their fiscal year and have a close eye on -- for very good reason, have a close eye on their inventory. So in CDIY, it's about a 2.5 month quarter as opposed to a 3-month quarter. But more importantly, Security, historically, and this continues in North America, is a business with some seasonality. And historically -- if you look, our second and third quarters, from a margin perspective, historically, all things being equal, are better than first and fourth. There's 2 reasons for that. Most of it's in the mechanical area. But in the fourth and first quarters, particularly our Stanley Access Technologies business; to a lesser extent, our mechanical locking business, we get into weather issues on install. We're scheduled to do a job, there's a snowstorm, the foundation is in port, we can't put in the door or we can't upgrade the door. Those are real issues that can have some headwind in the fourth and first quarter. Secondly, our education vertical, for obvious reasons, performs much stronger in the second and third quarter. We do a lot more work in the education vertical in the months of -- a little bit of June but particularly, July and August, when there are fewer students on campus and we're allowed to do that work. So as you're looking at quarters and years, keep that -- and doing your modeling, and we're happy to talk about because it's -- we've got a lot of history, just do keep those 2 things in mind.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So on Security, I'm just curious what kind of visibility you have to kind of flat or better Security sales next year, given the headwinds that you've faced. And then if you can also put this double-digit order growth in European Security kind of into context for us. With mid-teens attrition, is kind of mid-double-digit order growth what you need to keep the business flat? Or is there some different way that we should be thinking about that?", "John F. Lundgren", "Jim wants everybody to know he's alive and well. And we hope you can hear him, Jason. I picked him up.", "James M. Loree", "So this is my 58th consecutive quarterly conference call and I didn't want to miss it. So bear with me, and I apologize for the voice. But taking them separately, North America and Europe, the total will be flat to slightly up. Europe will be slightly down for the year. With 10% attrition, we need 5% order growth to be flat, basically, because the RMR part of the portfolio is about 50% of the portfolio. So we expect to go from where we are today, which is mid-teens attrition, down to about 10% attrition by the middle of the year. So we will have about 12% attrition for the year, which means we would need an order rate in excess of 6% to be positive. We won't -- we're not expecting to be positive in Europe on an organic basis in 2014, but we do expect that attrition to come down. And over time, we'll convert that order backlog that we have into sales, and we're working very diligently on making sure that we have all the routines in place to make sure that we do that effectively. We have a good momentum going in the verticals, as has been mentioned previously, in North America, so that gives us a lot of confidence that we will have positive organic growth in North America. We see a positive trend in Access Technologies, a positive trend in CSS. The big question mark is SMS. We have positive unit volumes for the first time in many, many years in mechanical. We think we're going to have a favorable market ahead of us. We've got a lot of work being done in specifying, on construction jobs. And so all signs are positive, but they're still a work in progress in the mechanical business in North America.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. I'll ask them quickly so -- in case I get cut off. The first one, last year, you mentioned, John, that the first quarter represents about 18% to 19%, historically, of annual earnings. And your guidance here of $0.95 to $0.98 versus your annual guidance is still in that 18% to 19% range. But I would think it would be lower than that this year because of the Security gains as the -- I mean margin as the year progresses, some of the restructuring savings as it progresses. So why wouldn't the first quarter this year be lower as a percentage of the overall expected earnings? That will question 1. And the second question would be, based on the FX challenges in the emerging markets, are you contemplating paring back some of your discretionary spending in 2014 based on the macro and current currency headwinds there?", "Donald Allan", "Sam, it's Don. So I'll take those questions. The first one, the 18% to 19% was actually a 10-year historical kind of range that we experienced. That was more before the merger. So when you look at the post-merger company, and we saw it again in 2013, the first quarter represents more of a 20% to 21% of the full year. And so that's really, in my view, the new starting base of this company when you look at first quarter to total year. And that's why I think the 18% actually is down slightly from that range because of the items I mentioned of FX and tax that are driving that.", "John F. Lundgren", "And the items that Sam mentioned.", "Donald Allan", "And the items you mentioned as well. And then, as far as your other question around discretionary costs, yes, we are very much focused as a company on dramatically controlling our discretionary costs. We obviously took a very significant restructuring program across the company in the fourth quarter and have executed many of those actions. We still have many that we have to do, especially in Europe. But just as importantly, the costs -- or the non-people costs, we are very much focused on reducing travel where we have certain consulting activities. We've cut way back on those levels of activities. The other costs related to -- any one that's connected to a person, the phone calls, et cetera, we are very much focused on how we can reduce that. Some of it's contractual in nature, so we negotiate with our vendors, and others it's just more of a policy change or a volume level of activity. That's something that will be 1 of our top 5 priorities for the year until we see more stabilization, especially in emerging markets.", "John F. Lundgren", "And Sam, I'll just add because you won't get a follow-up. SG&A is something we talk about in great detail at the highest level of this company, even with our -- and with our board, and all SG&A or discretionary costs, if you want to use that term, as we've said many times, it isn't bad. Our investment in brand, our investment in people, in feet on the street, our investment in product development, building SBUs is the last place where we're going to pare back. What we may do is slow the pace of acceleration. I mean, there was a huge incremental lift in that in 2013. But we truly do, as I think most companies do, in good conscience, divide all discretionary costs into 2 buckets. Those that are creating revenue through generating new products, creating revenue and building brand franchises versus those that are just required to run our business. And it's the latter that's under closer scrutiny than ever and looking at significant cuts. The former will not increase at the rate they increased in 2013 nor were they ever planned to. They'll be closer to flat in 2014.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "On the update call you hosted last month, you talked about 12% attrition. My understanding, that may have been for November. But it seems, like, for the quarter, it was back up in mid-teens in your presentation. Can you just talk about how that is versus your expectations? And to the extent the attrition is driven by any kind of irrational price competition, would you be chasing that business? Or would you just cede that share?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Mike, I'll give you a top line. This is John. And then you can follow-up with Greg because he can give you as much detail as you want that we feel we're willing to publicly disclose. What you said is correct. We were improving at a faster rate quite frankly than we expected in November, and it digressed or reverted in December. So the quarter ended up being flat sequentially in terms of attrition. That being said, I don't manage this business nor does Massimo Grassi, who runs it, day-to-day or even quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we look at the trends. Second half versus first half, we were down 200 basis points. If we repeat that again in the first half, it will be -- we'll be down 200 or 300 basis points. And as Jim said, our target by the end of the year is 10%. We're tracking to get there or slightly shorter, but that remains our objective. But your statement is absolutely correct. December was poor relative to October, November, and we've not reduced the focus on it one bit.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. The only thing I would add to that is that as we -- we really highlighted that in December as an encouraging sign. But in October, when we provided guidance, our expectation was the attrition was going to be flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, which is really what we saw. So we really highlighted that in December, more that we were seeing potential for encouragement there. And we still see that, but this business will see those types of fluctuations month-to-month.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Dahl from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Dahl - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about Security also but on the North American side. Could you talk about what trends you're seeing on the RMR in North America, what type of conversion you're getting from some of the stronger install and also maybe talk about which verticals you're seeing the most momentum in?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. I'll talk about which verticals we're seeing the most momentum in, which I already did in the presentation, with our global customers, with health care and in education. We're not going to talk about the beginning of your question. It's nothing we do in the public domain, and we think it would provide more, I'll say, competitive damage than it would be helpful information to our investor base.", "James M. Loree", "The only thing I would...", "John F. Lundgren", "Jim may want to add something.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. The only thing -- the way I would answer that question is that our RMR base, without any acquisitions, grew in 2013. So it is moving in the right direction. We're not going to talk about specific RMR attachment rates.", "John F. Lundgren", "And the verticals, did you want to mention...", "James M. Loree", "I did. I do.", "John F. Lundgren", "Okay. All right.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "With 1Q guidance coming in below consensus, I just want you to be as clear as possible. So at the $60 million FX, is that going to be split kind of equally 1 and 2Q since it's front loaded, a? And b, is your 1Q tax rate higher than your 21% to 22% guidance for the year? First question.", "Donald Allan", "Well, the $60 million of FX is pretty much divided in half, Q1, Q2. So it's not perfect that way, but that's a good way to think about it. And the tax rate for Q1 this year will be relatively in line with our expectation for the full year. So -- but remember that in the first quarter of last year, the tax rate was around 16%.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Correct. And then I guess if you could give us the lessons learned on -- as well as educate us on emerging market. How the -- since the distrib -- you're accessing more selling points there. Part of the decelerated expectation in growth I think was related to, probably, lower demand, a, but it was also some excess load-in that you guys might have perceived as demand. So how do you guys manage those channels of distribution given that they're less technical? You have less weekly runs of data in terms of sell-through and sell-in. So what did you learn in '13? And how is that -- those -- how are those channels different than the big box we're used to domestically?", "James M. Loree", "If you're talking about load-in issues, we did mention, last quarter, that there was some issues, in particular, in China, with respect to the distribution channels becoming congested as we grew our T2 distribution channel in China. What we're really finding in China, as we sit here today, is there is a deceleration going on in the market, and there is a credit crunch going on. And we're starting to really see a very tight credit situation with the channel. So it's not as much that -- it's not as much of a load-in issue as it's inability of the distributors to finance purchases to meet what could be growing end-user demand. But with the issue in the channel, it's almost impossible for the distributors to buy the product that they need. And it's a really interesting phenomenon going on in China right now. And if you've been following the news over the last couple of days, there's been some indication from the Central Bank in China that they are beginning to realize that there's a credit crunch with the small to mid-sized businesses, and we're seeing that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Hoping you can go back and just talk a little more about the attrition rates and some of the market dynamics around those attrition rates. And specifically, I guess, is this a dissatisfaction with historical Niscayah execution or is the reaction to increased effort by your competitors?", "John F. Lundgren", "It's some of each, David. As we've discussed on previous calls, we've had a lot more price discipline. The Niscayah European model, and Jim has gone into great detail on this in previous calls and Greg can -- Greg, I know, will be happy to provide or reinforce that offline. In the interest of time, I'll try to do it quickly. We're trying to turn this organization from farmers to hunters. Historically, Niscayah relied on referrals from its parent company, Securitas, and those have gone away. They -- it was much more of an install model with less attachment than the model that Stanley Convergent Security Solutions, both in U.S. and Europe, have operated. So there was essentially a model change or the way business was done change as a result of our acquisition of Niscayah. And quite frankly, we -- or they, the Niscayah folks, relied more on those referrals than we realized, thus attrition was higher. Second has been pricing discipline on our part. If, in fact, we're going to do an installation, we've gotten much better at costing. We want to be sure those are at least -- at worst, breakeven if it has some RMR attached to it; otherwise, that it's at a reasonable margin. That also has contributed to the growing attrition. And thirdly is we've changed a lot of people. The folks that were relying on the referrals, and it's not even meant to be derogatory, but were much more farmers than hunters, weren't going to make it in the system and business that we're trying to operate. And we believe we have very capable leaders. But in our -- 3 of our -- or 4 of our largest markets, we have new general managers in those markets in place within the last 6 months. They've come either from the industry or related industries, from blue-chip companies, all of whom Jim, Don, myself have met and Brett and Massimo have interviewed intensively. So we think we've got a new team on the field that's going to help as well. So you got a lot of factors contributing to it. You touched on a couple. And hopefully, I added a little more light. But please follow up with Greg and Dennis, and they'll ...", "James M. Loree", "And I would just add. There's one other competitive dynamic which is relevant here, which is that the -- electronics are gradually, and maybe now at an accelerating rate, replacing guards in commercial buildings and establishments. And this places tremendous pressure on the guarding companies, and that's one reason I suspect that Securitas probably tried to acquire Niscayah because of its electronic capabilities. So without an electronic company -- you have several major European security companies, which are guard-focused and fairly large. Their typical operating margin appetite is about a 4% to 6% operating margin, and that's quite satisfactory to them. So that competition for what I'll call the commodity-type services is pretty intense right now in Europe and probably more intense than it has been in years. So for us, the answer is moving to the vertical solutions that we're implementing in North America. But in order to do that, first, we have to get the sales force in place, which we've done, and we're working on maturing that sales force now. We're working on getting the attrition down to stabilize the revenue base, mature the organization enough so it can handle the vertical market solutions, and that's about 6 to 12 months out. Once we start getting the vertical market solutions from North America imported into Europe, that competitive pressure that we're feeling will be muted to some extent, and the higher-margin business that we'll bring in will really help turn the Niscayah situation around.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess a couple of questions here. I just don't want to get cut off. Looking at, for a change of pace here, construction and industrial. If I calculated right, kind of stripping out the negative impact of FX, if you're saying that roughly 80% of the $60 million headwind was in CDIY, it looks like 2013 CDIY was about 15.7% margin, and it translates to a 33% incremental margin. Are those numbers right? And as you think about that business going forward, do you look at, like, a 30%, 35% incremental as a sustainable basis given that, that business, I would say, best case is kind of a mid-teens to high-teens type margin business? Or how to think about that longer term?", "Donald Allan", "Well, I think if you -- the way that you did the math around the currency to get to kind of what's the operating margin rate without the currency is reasonably accurate, so I would agree with that. But you also have to remember that you're not seeing as much leverage in '13 because we've made some growth investments, too, in SG&A, especially in emerging markets within CDIY. So I do think when the business stabilizes and we're not making those types of investments, which will be in the latter half of '14, assuming no other changes in currency, that the leverage drop-through rate is more of a 35% to 38% number in that business versus what you're seeing now because of the -- both the FX and the growth investments.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays.", "Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a sort of follow-up on that one. If you could explain what you think the incremental margins are in the other businesses given the changes that have occurred. And I guess, more broadly, also, if you could talk about -- in CDIY and Industrial, you had some pretty good organic growth generally. And I was curious how much of that you think is attributable to the initiatives that you've been doing in those businesses, implementing versus, let's say, the overall market improvement.", "Donald Allan", "So as far as incremental margins, I mentioned CDIY already. Industrial has very similar, depending on the business. So there's 4 different businesses in there. It can range anywhere from 30% to 35% incremental margins. Security is a different animal because it depends on the region, the type of business. And it can have a different level of leverage or operating leverage depending on which piece of it, and it can range anywhere from a 20% number to a 35% number. So that's difficult to really say, to have a perfect one for that. I think the more important thing about Security right now is it's continuing its recovery, getting it to the levels of profitability that we want to see, at the same time, seeing the right levels of organic growth that are consistent with our long-term financial objectives. And then, at that point, when that is stabilized, we can start to talk about what's the right level of leverage we're going to see in that business going forward.", "John F. Lundgren", "You want to take the second part, Don? How much of it was our initiatives? We've said 200 basis points. But if you want to provide some more color, if you want to provide more color on...", "Donald Allan", "Security specifically?", "Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "No, for the...", "John F. Lundgren", "Whole portfolio. I think Steve was asking about the whole portfolio. He won't get back on. But Steve, what we've said is roughly 200 basis points of our top line growth, we felt, was attributable to the growth initiatives. To the extent we can maintain that growth rate at lower initiatives, obviously, that will have a positive impact on incremental margin, if I got the gist of your question.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "John, you had another pretty decent contribution on the IAR side from Mac Tools. Is that market share gains or just firming end markets? And in Europe, you had promotional activity driving positive growth on the IAR side. Is that sustainable as the promotional activities ease off?", "John F. Lundgren", "Well, the promotional growth was more CDIY than IAR, Liam. But it is -- no worries, it is sustainable. We had terrific performance in IAR in Europe and CDIY in Europe. But I may have misspoken or you misunderstood that there was much promotion in -- I shouldn't say that. It's a busy promotional quarter for CDIY in Europe in the fourth quarter because of the strength of the Black & Decker consumer products franchise in Europe in general and the U.K. in particular. That being said, I did talk about EQUIP AUTO, which normally happens -- often happens in September. This year, it just happened to happen in October. From a U.S. perspective, think Mac Tools Fair. It's a huge pan-European exhibition that does contribute positively to revenue, and it was very well received. So I might have sent you mixed signal there. In terms of Mac, it's going from -- you've followed us a long time, and Jim has been reporting on this longer, I'm just going to help him save his voice. It's gone from bad to good, and it's going from good to better. And it's a combination of several things. We really, really worked hard on net distributor adds. We've worked really hard on having the right distributors and their productivity, mentoring, training, retaining. But it's also what they have on their truck. We've also -- we have an improved financing program for them, which is far more competitive than what we've sent them to battle with in the past, and our Treasury Department deserves a lot of credit for that. So those are the -- in the back, that's kind of the underlying points. But in fact, what they've got in the truck's are a lot better than what they've had before. It was overwhelmingly 100% sourced business with no proprietary technology. Now a significant percentage of what they're selling are produced in our facilities ever since we combined Mac, Proto and Vidmar under one leadership team, made it part of North American IAR. Those cross-SBU synergies are really, really, really gaining traction. We also have the capability, since the merger, to have DeWalt tools on a Mac tool truck. That's a big draw. So we've got a lot of things in terms of basic blocking and tackling that we've improved with Mac. But I think, most importantly, we've got a dramatically better line of products on the truck in terms of both what we're offering, innovation, margin for the distributor, and it's all working to make this -- it's always been a good franchise. Now it's a good business, and it's going to do nothing but become a better business under the leadership of the current management team.", "James M. Loree", "And in the fourth quarter, they celebrated their 16th consecutive quarter of organic growth, which for those of you that have been following the company a long time would find that almost miraculous.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Could you comment on the price, cost dynamics in your tools business, particularly CDIY, where you think you've been gaining share?", "John F. Lundgren", "So the question was price, cost dynamic, sure.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. I would say that, I've said it before about our CDIY business, it's a situation that is a fine balance of going after volume and controlling your pricing decisions in this business. I think there's many pieces of it that have significant levels of competition, especially on the power tools side, that you have to be smart about when you do promotional activities, how you do promotional activities. And also, ultimately, a driver of many of those decisions is all the new product introductions that we've put into the marketplace. And ultimately, those things drive the market share gains that we've experienced, especially the last couple of years. We made great progress, especially with our cordless power tool products over that time horizon. And as a result, we've been able to really continue to combat some of the price pressures you see in that particular space. But we all know that's a challenging aspect of this business. But as long as you have that DNA around new product introductions and driving technology and innovation into that marketplace that the user wants versus giving them something that they don't want, you ultimately can really continue to combat that. And I think you saw that in the performance, where there's a modest price negative in the business in 2013. We're never satisfied with that. As we go into 2014, we want to continue to focus on how we minimize that impact and maybe eventually, turn that into a price positive. But ultimately, that's the dynamic of the business today. And then we're not satisfied with it, but we think we have all the right, as I mentioned, DNA in the business that allows us to be very competitive, continue to have a premium to many of our competitors as well.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. And Jeremie, let me just add on to that. We've said this before on calls. It's our largest business. It's -- we think it's well managed, and it has the benefit of being a market leader, #1 and #2 in virtually every category where it competes, so it's not only our right, it's our obligation to behave like price leaders. That being said, there's tremendous competition in the market, particularly in power tools, which is relatively new to the Stanley management team post Black & Decker merger. Having said all that, operating margins were up 10 basis points, all in. And the reason we've been able to do that and maintain it is real prices -- in this category, real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years. We haven't mentioned productivity, operational excellence, whatever you'd like to call it on this call, but we work very hard at it. And our global operations team and our CDIY ops team, every year has an absolute table stakes commitment of 3% cost reduction. They usually have a funnel that adds to more than that. But if real prices go down 1% to 2% and margins are 35% and you get a 3% cost reduction, that leads to margin maintenance, and that's how we manage this business, so quarter-to-quarter, we'll have a little more promotional activity that might drive a little more volume at a little lower margin. And that will be a little bit of give and take. But over time, that's how we think about this business. We want to keep it right in that mid-teens level and continue to gain share. And so far, I think the CDIY team in every function has done a commendable job of doing that, and it is a model for the rest of our company in terms of a level we're trying to get to.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Don, I was hoping you could just walk through a little bit on the math of how you think about the cash flows over the next couple of years. I think what you guided to is sort of roughly $1 billion of share repos and then $700 million of debt reduction, and that would seem to pretty much match the free cash flow that you'll generate. But then you have dividends of $600 million or $700 million and then you've got some limitation on the international cash and how you use that. So I just wondered if you can maybe bridge all of that.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. Well, the -- we went into the year with a debt level of about $300 million that we can actually pay down in commercial paper. And so that's about as much deleveraging as we can do going forward over the next couple of years. So that's kind of the number for debt deleveraging. And then there's, obviously, the dividend numbers you mentioned and then share repurchase as well, and that pretty much uses up the vast majority of our cash well over the next 2 years.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Is that inclusive of calling back international cash?", "Donald Allan", "There'll be a little bit of that as well, absolutely.", "Operator", "And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Waybright for closing remarks.", "Gregory Waybright", "Lorraine, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation. And please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

After the speakers' remarks there will bea question-and-answer session.", "(Operator Instructions)", "Mr. Gould you may begin your conference.", "Gerry Gould", "Okay. Thank you Valerie, and good morning everybody. On thecall with me this morning are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO and JimLoree, our Executive VP and CFO. We've issued three press releases in the lastfew days; our fourth quarter dividend last Friday; the announcement of a newdirector on Monday; and this morning our third quarter results and our fourthquarter and full-year guidance. They are all on our website on www.stanleyworks.comin the Investor Relations segment.", "There is a presentation also, on our website and some PowerPointand PDF versions of charts that we\u2019ll refer to during the call. They went up byabout 60 minutes ago, so please refer to those.", "John and Jim will review the quarter\u2019s results and thenwe\u2019ll have a question-and-answer period following that. The call should last aboutan hour.", "Beginning at 1.00 pm this afternoon, we\u2019ll have replayavailable through next Wednesday, the end of Wednesday the 31st. Thereplay number is 800-642-1687, and this quarter the code that you need for thereplay is 201-99629. After that comes down next Wednesday, both the replay andthe presentation will remain on our website.", "Any questions, call me at 860-827-3833. And we just have twobrief announcements, and we are ready to start. First, in accordance with Reg G,we issued our earnings guidance at the beginning of the quarter as we did today,and we cannot comment on it thereafter. If it were to change materially, wewould issue a press release and conduct a conference call.", "And finally, certain statements contained in this discussionby the various Stanleyparticipants are forward-looking statements, as such, they involve risks. Actualresults may differ materially from those expected or implied, so we direct youto the cautionary statements in form 8-K, which we filed with today's pressrelease this morning.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to JohnLundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thank you Gerry,and I will provide an overview and then ask Jim Loree to look a little deeperinto some of the individual segment performances, as well as our fourth quarterguidance, which I will remind everybody, will be the last quarterly guidancethat we will issue. This is consistentwith our first quarter call 2007 we are beginning in January of '08. We willprovide an annual guidance and update that in the event of a material change.", "This quarter, in a large way validates the portfoliodiversification strategy that we initiated almost four year ago, and obviously wecontinue to pursue it today. Looking at the quarter, in summary, our CDIYbusiness and segment performed fairly well in a challenging domestic market,and the consequence of less dependence on some large US retailers didn't haveas large and adverse an impact that it might have, had our portfolio looked theway it looked four or five years ago.", "Strong CDIY performance in Europe, as well as our industrialtool group and our security segment, across the board, contributed to the goodresults in the quarter, which does enable us to re-affirm our full-year 2007sales EPS and free cash flow guidance that Jim can take you through in a lotmore detail.", "Quickly on the numbers, because you have them, it was arecord sales quarter for the Stanley Works, exceeding $1.1 billion. Pretaxincome was up 11%. Operating margins surpassed 15% and free cash-flow of $119million, was a 130% of net income.", "Strong performance in our industrial tool sector, across theboard, hydraulics Proto, Vidmar, Facom, all with very strong high-single orlow-double digit growth. Our mechanical security business had anextraordinarily strong quarter. Bostitch continues to recover, despite about50% of [DIY] markets being quite weak. Obviously the North American residentialsector is about 50% of what Bostitch does, it is industrial and is lessimpacted by market conditions. But that profit improvement program that we havediscussed in many occasions, remains on track.", "The HSM merger also is on track, and the legacy system integrationbusiness at Stanleyis still not performing at our expectations, but is clearly benefiting from thereverse integration into the HSM business model, which was one of primestrategic drivers behind that important acquisition.", "We grew across the board. All three regions of the worldshowed growth. And the combination of price and productivity more than offsetthe high inflation that we experienced during the quarter and this is the fifthconsecutive quarter, where that's taking place, which has an obvious positiveimpact on our margin achievement.", "Numbers in general, you see the $9, it was flat in line withour guidance of approximately $10. Operating margin, as I mentioned was up 100basis points, at 15.4% versus 14.4% a year ago. 700 basis points of increasedtax versus third quarter '06, which accounted for about $0.10 a share. The27.2% tax rate was only slightly or marginally above the midpoint of the rangewe provided in our guidance, but nonetheless 700 basis points up higher than ayear ago.", "Share count was not too different. It crept up 1.1 millionshares, as the performance of the stock over time has put more options in themoney, and the anticipated exercise of those options. So, EPS growth was constrainedby $0.10 in taxes, but all in all from an operating margin perspective, was agood quarter.", "Pre-tax income on operating margin both expanded. Pre-taxincome up 11%, operating margin up 20%, with a 15.4% operating margin, sodouble-digit growth in both of those key metrics were achieved.", "Looking at revenues in the next chart, and some of thevarious components, there was a 12% total increase in revenue, the biggestsingle contributor. About half of that was the HSM acquisition, but at $1.131 billion,these were record revenues for Stanley.", "Looking at the sources of growth, as most of you know, we donot include currency in our organic growth figures.  It did add 2% to the total topline, butgrowth across the board volumes contributing to 2% positive price, which is agood thing. 1% for 3% organic then 2% currency, so this is the split up betweenour core activities or activities that have been with Stanley for more than 12months,  and acquisitions was about equalleading to 12% growth in total.", "Looking at the segments, I won\u2019t detract from what Jim isgoing to talk to you about in just a minute.", "But again, growth across the board:  Construction & DIY being flat organically,was 3% in total with that the positive impact of currency outside the U.S.Industrial segments were strong by all measures. Again, the difference betweenorganic, very strong at 8% and total, a large Facom business in Europe is benefiting from positive exchange rates.", "And security was way up, the combination of strong mechanical,great performance at HSM, slightly offset by a modest decline in the legacysystems integration business. So, record revenues were achieved for Stanley in the quarter despite the challenging NorthAmerican or U.S.retail market.", "Most of the numbers in the financial highlights, we'vediscussed either in the press release or I've touched on, but just veryquickly, in total, acquisitions added almost 70 million, clear theme whereextraordinary strength outside the U.S., market driven weakness in the U.S.,strong industrial across the board, and I've already touched on security.Margins grew nicely, again, up a 100 basis points, price productivity and ahigher margin HSM business included in the mix, all contributed to thatimprovement.", "Pre-tax income, as previously said, double-digit growth,good margins in security, higher tax rate and positive cash flow, and Jim isgoing to give you some more granularity on that in just a minute.", "So it's an important chart, it\u2019s something that we look aton a regular basis in terms of the differentiation among, at least Stanley insome of its peers, and again, we go -- we look at this pretty regularly toensure that we are on the right task. But, it re-affirms again that the weakAmerican, certainly residential constructions markets, not necessarilyindustrial, continue to impact about 25% of our revenues, and specifically atthe top of the chart.", "The Construction & DIY segment in the Americas, ourTools and Storage business is down 11%, Stanley, Bostitch down 4%, the weightedaverage of those two are combined to about 25% of our sales, down about 9%, andthe other 75% of the portfolio up 7% organically with good performance,industrial across the board, security across the board and CDIY outside NorthAmerica.", "So, despite two large businesses in North America, we arehaving some very serious market headwinds that we won't dwell on, that we\u2019rereading about everyday, and we anticipate, you know, will be no different orare not much different until midway through the second quarter of next year.", "Nonetheless, organic sales grew 7% in the remainder of theportfolio, contributing this in positive growth overall.", "Let me turn over to Jim who is going to take you throughsome of the segment detail and the outlook for '07.", "Jim Loore", "Thanks John. As we\u2019ve said in the release, it really was astory of industrial insecurity. Really strong performances, but we had to holdon our own in CDIY segment to put it all together, and that's exactly what theydid. With revenues up 3% to $457 million, that included 3 points of currencybenefit, and we did that with a minus 8% organic growth in the Americas, whichwas very, very difficult market conditions, as John mentioned, and I think avery good performance and certainly some share gain going on there to achievethat in the US with a strong new product introductions that we have and thestrong execution.", "But the real story in CDIY, this quarter, was international,with double digit growth in Europe, Australia,Latin America, Asia, virtually everywhere, weare in markets around the world. We had strong growth and good growth in Canada,and it wasn't all currency, there was definitely some new product introductiongains in those major markets that we participated.", "That revenue performance allowed us to basically hold ourown with a modest decrease in segment profit down 5%, and a slight decline inthe segment profit rate, down to what I would consider a more normalized levelof about 16.8%. So all in all, an excellent performance for this segment in avery difficult market.", "Hand tools and storage was up 7%, and again the story wasthe strength internationally, and particular Europe, offsetting the weak Americas.The European folks in our Construction and DIY hand tools and storage business,were up 25% and that truly was an extraordinary performance driven by newproduct introductions and increased brand support. The margin decrease was alsoaffected by, and the overall segment was affected by some mixed stores,mechanic tools, and storage that we mentioned.", "Point of sale performance in the U.S. was down 5%, so sell-throughof the product down 5%. So actually inventories came down a little bit for thecustomers in the quarter and we note that in FatMax. And FatMax Xtreme point ofsell-through was up 7% at the North American retailers. That is a sample oflargest customers, the seven largest customers that we do business with, herein the Americas.", "The rest of the world, as I mentioned, the sales werestrong, up 23% and Bostitch sales were down slightly, nominally down 1% andagain the story was international with Europe up 12% and the U.S. was downabout 4% in Bostitch.", "And the profit and improvement initiatives in that businessremain on track. We said a couple of quarters ago, that we expected somesequential improvement, about a point a quarter, and they are holding to thatimprovement. So, the teams up there at East Greenwichare continuing to move that business in the right direction.", "So, moving on to industrial, it's truly a great story here.A strong, strong performance, revenue is 13% to $300 million, segment profit up46% to $42 million and 320 basis points of expansion in the segment profit rateto almost 14%. Industrial and automotive repair tools, which consist for thispurpose of Proto, MAC and Facom was up 8%, including 5% organic growthperformance.", "We had terrific strength in the Proto industrial business inthe America's up 11% and Facom was up 7% organically on strong new productintroductions and a solid integration continuing in that business.", "And as John mentioned, the engineered solutions businessesalso benefited from exchange, but had some really solid organic growth up 16%on total, and they were up almost 30%. And we had double-digit growth in thesmall business, the Vidmar high-end storage business, assembly technologies andthe hydraulics business.", "We had a good story on price realization, where favorablepricing more than offset our cost inflation in this segment and certainlyproductivity added to profits as well. And as I mentioned, the folks at Facomare doing a great job on the integration and not only are the revenues comingin as we expected, it got a little bit better. But the synergy realizationcontinues to be in line with expectations.", "Moving on now to security, another great story here, withrevenues up 24% to $374 million, segment profit up 34% to $69 million and otherexpansion in segment profit rate up a 130 basis points to 18.4%.", "The story here was twofold. First, an excellent performanceby the Mechanical Access business, which tends to be North American-centric. Wehad 7% sales growth in that business with strong orders and productivity in theautomatic doors business, but also good solid performances across the board inmechanical access solutions, including the old BEST Access, commercial locksand lock set business.", "Again, as the order book is strong in the business, theoperating margin is now north of 20%. The price realization and productivitygains are strong as well, and the non-ferrous metal inflation, is well though abatingsomewhat is still with us, but the price is more than offsetting there rightnow, and the productive is actually added to the margins.", "And then the other story in security is the ConvergentSecurity business where we had 62% sales growth, all of that driven by HSM, amodest decrease in the remaining part of the business, excluding HSM. Thatmodest decrease was driven by a sales decline in the United States SystemsIntegration business, which is, as we expected as we wean ourselves off theunprofitable types of business that we were working on previously there, andintegrating that business into the HSM business model.", "The team is in place to manage that integration, and it\u2019sgoing well. And the good news there in the US Systems Integration business isthe operating margin was up $6 million on a sequential basis, which is movingin the right direction.", "And now turning to cash flow, another good story here. Asolid, solid quarter, $130 million in operating cash flow, $119 million in freecash flow, brings us to a year-to-date figure of $326 million for operating and$271 million for free cash flow, and that puts us solidly in position toachieve our forecast to $400 million to $450 million for the year.  And we will expect to see some workingcapital improvements in the fourth quarter that are built into our thoughtprocess there.", "And then turning to the full-year and fourth quarterguidance, really nothing different here. We expect the fourth quarter to be inline with previous expectations and that's the full-year, 2% organic sales inthe fourth quarter, which is in line with what we have accomplished eachquarter this year.", "Acquisitions contributing 6 points total, 8 points of salesgrowth, the earnings per share of a $1.10 to a $1.15 that will give us a 6% to11% earnings per share growth with some significant tax headwind which you cansee on the chart there. It looks like about $0.15 to $0.18 headwind is still todeliver this earnings growth.", "The free cash flow $130ish to $180 million, will get us tothe 400 to 450, and when you step back and look at the year in light of thevery difficult United States Construction & DIY market, we expect toregister 15% to 17% earnings growth, and that goes to the strength of the portfoliothat we started this conversation at the beginning talking about, how thatportfolio has shifted. And if we go to the next chart here, the portfolioshift, you can see, back in 2002 when we were $2.6 billion, we had $1.7 millionof Construction & DIY.", "So the majority of the portfolio revenue base coming fromthat Construction & DIY segment back in \u201902 now; today a very similarnumber, $1.8 billion coming from Construction & DIY, but we have grown thesecurity business from $300 million to $1.4 billion during that timeframe, andthe industrial from $600 million to $1.3 billion and as a consequence we have amuch more balanced portfolio.", "And then the other point that I would make here is thatbecause the Construction and DIY segment are mostly geographically diversesegments. And you saw that in the results today that we only have $1.1 billionof exposure to the United State Construction and DIY market and [.700 million]in the rest of world. So that geographic diversification within the Constructionand DIY segment has helped us this quarter and we think it will continue tohelp us as we go forward here.", "So we have a larger and more diverse revenue base, and thatreally did help us drive performance throughout the year and we'll expect tocontinue to see that in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to the next chart, you can see a pretty good yearwhen we step back and look at some other key variables such as free cashflow.  It looks like about an 11% to 25%increase there, pretax income about a 25% increase. Operating cash flowconsistent increases as well there, and then EBITDA should grow about 25% thisyear.", "So on pretty much all fronts, including our earnings pershare with that 15% to 17% growth expectation, it looks like its going to be apretty good year and it looks like, despite the difficulties in the UnitedStates Construction and DIY housing related markets, that our portfolio iswithstanding them very well and we'll continue to do so as we go forward.", "With that we'll opening up for our questions.", "Question-and-answer session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Yourfirst question comes from Michael Rehaut.", "Ray Huang - JP Morgan", "Hi guys, this is actually RayHuang on for Mike. How are you doing?", "John Lundgren", "Okay.", "Ray Huang - JP Morgan", "Just had a couple of questions,first on the price realization. You got to expect that to continue goingforward to the fourth quarter and into the next year and by how much?", "Jim Loree", "Well, it will definitely goforward into the fourth quarter and it will help the fourth quarter. We arelooking at inflation in the total year of around $70 million now and we'llrecover about 80% of that in terms of our price realization. Price realizationhas grown to be a fairly good competency of the company over the past few yearsand certainly this year its been a pretty good year in that respect. Part of itthough, part of the higher percentage then will be typically, I mean typicallyhave been in the 60% to 65% realization range for the last couple of years.", "And I think the reason we aredoing a little bit better this year, is that the -- we are gaining somepositive effect from the non-ferrous inflation subsiding a bit as we go, tryingto go throughout the year and price increase, lag the inflation. So, we'rehaving a little bit of benefit from, of that lag effect, which we thought wouldcome soon or later, it looks likes it's coming. Nothing really significantthere, but I think in the fourth quarter we'll -- we should be, maybe the firstquarter where we are very close to a 100% price realization vis-\u00e0-vis our inflation.", "And when you look at it on asegment basis, its interesting, because we continue to -- that lag effect isclearly occurring in the Security business and in the Industrial business wherewe are recovering a little bit more than 100% of our inflation, but really justcatching up for inflation that we experienced in the past and in the CDIYsegment unfortunately due to the structural characteristics and difficulties inachieving price increases in that segment. The price realization percentage ismuch lower.", "We would be without that segmentkind of waiting the mix down, we would probably be right out around the 100maybe even slightly above 100% as we sit here today. ", "Ray Huang - JP Morgan", "Okay, so you guys are stilltracking that 70 million in raw material inflation that you guys had previouslygiven.", "Jim Loree", "Yes, no change from that and atleast based on the last 3 months worth of data.", "Ray Huang - JP Morgan", "Okay and then onto the follow-upon Bostitch, simply you guys are on-track there, but where you guys versus whatyour initial expectations were in a couple of quarters ago and how did thatprogressing over the next 12 months or so?", "John Lundgren", "No, that\u2019s fair. As Jim said weare at in fact slightly ahead and it's not going to be perfectly linear. Ithink we were pretty clear starting a year ago we said 100 basis points aquarter for 8 quarters, that gives you 800 basis points and takes margins fromvery low single-digits up to low double-digits. We are slightly ahead of it,it's not perfectly linear as mentioned. In terms of the key projects we cantalk about some things that weren't public at the time, but the key projectsare what\u2019s driving a lot of the improvement, specifically our plant in Chihuahua, Mexicois closed, that\u2019s been a very good thing. ", "Fastening production is primarilybeen relocate, what\u2019s been relocated at three different facilities as you know,and else don't travel very well, they are heavy. And we moved that productionprimarily to East Greenwich, Rhode Island. Secondarily thePoland and the Lung Fung, China, concurrent with that move we are making goodprogress on our tool transfer from East Greenwich Rhode Island to both Taiwanand China with recent Besco acquisition again a very important element in theprofit improvement program, with the transfer of some less proprietary tools tolower cost markets importantly we own the company, we own the facility, it isnot outsourced, it is a Stanley Works production facility primarily in Taiwan, secondarily in China. So, specific models, at thebeginning of that curve have been transferred and the products working and theproducts are moving back to the various domestic markets.", "So, simply said, on-track it'sthree quarter in a row, where we have achieved what we said we would and as Jimsuggested and we would suggest from our most recent review Bostitch business.We continue to track it very closely, and our plan and what's picked into thefourth quarter guidance at our plans for next year or it will continue withthat pace.", "Ray Huang - JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from KenZener with Merrill Lynch", "Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "Jim Loree ", "Good morning.", "John Lundgren", "Good morning, Zen.", "Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch", "I am interested in the Industrialmargins, which while up year-over-year. I am just trying to understand the kindof sequential decline. I am just trying to see about the mix for industrialistquote which is 13.9 versus 15.2 in the second quarter of '07, is that just kindof normal seasonality or can you kind of explain that a little bit?", "John Lundgren", "Sure, it's primarily one driver,and Jim who has got business specific detail in front of them. And I am notsure how much detail we want to go. The biggest single element is, August isnever a very high productivity month in France. We know how important Facomis. It's a third of the revenue and more than the third of the profit from thatbusiness. Last August of course we had tremendous synergies going on and theearliest synergy is hitting the bottom line. So, while the business with Facomremains extraordinarily healthy and wouldn't want to suggest anything to the contrary.August with vacation period etcetera, Europe in general, France in particular, is arelatively low productivity month usually results in under recovery of somefixed costs. And simply said, it didn't show up last year because theimprovements due to the synergies at Facom overwhelmed the lack of efficiencyor reduced efficiency. And importantly we still have eight French plans andmajor merging porter that all we need to do is plan it a little better andforecast at a little better. It is always existed. It just didn't show up lastyear because synergies overwhelmed the historical lack of fixed cost recoveryand French plans in August.", "Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then I guess on the SecurityIntegration. I believe last quarter you guys said it was the business was down8% the second quarter, and sounds like it's kind of down the low single digitsthis quarter. Is that correct?", "John Lundgren", "", "That's correct. That's on the [electrophic]convergent fees, Ken.", "Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Exactly.", "John Lundgren", "", "Mechanical continues to do nicelywith low single-digit organic growth at improved margins. We would love to withall three businesses on the Mechanical side heading on most, if not allcylinders, but what we are speaking to is yes --", "Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch", "But there you also said thatprofit was up $6 million. Was that quarter-to-quarter?", "John Lundgren", "That was sequential that Jimreferred to, second to third, and that\u2019s primarily, you\u2019ll recall, within theLegacy SI business, we had a tremendous backlog of best and profitable installationprojects, particularly in some corrections facilities around the world, wherewe didn\u2019t do as good a job as we should have, in both, estimating cost toinstall and secondarily, bringing it in at the cost we estimated once weprovided an estimate that arguably was not competitive to begin with. ", "We are Stanley, we are in thisbusiness for the long haul, we are going to honor those commitments to ourcustomers, that backlog at the end of the second quarter was dramaticallyreduced. We still have a few more and what we said on our second quarter callis they would be reduced. We are finished with them until the end of this year,but that\u2019s the primary sequential driver. Quite frankly, continued strongperformance at HSM and fewer bad projects in the backlog to work through atLegacy Systems Integration.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromNigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning. Nicequarter by the way, I think you do admit some good numbers here, and it\u2019s a verychallenging environment. Just want to focus on Industrial, particularly with EngineeredSolutions, 16% organic growth. Can you just talk about some of the drivers ofthat performance, and lot of my Industrials are talking about 4Q and 2008 beinga bit more challenging, could you maybe address that question as well.", "Jim Loree", "", "Sure, engineered solutions is amixture of several small businesses, anywhere from $60 million to $150 millioneach; within those businesses each one participates in a niche market. So forinstance Vidmar is in the high end storage business for industrial customers,military customers and most recently hospitals in the healthcare industry withthe acquisition of InnerSpace. And assembly is in the Automotive OEM business.And hydraulics happens to be in the scrap recovery and demolishing segments ofthe market. ", "So, to extrapolate anythingdramatic about the state of the overall industrial economy would be verydangerous and difficult. However, fortunately for us the markets that wehappened to in are vibrant right now, and the value propositions that we havewithin these businesses are very good and strong. And I think in all caseswe\u2019re either maintaining or growing share within those businesses.", "So, it\u2019s a combination ofindustrial strength within certain niches that we are in. And on top of thatsome good performance. Now the one notable exception to that in terms of marketstrength would be the assembly, you know the Automotive business. And there isa couple of things going on there.", "Number one, there Europeanperformance was very strong in the quarter. So despite, you know, again the US wasin the Automotive industry. They did it very well in that regard. They had arelatively easy comp on top of that because it\u2019s been down for a while. Andbasically the combination of those two factors and some good new products havehelped propel into a positive performance as well.", "So, no one story there, buthaving said that, we don\u2019t see any significant weakness at all on theindustrial economy across the board. I am talking more in a general sense now.And I think the exports in the USare certainly robust that\u2019s helping drive the industrial economy and theinternational aspects of the Industrial business are very strong as well.", "John Lundgren", "Nigel, let me just add one thingto Jim\u2019s point because the segmentation is relatively new to the investmentcommunity. We have only been reporting this way, this is our third quarter andwithin Industrial. The largest distinction between what we call Industrial onAutomotive Repairs versus Engineered Solutions. Engineered Solutions representsabout 20% of our Industrial portfolio. That is they made to order versus a madeto stock business model.", "But all the businesses that Jimdiscussed, they tend to be larger ticket items, longer lead times and theinterest to simplification. More often than not it's going to come from the customer'scapital budget as opposed to his expense budget. Thus, we have a little longerlook into the future, in terms of open orders and things of that nature in thatbusiness.", "So, fundamental business modeldifference, made to order versus made to stock and beyond that obviously theyall compete in the same general environment. It's more an internal than anexternal thing, is why the Engineered Solutions segment showed more robustgrowth than Industrial in total.", "Nigel Coe - Deutsche Bank", "Got it, thanks for the colorthere and just a quick follow-on HSM, I know it's not part of organic growth,but can you just talk about the organic growth there for the quarter?", "Jim Loree", "It's very consistent with what ithas been, the trend is in the right direction. It's in the 8% to 10% kind of arange and the good news about that business it has so much recurring revenuethat forecasting the revenue is a lot easier than say the CDIY segment nextweek. So in any event, business continues to be strong and trending in theright direction in HSM.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromEric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Good morning. ", "Jim Loree", "Hi Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "Two questions, first of all onthe Facom business, the 7% organic growth SFX seems like a heck of a number.What's going on in those markets and within market shares what\u2019s driving thatand is that sustainable over what period of time?", "Jim Loree", "Well, the market itself Eric isnot on fire, certainly stronger than usual, so its probably you get probably2.5% economic growth going on in Europe right now, and these markets tend totrack the economy fairly closely, but compared to how Europe has beencontinentally or been particularly has been performing over the past few yearsthat's a slightly stronger pulse than before. The real story at Facom islargely one of new product introductions and Facom prior to Stanley's ownership was owned by a financial,in effect the financial portfolio company, company they don't fetch in and thenItalian commercial furniture company. So they are now part of a global toolcompany and a global industrial in Automotive tools platform and we didn'treally bank on any revenue synergies or anything else when we put the dealtogether, nor do we really count on those, but we are definitely getting someand in addition to that we are getting some geographic expansion into Centraland Eastern Europe. ", "So combination of factors, thequestion about sustainability who knows certainly new product introductiondoesn\u2019t turn on one quarter in the Industrial business and turn off the next,so I think we should have some sustained performance for a period of time,whether it will be at the levels that we have this quarter will be anotherquestion, but certainly we see no reason to become pessimistic about organicgrowth at Facom at this time.", "John Lundgren", "Yeah, Eric before you ask mesecond question because we now it works to get cut off in the queue. Just toexpand historically Facom's been outstanding at new product introduction. Ithink the internal improvements at Facom are simply our robust new productpipeline replaced all of the attrition from the core business thus the businesswas able to stay flat. What's happened with the Facom team that I think justimprovements that Jim talked about in their rhythm, in their metrics and howthey are managing the business is simply said, the new product introduction isnot 100% cannibalization or replacing lot business. So, they are maintaining alarger percentage of the core business and as a consequence, some of the newproduct introductions becomes net incremental and that\u2019s really helping. Can wekeep doing that forever. It\u2019s a long plan, but we like the way the business isgoing, we like the way it's managed and EQUIP AUTO which is largest Automotiveand Industrial show in Europe just took place.We were very pleased with the interest, the results with our position at EQUIPAUTO in Parisin late October. So, for the short-term future things look good at Facom.", "Eric Bosshard - ClevelandResearch", "And then lastly, it seems thatthis is your last quarterly guidance. Within the 4Q guidance, my number suggestthat you probably need to have some profit growth out of the CDIY which isdifferent than what you showed in the 3Q. Can you just give a little sense ofwhat you expect the profit comparison to be in that segment and 4Qyear-over-year and why?", "Jim Loree", "Well, I will tell you, Eric. Wedon\u2019t, we are not in the business of giving guidance by segment anyway eventhough we still give quarterly guidance. But what I will say is that, we expectthe fourth quarter to look and also lot like the third quarter in the sensethat CDIY will most likely be a kind of a strong base and not particularlystrong in terms of growth but solid in terms of not eroding. And thenIndustrial and Security we are expecting very strong quarters out of them aswell in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromPeter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "", "Good morning gentlemen. ", "John Lundgren", "", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "", "I guess first question would beon Security. If you look at the legacy Convergent portfolio, you mention thesequential profitability improvement. But can you give us a sense as to whatthat would mean on a year-over-year basis or where we were at in terms of justthe underlying margin in that business right now?", "John Lundgren", "", "Yeah. I guess as Jim just said,Pete in all fairness, not only are we\u2019re going to forecast or talk revenue andmargin by segment. We\u2019re certainly not going to talk to it by sub-segment. Wehave no intention on an open conference call of talking Legacy Convergent,Security margins versus HSM versus anything else. ", "What we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve been very-- about HSM is obviously mixing up Security in a meaningful way. A businessthat was certainly a drag on profitability, you know, round numbers it's 350million of the $600 million segment. So, you can do the math on what 6 millionin one quarter did. Going forward we see the reversed integration of the LegacySI business into the HSM model continuing to affect performance and that\u2019swhat's build into our guidance.", "Importantly, the change wassimply we have a better with the help and one of the strategic justificationsof HSM a far better cost estimating tool, far better project managementcapabilities and the elimination of the backlog, you know, all of those aswe\u2019ve said in the second quarter impacted the third quarter positively we\u2019llcontinue to impact the fourth quarter. That\u2019s why we bought HSM and right nowwe got 15% plus operating margin business and we continue to believe it's thereand can go up from there, but we just aren't in a position and it's not in ourbest interest to provide any more granularity than that.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "No I understand that, I just wastrying to get a ballpark of whether or not you are seeing improvement and howmuch but second question. So thanks for that answer. Second question, in termsof the Mechanical Access business, I think I had the same question what Ericjust asked on Facom and that is it looks like 7% plus in the first half orfirst three quarters of the year. And Jim you mentioned strength on all threeof the businesses.", "Just can give us a bit more coloron how that's happening and do you expect that to continue and how?", "Jim Loree", "We don't expect to continue at 7%for the intermediate term that's for sure because it's a 3% to 4% market growthstory. If we can get Mechanical to grow 3% or 4% the real growth in the futurefor this segment above line average will come from the Convergent business andMechanicals job is to grow 3% to 4% and generate a lot of profit and lot ofcash and help us fund the expansion, of the platform into other geographies andso forth.", "That said, there is lot of, a lotof good things going on in the organic growth area in Mechanical. We are verystrong in the Education and Healthcare markets. They both happen to be goodmarkets to be in right now. Where gaining some shares in the CommercialConstruction market because all of the fact, that we have more specifiers thanwe use to and that's gradually starting to have a positive impact and we alsohave a full product line and you recall that in the last few year we purchaseda few companies that have enabled us to round out our product line in Mechanicalaccess. And some of the competition prior to the fact that we have this, now wehave this full product line, but prior to that some of the competition wastaking advantage in their pricing strategies by looking at low (volume), wherewe were competing with them and then making their moneys on areas where we didn'thave products and they are winning bids that way. That is not happening to theextent that it did before and that certainly is helping.", "The other factor there is theautomatic door business which has just been a tremendous growth story over thepast five to seven years, started out five to seven years ago it was $100million business, today it's between $200 million and $300 million and most ofthat has been organic growth and they have had enormous share gain. That has todo, we believe, with the superior products that they have and they continue todevelop new products in that particular business and also has to do with ourdistribution strategy, which is go-direct strategy and that enables us to servethe national accounts extremely well and we have gained share as a result. ", "So, all of those factors I think arecombing to give us strong performance. And the other thing, it's an intangiblebut I believe it has something to do with this, is that we split these businessesfrom management perspective about a year ago and as it turns out the Mechanicalfolks now are able to focus much more on the nuts and bolts of organic sharegain and productivity and other things in their business and they don't have toworry about estimating cost in the Electronic business and project management,the Electronic business. I am trying to figure out how to grow the recurringrevenue base in the Electronic business in all thing and the technology changesin the Electronic business, and everything else there was potentially a bit ofdistraction before. So, I think increased focus has also contributed to thestrong performance in Mechanical access", "John Lundgren", "Pete, let me just add because youdidn't get everything you were looking for, I know in convergent, but infairness. Just, the third leg of course of our Mechanical Security Solutionsbusiness is builder's hardware. We talked about in February, talked about againin May, we lost a meaningful piece of business there and it is what clouds theoutlook and makes Jim or me hesitant to say yes of course, it will continuewith the rate.", "The good news is we lost thebusiness, we started to plan for it, that business has in fact wind down alittle slower than we thought and we've done a better job replacing the lostbusiness, and we gave ranges of what we thought that might mean in terms ofrevenue and income, and quite frankly we've lost the revenue a little bit andincome a little bit slower than we had anticipated in our outlook and we\u2019rereplacing it with business that we know we can count on in the future a littlebit faster, still a lot of open books there.", "With the speed at which linereviews work and as Jim already talked about the architectural bidding process,and it's a little less than straight forward, but that too has contributed togreat performance of late, and it\u2019s a little more difficult to predict theshort intermediate term future of that piece of the business. But all in, we'repleased with our decision to have split those businesses, fundamentallydifferent business models despite the great synergies between the two in termof install base.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromSteven Kim with Citigroup.", "Mark Montanan - Citigroup", "Hi, this is Mark Montanan onbehalf of Steven. Regarding your recent acquisition, seems like you\u2019re line upproduct offering on the Mechanical access is fairly complete, wondering isyou\u2019re expecting to further add to your portfolio on the Mechanical side, orshould we expect more acquisitions coming on the convergent side going forward?And in particular are you still expecting to expand these future convergentacquisitions internationally. Thanks.", "John Lundgren", "", "Yeah. Well, I guess it was March8 when we talked specifically about some of the different strategies in thegrowth platforms so we have in Security and Industrial and Automotive tools.But, we have three growth platforms of which two are security and each ofthose, one is Mechanical and one is Convergent. And the growth strategies aresomewhat different, especially as it relates to the M&A growth.", "And you\u2019re right; I mean we havea relatively complete now product line in Mechanical in North America,certainly there is no, there is no burning platform need to buy anything elseas product related doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be possible nicheopportunities that come up from time to time within Mechanical in NorthAmerica.", "But the real opportunity in themanagement team is well aware and strongly pursuing it for growth for mergerand acquisition growth in Mechanical is outside the borders of the United States,and that\u2019s where they are focused on. And I suspect you probably will see somedeals there and all likelihood over the coming years. And when you think aboutthe strength of this business and profitability and the growth profileetcetera, it\u2019s a nice business and it\u2019s equally as nice in Europe as it is inthe US.But the products in the USdon\u2019t just translate like the tool business translates into Europe.You have to, they are subject to different standards and you have to have localproducts.", "So, it makes it more challengingand it really does require sort of M&A approach to the non-US growthstrategy. So that\u2019s Mechanical. In convergent, convergent has the opportunityto grow through acquisition as well. But I would say their growth strategy willlikely be more focused on organic. Not to say that we won\u2019t acquire there\u2019scertainly a lot of commercial monitoring companies that we could consolidateinto our business in a very successful and cost effective manner and it'slikely that we will do that, and it's also possible that overtime, there maybesome businesses outside the borders, of the United States that are attractiveto us, that will to a large extent depend on how well, the team is executing inNorth America making sure that the US Systems Integration business isstabilized and so forth.", "So before we go venturing toofar, beyond our borders we are going to make that we totally certain, that wehave the equation right, in the United States and the only way you can betotally certain is to get some quarters under your belt and make sure that theperformance is there. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction, and wewould expect to continue to do that.", "Mark Montanan - Citigroup", "Okay, great. And then a follow-upto previous question on the implications to the fourth quarter guidance andmargins holding up pretty fairy well. Is this, I am just wondering if this isparticularly due to the strong pricing that you mentioned earlier on theindustrial on Security segments? I know you said that CDIY is going to continueto be anchor there, are you expecting margins to really hold in place mainlydue to the pricing or is it something in particular of the time in anotheryear?", "John Lundgren", "No, it's kind of what we arelooking at about 2% organic growth where we are looking at strong productivity.We are looking at price and inflation roughly off setting each other. That meancombination of factors, such as that are really driving the outlook forcontinued in a positive performance.", "Certainly the market conditionswere not betting on any improvement in any market conditions, I can assure youof that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromSeth Weber with Banc of America.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America", "Hi good morning, my questionshave all been asked and answered thank you.", "Jim Loree", "Thanks Seth.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks Seth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes fromDavid McGregor with Longbow Research.", "David McGregor - Longbow Research", "Yes, good morning. Just on thetopics for organic growth at HSM. Can you talk about your plans for 2008 withrespect to opening new offices and how that could contribute to organic growth?", "John Lundgren", "Yeah, there are David, three tosix regions where we feel we are not top cities, quite frankly, where we feelwe are not perfectly suited to compete. The best way to not make money or losemoney in this business, as I am sure you understand, is to how folks drive in threeor four hundred miles to service a commercial account. So I won\u2019t name thecities, but three to six are on the radar screen for having enough critical mathbetween the Legacy Stanley Systems Integration business in HSM, to open anoffice there and as there is consequence to staff with two to four field techs,and that is quite frankly to eliminate the cut drive time from four hours toone hour to allow us to grow organically in that market. ", "It probably overall would come,but we still have some redundancy in our field operations, as you might expectcombining the HSM locations with the Stanleylocations. We have done a really good job so far Brett Vontrager, Tim Wall andthe team. They have done a very good job in terms of choosing the rightlocation and the tough decisions, the best of the best in terms of the peoplewhere if you got two-ten person offices in a city that becomes a 15 personoffice. So, long answer to a simple question, look for three to six new citiesnext year, which we think will help contribute to the organic growth. We thinkit's necessary. We continue, the biggest help to organic growth of course iskeeping attrition at or below industry standard levels, where we are with HSM.That\u2019s what Tim Wall and the team wake up every morning, not just looking fornew business, but working real hard to ensure that they retain every existingcustomer, that\u2019s a profitable customer. And if there is any chance of losing itfor whatever reason, we work extra hard to keep that from happening, which iswhy attrition is well below our industry standards in that business and areworking hard to drive it even lower.", "David McGregor - Longbow Research", "And it's impressive as 8% to 10%growth is, is it possible that with these 3 to 6 openings that might be on thescreen of '08 that we could see organic growth moving higher from 8% to 10%next year.", "John Lundgren", "David, anything is possible, isthat built into our guidance? The answer is no, as much as we would like to, wedon\u2019t operate in a vacuum, there are people out there actually after those samecommercial accounts as we are. Some of whom are a lot bigger than we are, sothe simple answer is, that\u2019s just part of our on-going practice. We think weneed to do that to keep up with the kind of growth we\u2019ve experienced in thepast. It will na\u00efve for us, you or anyone else to think that for whateverreason, consolidations of the customer base, that their wont be some attrition.And remember, when there is, whether it\u2019s three or five or 8%, even if you areon the low end of that, 3% to 5% attrition means you need some new business inexciting markets or you need some new cities to back fill that before youbreakeven. ", "The best part of the HSM model asJim suggested earlier, is the high base and increasingly high percentage of therevenue that\u2019s recurring. When you get more than 50% of your revenue baserecurring, that is an annuity, and at least a year in advance that businesswill be with you, and that\u2019s where our focus is, on HSM. But we will take anyupside that that team can deliver, they\u2019ve done nothing but pleases with theconnectivity and their performance so far, but it would not be prudent for usto expect any more from and making a lot of things going on, and they\u2019reoperating in an intensely competitive market.", "Operator", "There are no further questions.I\u2019ll turn it over to John Lundgren for final comments.", "John Lundgren", "I want to thank, just nothingelse to say in terms of the numbers, they are out as always as Gerry isavailable for a follow-up if somebody didn\u2019t get it. There is a lot going on inthe market this morning and a lot of calls coming out.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Black & Decker fourth quarter conference call. (Operator Instructions)  ", "I would now like to turn today's conference over to Mr. Mark Rothleitner, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Mark Rothleitner - IR", "Thank you, Christy. Good morning, and welcome to Black & Decker's fourth quarter conference call. On today's call our Chief Executive Officer, Nolan Archibald, will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and outlook for 2008. His comments should take about 15 minutes, and then we'll answer your questions.", "In keeping with SEC requirements, I advise that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Black & Decker Corporation, please review the reports we have filed with the SEC, including the 8-K filed today.", "In addition, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included on the corporation's web site under the Investor Relations section.", "And now I'll turn it over to Nolan.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Thank you, Mark.", "This morning Black & Decker announced fourth quarter results consistent with the revised guidance we provided in December.", "Excluding certain items, EPS was $1.06 for the fourth quarter and $6.03 for the full year. Reported earnings per share were $2.94 for the fourth quarter and $7.85 for the full year. These results included $153 million from the tax settlement we announced in December as well as a $32 million environmental charge and a $19\u00a0million restructuring charge.", "Macro conditions made 2007 a challenging year for Black & Decker, and the economy deteriorated further in the fourth quarter. U.S. housing starts were down approximately 25% for the year, significantly worse than we had expected a year ago. Commodity inflation during the year was also more severe, coming in roughly $60 million worse than our initial estimate. Yet despite these headwinds, our $6.03 adjusted EPS was only 4% below the full year range we provided last January.", "Two factors enabled us to limit the impact of the downturn on our EPS. First, our international operations had an extremely strong year. All of our businesses outside North America posted outstanding sales growth combined with strong operating margins. Second, we generated a record $623 million in free cash flow and used that case effectively for share repurchases at attractive prices.", "For the fourth quarter, sales increased 3% to $1.7 billion. Our organic volume was flat, price was negative 1%, and foreign exchange contributed 4%. For the year, sales increased 2% to $6.6 billion. Organic volume decreased 1%, price was flat, and foreign exchange added 3% for the year.", "As we have described in the past, we estimate that 15% to 20% of our sales were tied to new U.S. housing starts. Therefore, the housing downturn probably had a 4 or 5 point impact on our sales for the year. In addition, we believe housing and the related credit market disruption had a negative affect on remodelling and consumer spending in the second half. Considering these trends, we are proud of our team's efforts outside the U.S. to limit our organic sales decline to 1%.", "Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 6.8% excluding the restructuring charge and environmental expense well below the prior year. The product recall we announced in December accounted for roughly 120 basis points of the decline. ", "As we have faced all year, component costs rose significantly. The increase was driven by commodities such as nickel in batteries as well as the increase in China's currency and the new Chinese VAT rebate policy. ", "We had nearly $50 million of year-on-year pressure this quarter, which exceeded our productivity gains. ", "Our SG&A percentage also increased due to lower sales volume and spending to stimulate sales.", "For the full year, our adjusted operating margin decreased to 9.6%. While our cost structure has improved in recent years, $180 million of inflation proved too much to overcome. The product recall also had a 30 basis point impact on full year margins.", "One major area where we exceed our goal was setting a sixth straight record for free cash flow. By continuing to manage capital expenditures and working capital effectively, we generated $623 million of free cash flow for the year versus $533\u00a0million in 2006. Adjusting for a one-time tax payment related to the American Jobs Creation Act in early 2006, free cash flow increased more than $45\u00a0million. We converted over 120% of net earnings to free cash flow, even including the large tax settlement. That conversion ratio has been greater than 100% in six of the last seven years, averaging over 120% during that period.", "For the year, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of stock, helping to reduce average diluted shares by 11%. ", "Our debt level was down year-on-year, our debt metrics remain strong, and we maintain investment-grade ratings.", "Earlier this month when the stock came under pressure, we repurchased 2\u00a0million additional shares. We remain committed to using our cash to create value for our shareholders.", "Now I'll discuss our individual businesses in more detail.", "Sales in our worldwide Power Tools and Accessories segment decreased 2% in the quarter. A year ago, our customers dramatically reduced inventory levels, which gave us reason to expect modest sales growth this year. Unfortunately, the U.S. economic environment continued to deteriorate, and customers remained cautious regarding orders and inventory levels. The consistent strength of our international businesses offset most but not all of the domestic weakness.", "In the U.S. Industrial Products groups, sales decreased low single digits. As you would expect, the weak residential construction market is a major factor. We believe that homeowners are also more cautious about remodelling projects, hurting sales at the home centers. ", "Sell-through in this channel deteriorated in the fourth quarter after stabilizing in recent quarters. Sale end results varied somewhat across channels, as some customers ordered to achieve rebate levels while others managed inventory tightly. ", "In terms of product categories, Woodworking had the steepest decline. The XRP recall had a negative impact on the Construction category, which otherwise performed well given the housing slowdown. The Accessories and Equipment categories were positives, posting sales growth in a tough environment.", "For the year, the Industrial Products group had a mid single-digit sales decline in the U.S. The housing downturn was the main driver of the group's sales performance, primarily affecting the independent channel. Sales were roughly flat in the home center channels for the year.", "The U.S. Consumer Products group saw a double-digit sales decline in the fourth quarter. It was a difficult holiday season for many retailers and consumer manufacturers, and we were affected as well. ", "As we have discussed in previous quarter, the Vector, Automotive and Electronic business had fewer new products than last year, and sales were down significantly.", "In our core categories, we did have some successful new products, including the Gecko Grip Level and a fairly strong second season for the Autowrench and Pivot Vac. However, our VPX Cordless line did not meet expectations. We continue to believe that VPX is a platform that we can build upon. We will add products and reposition the line to take advantage of this opportunity.", "For the full year, sales in the U.S. Consumer division declined at a high single-digit rate. The Vector, Automotive and Electronic line in Pressure Washers were responsible for roughly half of the decline. Tools and Accessories sales slowed in the second half, along with the overall U.S. economy.", "In Europe, sales grew at a low single-digit rate in the fourth quarter after a very strong double-digit gain in the third quarter. Unlike earlier in the year, the Consumer business led the way this quarter. The addition of Vector and the strong sales of blower vacs, Dustbusters, and consumer accessories drove the gain in Consumer.", "Industrial sales in Europe were roughly flat this quarter, with double-digit sales growth through September, inventory in the channels were somewhat heavy entering the fourth quarter. Customers ordered more cautiously in places such as the U.K. and Nordic region. Sales growth in Eastern Europe and the Middle East remain very strong.", "For the full year, European sales grew mid single digits, with double-digit industrial growth. We continued to gain in concrete categories with new products such as the Pavement Breaker, Angle Grinders and Diamond Saws. Europe also had a modest in Consumer products for the full year.", "In Latin America, we capped off a great year with sales growth over 20% for the quarter. All regions and nearly all product lines continue to deliver sales gains. This strong finish enabled the Latin America business to tout growth above 20% for the year.", "The Asian business also left 2007 on a positive note, with sales growth in the teens for the quarter and full year.", "Return on sales for the Power Tools and Accessories business decreased significantly to 4.9% for the quarter. The XRP recall caused roughly one-third of the decline. The remaining pressure was split between SG&A and gross margin. ", "We made SG&A investments to drive sales primarily growing international markets and had substantial negative leverage in North America. ", "Commodity inflation intensified in the fourth quarter as we felt the full impact of higher battery prices. At the same time, we reached the anniversary of our price increases in late 2006. ", "International margins remain strong with Europe and Latin America again in double digits.", "For the full year, margins fell to 10% for Power Tools and Accessories. Commodity inflation was the overriding factor, with the XRP recall adding to the decline. The U.S. Consumer business felt the most pressure, in part due to weak performance by the Vector, Automotive and Electronic business.", "In our Hardware and Home Improvement segment, sales decreased 4% for the fourth quarter. While our new products continue to do well, the housing impact on our lockset business more than offset this. Our U.S. lockset business, primarily under the Quick Set brand, saw a high single digit sales decline this quarter. Quick Set continues to have success with the launch of SmartKey. This is the most innovative security product in years, and we're very pleased with the support that we have gotten at retail. In the new construction channel, where we have not yet launched SmartKey, we saw a decline consistent with the drop in housing starts. ", "In addition, we passed the anniversary of the 2006 price increases, which had contributed to sales growth in the third quarter.", "The Price Pfister Plumbing business posted sales growth for the fifth straight quarter. While the growth was modest this quarter, this is a significant accomplishment in today's housing market. We continued to see positive results from a repositioned product line up at key customers. Conversions of large builders to Price Pfister also had a favorable impact again this quarter.", "Operating margin in the Hardware and Home Improvement segment declined to 9.6% for the quarter. This was driven by lower volume in the U.S. lock business. SG&A for this business was roughly flat in absolute dollars but rose as a percentage on weaker sales.", "In addition, locksets are among our most vertically integrated product lines, so we incurred manufacturing absorption costs as production levels came down. ", "The increases in commodity costs were not as significant as earlier in the year, and we offset it with productivity this quarter.", "For the year, sales in the Hardware and Home Improvement segment decreased 1%. Price Pfister had an outstanding year, growing sales high single digits. Over the last four years, Price Pfister has had nearly a 10% compounded annual growth rate. HHI's international group, despite being a small piece of the segment, contributed meaningful growth this year. These successes could not quite offset the construction-related decrease in sales for Quick Set.", "The full year operating margin for the Hardware and Home Improvement segment decreased 11.3%. This team did an admirable job of offsetting cost inflation with price and productivity. The significant decrease in lockset volumes was the primary cause of the margin decline.", "In the Fastening and Assembly Systems segment, momentum continued from the third quarter, with sales up 6%. Asian sales were up double digits, with strong results in China. Europe also had a solid quarter, particularly in the Automotive division. North America's sales were flat, but we are encouraged by continued success in Automotive. Operating margin for this segment increased to 14.6%, primarily due to volume leverage.", "For the full year, sales in the Fastening and Assembly Systems segment grew 4%, its sixth straight annual increase. Asia and Europe drove the growth. Growth in North America improved as the year progressed. Full year operating margin for the segment rose to 15.4%, largely on the strength of higher volume.", "In addition to the underlying operational results, three items had a significant impact on reported earnings for the fourth quarter and for a full year. First, earnings benefited from the tax settlement we announced in December. The $153\u00a0million P&L impact was slightly higher than we estimated at that time. We continue to expect a $50 million cash outlay in 2008 related to this settlement.", "The second item, a $32 million environmental charge, relates to a former Emhart operation. Emhart sold that operation before being acquired by Black & Decker. We now expect to incur higher clean-up costs on the site, and therefore increased our reserve.", "Third, we recorded a $19 million restructuring charge. It is critical that we continue aggressively reducing costs, especially in light of current economic conditions. The restructuring actions will affect the cost structure and workforce levels in our Power Tools and Accessories and Hardware and Home Improvement segments. The restructuring plan should generate approximately $7 million of savings in 2008 and additional benefit in future years.", "Now let me discuss the outlook for 2008. ", "The U.S. economy clearly deteriorated in the fourth quarter of 2007. Whether the U.S. enters or avoids a recession in 2008, the new housing and remodelling markets will almost certainly remain weak. Consumer spending and nonresidential construction are likely to slow as well. Many of our international markets remain very strong, but not enough to outweigh the U.S. situation.", "We plan to fight these trends with the approach that has worked for Black & Decker for decades. We will continue investing in our leading brands with innovative products that deliver value to end users and selling them through a broad global distribution network.", "In Power Tools, we intend to strengthen our leading cordless position, both in NiCad and our Nano Lithium Ion lines. We'll also continue our efforts to gain in the independent channel. ", "The HHI segment will continue rolling out SmartKey to distribution channels and driving sell-through. Emhart's Engineered Solutions should drive higher content per vehicle in growing markets.", "Considering both the macro trends and our initiatives, we expect sales to be down low single digits for the year. In the first quarter we have our most difficult comparison of the year; therefore we expect a mid single digit sales decline, including favorable currency.", "We anticipate our margins will contract modestly in 2008. We will control expenses carefully, but expect a higher SG&A percentage on lower volume. Component inflation is expected to be approximately $120 million, mostly in the first half of the year. Batteries, changes in China's VAT policy, and appreciation of the Chinese currency remain the key issues. We plan to mitigate this pressure with productivity gains and favorable currency. In addition, we have a favorable comparison to the recall costs in late 2007. ", "In total, we expect operating margins will decline to around 9% for the year. The first quarter is our smallest, so margins will likely be below 9%. ", "Based on share repurchases to date, we expect a diluted share count around 62\u00a0million and interest expense flat to last year.", "We continue to expect a full year tax rate of roughly 27%.", "In total, we expect diluted EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 for the first quarter, and $5.40 to $5.90 for the full year.", "Finally, we expect to convert approximately 100% of full year net earnings to free cash flow. As always, we intend to use cash wisely to build shareholder value. Following last year's credit market disruption, we are hopeful that our efforts to find financially compelling acquisitions will bear fruit in 2008.", "In summary, Black & Decker continues to weather a challenging economic environment and prepare for the future. We announced adjusted EPS consistent with our December guidance and only 4% below our forecast a year ago. We generated $623 million of free cash flow, setting a sixth straight record. We repurchased 8% of our shares and raised the dividend without increasing debt. We delivered impressive sales growth outside North America. We continued to reduce costs in response to declining markets, and at the same time, we moved ahead with innovation on key platforms that should provide opportunity when our markets recover.", "Black & Decker has the best people in our industry executing a successful proven strategy. We believe that we are in an excellent position to take the company to an even higher level in the future when the economy recovers. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks. Mike Mangan, our Chief Financial Officer, is with me, and we'll turn it back to the Operator to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael\u00a0Rehaut of J.P. Morgan. ", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, thanks. Good morning.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Good morning.  ", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "The first question is just on the '08 guidance, and I appreciate some of the detail there. It appears that excluding some of the cost inflation that you're expecting in '08 which is about a 180 basis point hit to margins roughly, that your margins could actually have been roughly flat even with a modest sales decline.", "So I was wondering if you could help with how you're approaching this as this has been an ongoing issue for a number of years, and if you could kind of review maybe your hedging strategies or your sourcing strategies or if there are any other types of things that you might be thinking of doing that you're not already doing.", "Then I have a follow up.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Mike, this is Mike Mangan. ", "To your point, we are looking at our margins to decline modestly here in 2008 inherent in the guidance from the 9.6% range to down to in and around 9% for the year for 2008. ", "Significant commodity inflation at $120 million, that'll put 180, 190 basis points of pressure on our margins, yet we'll be able to offset some of that with productivity improvements, we'll get some favorable FX. We won't have the recall charge that we saw in 2007. Probably some modest, flat but maybe a bit favorable on the pricing side. And as well, we'll get some restructuring benefits as well.", "So, you know, net-net, our gross margins will be flat to up slightly, and we'll see some challenges with SG&A percentage given leverage. ", "In terms of fighting these costs, we are doing a number of things. A significant portion of that productivity is driven by value engineering activities. We drive productivity and look at not only alternate suppliers but alternate material usage in our products, so we're trying to substitute obviously away from higher-cost commodities down to lower-cost commodities, and that's one of the big items that drives our productivity benefits for 2008. ", "As well, we'll continue to work on dual sourcing to leverage that supply base in China and in other places around the world begin to drive productivity in our business.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "You also noticed the restructuring charges I mentioned in my remarks that we're continuing to take costs out of our operations, reducing our headcount, and that restructuring charge also covers some manufacturing restructuring that we'll be doing.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "I appreciate that, and that kind of leads into my second question which is if you could give us an idea what you estimate your productivity savings were in '07, and to your point just before, if you're able to give any quantitative guidance in terms of what you're expecting for productivity for '08.", "And I guess the second part of that question, with the restructuring, what does this do now to your low-cost country makeup as a percent of overall manufacturing footprint across Power Tools and HHI, and where do you see that going over the next couple of years?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Let me answer your second question first, and that is we still think that, as we look at our competitive field, that we are still in an excellent position by the strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities. You're obviously seeing some costs increase in China. Most of our competition will share those very same increases. We believe that we have a very good structure about when you balance close to market versus costs and risk of inventory and transportation costs and all of that. So we still think that we're in a pretty good strategic manufacturing footprint that will effectively compete with anybody that is in our industry.", "But we do look and we'll continue to look for opportunities to take costs out by closing down some manufacturing; when costs increase in one area, we my do some shifting into our factories, and part of that is this restructuring charge. We're not announcing the specific locations yet, but we'll be consolidating some operations here. That's inherent in this restructuring charge.", "Mike, why don't you take the margin question?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Relative to productivity, Mike, we're generating in and around $80 million of productivity, both in 2007 and expect to be able to do that again in 2008. So if you look in and around 80, potentially up to 90, we're looking to offset from twothirds up to three-quarters of that component cost inflation issue, the $120\u00a0million that Nolan referenced in his comments.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth\u00a0Zener of Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Good morning.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple questions on the inventory that is up about 8% year-over-year, if you could address that. I know things had slowed down more than you guys had expected in the quarter, but could you address that a little bit in terms of the implications for the first half of '08?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "There are two major components of the increase in inventory. One is FX and the second one is an increase in inventory in our HHI business. Most of our other inventories are in pretty good shape. We do need to work our HHI inventory down a bit.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I'm just trying to understand the U.S. side of the Power Tools business, the Consumer business which fell off. Was there loss of market share there relative to a competitor in a big box channel, and can you address why you think the Industrial Tools was down more in the independent channel versus the big box?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "In our core Power Tool businesses, we do not think we have lost any share. We got some increased listings in our DeWalt business and therefore we believe that we maintain and maybe even probably increased market share in our DeWalt business.", "Now there were certain pockets of that, like cordless Lithium Ion that we might not have been as strong because we were a bit later in coming out with our full line of our Lithium Ion products, but overall, our DeWalt business held pretty well, and with the additional listings, we think we gained share.", "In the Consumer business, in our core Power Tool business we believe that we did maintain share. Our VPX launch was not quite as successful, but we did pretty well on a number of other products.", "We did lose share in our Vector, Automotive and Electronic business. I mentioned in my remarks about not having a robust new product launch for this year. We still like that category very much, but it's going to take us awhile since we made the acquisition to gear up our new products machine in that business. And we probably lost some market share in that.", "We might have lost a little market share - we lost some market share in the Pressure Washer business, but the overall core business we think we held share.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then if you guys could just give me the macro thoughts for where you think housing starts are going in '08 as well as remodelling that is underlying your sales assumption. Thank you.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, we don't believe that we're going to see any recovery in 2008. We're assuming that the housing market - you know, it deteriorated 25% this year - we're assuming probably another 10% to 15% in 2008, and hopefully a recovery the following year in 2009.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "And to the remodelling question, Ken, we expect the remodelling market to be down mid single digits year-on-year.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "If you guys are off by 10% on the new side, what do you think the negative operating leverage is in terms of EPS? That's it, final question.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "You mean housing down another 10%, so down 20% instead of - ", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Correct. Correct.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Well, you can do the math, as we've talked about in the past. You know, we think about 15% to 20% of our sales are tied to housing, so you can work that math through. If you end up with an additional 10% decline in housing, you've probably got another couple of points of pressure in our top line. And if you generally look at our economics, we tend to drop through in operating income 25% to 30% of reduction in sales.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "And we factored that into the forecast and range that we've given you on our guidance.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, good. Thank you for that clarification.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Good morning.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "First question, in 2007 you had relative strength in Europe compared to both your professional and consumer businesses in the U.S., so my question was, how are your forecasts in each of those areas, geographically speaking, for 2008, and would that leave you susceptible to a further slowing down overseas?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "We had an excellent year as you saw by the numbers and in my remarks for 2007 in Europe and Latin America. In fact, everywhere outside the United States was very strong, and that continued throughout the year. ", "We did see some slowing in Europe near the end of the year in the fourth quarter, and I think generally we're seeing some slowing in Europe at the beginning of this year.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "I guess my question was have you factored in a slowdown in Europe into your outlook for '08?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "We have.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Yes, we have. I know if we look at our numbers for 2008, while we continue to expect growth outside the United States, we're certainly expecting growth at a lower rate than we saw in 2007.", "Two factors are obviously - one is the slowing economies outside the U.S., but as well, obviously, we'll have tougher comps as well. ", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Next question was on just I guess a follow up on what Mike was asking earlier about commodity costs.", "If I just listen to some of the things you're describing, I think in Hardware and Home Improvement you described a slowing of direct commodity cost impact, but obviously you still have the wave of component stuff such as batteries ahead of you.", "Do you kind of think about the wave of - the way that commodity costs have hit you, materials costs have hit you - that sounds to me like the stuff that hits you in a quicker timeframe, direct commodities, are beginning to wane whereas the stuff that hits you at a later stage such as components is still ahead of us here.", "Does that tell us that we're getting closer to the end of the kind of impact of commodities and materials costs on your earnings?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "I think your conclusion is correct. The $120 million, just to give you some background, if you look at the $120 million of inflation, component inflation, that we're talking about, about half of that is commodity driven, mostly batteries, so it'd be mostly seen in our Power Tools and Accessories business. Then that 50% is split between a weaker currency, U.S. currency, the strength in the Chinese yuan as well as VAT. ", "So again, those are side components from pure commodities, but to your point here, we're starting to see commodities flatten, and if you'd look at the inflation that we're seeing here, it is predominantly in the first half of the year. Of that $120\u00a0million, three-quarters of that we'll experience during the first half of the year, and we'll have anniversaried a lot of these increases and it will start to wane in the back half of the year.", "So obviously we need to see where commodities go from here, but as an example, one of the underlying challenges in that area has been nickel. I guess as well, lead. Those have come off their peak so as we negotiate our contracts for the latter part of 2008, there's a potential productivity opportunity there, again depending on where those commodities go.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, great. And final question, on your guidance, given that the last two years things have turned out to be worse than you had forecasted at the beginning of the year, would you say that you took a more conservative tact this year, kind of given current conditions, or was it similar in terms of the approach you took in the past two years?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "I think we've become a bit more conservative, but we think that's reflective of the marketplace that we're in right now, too.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim of Banc of America Securities.", "Mike Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, this is Mike Wood. ", "In the Hardware and Home Improvement segment, can you give us some more color on the change in sales growth since the third quarter? Was that driven by just market conditions or was there a price increase attempted in the fourth quarter that led to the decline in sales, and could you just talk about that pricing strategy going forward in that segment?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, it was not a price strategy or price increase that affected sales. It was the general economic environment that we had.", "Our pricing philosophy is we watch the market very closely. Right now, we don't anticipate our competition raising prices - I'm talking specifically Power Tools right now - and so we've assumed about flat price for the year in 2008.", "We'll look for opportunities in our other businesses, wherever we can take price, and we'll do so whenever we can.", "We have had some success in price with our businesses other than Power Tools. We did have a price increase in Power Tools a year ago. We gave part of that back because of competitive reasons, but we were able to get price in our other two segments.", "Mike Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Great. And in Europe and the other international markets, are there any new product rollouts there or new markets that could help accelerate growth in '08?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "We've got some very aggressive and good product that will be rolled out in our international markets, and so we're going to have a very strong new product year in our international businesses.", "Mike Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor if Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Yes. Good morning, everyone.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Good morning.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "First question, just on HHI in the locksets, you mentioned in the press release that you'd seen some unfavorable mix, but in your prepared remarks you talked as well about some of the newer products doing well.", "Was it just weakness within the good, better, best line up than was favorably offset by the new products, or how did that mix in HHI shake out?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "It was some of our lower margin businesses that just didn't sell quite as well, so that did have some impact on us.", "But generally we think it's the economic impact on locksets. That business does a lot of business in new construction and that hit us in that business.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. Secondly, working capital for 2008, how should we think about this - source, use?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "I think in terms of thinking through the year, David, just think relatively flat, maybe a small use. And we had some real favourability in working capital with receivables and as well payables and accruals, which would not expect to continue here into 2008 in terms of a source of cash so, again, timing of sales will impact that. ", "Obviously, it was a relatively weak fourth quarter so receivables did not grow. And we had a relatively weak or low payable and accrual period during the fourth quarter of 2006, so we had some favourability on that. I would not expect necessarily any favourability in payables or accruals in '08 year end to '07 year end.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then just a couple small points. Latin America, you talked about a positive 20%. Was that an industry number? I know your number was 20%. Was the industry up about that or did you gain share there?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "We clearly gained share in Latin America and have done so now for three years in a row.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay. What was the industry number, do you know?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "It probably was in single digits.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Single digits. And then finally, Fasteners, what percentage of your revenues are in China?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "It's still a relatively low percentage of our overall sales. That's still an emerging market. We've got a good presence there. We've got the infrastructure there to take advantage of it when it turns around.", "We're also selling a very premium price product in that market with our DeWalt business and we need to wait for that market to evolve before we have the kind of growth that we'll eventually have there.", "But it's relatively a small piece of our business in China itself.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good morning, gentlemen. Just three quick questions, if I might.", "You noted a lower pension expense for '08, and I noticed that your post-retirement liabilities line went down meaningfully sequentially from Q3. Can you help, Mike, with respect to what you're expecting for pension expense in '08 versus '07?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Yeah, it should be down about $20 million year-on-year, so it should be a $20\u00a0million favorable impact on 2008.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Second question, on your corporate adjustments and eliminations line on the segment disclosure, if I back out - I'm guessing the remediation charge went through that line in the op inc side. If I back that out, it looks like your op inc for the corporate line was a positive in the quarter, and it's normally fairly negative, obviously, with overhead.", "If my math holds, why would that have occurred this quarter?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "As you know, I think as we've talked about in the past, Sam, that we're trying to, I guess, mark-to-market relative to allocations that are made to operations, so one of the things that benefited that quarter, to your point, which would have shown absent environmental not to be favourable, we reversed some incentive accruals that would have been in the operations numbers given the lower performance during 2007. ", "And as well, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we had some environmental reserve increases. If you take that environmental increase out for the onetime item, we actually have some favourability year-on-year due to environmental.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "How should we look at that line for '08, then, throughout the course of the year in aggregate?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "If you adjust out here for 2007, that number's about $76 million. You'll see some increases in that during 2008. You should plan around an $85 million number.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay, last question.", "I think we had heard some rumblings that there were some management changes in DeWalt Europe. Can you address how that structure looks now from a managerial standpoint?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Les Ireland, who's been running that business now for several years, continues to do a great job, and we've got a good strong team around him.", "We did lose the head of our industrial business, and so we did lose him and a couple of his team.", "But overall, we've got a good strong bench, and we think we've got a very strong organization in Europe to continue the results there.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good morning.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Hi, Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Hey, can you talk a little bit about - you commented about the DeWalt share wins from 2007. Can you talk about how things are going in 2008 as you look at listings and you look at share competition? Obviously, the competitive environment's changed, a bit of competitive set has changed a little bit. But just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that area.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "DeWalt, we continue to hold our listings, and we are - you know, our listing is in very, very good shape, but all of our major competitors are in our DeWalt area. ", "As I mentioned, we did lose some of our Pressure Washing listings, the very low end, very low margin. There comes a point where, if we just can't get a good return on that business, we're not going to reduce it to levels where it just doesn't make sense for us, so we did lose some very low end, very low profit if profit at all in the Pressure Washer business.", "But overall, our listings have held pretty well.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay, so the assumption for '08 implied here is that pretty stable listings - no gains, no losses of substance?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Yes.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay. And then secondly, is there any change going on within mix that you're seeing within the North American Power Tool business? Is there any trading down going on, or is there any need for you to be more aggressive with price or promotional support in this environment?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, there's - we call it the big middle. If you look at serious do-it-yourselfers to the low end of the pro business, there is - you know, that big middle continues to grow, and we believe that we've got a very aggressive, effective plan that we'll be rolling out this year to address that opportunity.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic of Robert Baird.", "John Houseltron - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning. It's actually [John Houseltron] for Pete. Just couple questions for you.", "First off, on the battery cost side, is that - I mean, you mentioned kind of lead and nickel costs as things. Is it safe to assume that cost pressure is not as significant in the Lithium product line?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "We have not seen inflationary pressures on the Lithium side, that is correct.", "John Houseltron - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so as those become more of a percentage of sales, hopefully this year, that should help in some regard?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, Lithium, you know, as we've said before, the Lithium margins that we have are lower than the NiCad margins, even with the price increase, as you have with any new product that you introduce.", "And so we will expect the same evolution in costs and prices in that area. As time goes on, we think that that difference will shrink and we'll become much more closer to our NiCad margins right now.", "But we're not seeing any increase in that area. And, as you would expect, as volumes grow in everything, we should gain some cost advantage there. ", "John Houseltron - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then turning to the Woodworking market, which if I understood you right just experienced kind of the sharpest decline in the Industrial group. Wasn't that an area where you guys had pretty significant product rollouts this year, so is it something weird, the expert enthusiast, who's just off, or what's going on there? Because I thought that was an area where you guys had a pretty good product rollout this year.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "We did have a good product rollout there, but the Woodworking thing, if you just think about it, is much more related to new construction as you have cabinet shops and things like that that, you know, is for new construction.", "So we think the major falloff there was really economic related.", "John Houseltron - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so it would be safe to say within that kind of niche you probably gained share this year?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "We'll say we held share. The numbers are really hard to get on market share, and we think we're holding our own there - and in some accounts we've lost a couple of listings where we didn't have some of the new product - so overall we think we've held our own in a pretty down market.", "John Houseltron - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Hi, Ivy.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "If you could take a step back a minute and think about the outlook for margins, I think that at least, Mike, you and I have had discussions about the fact that you have a more variable cost platform today, and I think you probably would agree with some of the noise related to the VAT tax and the weak dollar and understanding commodity costs, it's hard for us to sort of understand what the opportunity would be for sort of more normalized margins. And right now, it's considerably below the threshold that we had talked about. I think you caveated your comments that - you know, with barring a recession.", "So now that we're arguably in a recession for housing, can you help us frame it and how we should think about the outlook, and then I have a follow up, please.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "As we talked about, Ivy, for the outlook here for 2008, we're expecting our margins to be around 9%. ", "That is lower than some of the numbers we've talked about in the past with 10% margins, we thought, potentially would be the floor for us. ", "I mean, two things that weren't included in that, one is an economic environment like we're seeing today and potentially we're in a recession, certainly on the housing side. And some of our ad markets are obviously very, very challenged.", "And over the last four years, we had - or including 2008 - we'll have taken on, you know, $500 million of commodity inflation. ", "So those are two factors that weren't anticipated in those numbers.", "As we go forward and as we look to 2008, we're obviously trying to balance short-term profitability with long-term capability to make sure we're continuing to invest in new products. So as a result, yeah, our margins are under some pressure here. ", "As the markets improve - and hopefully they will as we get into 2009 - we'll see some better leverage on our SG&A, we'll start growing our top line, we'll see some easing in these commodities and seeing our way back quickly to double digits I think is something clearly in the cards. ", "But we've got obviously some very significant variables here - economic conditions, you know, not only in the U.S. but globally, and as well, where do these commodities go and how weak does the dollar get and in particular, how weak is the dollar versus the Chinese currency, the Chinese yuan.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "And just to underscore, Mike, if you think about it, a $500 million commodity increase over the last four to five years, that's a pretty strong headwind.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "No question. Just a second question related to your outlook again. With respect to the performance in '08 and you've obviously used some conservative assumptions, what can happen that you would miss? ", "For example, if you look at the consumer today and we've seen slowing, is there, you know, an understanding if consumer spending or if the economy goes into a recession, what are you using for your economic backdrop in your outlook for '08 and therefore, you know, for the full year, what can therefore require that you have to adjust again downward on your expectations?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "I think the biggest variable as we look at 2008, Ivy, is to try to figure out where the top line is going to ultimately end up. ", "I think Nolan touched on a few of these in his comments as well as some of the questions, but we're looking at continued modest growth, low to low single-digit-type growth in our non-U.S. businesses, the U.S. industrial-commercial side, again, we'd expect some growth there, but when you look at some of our strong or our big end markets like U.S. housing, expecting that to be down 10% to 15%, expecting the consumer to be relatively weak, so we're seeing some negative pressure there as well. And expecting the remodelling market to be down. ", "So if those are down more severely than that, obviously that will put some more pressure on our top line, and while our gross margins probably will reasonably hang in, you know, the challenge is some of the SG&A de-leveraging. ", "And if we find ourselves well into 2008 and the outlook isn't beginning to improve for 2009, we'll have to take a look at some additional costs here that we'll have to ratchet back on to reposition the business in light of the market opportunity.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Can you just be a little bit more specific, though, with respect to your assumptions? I think I heard you correctly that maybe new construction would be down 10% to 15% in '08, and what your quantified expectations would be for Repair and Remodel in your assumptions, please?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Our Repair and Remodel markets are expecting to be down around 5%. ", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Okay.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "In the mid single digits, as we talked about earlier.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "And the new construction was 10% to 15%, is that correct?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "That's correct.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "And then lastly and I'll let others ask, just on inventories, I think, Nolan, you mentioned going into the quarter, you know, your customers especially in the retail channel were more conservative in orders on inventories. Can you just give us an update in the last several weeks how the inventory picture looks, specifically at the home centers?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, we think the inventories are in reasonable shape, other than the inventory I mentioned in HHI, but that's our inventory, that's not the dealers' inventory. So we think they're in reasonable shape, but our customers are very, very cautious about POS and order levels and all of that, so the kind of cautiousness that we saw in the fourth quarter has continued in the first quarter.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Right. Thank you very much.", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "And we have factored that into the range in guidance that we've given you.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut of J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Yes, hi. Thanks.", "First question, just on going back to '08 for a moment, I think you had mentioned from a share count perspective 62 million, but that was just for the first quarter or was that for the full year?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "About the first quarter and full year, Mike.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. So given the cash flow generation, I was wondering if you could just kind of give us an update on how the M&A picture is looking to you and that, you know, historically you've always said that you'd like to be able to do either internal investment or accretive bolt-ons primarily, but I think in the last year or two, prices have run up. ", "Maybe now could you talk about how - with, you know, the OBOs and markets slowing and maybe less competition from that side of the picture - how pricing is with some of those bolt-ons and overall kind of pipeline update in terms of what you're looking at?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, we have seen prices come down on potential acquisitions. It's a very different market out there, as you probably are aware, then it was even a year ago, and so we think that there are more reasonable prices and, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're hopeful that we'll be able to find some bolton acquisitions that are financially compelling. And so we continue to be very active at looking at businesses that we think can be accretive and financially compelling. ", "On the other hand, the competing piece of that is that our stock price is at a level right now that's also very, very attractive. And we'll try to balance those two to make sure that we spend that cash that would drive our stock price the best possible way.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. I mean, you know, looking at maybe the longer-than-expected product revamp that you had with Delta and Porter-Cable to some extent and the difficulties with Vector, are you more inclined to try and continue to reap the benefits out of those businesses by focusing internally and more look primarily at the share repurchase, or are there still just some interesting bolt-ons that you feel you'd be compelled to do if the price was right? ", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, if it's financially compelling and it's an attractive business, we'll clearly look at that, but what we try to do is balance the two. And we've got a low stock price right now that's very, very attractive. We continue to generate significant cash flow. But if we find - you know, what we need to do now is balance this very low compelling stock price that we have with more moderate prices in the businesses that we're looking at to acquire. And I think we've done a reasonably good job of balancing those.", "Despite not achieving the top line growth that we'd like to have seen in some of the acquired businesses - let's outboard Vector for just a minute because we've got some special issues with Vector right now, short-term with that - we've come in where we've said we would come in on the bottom line with the acquisitions that we have made.", "And so we're very pleased with the ones that we have made to date, and they have contributed like we forecasted that they would.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Just lastly, a couple of operating line items, clarification.", "If it's possible to give some degree - I know you kind of mentioned that you didn't want to give a full kind of breakout of the charges, but just a rough idea of how that $19 million splits across Power Tools and Hardware, and is it, you know, more driven by headcount versus some manufacturing capacity changes?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "About 50:50 between the two.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And, you know, the corporate, excluding the environmental charge would have been up slightly. I was wondering, you know, typically maybe that's down, you know, that's a net negative of $10 to $15 million a quarter, give or take. Were there some one-time benefits in that as well?", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Mike, we had talked about this a few minutes ago.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "I'm sorry.", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Yeah. A benefit of reversing some incentive accruals that we in the operating numbers that are controlled here at corporate, and as well we had some favourability outside this environmental charge. In our environmental comparison, we had some significant increase in reserves in the fourth quarter of 2006 for environmental which did not recur in the fourth quarter of 2007 absent the onetime charge.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Last question I want to sneak in, just bigger picture, with VPX, you know, maybe not meeting your expectations, and Nolan, you had mentioned that perhaps you lost a little bit of share in cordless and some of the Lithium Ion areas and that was an area of focus for you as well, what do you feel, you know, maybe went wrong or that you weren't expecting when you kind of set out earlier this year to launch those lines or market those lines? And what do you plan to do to perhaps reverse some of those trends that kind of went against you unexpectedly in the back half of this year?", "Nolan D. Archibald - Chairman, President and CEO", "Well, on VPX, it is a brand-new platform for us. It's a very high-priced Lithium product, and in this economic environment, you know, to come out at Christmas with the launch of this right here, it was a very high-priced item, and we think that that high price in a touch economic environment when people are really watching what they're spending, that that had to have some effect on our VPX.", "In our Lithium, we were just late in coming to market with our Lithium line. But if you look at our Lithium line right now, with 36 volt, 28 volt, 18, we believe that we've got the most comprehensive, best line up of anybody in the industry as we now move into 2008.", "We also have the best chemistry and, you know, if you look at our engineering capability and how we have been right historically on our product, we believe that the marketplace will eventually recognize the superior chemistry we have in our Lithium Ion technology, particularly when it comes to the recharging of batteries. I mean, we get more cycle life by far than any of our competition, and you're starting to see that in the marketplace by the return of some of our competitors when you're not getting the cycle life with their batteries.", "So we believe we have the best chemistry and the most comprehensive line up in 36, 28 and 18 of anyone in the industry that will prove to our benefit as we move to 2008 and beyond.", "With that, I think we've come to the end of our Q&A, and those of you who would like to ask additional questions, if you'll just contact us, we'll do that one on one with you.

My name is Matthew and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Stanley Works Fourth Quarter earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "I would now like to introduce Gerry Gould, VP of Investor Relations. I will turn the call over to him at this time. Thank you. Mr. Gould, you may begin your conference.", "Gerry Gould - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay. Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, everybody.", "On the call this morning with me are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Loree, our Executive VP and CFO.", "We have two press releases out in that I refer to the 4Q update and initial \u201908 guidance we issued on January 7, and then the fourth quarter results and \u201908 guidance we issued this morning, both on our website. Also our PowerPoint presentation is on the website. We will refer to these charts as we go along. We have got PDF version out there about 20 minutes ago.", "John and Tim will review the results and then we will have a Q&A period following. The either call last about an hour. There will be replay available beginning at 1 PM today through the end of the day Saturday which is February 2. The replay number is 800-642-1687. You did need a code for the replay which is 30996508, and after it will remain on our site.", "You can call me with questions at 860-827-3833. And we just have two quick announcements, the first regarding Reg G. We issue an update our earnings guidance on an annual basis in our press release. At the beginning of the quarter, and we cannot comment upon and thereafter. If it changes materially, we would issue a press release and conduct a call.", "And secondly, certain statements contained in this discussion by the various Stanley participants are forward-looking statements. They are based on assumptions on future events that may not prove to be accurate; as such they involve risks and uncertainty. And actual results may differ materially from those expected or implied. So, we direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K, which we filed with today's release and then our recent 34 Act filings.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Gerry. Good morning everybody.", "What I am going to do is touch on some of the 2007 full year as well as fourth quarter highlights. Then turn it over to Jim Loree. Jim is going to go through some of our progress on cash flow, provide a little more detail, drill a littler deeper into the segments, and talk about some of our recent repurchase activity as well as 2008 guidance.", "The 2007, in general, and the fourth quarter, in particular, I think provides us some pretty good evidence on the merits of our ongoing portfolio diversification As you know that started arguably five years ago, certainly started to gain traction about four years ago, and it continues to reduce our volatility that enabled us to achieve sales earnings as well as cash flow growth due in part to a higher European and industrial and security content in the obvious lower dependence on the construction and DIY markets, which we have heard for the last six months are fairly weak in North America.", "Looking quickly, revenues $4.5 billion, up 12%, 26% increase in operating margin and Jim\u2019s going to get into the drivers at that. 15% EPS growth, 25% growth in EBITDA, we are quite pleased with our cash flow, both from an operating cash flow perspective as well as free cash flow. All of these numbers on this page are in the release and in the appended financial statements. But to say the least we were far from disappointed, in fact we are quite pleased with these results in light of the market conditions, particularly North America where we compete throughout 2007.", "Looking at the fourth quarter financial results, good solid revenue growth and I am going to provide more details on it in the next slide. But revenue growth at 15%, earnings per share of a $1.04 in fourth quarter \u201906 increasing to a $1.11, a 7% increase, 16% increase without the check\u2026 check win that I am going to touch on in a minute. Just as it relates to guidance we normally don\u2019t spend a lot of time talking about how we performed versus guidance, but in October of \u201907 we were out with a $1.10 to a $1.15.", "Given some of the\u2026 much of the uncertainty out in the market, we did provide updated guidance even though there was not a material change in our business which historically is not our custom, but we updated our guidance to a $1.06 to a $1.11 as Jerry suggested in early January. The $0.04 was simply reflection of $0.04 of settlements of some legal issues for which at the time we saw no offsets, and as you can see from the results we came in at the very top end of our revised guidance, or in fact right in the middle of our initial guidance. So, throughout the volatility, very little change really attesting to the strength at least in our view of where we are. Nice accretion in operating margin of 600 basis points in the quarter, the tax rate up to 21.3%, that was within our guidance range but that was about $0.09 worth of EPS headwind versus prior year. Our share count on average was about the same in the quarter, down 600,000 shares but as Jim will touch on later we did refer to just about a $100 million worth of stock in the fourth quarter, and another $100 million in the first quarter not included in this share count. So, earnings growth was consistent with our guidance that we provided in October, as well as updated in early January.", "Looking at a little more detail the fourth quarter revenues, again the 15% improvement, the sources of growth are pretty straight forward. Volume was 1% globally. Price was 1% for 2% organic growth and I\u2019m going to talk a little bit more about that on the next slide.", "But in terms of the price that 1% gave us about 75% inflation recovery for the year. Where early on in the year in our calls, in our annual guidance which was $4 and that\u2019s where we finished. We assumed about $60 million of commodities inflation. Our best estimate at the end of the year, we absorbed about $67 million, so it was a pretty accurate estimate. The difference between the $60 million and $67 million was the overwhelming majority of that difference was the elimination of value added tax rebate reductions from China\u2026 resulting increase. So, we had a pretty good handle on that at the beginning of the year, there were obviously some foots and calls but the good news is of the $67 million that we felt that we absorbed, pricing covered three quarters of it so more of our productivity could fall to the bottom line. And lead to our margin expansion.", "Currency added 5%, about 35% of our revenues are outside the U.S. the majority of that is in Europe and acquisitions added another 8%, the biggest single piece there was HSM.", "Looking real quickly at the segments you see construction, DIY flat on an organic basis, up 5% in total for the fourth quarter that\u2019s primarily the inclusion of Besco Pneumatic, our strategic Taiwanese and Chinese tool manufacturer that we purchased mid year. Really strong performance in our industrial segments, both from an organic perspective, Jim\u2019s going to provide more detail on that but both automotive repair, automotive and industrial tools as well as our engineered solutions businesses performed well, 15% in total the difference being primarily attributable to our InnerSpace acquisition. That\u2019s industrial storage included from mid year on. Security, 1% organic in total as strong performance in the mechanical business offset some negative growth in the legacy of conversion security solutions business, and of course is that we are placing on the Stanley Fulfillment system which has taken place really over the last 12 months or so. We talked about it briefly on the March 8,analyst meeting. Second the winter inventory position that we have now comes at an excellent time given the uncertain economic outlook in the slowing world economy. Thirdly the improvements are based on process improvement and not some sort of a tactical or knee jerk reaction to bringing inventories down and they do not come at the expense of customer service levels which is very important. And then finally the extra cash that we generated from our fourth quarter working capital improvement totaled $86 million and that helped fund our ability to do another $100 million share re-purchase in the first few weeks of 2008.", "So moving on to the cash flow statement. As I discussed working capital clearly was one of the key catalysts in the fourth quarter, you can see the $86 million there. We were also aided by strong depreciation and amortization and strong net income. We had a total operating cash flow of $218 million and free cash flow of $186 million. On the right hand side for the total year, free cash flow was a record $457 million, the big story here in addition to working capital was depreciation and amortization and this is increasingly becoming a huge cash generator for us. All that intangible amortization that\u2019s come from the four, five years of acquisitions now totals about $160 million a year that we add to the net income and then on top of that we had a good working capital improvement of $31 million given the sales growth that we experienced. And what you don\u2019t see on the page here is about $60 million of cash out which would be in that other line related to severance and mostly from the Facom acquisition, a good portion of which is not likely to recur in \u201908 and that should help our center prospective basis.", "All of that yielded a record free cash flow which exceeded our forecast of $400 million to $450 million which we introduced on March 8th back in New York and the $457 million gives us a good, solid platform to go into \u201908 with. When you look at cash flow form a longer term perspective clearly the \u201907 performance caps a string of really strong cash flow performances over the last ten years or so. And this performance has really been a result of the portfolio transformation that John talked about in recent years and interestingly of the transformation itself has both been an enabler of ongoing growth as well as a kind of a manifestation of that portfolio shift and so it\u2019s a virtuous circle so to speak and as we look at \u201908 our expectation is for $500 million plus of free cash flow and a continuation of this strong performance. And as I said it should be doable because we have a good, strong net income and lower restructuring and then the benefits of Stanley Fulfillment System should continue to appear in the cash flow statement. So, very, very strong position going into \u201908 from a cash perspective.", "Just a brief comment or two on the portfolio shift, we have covered this before, but we have been able to achieve 16% average annual growth since \u201902 growing the revenues from $2.6 billion to $4.5 billion. And the company is no longer dominated by the construction and DIY market. In fact the US portion is about 25% versus 50% just 5 years ago. And as John indicated this certainly is fortuitous for us in this weak United States construction DIY market environment. And what we have here is a company that also, their largest, our largest customer is only 8% of revenues today versus 22% a few years ago and our dependence on the US home centers and mass merchants is greatly reduced down to below 20% from about 40% in 2002. We have a larger, more depressed company and a stronger company to stand up to some of the pressures that we are encountering from an external perspective. And now we will go through the segments in a little more detail as John indicated.", "The construction in DIY segment had an okay performance from a revenue perspective and a good one when you consider the degree of difficulty in the environment. Segment profit was down 8% and our segment profit rate was down 190 basis points.", "Now, notably $3 million of the $5 million segment profit decline is associated with the legal matters that John discussed in the quarter. So that would be kind of a one off if you will. But clearly the US was adversely impacted by the residential construction market issues. In fact, the US construction DIY was down about 4% but the rest of the world was a great story. The sales were up 19%, continued to be strong in the wake of the strong third quarter performance and here we had some benefits from an ongoing wave of new product introductions in Europe, Canada, Australia, Latin America and Asia and outstanding execution in those areas and a little help from decent economic environments from most of those places.", "The segment profit rate as I mentioned in addition to the $3 million decline related to legal matters was also somewhat suppressed by unfavorable product mix within the consumer tools and storage business and therein we had a mix towards consumer storage both plastic and metal storage and you can imagine plastic and metal storage, the plastic being affected by the rise in prices related to oil and the metal being affected by the strong Canadian currency as we ship those products from Canada into the US. And there was also a currency benefit significant in this segment however, these\u2026 the constructions DIY business also had a significant inventory reduction. So, this is true for the total company but it is also true for the construction DIY segment, the benefits of the currency in the quarter were significant and the total for the company was $7 million and it was a couple of million for the CDIY segment, but the inventory is coming down from a P&L perspective basically offset that so, there\u2019s really no significant impact from currency when you factor in the inventory reductions.", "Moving on to industrial, here we have a terrific story, revenues up 15% as John indicated, the segment profit up double that 31% with almost 200 basis point increase in the segment profit rate. When you break it down into the sub-segments if you will, the industrial and automotive repair tools part of it, which is your Facom Mac Proto piece, that was up 11% of which 5% was organic. Proto had a terrific quarter up 17% revenues without any acquisitions, there was some share gain, there was some customers buying ahead of price increases, price increase effective in January of 3% and there was also some good market strength as in particular the petrochemical demand continues playing into one of our strengths in Proto. And Facom although it was a little bit less in terms of organic growth than they encountered in the third quarter still had a strong organic performance netting out currency, they were up 2%. Engineered Solutions, terrific quarter, up 15% organic and up almost 30% with the acquisition of InnerSpace, we encountered double-digit growth in all three of the elements Industrial Storage, Assembly and Hydraulics. Each driven by good gains in product innovation as well as decent end markets. And then the segment profit range within Industrial increased as well and here we saw the result of what I would consider excellent execution in the area of price realization and productivity with price offsetting inflation and then productivity basically following through and in Stanley we have a very robust process for tracking inflation and making sure that the price increases are implemented on or about at the same pace and the idea here is to try to offset the inflation with pricing cuts, stay ahead of the curve as much as possible and we have very good market intelligence from our sourcing organizations about when those inflationary costs are coming through, how much they are and there would be sourcing people on the\u2026", "Operations people work hand in hand with the marketing folks to make sure that they\u2019re armed with the data to go to their customers in real time and implement price increases. It\u2019s easier in industrial than it is in construction in DIY. That\u2019s why our price inflation recovery is about 100%, slightly above industrial in the fourth quarter. Whereas it was much, much lower in construction DIY, say less than 50%. But still we have that process throughout the company and you can see the benefits clearly in industrial.", "Security also had a fantastic quarter, with revenues up 30 % on the strength of the HSM acquisition. Segment profit was up 44% and our profit rate was again up almost 200 basis points. Mechanical access really strong, 8% revenue growth despite the Home Depot hardware loss. Of that 8%, 4% was organic; the other 4% was smaller acquisitions. The hardware loss in Home Depot cost us $10 million of revenue in the quarter. As John said, if we had benefited from it, from a delay in the loss of that business during the previous quarters. It really hit us in the fourth quarter. We expected it. That was the good news. But it had a five-point impact on organic growth in mechanical and a couple of points on the total segment.", "Convergent, HSM performed very well. HSM had 11% organic growth performance; if you consider it, consider that on a pro forma basis as if we owned HSM in the fourth quarter of last year, even though we didn\u2019t. So, they executed well. We continue to have the negative pressure from our business model change that is taking place in the U.S. systems integration business. But this is a very good thing because we're shedding unprofitable business and it cost us 50% negative organic growth in the legacy USSI business in the quarter. However, we have basically one or two more quarters to go anniversary out of that and the business we're taking on today is very profitable business. Much more similar to HSM\u2019s business, with a nice recurring revenue content as well.", "The segment profit increase was also driven by price realization as well as the realization of the HSM synergies and good strong productivity projects within the mechanical access business. So, all of that goodness allowed us to because a little bit more active in terms of repurchasing shares. As you know in November and December of \u201907 we repurchased 2 million. In May of \u201907 we repurchased 1.7 million and with the depressed price levels in the early days of January of this year we repurchased another 2.2 million. So, in the last 12 months or so we've spent now $300 million on share repurchases at an average price of $51.70. With this most recent repurchase, the shares outstanding have dipped slightly below $80 million fully diluted shares. Our total debt at the end of the year was about $1.5 billion. If we take the $100 million that we spent on the share repurchases, probably now closer to $1.6 billion as we said here today. And at $47 a share or so, the company is trading for an enterprise value of about $5.3 billion with \u201807 EBITDA of about $694 million, that would be about 7.6 times trailing EBITDA. So, when you look at the value inherent that we see in the stock, hence the attractiveness or buying back shares at this time. And as we move now to 2008 guidance this is nothing new here, this is all reaffirmation of what we introduced in the early days of January, when we pre announced our fourth quarter as well as updated our \u201908 guidance and as most folks on the call know, we are no longer providing quarterly guidance, we announced that over a year ago. And so this is the annual guidance for 2008 and the organic growth has been tempered to flat up 1% we are anticipating a very mild and short lived recession by definition and that would be in the US by definition, that would mean two quarters of negative GDP growth in the US.", "However, we do not expect it to go beyond that level of recession because the monetary and apparently the fiscal stimulus will be fairly strong coming into this year. So, hopefully this will be short lived and so that 0% to 1% growth would be consistent with how we performed in past recessions we\u2019ve done some work looking at it, typically will be a flattish to maybe up or down a point during a recession and we might have two quarters of negative a couple quarters of negative growth during the year where that, organic growth, where that occurred.", "As far as other assumptions related to sales growth we\u2019re looking for to do some acquisitions. We haven\u2019t built anything in to the guidance obviously we\u2019re looking for a share count of about 82 million shares which anticipates a nominal share creep and no new repurchase although we are not ruling repurchases out at this point in time. We have our free cash flow expectation of around $500 million. We have about $100 million-ish kind of a dividend and there\u2019s $400 million to work with to keep within our ratings. Roughly to keep within our ratings profile we spent $100 million of it so there\u2019s $300 million left to spend and we\u2019ll be looking at acquisitions, we\u2019ll be looking at share repurchases and we\u2019ll make whatever informed judgments that we deem appropriate at the time.", "As far as inflation goes, we had a very consistent track record in \u201907 of predicting inflation, we certainly anticipate that to continue into \u201908. We're looking for about $75 million of inflation including currency EVRR [ph] all those sorts of things. We\u2019ll get about 80% of that back and recovered in price we believe it this time. Similar to our \u201907 performance we expect to generate another $70 million or so in productivity. Our SG&A would probably be a slightly increase in dollars versus \u201907 and a slightly, very slightly increase perhaps in percent of sales, if that sales forecast comes to fruition as it will increase slightly faster than in all likely hood than the sales growth with it\u2019s tempered sales outlook. And I mentioned free cash flow already and the tax rate we\u2019re looking for a similar tax rate in \u201908 that we experienced in \u201907 and I think we are very well positioned for some. Earnings growth despite a very challenging market environment.", "With that I will turn it back over to Q&A. Matthew we are ready to take questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Pete?", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Can you hear me?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes Pete we hear you now.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Ok sorry. Jim I was intrigued I guess by your comments on Facom with the growth slowing, looks like you have kind of a mid to high single-digit for the past couple of quarters and then down to two. Can you give us a sense as to what your expectations for the European economy might look like for \u201908. The slowing growth of Facom is something that we ought to be incrementally concerned about or just kind of what\u2019s your thought there?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think the Facom growth was not a\u2026 earlier in the year was not a direct result of any economic boom over in Europe. Clearly there was one point higher of GDP growth than we typically had been experiencing in Europe over the last X number of years and Facom and GDP would be expected to track fairly closely. So, I think, the growth was more a function of the Facom folks joining a company that was willing to fund new product introductions and was a real tool company and there was some revenue synergies that we talked about that we", "didn\u2019t anticipate in our financial forecast for Facom when we bought the company. And all those things were positive but the comps are getting tougher and yes I think the likelihood of the economy maintaining that slightly higher than historical GDP growth in the context of a US slowdown is not very high. And so we have tempered our growth outlook on a prospective basis for Facom. We are looking at probably something closer to flat to up a point or so for Facom as we go forward.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay great. Thanks on that one and then the follow-up question I guess. The working capital obviously was quite strong in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just wondering how sustainable is this working capital improvement through the fulfillment system and another way of asking the question might be you have a longer term target or there is something there that would encourage us to say, this is sustainable, this is where Stanley is going in terms of working cap?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes Pete, I am going to start and Jim will take it. We\u2019d like to think it\u2019s sustainable and we are not going to put a specific longer term target up there other than to say, the Stanley Fulfillment System is all about continuous improvement. We\u2019ve been working, I don\u2019t want to say quietly behind the scenes but working very hard, focusing each and every one of our business unit leaders on, among other things working capital efficiency and working capital improvement and as you are probably aware a meaningful piece of every P&L owner\u2019s compensation is based on measurable improvement in working capital turns on an annual basis. At the corporate level we are measuring on cash flow and the business unit level it is on working capital turns. So, simply said it will be continuous improvement. We have been working on it a while, I think the fourth quarter we really began to gain some traction and saw the first tangible results of that. Jim you might want to add something.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I think that\u2019s\u2026 its very consistent with what I would say as well. The only thing I would add is that inventories were the star of the show in the fourth quarter and will continue to put upward pressure on the working capital turns through our process improvements in from a Stanley Fulfillment System. What we would like to see in \u201908 and beyond is a continuation of the inventory improvements\u2026 continuation of the payables improvements which have been now in place for about two years and then the beginning of some improvements in receivables as well and that would be something that we are working on very diligently and I believe that there is some opportunity there, receivables are $800 million, North of $800 million and clearly there is some process improvement opportunities there. Perhaps not as much as in inventories because they are dictated by terms and terms have to be negotiated in their economic tradeoffs that one makes but there is a lot of waste in receivables in any company that doesn\u2019t have fully standardized processes and a process focus and Stanley\u2019s history with all of acquisitions and everything and it certainly left some opportunities on the table so I think we will se a broader based working capital improvement as we go through \u201808 but we certainly won\u2019t let up on inventories or payables.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Radbourne Atlantic Equities.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Richard.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. This is actually Joe Herick with Gutermine[ph] Research. A couple of questions. You guys talked about continuous improvements a while ago", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "What firm?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hello.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "What firm are you with?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Joe Herick with Gutermine [ph] Research. You guys talked earlier about continuous improvement initiatives. Regarding your operational initiative what are you guys doing regarding lean manufacturing, TPN to Six Sigma and how do you expect them to affect the bottom line?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The end your question was how to what about the bottom line?", "Unidentified Analyst", "How are you expecting looking at Lean manufacturing, Six Sigma within your operational plans and how do you expect them to--?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Listen, we\u2019ve reviewed that at great length on previous calls. Lean, Six Sigma et cetera are tools, they are not processes within themselves that are going to contribute to improved working capital efficiency as well as margin accretion and we will take that offline to the extent we need to but we have got 19 people in the queue and don\u2019t want to spend any more time on that on this particular call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with Merrill Lynch.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Ken. Good morning.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "If you can update us on the status of Bostitch given that it\u2019s such a large business and I know the margins, You guys had expected them to go up roughly100 basis points sequentially in \u201907 and into \u201908. Can you tell us where we were or refresh us at the beginning of \u201906, end of \u201907 and what your expectations are?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Basically I can\u2019t, as we have said on several occasions. Bostitch was in terms of margin and performance, the business was shrinking due to a combination of market and us consciously shedding unprofitable business, up to 5% even arguably approaching 10% of revenues although some of that will get back. They will load mid single digit operating margins at the end\u2026 by the end of \u201806. What we said we would like to do is March from about four to 12 in the course of eight quarters, on average 100 basis points a quarter, I mean the state quarter spends a 100 basis points getting us to 12. What we also said is that we wouldn\u2019t be perfectly linear. We can\u2019t say by the end of the year without providing more detail than we intend to for all of \u201907. They made a nice sequential improvement. Fourth quarter was a bit of a setback. That been said there were three things\u2026two things going on that are really difficult to isolate. As you know we had a about$ 4 million\u2026 $3.7 million charge that hit above our P&L. That\u2019s easy to isolate, unfavorable product liability litigation but it did show up in the Bostitch numbers. We had the preliminary implications of the anti-dumping legislation that in some cases increased costs, but the flip side of that gave the opportunity to improve prices. No telling where that will settle out in the short-term. But it was too upsetting factors for Bostitch. And then third. The business is 75% North American\u2026 in North American at least half of that residential construction related and that\u2019s a tough business. So they got a lot of market headwind. Long answer to a simple question. We're happy with where we are in manufacturing restructuring. We have our Besco pneumatic that we purchased. We've very successfully closed our Chihuahua plant. Ramping up in Langfang we have world-class production on three continents. North America, Poland and China and we're still cautiously optimistic about the future of that business. But there are tremendous marketplace uncertainties that are tempering our optimism.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. And I remind you there\u2019s one additional clarification on the guidance I wanted to make relative to the anti-dumping decision that was made by the department of commerce. And that is that the inflation and the price information that I actually gave you, excludes the anti-dumping impact because it\u2019s been, it has been happening in real time, happened last week, late last week, in terms of the decision and we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to fully wet it although we believe that it\u2019s going to be essentially a neutral to a slightly positive, very slightly positive for us for the year from a financial perspective. So, we're not excluding it because it\u2019s a negative or anything like that. We're simply excluding it because we don\u2019t have accurate numbers for the price inflation impact related to it and you can imagine it at a 30, 29 point something, 29.6% I think it is percent. Tariff and many of our nails that we import from China as well as all the other nails that are imported from China ranging anywhere from, in the low teens of percentage up to 110% and so our competitors are going to experience, in many cases the same type of impact if not worse and from a strategic perspective it really, I think, is a positive for us. A very big positive for the Bostitch business because it\u2019s\u2026 this business has really had to compete in a very, very unfair environment over the last couple of years as the Chinese startups have been dumping these nails into our country and certainly the punitive tariffs that were put in place, especially the ones that are North of 30% are really going to change and they are going to level the playing field, we hope and on top of that we have the most diverse manufacturing base of nail manufacturing of all our competitors. With manufacturing in Eastern Europe, North America and China and we have the flexibility to move production around from place to place as the economics of producing the\u2026 cost economics of producing change so we actually hail the advent of this anti dumping issue. I think it is going to be kind of a real positive for the business on a go forward basis.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Give a follow up Kim?", "Stephen Kim - Citigroup", "I do I appreciate the expansion of that as well Jim. The consumer margins, just to focus on this, I think that\u2019s where a lot of people do have this concern though, obviously your other 60 plus % of businesses are operating very well. The consumer business, you talked about the 190 basis points margin drop earlier related to U.S. mix and absence of price recovery. Can you talk about the mix A and B, why we see better pricing outside the US relative to the U.S.? Thank you very much.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, first of all we need to make sure that everyone the $68 million going to $63 million is a $5 million decrease in profit rate, of which 60% of which, is related to non recurring items. The legal matters, and I don\u2019t know if that was entirely clear when I said it but make sure that we understand that. And so if we added the three back to the $63 million we\u2019d be at $66 million divided by 459, am just doing math in real time here, We would be at 14.3 instead of 13.7 so we\u2019d be a 130 basis points decline so that\u2019s a piece of it.", "The mix issue itself, in the quarter it\u2019s simply one of\u2026 we were doing some refreshing of some product lines in both ZAG and our consumer storage business, and it just so happens those are our lowest margin businesses in construction DIY, and unfortunately you know that\u2019s just what happened. That would be a big piece of the remainder of the negative there, and we don\u2019t see an inherent profitability issue in this segment, on a go forward basis especially with Bostitch recovering and with construction in DIY being so strong outside the country. Now there is pricing power outside the U.S. is actually a bit higher than it is in the U.S. although not dramatically higher and that results from the fact that we are planning in many fragmented markets\u2026 much more fragmented markets from a customer prospective outside of the U.S. whether it\u2019s in Latin America, or Europe or Australia, whatever. That said there\u2019s some very large customers that wield a very significant amount of power. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about China inflation and so forth as well in our business and other businesses that were affected by China inflation and there\u2019s a lot of people getting exercised about inflation from China and how that might negatively impact these types of businesses, in particular these segments and in fact we look and again it\u2019s China inflation is more of a positive than a negative for us because the single largest competitive for Stanley Works is not another branded tool company, it\u2019s private label in the aggregate. Private label in the aggregate buys 80% to a 100% of their product from China, and with prices going up the retailers are facing pricing\u2026 unprecedented price increases and pressure from China and that just simply is a positive for us, because on a comparable basis it means that we are more competitive with our non-China manufacturing and that we are on a level playing field from a China perspective.", "Stephen Kim - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Two questions on the acquisition integration side please. First, could you bring us up to date, you talked a little bit about Facom\u2019s end markets, but in terms of the overall European industrial strategy, both from a manufacturing standpoint as well as going to market of combining the Facom and Stanley brand? Can you just give us a quick update there and secondarily with regards to the convergence business\u2026 you had alluded to it in the opening remarks in terms of as the strategy there evolves but in terms of the older lower margin business that you have been purposely changing the portfolio from. How far long are we on that and just overall how do you feel about how that convergence strategy is coming together?", "John F. Lundgren \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah Jim, it\u2019s John. I will take them both and Jim will add on if need be. First of all, in Europe in the integration, I think there\u2019s two important integrations going on if you will, backroom and front room, the strength our customer facing. From the backroom perspective, if it doesn\u2019t face the customer and end user, we are trying to do within one place, one way, we are making\u2026 at they were making great progress there including a seamless transition in leadership on the Facom side of the business. But, importantly we have no intention to combine the Stanley and Facom brands other than in emerging markets where we don\u2019t have the structure and the scale to have if you will, a dedicated sales force. So, in markets where we are spread a little thin, you do have one individual reporting jointly to the Facom and Stanley side, but in general and you know this well, Facom Is an iconic brand for professional automotive repair and industrial tools. Stanley brand in Europe is overwhelmingly construction and DIY, and we intend to keep them that way. So, we are quite pleased with the integration in terms of cost synergies, the organizations are working better, very well together, better than in fact we", "had hoped for and all we can say on that one is now we are 24 months into it, so far so good and the two businesses are working well together. The other point that Jim made on Facom is I think an important one up to the first caller to Pete Lisnic\u2019s question. The improvement in Facom revenues is a combination of great new product vitality which has always been the case but less attrition or cannibalization from the existing business and I think that is the strength of the combination. Real quickly to touch on conversion and security, Jim suggested we probably have two more quarters before some of\u2026 I will say the bad legacy business, primarily installation driven at low margins is going to filter through the system. In terms of the two organizations, again we are as pleased as we could be at this point with how well they are working together. I think everyone understands on the Stanley side, it was a little bit difficult to say, wait a minute we have just bought\u2026 excuse me\u2026 we have just bought HSM. We are doing a reverse integration but the margins speak for themselves, the business processes speak for themselves, the percent of recurring revenue speaks for themselves and I think by now they are starting to\u2026 they really are starting to behave as one team. We have got the majority of the office consolidation behind us, leadership is aligned and we are\u2026 on both those fronts we are certainly not complacent but we are on or ahead of schedule in terms of the integration and looking for some margin improvement on the legacy Stanley side going forward.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Two questions for you. First of all, the mechanical side you commented of the improved growth out of assets, it sounds like almost 10% excluding the hardware. What\u2019s driving that and what\u2019s the sustainability of that?", "John F. Lundgren \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there\u2019s a number of factors driving it. And I would say they are more related to execution and\u2026 than anything else. And the first is, and I guess I mentioned last quarter, there is a real intangible benefit to having split the mechanical and the electronic businesses. I think in reality they are quite different businesses and the issues that one has to deal with in transforming an electronic business model are very distracting to someone who is trying to go out there to do business, that is trying to go out and gain share in the electronic, I mean in the mechanical business.", "That said, I think over the last few years we have assembled a very broad based product line that covers virtually all of the important elements of a full fledged mechanical product line. Why is this important? Because in the past we were losing bids in mechanical and losing business occasionally, when competition had products in certain areas, an example of the exit devices in closers and so forth and another example which we have yet to plug but we hope to someday, that will be hollow metal doors where they would underbid one element and overbid another element of the proposal to win the business where we couldn\u2019t compete in the areas where we didn\u2019t have the business. That\u2019s virtually behind us, we have one remaining hole now which is hollow metal doors, as I mentioned. Another benefit to the mechanical business has been the tremendous strength of the Access technologies business, the automatic door business and that particular business basically put together a value proposition to the customer which is predicated on national footprint with 24x7 service and a service contract type of mentality where it is a service based business and they pull through a lot of mechanical product. Justin\u2019s actually been talking about this for years and gradually and methodically putting together that service value proposition and that certainly paying off in spades, so and then the final thing is we have added specifiers. We have added specifiers in the mechanical business deal best Access Legacy business, if you will and the combination of all those factors have contributed to good solid building momentum in that particular business. To understand those re-structural factors is the reasonable the thing that you can see sustained better growth like we saw in the fourth quarter.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think the thing we have to be realistic about in mechanical is we are going to encounter some market headwinds and I don\u2019t think they are going to be dramatic like they are in the residential side but take that small piece of security, it\u2019s probably 30% of security roughly that is commercial construction related business. When you have a\u2026 I think we all expect to see some pull back in commercial construction, I don\u2019t know how much, various people expect that in our case we expect to see some pullback but not o go negative like we saw in residential construction and I think that is, that is probably weigh down the Mechanical Access performance a bit lower than it has in the last couple of quarters, but that said that strong momentum that we have in the fundamentals there is going to help us continue to have a very good \u201908, we would think even though we expect to see some market slowdown, all of that which has been built into the overall guidance for the Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then a follow up, I think Bostitch, things are changing pretty rapidly right now in regards to the cost side of the equation but can you talk about the expectation of getting to this 12% margins over eight quarters is\u2026 should we be thinking about a different schedule at this point or do you do anything different to ensure that you do stay on schedule?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. That\u2019s really fair Eric. There\u2019s enough uncertainty in the marketplace. Let me just say we are not thinking about it any differently. We think and the reason being\u2026 we think we have as much to gain as we do to lose with the pricing follow on to the anti-dumping legislation but it is going to take us three to six months to see for Denise [ph] to entertain to see where that settles out in the marketplace. In terms of everything we can do internally we think we have done it, it\u2019s on track, it\u2019s really good to see it. We are producing tools in both Taiwan and China. That\u2019s very, very encouraging so one answer to that simple question is we are not backing off that and if something sculls in the marketplace or executionally that would allow us to do that we would be the first to raise our hands, but we are still looking at our\u2026 we are hoping and targeting a double digit run rate exiting 2008 for that business in terms of operating margin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good morning, gentlemen.

If the recession gets deeper, we could do more but if we do more, it will be, it should be relatively neutral to earnings because the benefits from those re-structuring would be reflected at least partially in the current year, \u201908 P&L.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Got you. Second question, I think I heard you say share count assumption for \u201908 would be 82 million shares, but right now with the action that we are taking earlier this month, it is actually under 80. Option creep is that much or I am confused as to why you wouldn\u2019t just assume 80 or 81 share count.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, when the stock goes back up to 64, we will lose a couple of million shares or add a couple of million shares of the outstanding\u2026 that\u2019s the game plan here is to execute, be rewarded by higher stock price and then we will go from there, so it is a bit of a tongue and cheek response but the Company is undervalued right now. Our expectation is the price will go up. That will create share creep", "and the last thing we want to do is have that impact our ability to deliver the earnings so that\u2019s the reason for the guidance being constructed that way.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "I\u2019ll be sure to put that on my mind. A last quick question John, this is for you.", "Because you go through Europe, looking at it broadly from 30,000 foot on a consumer industrial combined basis where you\u2019re seeing changes in growth rates on a country by country basis. I mean, if France is were your biggest exposure is but are you starting to see things weaken or are there\u2026 is it looking to be pretty steady and stable at this point?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "No. l\u2026 we\u2019re\u2026  Jim, this is John. Jim and I are obviously in daily contact with all the key regional leaders, even country by country you\u2019re absolutely right. France and the UK provide the overwhelming majority of our business, we\u2019ve seen no softening on the industrial or consumer side at this stage. Germany is booming which is an opportunity for us, we don\u2019t have a lot of business in Germany, but it\u2019s\u2026 growth from a low base and I can\u2019t under emphasize the extent to which the opportunity to grow and I\u2019ll call them emerging former central European markets. It\u2019s filling in a lot of holes. Remember we\u2019ve got good production in Poland, we\u2019ve got teams on the ground there and that\u2019s still in a lot of the\u2026 what we call it former Western European gap or potential softness. So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic on the European outlook and maybe for the first time in my career, Europe for a variety of reasons, this is going to follow the U.S. one way or another, at least you\u2019ve read as much about that as we have. So, simple answer to this question is we are all over in terms of staying current. We\u2019re not building much of a slump into our assumption.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Delabase [ph] with Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "I\u2019m asking questions on behalf of Nigel Coe today. How are you?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good Nicole.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "Quick question for you on FatMax. Where are you guys on the roll out both in the U.S. and international.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "FatMax is\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say yesterday\u2019s news. But, that at this stage is one step behind what we call FatMax\u2019s Xtreme in the U.S. and XL in Europe and simply said, Nicole, where we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve been and we will continue. We are two thirds of the way through a previously announced sequential roll out. That\u2019s roughly two waves of new product introductions per year in the spring and fall which is the best selling seasons for relatively low priced consumer hand tools. And we have had tremendous success in terms of the shipments of those products, in two areas the POFs for the retail takeaway for the XL and for the extreme is up mid single to low double digit rates with less FatMax cannibalization than we\u2019ve seen in the past. So, looking forward what you can expect is until we say something differently, or get further ahead of ourselves in terms of announcements. Another two ways in 2008, the only difference being we\u2019ll do it simultaneously in the U.S. and Europe, historically we\u2019ve trailed in Europe, but we think we have our supply chain to the point now where we can do them simultaneously, and we are looking for another $20 million, $30 million of growth from those new product introductions and the question will be, can we keep the cannibalization of the base FatMax line as well as it\u2019s been so, the overwhelming majority of that becomes incremental.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Hi, thanks good morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Morning Mike.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "First question, just on CDIY. Can you just break out what was the rest of the world excluding FX?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. 5% less than\u2026 you want the quarter or the year?", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Quarter please.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "19%.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "So that was, okay that was excluding the benefits. And also what was the benefit on the margin line from currency?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Probably 100 basis points, but I don\u2019t have it at the top of my head, we actually\u2026 we think it would be a pro rata percentage, but I don\u2019t have that number out of the top of my head. Jim might be able to give you better estimate.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The 19% is half currency and half organic growth just to clarify.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Okay.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I missed the second part of your question because I was busy researching\u2026", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "No actually I think that was my fault. I think you did say previously, it was a one to two million currency benefit.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "The second question just on \u201908. You had mentioned that you are expecting a kind of a decent backdrop. It\u2019s a little bit in contrast to some economists that are looking for a little bit of a slow down and in the housing markets in the extent that certainly, you are a lot less exposed to the housing markets but particularly driven by housing market down 5% on average in terms of completions across a lot of G-7 type nation. So, is your outlook or your game plan in Europe, mostly end-market tied or do you also have kind of new product share gain initiatives that would bolster your confidence of Europe?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well based on performance in the U.S. it down turned to 20% set us down 5%. We operate the same business model in Europe. On the CDIY side is that you said to\u2026 It\u2019s in response to Nicole\u2019s question. We've got two more waves of excel coming in Europe. They\u2019ve been extraordinarily successful. So, we think the fact that our new product vitality on the consumer side. That\u2019s what\u2019s allowing us to gain share in a down market because of very high percentage thus far. 60 to 80 of its been incremental. Not a lot of cannibalization from the base business and Jim made a very important point earlier. Why we were far from bullish, Mike, but while we're cautiously optimistic. Despite the weakness of the dollar. The strengthening of the\u2026 of our if you will the Chinese currency relative to the dollar, relative to Europe. It\u2019s going to have a big impact. Private Label\u2019s a big piece in Europe. Whether it\u2019s generic or Private Label with an European home center. The cost of those products are going to go up dramatically. We're the market\u2026 we're number one or two in the market in every product category where we compete and with a lot of experience and a variety of branded products, in situations like this the market leader is quite often the one who gains as SKU\u2019s are rationalized et cetera. We have this, I think, a chance to gain as much as we have to lose. That\u2019s what provides, if you will a floor to our believe that despite some market headwind we think we can, we can grow a little bit and maintain our margins even in the European market.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "And just one last question. You kind of highlighted your ability to recover some of the cost inflation this year pretty effectively at least on the industrial side. A little bit more competitive on the CDIY side. I was wondering if you could give us your outlook for \u201908 and that as well what\u2019s big then--?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "And in terms of incremental raw material cost inflation and if you're\u2026 given that, it would likely to be up. Have you already started to be concerned in certain pricing initiatives in your different businesses?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The answer is yes. Jeff touched on it. I\u2019m going to turn it over to him. But we're looking at slightly more raw materials inflation and about the same percentage of recovery in the same place. But I think, Jeff can give you a little more granularity on that. I think, it\u2019s important that you have it looking out at our guidance. Because we\u2019ll update it if it changes.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Yes. I mean the numbers.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Those are the numbers and of the 75 or so that I mentioned when we did the guidance page.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "About 50 or so is actually materials. A lot of those materials are sourced from China so we're having the currency impact. We're having the EDRR impact. We're having the wage inflation impact. And we have pretty good visibility too. We have a centralized sourcing operation, which has very good, which has written contracts with these big suppliers et cetera and we kind of know where we are. We have a lot of our contracts have been finalized for \u201908 and no, we have some freight inflations and wage inflation and some energy inflation on top of that and that accounts for the 75.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Banc of America.", "Seth Weber - Banc Of America Securities", "Hey, good morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Seth.", "Seth Weber - Banc Of America Securities", "Back on the security business, on the last call you guys talked about, I think, adding somewhere between or targeting 3 to 6 new cities for the HSM business and that kind of contributing to pretty robust organic growth rates. Is that still the case and can you talk about whether the competitive\u2026 the pricing environment in that business has changed here with the economic outlook?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes and no. We still continue\u2026 we are targeting between 3 and 6 or roughly one a quarter cities to add, as we get confident we can have the scale to run a profitable operation. The no, is that is not the primary contributor to the HSM growth. I\u2019d say with 70 field offices these are going to be much, much smaller offices. The primary contributor to our growth is continuing to execute the reverse integration that Jim described in quite a bit of detail and continue the trend to increase the percentage of recurring revenue i.e. the service piece of the business that comes along with the installation. Executing the of say the HSM model where its unlikely if not inconceivable, that we would do an installation without the monitoring and/or service contract that came with it. That\u2019s what\u2019s the driver of the organic growth.", "Seth Weber - Banc Of America Securities", "Okay. And any change to the pricing environment in that business and can you also just, going back to the Home Depot situation, should we expect another quarterly differential in this quarter and when will that kind of stop?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lets take them one at a time. The Home Depot situation which relates to the hardware business is in mechanical and that is roughly a $40 million impact in total and a $30 million impact in \u201908 and it will anniversary after the third quarter is complete so the fourth quarter will have completely anniversaried that issue. And you can expect it to be, hardware is a vending machine business so in theory so, it\u2019s pretty evenly spread throughout the first three quarters. And you want do the other part of the question Eric? And just repeat the other part of your question.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The second part. Oh, Seth won't be able to.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "OK.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think, it was the pricing, I\u2019m sorry, it was the pricing environment on the\u2026", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "On HSI?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And quite frankly no is the simple answer. It\u2019s a service business, it\u2019s a very small part of an operator\u2019s cost and the cost of failure is so high compared to the cost of doing it right. And I think by maintaining the current reputation we have as the premier service provider in the industry it\u2019s obviously a competitive business but we do not see tremendous competitive pricing pressure particularly on the service side of that business.", "Operator", "You\u2019re last question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Morgan Stanley.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "I\u2019ll try to be brief. On CDIY just wanted to ask about margins by geography stripping out Bostitch. Is there any material in other words are margins higher or lower overseas versus the US?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. In lots of businesses they are but in ours margins are quite similar and we anticipate seeing the same going forward. The team works hard to keep it that way. We manage it as a global business from a product development and a pricing prospective so that in itself is part of the reason but the simple answer to your question is no. They\u2019re very consistent.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. And the second question, I\u2019m just curious whether the economic uncertainty has an impact on your acquisition strategy? You have a lot of cash to deploy, especially I guess you\u2019re taking a slightly more positive view on Europe. And does that uncertainty reduce or change your appetite for acquisitions? New ones.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "Go ahead Gerry.", "Gerry Gould - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yes, well we look at this both tactically and strategically. And strategically there\u2019s no difference whatsoever. Our strategy remains as we presented it on March 8, and supplemented it in discussions and various conference calls afterwards. From a tactical prospective there\u2019s always a trade off that one has to make in our positions when looking at buying oneself versus spending the next $100 million to buy an acquisition. And as I said we\u2019re trading at 7.6 times EBITDA and that\u2019s a fairly compelling evaluation on a historical basis, on an intrinsic basis, on almost any basis you can derive. So, we\u2019re not saying that we\u2019re out of the acquisition hunt because we\u2019re not, but yet when we look at the shares trading and the levels they have been trading it\u2019s really difficult to get really excited about spending nine or ten times EBITDA doing all the work to take out the cost and everything to get it so that your buying it at basically seven to eight times EBITDA when you can buy yourself at really, with buying exactly, knowing exactly what your buying. So we\u2019ll see. This year we could, we may not do any major acquisitions. We may focus purely on share buybacks, but, if a really compelling acquisition were to come around and we contracted the two, it looked like it was a smart move and it was strategically consistent then we would definitely go in that direction. So we\u2019re keeping our options open, we\u2019re staying flexible and we\u2019ll see where we go.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to John for any closing remarks.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Matthew. Two things. Just very briefly. We read over but we wanted to get virtually everybody in the queue. One point I just wanted to make. Numerous companies on calls earlier this, last weekend earlier this week, have had imposters calling in and I\u2019ve abruptly dismissed the second caller which was not Richard Radbourne from Atlantic Securities. We know Richard well, he follows the company. And we simply removed his line because he signed on for someone he wasn\u2019t. So, for anybody who thought that somebody was dismissed rather abruptly he was and in the future if they like to sign on as to who they are we\u2019ll get then in the queue and if we don\u2019t get to it during the Q&A Jerry is available always as he is. So, I just wanted to make that clarification. Second just a couple milestones before I close. Jim talked about the terrific performance of our industrial group. In general the Engineered Solutions in particular. We had our first shipments of our System 100 RFID enabled industrial storage unit. Really, really strategic, important product. And we're very exited about it in terms of our entrance into the healthcare segment. From the hydraulic side, good market strength, the business continues to grow. This business is almost twice as big as it was three or four years ago. And after a lot of joint development effort, our assembly technology\u2019s business has received its first orders from Toyota Motors. And as you know a lot of those decisions are initially made in Japan before they cascade to the US. So we\u2019re real pleased with some of those, I will say, small but strategically important milestones within our industrial storage business. Thanks for your interest on a call that we extended just so we could try to address everyone\u2019s concerns. And we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Baird & Co.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "Jeff - Raymond James", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Sierra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to The Stanley Works first quarter results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions).", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. John Lundgren, Stanley Works Chairman and CEO. Sir you may begin your conference.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Sierra. Good Morning. Just before the cautionary statements and proceedings with this mornings call, we have a brief announcement regarding investor relations at Stanley, which you may have seen this morning. Gerry Gould, who is Stanley's Vice President Investor Relations and has been for the last 11 year's has expected a position as the Vice President of investor relations for RSC Equipment Rentals Scottsdale, Arizona. And, simply we want to thank Gerry for obviously his many years of diligent service, valuable contributions to the company. Of course, we wish him well. We know he will enjoy the sun and do a really good job for RSC. And with us today is Greg Waybright who is our Vice President of Internal Audit. Greg is also going to be serving as our Interim Vice President of Investor Relations as we completed search of Gerry's replacement. So Greg, I will turn it over to you for the cautionary statements.", "Greg Waybright - Interim Vice President, Investor Relations", "Great thanks John and good morning to everyone. On the call in addition to myself and John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO is the Jim Loree, our Executive VP and CFO as well as Jerry Gould. And there are few recent press releases that I would like to mention. One relates to our first quarter results, which was issued earlier this morning, and the other is related to our second quarter dividend declaration and the results of our annual shareholders meeting, which were issued yesterday and these press releases are available on our website.", "Today's presentation is also available on our site. And as that's important as we refer to these charge during the call. John will review Stanley's first quarter results followed by a Q&A session. The call is expected as usual to last approximately one hour. And then a replay of the call will be available beginning at 00:02.pm today through Wednesday, April 30th. The replay number is 800-642-1687 and the access code is 42633122.", "And you can also call me with any questions. My number is 860-827-3544 and I look forward to speaking with some of you as part of mine Interim Investors Relations role with Stanley. So, two quick announcements before we proceed with John's comments, both reminders, one being that we issue an update our earnings guidance on an annual basis in our press release at the beginning of each quarter and we cannot comment on such guidance there after.", "If the guidance does change materially, we will issue a press release and conduct the conference call. And then secondly, the obligatory, cautionary statement language being that certain statements made during today's discussion by the various Stanley participants are forward-looking statements.", "They are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. As such they involve risks and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those expected or implied. So, we direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K, which we filed with today's press release and then our recent 34 Act filings.", "I'll now turn the call over to, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Greg. I'm going to go through a brief and call it formal presentation of the results. Jim and I often share this. Jim is here with us today, it's relatively short. So I'll take us through the entire presentation to allow us plenty of time for questions and answers.", "In summarizing, the first quarter business highlights, 6% earnings growth which led to 85% earnings per share, despite the difficult market conditions particularly in the North American residential construction business. Our revenues were up 3%. Certainly they were aided by our foreign currency translation and acquisitions, which did more than offset the softness in organic volume.", "We grew our gross margin by 60 basis points as a percentage of revenues, as our productivity programs in the plants and good work in the market place on freights realization more than offset the inflation, excellent quarter in terms of cash flow of $83 million up 22% over the first quarter of '07.", "As you would expect, the CDIY revenue was flat as the currency offsets in foreign markets compensated for the weakness in demand in North America. But in the industrial segment both profits and revenues were up 8%. I will talk more about that in our segment detail. And an outstanding quarter in security with our profits up 17% on revenue growth of 3%, again more detail on that in the segments.", "So looking quickly at the first quarter results in total, we see net earnings flat at $68 million, which translated the EPS of $0.85. Interest expense, tax rate, share count, tax rate is 70 basis points lower than the same period year ago, all contributed to the increase in earnings. So 6% earnings growth despite relatively difficult North American market conditions.", "Now, looking a little more closely at revenues and the sources of growth, as previously stated revenues up 3%, unit volume across the globe was down 5%, offset by 2%price realization, which lead to the previously stated minus 3% organic growth. We got a 4% less from currency, as you know about 45% of Stanley's revenues are outside North America and another 2% from the annualized effective acquisitions that one part of our portfolio in the first quarter last year leading to the revenue growth of about 3%.", "By segment, and we'll get into more detail on this, CDIY as previously stated was flat. Organic growth on a global basis was minus 5%. And, as I stated earlier, currency and price offset the unit volume softness, which was overwhelmingly concentrated in North America.", "The industrial segment grew 8% in total and was down 1% organically. Lot of moving pieces there, but Europe was strong. Our Engineered Solutions business was strong and of course we were helped by foreign exchange, offset by weakness in North American automotive and repair segment, and lot of things driving that and we'll talk about that more in the segment detail. Two small acquisitions, both notable of which was InnerSpace contributed in addition to the FX to the total growth.", "Last, but certainly not least, security which was up 3% in total, down 2% organically, but that's a tremendous achievement, and I'll talk about it more in the segment when you think about the fact we offset a 4% to 5% headwind due to the loss of a major customer in North America, which was announced this time last year, but the volume didn't disappear from our P&L until the middle of the third quarter. So as you see, 3% organic growth in the total security segment excluding hardware.", "Let's look briefly at the three segments, starting with construction in DIY. As I say, flat revenues, in those, in both the consumer tools and storage and our Bostitch business were basically flat. Segment profit down 19% in absolute returns and 280 basis points. The U.S continues to be adversely impacted by the residential construction market. That of course affects consumer tools and storage as well as Bostitch. In North America those businesses were both down low single digits in terms of revenue.", "Sales in the rest of the world were up 6%. Of course a lot of that was foreign currency, Europe up about 7% in the consumer tools and storage business and Bostitch up even more than that in Europe. So, relatively good performance outside the U.S. The profit rate of course is negatively impacted as we failed to fully recover inflation, about $20 million of the annualized inflation came out us in February and we absorbed some of that in the cost line and didn't yet recover it with price and productivity.", "The soft volume resulted in lower absorption of fixed cost, and we did continued spending on market development. We made our commitment early in the year to continue to support our brand in consumer tools and storage, as well as fully implement and retain our discovery team activities, and if appropriate as suggested in our guidance, we'll reduce those slightly to preserve earnings later in the year, but that money is committed. We thought it was money well spent and we continue to believe it will strengthen us for the future going forward.", "Just a brief note, we talked earlier about anti-dumping tariffs, and the impact that had on our Bostitch business. In the short term, it's neutral, neither positive nor negative. In the long-term, we think it's an advantage for Bostitch. You may recall in January of 2008, tariffs has a range between 4% and 118%, were imposed on all imports from China as a result of a lot of study and the fact that the conclusion that certain fastening products were being dumped in the U.S at unfair prices.", "The total impact on Bostitch was 19%, which was well below a lot of the competition and it of course just reflected the product mix of Bostitch. And, going forward it will level the playing field against any relative to Chinese imports that were being dumped. Short-term, any one the increases have been passed along in terms of pricing because it's affecting everyone.", "Long-term, we think it's an advantage for Bostitch and the Bostitch has very capable production facilities in North America, as well as in Poland, as well as in China, near Beijing. So, good production on three continents gives us the flexibility to move production going forward as exchange rates and market conditions vary.", "Looking at the industrial segment, as I said revenues and segment profit both up 8%. Profit rate was flat. Industrial tools and automotive repair tool revenues were up 6%, down 2% organically. Facom continues to perform well, and our U.S industrial revenues were down slightly. That's driven primarily by weak automotive sector assembly and MAC, both down and we'll talk about those in the Q&A to the extent if there is interest.", "Our Engineered Solutions business was up 18%, 3% organically. Our Vidmar business remains very strong. Total storage grew 50%, 13% excluding acquisitions and in total segment profit was up 8% despite the lack of organic growth. The rate was flat we did well with pricing and productivity, and that offset any of the negatives associated with inflation and mix.", "Lot going on in the securities segment, profit up 17% on 3% revenue growth, and the rate up nearly 200 basis points. As previously stated, the 3% revenue growth for the total segment would have been in the neighborhood of 9% excluding hardware. Segment profit as I said remains strong up 17%. Looking at our sub-segments within security, convergent had a very, very good quarter. 12% sales growths, 2% of which was organic, the difference between those two are combination of a full quarter of HSM where we brought that business on in mid January a year ago, as well as foreign exchange of about 20% of that business is generated in the UK. So, that's the primary differences and of course some good pricing work between organic and total.", "Restoration of organic growth in the U.S. systems integration business was a very encouraging aspect of the quarter. As the HSM acquisition and the reverse integration that we have talked about on previous calls, that's taken an impact and it was good to see that we call the legacy convergent securities solutions business performing well, and showing some true organic growth. On the mechanical side revenue was down 3% as due overwhelmingly, or more than a 100% due to that hardware issue that I talked about before. Plus 7%, 4% of which was organic if we exclude hardware, and the profit increase, was driven by combination of organic growth price and the benefits of the HSM Integration and Convergent that we talked about previously.", "Good story, on working capital, which continues to contribute to, a good story on free cash flow. Specifically, looking at the elements, despite the softness in demand, we took five days out of inventory and reduced our inventory in absolute terms. Receivables were up five days are 11%. It's overwhelmingly due to European mix with a higher percentage of our revenue in Europe, foreign exchange, and as many of you are aware in general negotiated terms are a lot longer in Europe than they are in the U.S.", "So, the mix toward more European business in the first quarter this year versus last year is having an impact on receivables. Payables again, a nice improvement in payables, but I wanted just emphasize, I feel it, necessary to emphasize that it's simply, it is due to negotiation of terms with various suppliers, which is an advantage of our strong balance sheet and not withholding payments.", "We are upper grade investment level credit. We want to stay that way. And, it's simply due to better terms with some of our strategic suppliers and renegotiation of those terms. And, as a consequence, turns improved from 4.4 to 4.6, as inventory and payable performance, more than offset the increase in receivables. Cash flow was up $15 million in absolute terms, and as previously stated up 22%. Fairly straightforward, in terms of where it came from. The biggest contributor was just better management of working capital.", "We believe we're still on track to achieve our $500 million of free cash flow for the year. And, that of course is what's going to allow us to continue to pay the dividend, make acquisitions, and pursue our opportunistic buybacks as necessary and as required. Of course, it also results on our balance sheet staying pretty strong, and as I said the capacity to allocate our capital is consistent with previously strategies and priorities.", "Last but certainly not least is guidance. You look at 2007 EPS of $4 a share which was up 15% versus '06 and $457 million of cash flow, current guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 and $500 million in cash flow. This was outlined, we think as clearly as we can outline it with what we know today in the press release. But our first quarter EPS was consistent with the fiscal year of 2008 guidance of $4.20 to $4.40.", "Second quarter recessionary operating environment also was what we anticipated at the beginning of the year and the end of last year, when we issued our guidance. Our guidance assumed two quarters of organic revenue contraction, and that was consistent with our stated belief in a mild to short live U. S. recession. As a consequence, the second half economic conditions will need to stabilize in order to support the achievement of our full year guidance of $4.20 to $4.40.", "In the event that it doesn't, contingency plans are primarily in the form of cost and discretionary spending reductions. Secondarily in the form of pricing are being developed or in fact are in place to protect earnings above prior year levels, if in fact the weak demand continues. And based on what we have seen today and the good achievement, continued focus on working capital management, we believe that our $500 million estimate for free cash flow for the year is well within reach.", "At this point, I'd like to turn it back over to Sierra and Jim and I will try to respond to any questions you might have.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Thank you. Good morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Eric", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I guess a couple of things, one can you give us an update on where we are in the Bostitch improvement effort and even perhaps the portfolio evaluation, consideration with emphasis as well.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I will take that one. I want to be sure you get your follow up and Eric Bostitch is I'd say on a long-term basis continuing to progress as we hope it would. It's fourth and first quarter, I'll say a bump in the road relative to the nice sequential improvement, we've seen for four quarters running before it. But there is so much confusion in the marketplace over, as I say 19% price increases across the board. What's that doing to volume on a short-term basis? It is really difficult to be very granular on how much of any volume softness was due to the confusion in the marketplace on price increases? How much of it was due to headwind? So it's fairly difficult to get up for us or anyone else on a short-term basis to get a handle on the Bostitch top-line.", "Strategically the manufacturing restructuring and our footprint modification is behind us and it's, we're quite pleased with the results. As I alluded to earlier, we've got a world class manufacturing facility in Langfang, China. We have great facility in the Southern Poland, as well as a very capable facility in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, and we've closed the facility that by no fault of its own. It was not up cost competitive in terms of delivery in Chihuahua, Mexico.", "We've actually moved nail production from China back to the U.S. As a result, about 10% of our production, the combination of labor rates, tariffs and Renminbi strength, has made it prudent for us to move about 10% of our production, and a 100 jobs with it back to the U.S on the fastening side. On the tool side, we're producing tools in the Besco plants in both Taiwan and China. That is on or slightly ahead of schedule, so we feel good there.", "So, I guess, to sum it up from the internal perspective, we're pleased with where we are to the extent that it faces marketplace challenges both in terms of the confusion around tariffs and North America headwind in term of construction, time will tell. You mentioned portfolio evaluation, we've been very clear about this for a long time.", "Our Bostitch is making money. I think sometimes people assume it isn't, but its low mid-single digits operating margin. It spent 10% or 12%. It needs to get back there, needs to get back there within a six to twelve month period, which is, will be two years after we started the restructuring program, or its less likely to be a part of the portfolio, and that we simply don't' continue to support businesses that are not creating shareholder value. Right now, it's not destroying shareholder value and they are doing. I think the team is doing an outstanding job with what they can control and we've got some pretty serious marketplace headwinds and we are trying to see if we can offset those going forward.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then just secondly, it seems like you've got a contingency that you've identified to ensure that you can have, I guess at least up earnings if demand continues to get worse, and I guess my question is, what is that consist of, and why not juts do it rather than wait to see what happens with the market?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We've done some Eric. I'm going to let Jim give you as much insight on that as we are comfortable doing on this call, but if I inferred we are waiting, I may miss spoke or didn't communicate clearly enough. Two (Inaudible) and Jim will take you through a little bit of that.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Well, I mean anytime you have a contingency plan that's going to generate enough earnings to be significant, it's going to involve reductions in force and obviously we take those very seriously, and we only do those when we feel it's appropriate to do. I mean, there is tradeoff's between the long-term and the short term that you invariably must make when you do those, and so our preference would be to not do anything in terms of the contingency plan, but the economic realities are out there.", "As John said we've done some, we've done the non people related part of it today. So, that's already in progress, and the way we are kind of looking at it is, it will cost us, if we do what we are doing, it will cost us about $0.20 a share and restructuring it will probably provide a benefit of about $0.40 a share. So, for plus $0.20 a share, to offset the lower volume in the second half that we might have if the economy doesn't come around. We are just making a decision, as to whether we want to do that or not based on the long term, short term tradeoffs.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And, the net saves Jim would $0.20 in the second half, is how the math looks like it would shakeout?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I mean that the volume that we assumed in the original guidance, if we were to continue to experience the kinds of issues that we are having, the volume would be about a $0.50 issue for us, and we've get a net of about $0.20, which would be about $0.30. Now that's assuming, where we have minus 3%, I am talking organic growth at this point. We incurred about minus 3% or experience of about minus 3% organic growth in the first quarter. Our outlook for the second quarter is fairly consistent with that, so as we look into the second half and we don't see any improvements, then we are looking at about a $0.50 issue vis-\u00e0-vis the original guidance.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from James Lucas with Janney Montgomery.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Alright, thanks and good morning guys.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Hey Jim.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Two housekeeping and one strategic question. With regards to the hardware comp when does that anniversary, that's the first one.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Okay let's tackle that and then we will go to your other question or questions. The hardware and total cost will cost us about $50 million, about 40 of which will be experienced this year. The first three quarters of the year are the time in which that will be recognized. So, we are talking about $12 million to $15 million a quarter depending on the quarter for the first three quarters.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Okay. And, with regards to the buyback, I don't know if I missed this number, if you gave it out or not. How much did you buyback in the first quarter and how much of that left under the current authorization?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Well we bought back 2.2 million shares in January at $46 a share that came on the heels of a 3.6 million share buyback and I think it was about a 8 million share authorization and we have expanded 2.2 million of it.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Okay, so there was nothing done after January.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "No.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Okay. And finally, with regards to Europe, could you give us a comment of what you are seeing there both from Facom, and your other industrial businesses and the consumer businesses, with regards to both of those?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah I mean, we were listening to Black & Deckers call, and I think that they mentioned that they were having a little bit of slowdown in Europe in the construction in DIY markets. And, I would say that our experience is reasonably consistent with that. It's a bit of slowdown, but it's not any kind of a deep dive like we are seeing in the U.S CDIY markets.", "Industrial, we are still growing in Facom organically, not the same kind of torrid rate that we were growing in the last half of last year. But still growing, so I think that what we have in Europe is the situation where the overall U.S. economy impact and the currency strength and everything else is providing a little bit of throttle on their growth, but it's not [tanking] in any respect.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Mike.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "First question, I guess this goes to the raw material impact. You had mentioned last quarter, that you were expecting about a $75 million from inflation and recovering about 80% of that. Can you give us an update on how those numbers worked now? And also, what that recovery or incremental positive might be with some of those incremental cost reduction efforts in place? I guess its more headcount related but nonetheless?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "I already talked about the cost reduction efforts in terms of the impact, which I will just repeat for ease of the administration here. It looks like it would be about a $0.40 improvement in the second half, which would be annualized around $0.80. And, the restructuring associated with that would be about $0.20, of which it's likely that $0.10 or so would be incurred in the second quarter, if we decide to do this. So, the net benefit of the restructuring would be, or the cost actions would be about $0.20, and it would be in the second half.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "I mean, and then $0.40 incremental in '09?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "If that has to forward to carryover absolutely, yeah.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Because of the annualization?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Correct.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "And, then your other question Mike was relative to the price inflation?", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Yeah.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I'm very pleased actually with our situation here, not the fact that we're getting more inflation, but the fact that we've responded I think very well. And, as soon as the next wave of inflation came in the first quarter, our operating heads jumped on it and implemented price increases. And, so we actually have good news to report here. Now the inflation estimate for the year is up to $100 million, so it's up $25 million, but the recovery percent is up to 90%.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "That's great. I mean that's really great reaction and proactivity. The second question is just on the commercial, your expectations for commercial end markets, obviously, on the consumer and macro side things are slowing but up until now commercial end markets have been relatively stable. It's not growing year-over-year, but the back half there are a lot of people out there looking for a significant slowdown.", "So, I was just wondering, if you could provide any idea of how your guidance either the $4.20 to $4.40 range or the more paired back type of expectations you are trying to set if things soften on a macro level, but within that what is your outlook for commercial and maybe just kind of remind us on a segment basis where that impacts your business?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Well, it's about 10% of the company, and actually it's less than 10%, about 8% of the company, about $400 million in revenue. And it is largely in the Security segment. So, I mean, obliviously there are some in the Construction & DIY, but very little and most of it is in the Security segment.", "The guidance that we issued and we discussed this in a little bit of depth at the analyst meeting, is that we didn't really have anything specific on commercial, but we said that it would be slowing. We expected it to slow in the second half of the year, because of the credit issues that are being experienced at the moment. And, that we didn't expect it to go severely negative. So, I would suggest in this kind of contingency view if you will that we're thinking about here for the back half of the year, I would expect that we would anticipate issues in the commercial construction market beyond what we had in the original guidance.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Thanks, Jim. One last question if I could. The free cash flow obviously comes in. It's still coming in nicely and you still have good confidence there. Relative to--", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sorry Mike, go ahead.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Have we loose him?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we lost him.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Let's have the operator put him back on if we can.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Why don't we take another call and answer.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah let's take another call, and while we're doing that, may be we can get him lined up to be, to finish his questions, thank you.", "Operator", "Mike, your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Thanks, I appreciate that guy's. Just relating to the cash flow, projections and your use of that cash, if you could give us an idea, particularly on the acquisition front, how you see that market right now? If there are any more pressing or compelling opportunities relative to six or twelve months ago either in terms of price or in segment or geography?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'll take Mike. The good news is the cash flow gives us the opportunity to continue to pursue our strategy and after we pay our dividend, I think, we've been very clear. Our strategic accretive acquisitions to clear our financial hurdles are our top priority, and that being said, Stanley is on sale right now, and we obviously look at it very carefully relative to acquisitions, even though they will advance our strategy.", "Our pipeline has never been more full to be specific in terms of your question. There's a lot there, particularly in Europe, both in the security space as well as in the industrial tools space, which are the growth platform where we focused. It won't surprise you or anyone to know that the fewer financial sponsors show up in auction or processes, or even an attempted unilateral negotiations. That being said, there has been little or no price capitulation thus far.", "So, long way of saying both in the tools space and in the security space, good properties are selling for multiples of recurring monthly revenues, multiples of EBITDA etcetera, that haven't come down at all relative to the last six to nine months. The difference being, the suitors tend to be overwhelmingly strategic, which of course wouldn't surprise you, and fewer and fewer financial sponsors just given the current credit environment. But the pipeline is full, as we go forward to make an acquisition our intend is to continue to built our capital base and bring in acquisitions at above our cost to capital, which we believe in the long-term create shareholder value.", "That being said, we had a Board meeting yesterday. We discussed each and every acquisition with our Board and before we make it, to the extent it's our cash, and it's our desire to maintain upper tier investment grade. We look at each and every acquisition strategically and financially relative to buying Stanley stock, and in this environment the share repurchase probably gets a closer look than it would have historically, but we have not changed our priorities and we've not changed our strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Hi, Pete.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Jim, if I could, just to clarify on the back half of the year guidance, down 3% organically in the first quarter, it sounds like second quarter accounts the same number. Is the second half of the year just kind of run along at that, minus 3% or are you expecting improvement? I just want to make sure I understand it.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Well, our guidance is 420 to 440 a share, and that as John mentioned when he went through his presentation is predicated on, was predicated on a short or a short lived, in mild recession in the U.S, and without a major global recession. So, the issue that we are facing right now is that, it's not even an issue, we are exactly where we though we would be when we issued the guidance, which is the first quarter would be really tough and the second quarter would be tough. And then, in theory if our assumptions hold true the third and the fourth quarters should get better. There is also its stimulus going on as you know with respect to interest rate reductions, with respect to fiscal stimulus as well, putting cheques in people hands in the U.S. and there are a number of reasons to think that it's possible that it could be better in the second half. But, I don't think anyone is going to bet on that certainly not us.", "But we are consistent with where we thought we would be. The wild card in the whole economic outlook for us has been the shakiness of the overall financial system over the past few months has really created more concerns on the part of the most folks here than we had before. And so, now we have seen some abatement in the last few weeks of that in particular with the Bear Sterns rescue and so forth.", "So, if the financial system stabilizes the stimulus works, I think there is a good possibility that we could have an okay second half, which would put us right smack in the range of our consensus. But, we want to give you a sense and I think, I saw a report from one of the analyst on the call who sort of pegged it as - we are sort of trying to quantify what we believe the downside to be for you if that doesn't occur. And, the downside is that we can still generate earnings growth while a number of our building products competitors are earnings are tanking 20% to 30% versus the prior year. And, that's a direct result of the portfolio shift, and also what we consider it to be a fairly direct response to the economic environment in terms of cost reductions and price inflation recovery.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Okay that's very helpful thank you for that one and then my follow up question I guess. If I look at the CDIY segment and if I understood John correctly, it sounds like there is a, was there a $20 million raw material hit in the first quarter or was there a price offset?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah let me, Pete I mentioned that $20 million, when I was talking about CDIY. And, the majority of it is in the CDIY, because it's steel and that's Bostitch and that's hand tools. So, the majority of it is there. That 19, 20 million was on top of the 75 to 80 to get to the 100 that Jim reference previously.", "So, we entered the year saying 75 to 80. We observed another 20 in February. Get us to 100, or 20 to 25, get us to a 100 for the year. And those are the price offsets we worked hard to get in the place. In other words, we would look at 80% recovery when the number was 75%. We are now looking at 90% recovery, of a 100.", "We are still looking at $10 million of negative price inflation, which of course we are going to get some productivity, that's all on the annualized basis.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah. But in any way, we expect to have gross margin accretion, because though, as I mentioned in last call, we expect about $70 million of variable cost productivity, which should fall through and except for the un-recovered piece of the inflation, which is at this point about $10 million", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "And, that was indicative. First quarter you saw 60 basis points of margin accretion despite all the activity that was going on out there, and despite soft volume relative to our plan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Robert Wertheimer with Morgan Stanley.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning, everybody. You said something in the actual opening commentary that keeps my interest. You talked about renegotiating supplier terms, and I wonder whether that's because your suppliers are really starting to feel the credit crunch, and whether there is any risk there?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "No it's more a function of in particular the Asian suppliers. So for two or three years, we have been able to stave off the price increases, while they have experienced significant raw material price increases. We sort of expected that. Sooner or later, it would come to this, and a lot of them have basically decided that they can no longer ship under the previous prices.", "And, so they come to us and say, well we don't want to do business with you anymore because, you won't accept the price increase, you haven't accepted the price increase for two or three years and our prices have gone up X percent on steel and other input costs. So, when we, we would be grudgingly grant those, and we have a process to fully analyzed their cost structure and everything else and then work with them to do value engineering, to reduce the impact of the price increases to us and so on.", "But ultimately, we've ended up taking some price increases from some of these Asian suppliers. And, in almost every instance when that's happened, we've said to them, we're not taking any price increase unless you extend the terms 30 to 60 days from what they are. And, that's basically most of what the payable increases resulting from, as well as some currency, John didn't mention the currency when he was talking, but the currency had an impact as well.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, fair enough. And then I would, just mechanically on your price increases, the one you just took, is that typically timing for the year, and if you talk about how often you typically do pricing in the year?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I have to talk to you by segment.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Let's take the easy ones first, easy to explain, not easy to get price increases. But insecurity and in our industrial business because, most of it is be-to-be most of our customers are in the very similar situation as we are. It tends to be far more transparent and their willingness to accept and pass on a price increase is understood because, they are in the same situation as we are. So, it tends to be relatively quick, 30 to 45 days notice and it passes through and they have the same capability to pass it on through.", "That 90% price recovery that Jim talked about, that's on a corporate wide basis. The numbers higher than 90 in security and industrial, and below that in CDIY and the reason there, I think it's pretty obvious and straightforward. A very large percentage of the CDIY business is sold through the North American and European home centers. Large retailer with lot of leverage and just as we have formal processes to fully {vat] and then, and in an essence resist pricing increases until we are sure there are merited.", "They have the same leverage and they have it from a $40 billion to $80 billion revenue base, and it takes a lot of work, a lot of working with the supplier, and a lot of negotiation on what else can change. So, they can keep their cost and ultimately their retail prices as low as possible. So, it takes three to six months in some case to truly realize the benefits of a price increase. And part of CDIY channel its more 30 to 60 days in some of the other channels. That's not unique to Stanley. It's just reflects the difference in the channel and how the pricing models work.", "Robert Wertheimer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Jeff - Raymond James", "Yeah, this is Jeff calling in for Sam.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Jeff - Raymond James", "First question is, we were pretty encouraged by the U.S. System Integration business. I was hoping you could talk about that a little bit, and whether or not you were surprised at all, or how did that came in, kind of just when you are planning forward?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We too were encouraged. We were surprised. Jim is right in the middle of it, so I am going to ask him to take that.", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, the encouraging thing about it is that it's happening a little faster than we expected. If you look at what we've said in the past, we were expecting to go through about the first half of this year with continued negative organic growth in that particular part of the business. And, as it turned out, we were able to emerge two quarters earlier with organic growth. And, the reason that is, is that we had a fair amount of sales turnover last year that was anticipated, but the folks that have stayed and the new folks clearly have brought into the business model, which involves recurring revenue as well as installation revenue as part of the sales process they brought into the compensation plans that we have and we're finding that gaining share is feasible. In particular, at the national accounts, it's been, we've been a welcome alternative to the other supplier out there or suppliers. And, in general, convergence security is really picking up momentum, and we feel very good about it.", "Jeff - Raymond James", "Okay. My follow up is in regards to, in your script you mentioned something about the automotive business weakness, and it sounded basically, that like, may be there is little more three than market weakness, I was, can you talk about that?", "James M. Loree - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President", "Yeah, let's start by hopefully, it didn't sound like we're reading a script, because we don't do that. But I do understand, you met in the formal comments. Let me distinguish, between our small OEM business assembly, which is facing the same marketplace headwinds obviously that anybody supplying the North American or European automotive business would do.", "That business is soft from a top line perspective. That team has done a great job adjusting its cost base to stay inline with it, and in fact saw some margin accretion as a result of it. The issue there is volume. The rest of the business though what we do call, industrial and automotive repair, you think some of Proto, some of Facom, and certainly MAC, it's been difficult. If you think of the MAC model, the drivers are paying for their own gasoline, that's extraordinarily expensive, and a large part of the MAC top line comes from very high ticket items sold on consumer credit, which their end users are having difficulty, quite frankly coming up with the credit to buy it. So, a lot of that softness is driven by the combination of energy prices, and tight credit in the end user market for that particular segment, because the industrial part of that business is performing extraordinarily well. That the Proto, the part of Facom that goes to industrial in Europe.", "We are quite pleased with how they are performing. So, if it involves consumer credit, if it involves gasoline, it's going to be tough in the end market place. And, lastly, we don't talk too much about individual businesses, but we are making progress with, I'll say distributor recruiting model with Mac where historically we looked very, very hard and very closely on. How many distributors did we add, how many distributors did we lose in a particular quarter, with not enough focus on retention. The way that business model works is we need to keep these people for 12 to 18 months before they turn profitable. So, I won't bore you with the details but the MAC team has really stepped up the sophistication and the scrutiny under which they look at distributors before they add them.", "The end result is, we are going to add fewer distributors without question, because the border for them to clear clearing and become a distributor is much higher. The theory is that while we will be adding fewer distributors, our retention rate will be dramatically higher and in the long run that will be great for Stanley. We are only 1.5 quarters into this in new process, so I can't tell you, yet that it's working, but I know both at the MAC level, Donald McIlnaydone who is responsible for our industrials tools group is well of those of that that headquarters in the HR function as well as Senior Executive Management, looked at the program, take it to the right way to go, and we are consciously optimistic that that's going to help him.

My main question was, when we talk about organic growth in the various segments for the rest of the world, is it possible to discuss them on a constant currency or a local currency basis, so we have a better idea for example, for Facom, rest of the world 6%, CDIY, what we are talking about on a local currency basis?", "James M.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Works Second Quarter Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Gary Waybright, Stanley Interim Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Greg Waybright - Interim Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Carly. It is actually Greg, but I have been called worse, so, good morning to everyone. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and a special guest Tony Byerly who is the Chief Operating Officer of our North American Convergent Security business. Tony will talk to us about the Sonitrol acquisition during the presentation.", "There are a few recent press releases that I would like to mention. One relates to our second quarter results, which was issued last night. The others relate to our second-quarter dividend increase which was our 41st consecutive annual increase. The other releases speak to the completion of the Sonitrol and Xmark acquisitions and the announcement naming Bret Bontrager, our Corporate Executive Officer. These releases are available on our website.", "Today's presentation is also available on our site and we will refer to these charts during the call. John and Jim will review Stanley's second quarter results and Tony as I mentioned will speak to the Sonitrol acquisition, and then we will have a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 PM and the replaying number is 800-642-1687 and the access code which is in the press release is 45127121 and please feel free to call me with any questions at 860-827-3544.", "Just a couple of quick announcements before we proceed. One is a reminder that we issue and update earnings guidance on an annual basis and our press release at the beginning of each quarter and we can not comment on such guidance thereafter. If our guidance changes materially we will issue a press release and conduct a conference call. And secondly another reminder that certain statements made during today's discussion by the various Stanley participants are forward-looking statements. They are based on the assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those that are expected or implied, so we direct you to the cautionary statements in our Form 8-K, which we filed with yesterday's press release and in our current or our recent 34-F filings.", "I will now turn the call over to John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Greg, good morning everybody. First just a couple of highlights from a very busy second quarter at Stanley, earnings of a $1.05 were up 4%, excluding the portfolio charges and related business closures that amounted to about $0.10 that were detailed in the press release and set to walk between continued operations... continuing operations and discontinued operations is also contained within the press release.", "Revenues grew 5% on the basis of currency and acquisitions. We did experience reasonably good organic growth in Europe and in our security business excluding hardware, and we'll come on to that. That was offset by continued weakness in U.S. markets in general and residential construction markets in particularly... in particular.", "The gross margin was relatively flat consistent with the prior year. We have got good pricing and productivity to offset the inflation as well as the impact of the lower volume. Jim is going to give you a detailed walk, but right now we are estimating 2008 inflation at approximately $150 million for the year and prior to the year beginning that number was between 60 and 80 was our estimate. So that's the magnitude of the increase. We are doing better than in past years in recovering that inflation with price, we are estimating approximately 90% recovery, but that still does leave the gap that we need to fill with productivity improvements in order to ensure that margins don't suffer.", "Cash flow slightly ahead of prior years excluding the impact of the receivable securitization, facility termination, that was about $17 million understandably unwinding net debt arrangement. CDIY revenue all in was up 4%, Europe was 7% organically. Profit rate was maintained operating margin at 14.6%, and that's despite the inflation and the volume pressure we are experiencing around the world. And within our industrial segment, strong sales growth 12%, if they say security up 7%, profit rated 18.7% excluding hardware, but still quite profitable even including the impact of the lost hardware business was 60 basis point less than 18.1.", "Looking at the results on the next chart, specifically zeroing in on the earnings picture, virtually all of these number are contained in the press release on a continuing ops basis $0.98 to $0.95 on the basis on which we began the year and provided annual guidance growing a $1.01 up to a $1.05, so a 5% increase on top of a 6% increase in the first quarter.", "Operating margin down slightly. Tax rate up about 40 basis points, so a little bit of a head wind there and the share count reflects approximately $200 million of buybacks that took place between the fourth quarter '07 and January '08. So all in a 4% improvement in earnings on an apples-to-apples basis, highlighted there in the box as well as outlined in detail in our press release.", "Looking at revenue, 5% increase primarily in the benefit of acquisitions and foreign exchange. I see revenues that add $1.54 billion, up 58 million. The sources of growth in essence organic was flat as 3% volume declined on a global basis was offset by 3% price improvement; 4% from currency, 1% from acquisitions leading to the 5% that you see in two or three different places. Looking within the segments, organically you see CDI vied down 1% as 4% volume decline is almost fully mitigated by 3% price increase. The total 4% growth of course that's the difference between our organic and FX, which we do not include in our organic growth reporting.", "Industrial was up 2% organically. Volume flat on a global basis and price 2%, the rest being currency and security down 2% on a comparative basis with volume down 5%, price up 3%. Again importantly we've talked to the hardware. You will recall we discontinued business with one of our larger retail customers that was announced in the second quarter of '07. It will not anniversary until the fourth quarter of '08 and that's about $12.5 million to $15 million a quarter of revenue, negative headwind if you will. Excluding that good solid growth in security totaled 7% of which 4% was organic. Given the magnitude of that number we do think it's important to point it out because it was a conscious decision and a mutual decision with us and the large customer.", "So simply said, revenues were subdued by weak U.S. market conditions and we were flat in a down market. We think a pretty good accomplishment. Looking on a geographical basis, it's clear from the map that it's a busy chart but we think there is a lot of good important information on it that our diversification and the fact that it is significantly larger percentage of our revenues are out side the U.S. than as little as three years ago is having tremendous benefit.", "That being said perhaps not the benefit as much benefit as is perceived based on some of the conversations we've had with both analysts and investors in the last several weeks or months. Zeroing on the U.S., middle of the left in total down 2%. This is global Stanley, all businesses and organically down 4%, and that's... represents 56% of Stanley Works total volume. Canada is up 7%; it... sorry it's up 11% in total, organically 1%, and that's all currency... overwhelmingly currency of course and that's represents about 7% of total Stanley revenue.", "Latin America strong on an organic basis as well as the total basis, it represents only 3% as Stanley's volume, but good volume growth as well as volume growth price achievement in Latin America. Europe, very interesting and I am going to give you a little more granularity in a minute on Europe, but in total up 15%, organically 3%, and that represents about 30% of our total revenues; Asia up 40%, 32% of which is organic of a low base, but we are gaining tremendous traction in the Asian markets in general and Mainland China in particular; and Australia relatively flat on an organic basis down 1%, total up 12% and Australia represents 2% of Stanley's volume.", "So Europe is about twice as big in terms of absolute terms as it was three years ago and it's growing nicely as well as Latin America and Asia up significantly from a lower base, which is really helping our results and in the sense validating the focus on geographic as well as business mix shift in our portfolio.", "The next chart is something you haven't seen from us in the past, but recent dialogue that Jim and I and Greg, in fact have had with both analysts and investors is focused a lot on state of the European economy in general as well as our European business in particular. So, we thought it would be helpful to put together this chart or just some information all on one page, and it's virtually all available from public sources. But just starting at the top left, you see the last four quarters of European... Western European GDP growth, that between 2% and 3%. 2.9%, 2.9% falling to 2.5%, following to 2.3%. So not a mediocre decline, but certainly far from robust. The colored chart, if you will are just various geographies, what's shaded in green, call them emerging former Eastern European markets, where GDP growth is above 3%. Those markets in total represent only 3% of Stanley's revenues.", "The yellow shaded areas are markets that are, I'll say traditional Western European markets with a few exceptions in red that are growing at 1-3% and those markets, as you see them primarily France, Spain, UK, Germany represent about 23% of Stanley's revenues. And they're growing at less than 3% per year in terms of GDP up until most recently. And then the areas in red Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and others, representing 4% of our revenues are growing at less than 1%.", "Over on the right, those are not randomly selected. Germany of course is one of the larger economies in Europe but it is not a large contributor to Stanley revenues. Those are Stanley's four largest markets in Europe. Now just take a look at the state of those markets; housing in the UK structured down 27% year-to-date. It's the worst market since 1945. The DIY business, the large home centers varies not dissimilar to the home center businesses in the U.S. are down 3% to 4%. So a third to half the rate that U.S. home centers that are thus far reported are down and auto industrial in the UK are flat to slightly down.", "In France the economy is holding up better than most western European countries. Construction's solid but it is slowing, DIY down about half the rate of the UK and about a fifth the rate of the U.S. Auto repair flat to down slightly. And industry at this stage remains positive that plus low single digit but its flattening. Italy less healthy with construction down, DIY flat; industrial is flat as well, automotive down about 10%, and I think no surprise that if there was a construction boom in Europe, most of it was in the south western part of Europe, particularly Spain. Construction permits are down 44% year-to-date in Spain. Automotives down as well GDP basically flat.", "So simply said the thought of European markets being buoyant is anything but true. They have been relatively soft, although not as soft as the U.S. for the last six to nine months and we are faring fairly well in those conditions.", "The next chart is a look at the Stanley business within Europe that we thought would be helpful to overlay one on the other. This is information we normally wouldn't provide on a call or wouldn't get into this level of detail but we think there is enough diversity of opinion out in the world in terms of how we are doing in Europe, relative to the rest of the world and how important Europe is. We put it on our two quarter rolling average basis just to take some of the lumpiness out of the numbers.", "On the left is total Europe and if you go back to third quarter '06 or fourth quarter '06, you see high... mid-to-high single digit volume growth in the black and prices being relatively flat. Of late you see that the volume growth is flat and it hasn't gone negative, but it's basically zero or flat with price offsetting some of the volume declines or the volume flattening. So as an example, in the most recent quarter volume and total up to two-tenths of 1%, price up 1.3% that would translate on that basis to 1.5% growth.", "A subset of total Europe is to the right, which is European construction, CDIY and you see the volatility. If you go back to the same time period, high single or low double digit volume growth, flat pricing has since turned to negative volume growth although low single digits mitigated by some price. So an obvious question is how and why have we held up in market conditions that I think are far less robust than perhaps is the perception. There were a lot of factors going on, first and foremost new product innovation continues to accelerate, simultaneous introduction of products on a global basis instead of Europe trailing the U.S. by six to nine months has had a tremendous is that a tremendous impact.", "We continue to support our brand in all major markets. Facom had its new catalog in March '08, that has been very well received, celebrating the 90-year anniversary of the company. And there are revenue synergies from the Facom acquisition that are now fully embedded. We have had two and half years of collaboration among the legacy Stanley and Facom teams; they are all under one management team in one place. And that too is having an impact relative to the conditions out there. So our conclusion is continuing to operate well in a weakening market that may get weaker, that being said, we want to make it very, very clear, the European market relative to history has been anything but robust in the last six months.", "Let's go back to a more traditional look if you will at our segments the way that we've typically talked to you about them on this call. Most of this has been said. Construction in DIY revenues are up 4% driven by Europe. You see the operating margins flat and our segment profit up $3 million or 4% in absolute terms. Sales up 4% outside the U.S.; you saw that on the maps on chart 5. U.S. is obviously impacted by the weak residential construction market although we're encouraged by the results given the volume softness within the U.S. retail channel. We are clearly gaining share as our volume is down about one-third or less the level of the market in general, and that's just simple arithmetic. We know we're gaining shares of consequence. And encourage that the segment profit rate is held at 14.6% despite the significant inflation and volume pressure.", "Jim is going to show you some numbers and be a little more granular on what's in our press release. But that number has gone up to about 150 million annually. About two thirds of Stanley's inflation always is steel and about two-thirds of our inflation is in the... the steel inflation is in the construction in DIY segment. So this segment holding a 14.6 given the magnitude of inflation in general, steel inflation in particular, and the high steel content within the Bostitch business to consumer tools and storage business is a good achievement in terms of both product innovation mix upgrades and price recovery.", "Moving on to industrial, double digit revenue growth would actively extend at the expense of 220 basis points of margin. Simply said industrial and automotive tools revenues did grow 10%, 1% of which was organic from a very large business there in Europe and a lot of currency effect. Facom continues to do extremely well; revenue is up 20% and 4% organically certainly inline with the market if not slightly ahead. So we continue to be pleased with the performance of that business and the Americas down.", "Engineered solutions were up 20%, more than half of that is from the recent Innerspace acquisition that we have talked about. That's our intelligent part focused on healthcare channels. Solid organic growth and the remainder of the engineered storage business specifically Vidmar, the hydraulics business remains strong in terms of volume and Assembly Tech is holding pretty well given its focus in automotive.", "Segment profit is down, steel inflation, product mix, as well strategic investments and just to give you a little more light on that proto and hydraulics in particular within these segment extraordinary high steel content. They will behind through the third quarter and we can catch up by the fourth quarter in terms of ability to recover via pricing the steel inflation that they've absorbed. And we continue to invest in emerging markets in our industrial channels both in the Mid-East as well as Asia. It's an engine on a platform for future growth. And we think this is... would be the worst time to take off the accelerator in those markets.", "Last, but not... certainly not least is security. What it shows you on a total basis is revenue is up 1%. That being said, 7% without the hardware headwind that we talked about. Segment profits flat on a similar basis as well as the profit rate, flat without hardware, down 60 basis points including the loss of the hardware business.", "We're very pleased with the performance of the Convergent Security business and just to refresh everyone's memory that's the legacy systems integration business at Stanley, it's HSM on international basis, it is the Blick business in the UK, the Frisco Bay business in Canada, and this is where Sonitrol will fit and Tony will talk to you about that a little later on in the presentation.", "Net sales growth up 9%, 5% of which was organic. We're getting operating leverage that we'd hoped for with HSM. And a greater importance to this is our U.S. systems integration margins continue to expand from the successful reverse integration of the legacy Stanley SI business into HSM. Mechanical access which consist of our access technologies business, mechanical and electro-mechanical locking, personal security which is our senior technologies in Bedcheck [ph] business as well as builder's hardware up 6%, 2% organically excluding the hardware and this quarter was about 18 million down due primarily to the loss of the business and a large retailer that as I said early will anniversary in the fourth quarter. And if nothing else the comps will get easier but maintaining that business where it is in light of that orchestrated withdrawal from about $50 million on an annual basis piece of business is holding up pretty well.", "Profit remains high at 18.7%, extra hardware but I don't think we need to apologize for 18.1% as stated and as reported. Now working capital management and cash generation remain a focus particularly in this environment and we're making progress in both areas. I'm going to turn it over to Jim who's going to take you through some of that as well as talk to you about our look going forward for the rest of the year.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, thank you John. First of all inventories were a great story with an 8 day decrease in light of the volume issues; the physical volume reductions that we are encountering which we will talk about in a few minutes. It's really difficult to bring inventories down like that and it can't be done in a haphazard way that's to be done through process and methodical process improvements and that's exactly what's going on with the Stanley fulfillment system as it relates to inventories. So we can look for more progress in inventories as the year goes on and I think that will continue to be a good story.", "Receivables were up quite a bit and 12% to be specific. We are not terribly concerned about that because the vast majority of that was related to... in the administrative calendar, a calendar issue which had to do with where the month closed and that should take care of itself by the fourth quarter, may continue into the third quarter, but should be out of that by the fourth quarter. So receivables, we have no material delinquency creep that we have analyzed very carefully and haven't... don't have any real issue there, and payables continues to be a very good story. So we are able to improve the turns from 4.5 to 4.8, and we expect to close out the year well over five turn, so good progress there.", "The cash flow and the company's cash generating capability continues to be an excellent story with good solid cash flow for the quarter. It would have been even better had it not been for the fact that we terminated a $17 million receivable, securitization facility, and no longer need that facility given that we have $800 million in liquidity outlines out there right now, so we decided... left to determinate that cost of $17 million in the quarter. But we continue to believe that receivables will generate cash in 2008. So on a year-to-date basis, we are at about $138 million of free cash flow compared with 152 last year, down 14. If you take way the effect of the terminated facility in effect, we are tracking to last year's levels, which is we are very high or highest ever.", "Moving onto price and inflation; this has been a really incredible phenomenon in 2008 like nothing we have seen since John and I have been here. It's certainly probably hard to inspect the 70s, when we as a country experienced this kind of inflation. Our estimate started the year if you recall back at the February analyst meeting, we indicated that we thought inflation would be about $75 million. Today that number is 2X the 75, and basically at $150 million. We could have had a $0.70 per share negative impact from that inflation had we not responded in a very crisp, robust way.", "So our price recovery continues to highlight the company's strong inflation forecasting and also just price recovery discipline. And you can see that we are expecting to recover 80% back in the initial timeframe. We upgraded that to 90% on last earnings call. And we still, despite the fact that we are going to have $150 million of inflation, we still believe that we will recover 90%. We've already taken most of the actions that are required to accomplish that.", "And in this environment, you really need a robust price recovery mechanism in order to preserve the margins and the latest culprit in the inflationary trend area is not surprisingly steel, and the steel companies have gotten very aggressive with tearing up contracts and not honoring commitments and so forth, resin, purchased products also factors. But now steel is really the big culprit there.", "Moving onto guidance, the 2008 guidance that we issued in January of 420-440 assumed organic sales of roughly flat to up 1% and price about $60 million which was near 80% of the 75 million inflation that I just talked about. So price would have been about a point of sales, 1.2% to be exact. So at the time in order to get to 0% to 1% organic sales, we were assuming that physical volume would be essentially down a point roughly and I will come back to that in a minute.", "If we take now the effect of the discontinued operations which primarily involve the sale of CST, but also some smaller product lines totaling about $60 million which we announced in mid-June as well as the recently closed Sonitrol acquisition which has a $0.02 dilutive effect in 2008. On an adjusted basis that guidance would look more like 410 to 430.", "Now as we indicated in the last call, we were suspecting that the second half economic environment could be difficult and it certainly has fulfilled that expectation. So we put in place a contingency plan which provided for $0.20 benefit in '08, net of $15 million of restructuring and as it turns out, the volume impact is now going to be about $0.50 a share which is what we suggested it might be last time, if the economic difficulties were to continue.", "So we've implemented those contingency plans subsequent to the last conference call and as a result of that proactive action are able to preserve the earnings base. So the 3.90 that you see here relates to $3.88 continuing operations number for last year and we now believe that organic growth will be down 1%, but the fact that the price is now up about two points, really means that volume is down 3 to 4 points.", "So the physical volume impact from the recessionary conditions in some of our markets is really severe and I would like to think in terms of the ability to draw down inventory with a 3% to 4% reduction and still preserve an earnings base. It means that there is a lot of good work going on in the productivity area in the company as well.", "We'll move on now to significant 2Q events. Pleased to announce that the Brett Bontrager, our Vice President of Business development and our President of our Stanley Convergent Security Solutions was named an Executive Officer by our Board that press release as Greg mentioned had been issued and we congratulate Brett on that achievement.", "We also agreed to sell our CST/Berger Laser leveling and measuring unit which was about 80 million in revenues. We announced that in mid-June, hope to close that shortly, next couple of weeks. We were able to achieve a selling price of $205 million and we also at that same time announced plans to divest about $60 million in revenue of some smaller non-strategic businesses during the year.", "And worthy of note, the CST/Berger business have become non-strategic, because it was getting... it had a competitors from the high-end that were coming down and competitors from the low-end that were kind of coming up; it was in the middle. When we bought that company back in 2004, we were envisioning that it could become a growth platform if we were able to acquire some of the other companies on the higher-end.", "As it turned out for various reasons, none of those were available for acquisition and we were really left with no degrees of freedom. So the decision to sell that business was made this year, and we were able to achieve a very healthy $205 million for something we paid about $64 million, four years ago. We also announced the acquisition of Xmark for approximately $50 million. It's located in Ottawa, Canada. It develops and markets RFID based systems to identify and protect people on assets in the healthcare market. Its principal products focus on infant protection in hospitals and wander protection for Alzheimer's patients and the like. As many of you know, we have a small kind of fledgling business, but extremely a high growth and profitable business in the security segment that specializes in healthcare type security like this.", "And then we also announced the acquisition of Sonitrol for $276 million. A very exciting and meaningful acquisition, and as Greg mentioned, we have Tony Byerly, COO of the North American Convergent Security business here to share some highlights. Tony would you please talk about Sonitrol?", "Tony Byerly - Chief Operating Officer, North American Convergent Security", "Thanks Jim. As Jim mentioned, these are exciting times in electronic security industry. I have been in the security industry for nearly 20 years, and I have seen only a handful of industry defining moments. One such moment began roughly one and a half years ago with the acquisitions of HSM by the Stanley Works and then combining of it with the Stanley System's integration business creating Stanley Convergent Security Solutions. That moment really has fully evolved now with the Sonitrol acquisition. The combining of Stanley CSS with Sonitrol creates the third largest electronics security monitoring company in the U.S. based on total revenue.", "Now Sonitrol will help both the direct and the franchise network go-to-market approach also about 125,000 customers and Sonitrol is best know for its industry leading audio verification technology; and as a result, reports the industry's highest apprehension rates and lowest dispatch and false alarm rates making it a law enforcement trend.", "Sonitrol's revenue is broken down by 53% coming from monitoring and service, 34% from installation, 8% from equipment and product sales, and 5% franchise growth. The combining of Staley CSS and Sonitrol not only creates a third largest overall provider as I mentioned, but also solidifies Stanley CSS as the second largest commercial security monitoring provider.", "Now the company reports $110 million in total revenues and through its audio verification technology reports one of the most stable customer bases in the industry with low attrition rates and an average customer life of 12 years.", "There are numerous strategic benefits to the Sonitrol acquisition. First it increases the overall CSS global platform to over 700 million and the Stanley Security solutions platform to over 1.6 billion. As previously reported the acquisition will be $0.02 dilutive in 2008 as Jim mentioned, $0.04 accretive in 2009 increasing by an incremental $0.05 each year thereafter.", "There are also numerous similarities between the two businesses. Both are commercially focused. Both drive an RMR, a reoccurring revenue business model, both are known for quality and high customer satisfaction and both have a solid national account program. The acquisition certainly brings increased skills of operations in national accounts towards the organization overall.", "In addition this allows us to really focus in on specific vertical markets for example the education market. Sonitrol is a leader in the K through 12 market and Stanley Securities Solutions is well positioned in the higher education market.", "Now in addition to Sonitrol's audio verification and intrusion alarms which they are very well known for, the company also offers a full range of suite of services as well as security systems including access control, video surveillance or CCTV, fire alarm detection and other security equipment products such as video monitoring and online access control management. Now with the close of Sonitrol behind us on Friday and as with previous D&A acquisitions, the integration is already in progress and has been carefully planned.", "I am very pleased to have Todd Leggett, who is actually Sonitrol's former Senior Vice-President of operations to join our team as our Vice-President, General Manager of Sonitrol operation. Todd has a considerable amount of experience in the industry and specifically at Sonitrol. Now joining Todd and leading our integration efforts will be Jim Coplain, [ph] who is one of our most seasoned leaders and who has a considerable amount of acquisition simulation experience as well.", "Of course Todd and Jim are joined by the entire team and we'll go through the many years of experience on this call. We don't have the time. But all integration activities will be carefully monitored and controlled and we're excited to have Sonitrol as part of the Stanley's CSS platform. I'm going to turn back to Jim. He's going to talk about transition.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Tony. We're pleased to have Tony and his team in-charge of integrating Sonitrol. They did a great job with the reverse integration of HSM. So the same team that led that. Now working the Sonitrol acquisition and we're looking forward to great results there.", "As we look at the portfolio transition, this is truly remarkable metamorphosis over the last few years, from '02 to '08, where with $2.6 billion company with 65% of our revenues in construction and DIY in 2002, with the largest customer totaling 22% of our revenues.", "By last year, we had built the security business up to about 31% of the total revenues, construction DIY was down to 40%, and industrial had grown to 29%, and we were $4.5 billion. So close to double in size. And then as we now adjust for the divestiture of CST and the acquisitions of Sonitrol and Xmark, you can see that the various portfolio moves that we announced in the last quarter have had a notable effect on the portfolio composition. So you can see the security business would now account for about 35% of the revenues, rapidly approaching the size of the construction and DIY business, which is 37%; and of course the industrial is roughly the same.", "So in general, continued progress in the tough environment... tough operating environment, but some of the challenges in this environment are also creating opportunities for us, and we continue to take advantage of those. Just a very, very brief refresher on the growth platforms. We continue to allocate our capital into three... our three major growth platforms industrial and automotive tools, mechanical security, and convergent security. So here you've seen a number of acquisitions that are more focused on the convergent business in the last year or so, but would not be at all surprised to see some progress in one or two of these other growth platforms over the next coming months.", "And I'll wrap it up now. We took a little bit longer than we usually do with the overview, where we had a lot of content. Needless to say, the inflationary conditions have accelerated. We've implemented the strong recovery actions, price management we talked about the rigorous process that we have enabling 90% recovery. Good news also is that we are able to recover price in CDIY much more effectively than we have in past years. We are looking to recover close to 80% this year of our inflation in construction and DIY. So, with the Chinese inflation and so forth have helped that out, and competitive dynamics are such that that we are able to do that.", "We will encounter a lag in the price inflation recovery in the third quarter. So for those folks that are modeling, please factor that in. We've quantified that in the press release, so that should be easy to do. We're also going to provide a schedule for those of you, who are interested later today that will break out the quarters for '07 on a recast basis, which will reflect the discontinued operations. So, I will caveat that by saying that that will change from quarter-to-quarter here, and we will continue to provide that on an ongoing basis this year. It will change as some of the $60 million transactions that we talked about are close than they actually are removed from continuing operations. So it will be a challenge to keep up with it, but we'll will provide as much information as possible to make it easy.", "The markets themselves are offering no sign of rebound, we talked the length about that. So the organic growth forecast is now down 1% to 2% for the year. The volume was even steeper volume decreased. John talked at length about Europe. Contingency cost actions have been implemented. We expect to be able to preserve our earnings and cash flow base amidst these weak markets and we absolutely should be well positioned for a successful '09 regardless of what the conditions might be with strong price momentum with carry over from the cost reduction actions coming into '09.", "The hardware loss will anniversary in the middle of the fourth quarter and we will have a substantial amount of restructuring in the base... in the '08 base, and the Stanley fulfillment system is gaining traction. So, as I said a minute ago, we are taking advantage of the market conditions performing well, but also taking advantage of this opportunity to advance the portfolio.", "And we will turn it over for Q&A at this point.", "Greg Waybright - Interim Vice President of Investor Relations", "ey Carlie, at this time, we will turn it back to you for the Q&A session.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Peter Lisnic with Robert Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. It's actually John on for Pete. Can you guys just talk about with M-CSS, the 5% organic growth was recurring revenue kind of growing at that rate also and kind of as a reverse integration that you've done, is that fully impact now?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. John, this is John; I'll take it although. Tony could probably take it even better. The simple answer is yes; the percentage of recurring revenue was actually increasing although that's what we modeled. As you'll recall HSM recurring revenue was dramatically higher than the Legacy Convergent Stanley business. So in total, the weighted average is increasing and in fact the percent of the proportions, excuse me, of reoccurring is increasing a little faster than the rates in general.", "At this stage, 18 months in, it's a little premature to declare victory, but all I can say is we are pleased beyond our initial expectations and we were cautiously or highly optimistic upon acquiring HSM. The team is still in place, and I think the best indication to that is we've just gone and made another $275 million acquisition in similar space and empowered the HSM team and former HSM team and Brett Bontrager to integrate that business. And without over simplifying, the process worked extraordinarily well with HSM, and Tony and his team along with Todd Leggett from Sonitrol, who is an industry veteran, we hope to apply the exact same type of methodology with Sonitrol and get the same kind of initial success and maintain the momentum as we did with HSM.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and then my follow up; just the free cash flow generation has stayed really strong kind of relative to everything else. What are your uses of kind of that free cash flow looking forward?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well it... as we have said all along historically two-thirds of our free cash flow has gone to strategic acquisitions, one-third has been returned to the shareholders and equally split between dividends and buy backs. Going forward, you could expect that to continue. I mean we think Stanley stock is a good buy right now. That being said that's a one time opportunity and it doesn't advance our portfolio strategically. The acquisition pipeline is robust with strategic acquisitions within the reach of our own cash flows.", "You'll recall we did announce a modest increase to our dividend the 41st consecutive year. So I think it is fair to say $500 million in cash flow on an ongoing basis going forward. I think the two thirds of it will be used for strategic acquisitions and a third will be returned to the shareholders primarily via dividend, opportunistic buyback when and if the pipelines are not full or we feel that our stock is so depressed, while it is not strategically advancing our portfolio, it's the best short term use of cash.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Thanks, good morning guys.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "James good morning.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Impressed with the good color on the conference call today. Two questions. One, on the industrial margins. Could you give us a little bit more color on how much of that is the pricing gap versus mix and any additional color specifically on the mix. And secondly just following up on the last question about the cash flow usage on the robust acquisition pipeline. Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the various growth platforms. What type of... where may be any type of color that you can give on the tools versus security what you are seeing out there and domestic versus international?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Jim will... Jim will take both of those, Jim and I'll add on it if need be.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We are looking for international acquisitions in the security business there with some success in the pipeline. And as far as the tool industry, the tool industry is supposed to consolidate at some point in time. I have being waiting nine years since I have been here for it to happen. I would suggest that this maybe a fairly opportune time for that, simply because of the stresses and pressures on the cash flow and the earning statements of certain tool companies that are sort of in the middle. Similar to how we were with CST. They're not private label and they're not the world's best brand at hand tool company, they are somewhere in between and they are getting squeezed. So there's some of that going on and I suspect this industry will likely consolidate at some point in time and I don't know whether it will be this year but if it does, we'll be in a good position to be a participant in that.", "So that's really the growth platforms. As far as the industrial profit margin of 220 basis points, I'd say it's about a third of each. I mean the strategic investments where we did a fairly substantial amount of consulting work in product simplification and complexity reduction to help us with our inventory reduction in a Stanley Fulfillment Systems initiatives, and that was about a third of the issue and then product mix is, we're finding particularly in the automotive repair business in industrial, a little more tendency to avoid the big ticket items and of course the financing state of the financing markets hasn't helped since many of those credits that when they sell tool boxes and so forth to end users are... they tend to be sub prime or close to sub prime in nature and the availability of financing is constrained at this time obviously.", "So, there tends to some of the higher margin storage type business in the automotive repairs is being stressed a little bit. And we just add some other mix issues here and there throughout the portfolio in industrial but are probably less structural and it's temporary in nature. And then the other third is this price gap that you talked about when you end up with... and the industrial business in particular; they tend to be on a little slower pace as far as the industry goes, recovering price because they have catalogs and things like that. That's all changing in this environment but sometimes it takes a little time to change behavior patterns and so our businesses are working hard to change those patterns and they range from businesses like hydraulics, which I think is implemented something like 6 price increases this year to proto which has implemented 1 and is now about to implement another one and everything in between. But with the recent spike in inflation they got caught little bit more than the other businesses with unanticipated, unrecovered inflation but it will be temporary.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "And back to your acquisition commentary. Have you seen any changes in the multiples out there or was it still that sellers premium that's out there?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No Jim since... glad you asked. I was going to add on time permitting. The good assets, obviously there is very little private equity competition for those assets. That being said, there has been very little price capitulation on the good assets. I think it would be a tough time to sell poorly performing assets or assets without a great growth profile or opportunity for growth with some synergies, but if you look at businesses that we've just sold as well as businesses that we've acquired, the numbers aren't crazy, but the good businesses continue to sell at a rich premium reflecting their growth and income potential, and I think as long as those are the types of businesses being sold that's our expectation for the next 6 to 12 months. Full and fair prices for the good assets.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Okay. Thanks again for the color today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "The first question just on the raw material and offsetting actions; if the raw materials were to sort of stabilize here, which unfortunately doesn't look likely, but what would that 150 be in terms of carry over into '09. And am I to assume also that the actions that you've taken, you are expecting an incremental 40 million benefit on the cost savings?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Want to try? What was the second part of the question?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The 40--", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Is this the offsetting... what would flow through on the raw material side?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we've been playing catch up; when you are chasing inflation, you are playing catch up. So if inflation stops, price exceeds inflation when it stops. So we are not the... the cost actions are not for price recovery. And you are right, it's a hypothetical question, because in reality, we are not expecting the inflation to stop, and we are not expecting our price actions to stop as inflation increases. So it's very hypothetical. What we are girding against with these cost actions is a continuation of an economic slow down. And we don't know whether that's going to happen just like we didn't know whether the second half was going to be as bad as it is, but we are prepared with a $40 million carryover and $30 million of restructuring in the 2007 base, which we may or may not use next year depending on circumstances. We are prepared to weather whatever kind of storm comes our way with quick solid earrings and cash flow performance.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Okay. And just I guess secondly, where would you expect over the next two, three years to see your product mix continue to go? I mean would you see security getting up into the... in the 40s? How would you think about consumer DIY? Are you comfortable at the size it is today or do you think you can see that shrink a little further?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I guess it depends on whether it's an absolute terms, Mike or as percent of total. As Jim showed, when we call--", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Percent of total.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I understood. As we closed '07, we're going to be close to a third of third of third. That was our interim objective. We said for a long time we'd like security to be 50% of the total in five years. That's probably slowed down a little bit. We said that three years ago and we continue to grow. Our objective with CDIY, with the sales of CST, there are two good businesses within CDIY and they are big. We think we can grow them organically at a rate slightly above the market, keep them at about the 1.7 billion, where they are currently growing at low to mid single digits, which means they will decline as a percent of total. We don't have a problem with CDIY businesses in general, it's the home center dependency we are trying to stay away from.", "So if I had to speculate, they... you said two to three years, they probably could go down to as low as 25% of the business while the combination of security and industrial would be 75 with security growing at a little faster rate than industrial borrowing any of the major consolidations that Jim talked about.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Okay, great.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't want to shrink any of our businesses in absolute terms however. Jeff Ansell's team is doing a great job growing a CDIY businesses with innovation, mix, and pricing in a market that's down high single or low double digits.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is open. If your line is on mute please unmute your line. There is no response from Eric's line. We'll continue with the next question from Nigel --", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We will try someone else, we'll go back to him later.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I have some questions on Nigel's behalf. Within CDIY, I was hoping you could give some color on Bostitch and the consumer tool business.", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "What you are looking for related to Bostitch and consumer tools?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just some additional color on how those business are performing.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "They are both performing consistent with expectations. In fact consumer tools and storage is performing maybe better than we would expect given the market. And Bostitch is about where we hoped it would be. It's a little bit frustrating, but not discouraging. Specifically we've taken $50 million worth of cost out of the Bostitch business. We've inherited... we've absorbed a lot of inflation. We've got almost $50 million of prize with the Bostitch business to do and in doing all that margins have remained about where they were in the last two quarters. We need little bit of help from the market place on Bostitch to get margins back up to the high single low double digits, where it's been historically and where is our target. But if there is a perception that Bostitch is losing money, it's simply not the case. It's making money, its making money in the low single digit operating income for couple of quarters in a row. Doing a great job internally with price, manufacturing restructuring, and tremendous SG&A constraint weathering a market that's down. About 50% of the Bostitch business is CDIY and 50% is industrial. Neither of which are terribly strong and about 25% of the Bostitch business is outside the U.S., that business is very healthy. So Bostitch is running really-really hard to stay in place and with a little bit more pricing which the market, I think is ready for and a little bit of help through the market, I think we will get it back to where we want it to be and where it rightfully should be at this stage of the process.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and then going to the restructuring, where specifically are you guys looking to restructure?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well restructuring is broad based. It means marginal facilities, SG&A cuts people not as opposed to spending for which we reserve. It's pervasive across the company. Obviously we would across all businesses across the company. Obviously we do less restructuring and our highest potential growth there is for fear of cutting that growth. So basically what it is, is getting certain businesses that are facing marketplace headwinds downsized so their infrastructure is more in line with the reduced size of the business and that applies to every business in Stanley whose volumes and revenues aren't up.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay great. And then one last quick one if you don't mind, are you guys currently paying full spot prices for steel?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. We'd like to think with our global sourcing capabilities we're at or below market but it depends on what one does call... what one is establishing and agreeing to be the spot price. We'd like to think we're doing a good job leveraging our global sourcing capabilities. What we do know is our prices are going up as fast as everyone else's, its just from which base we are talking. So the magnitude of the increase from the base is unprecedented. We would like to think we are paying a little bit below full spot prices because we are buying ahead to the extent we can and that has given us a bit of benefit.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Anna Stromberg with NAV Capital. I am sorry; the next question comes from Ted Hover [ph] with Stanopoint [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. Just going back to the cost recovery question. I guess I wanted to, I don't know if you would actually kind of break this out but what percent of your cost inflation is primarily attributable to steel. Just trying to get a sense so we can kind of see what's going on with steel price.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And how much is actually driving that and my second kind of... second... my follow up question would be what type of price recovery do you need to get across your product line to be able to get your targeted 9% price recovery?", "James M. Loree - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, the second one is going to be very difficult to answer, the first one is easy; I talked to it earlier. Roughly, two-thirds of all of our inflation is steel, the rest in order of descending priority is resin, nonferrous metals, and of course there is no... there is little bit more stability in non-ferrous metals right now and steel, last year nonferrous metals in fact were greater, cause of inflation and steel. So roughly two thirds of our cost inflation is steel, followed by resin, nonferrous metals and then various other inputs. What kind of price we have to get, I mean it's simply arithmetic, it's 90% of our $150 million is about $135 million, you need 135 million on a $4 billion revenue base. So globally across Stanley that's 3% to 4% on an annualized basis for the year. That's going to vary dramatically by business where some are up 20 and some are flat. But simply said, we need $135 million on $4.5 billion, which is 3% to 4% on an annual basis with tremendous discrepancies or variations across the Stanley businesses. I hope that answers your question; if not, for more granularity, Greg can walk you through that offline.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And this concludes the Q&A session for today's call. John, do you have any closing remarks?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "This obviously was a very busy quarter. And we feel good about the results given the environment that's out there. We've got a lot of work to do on pricing. We think we have the right people in place to do it. And borrowing any major news, we will talk to you again on October. Thanks for your interest this morning.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

(BDK) Q2 2008 Earnings Call July 25, 2008 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Rothleitner - VP, IR and Treasurer", "Mike Mangan - CFO", "Analysts", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Susan Maklari - UBS", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Black & Decker Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Rothleitner, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Mark Rothleitner", "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and welcome to Black & Decker's second quarter conference call. On today's call, our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Mangan will discuss our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2008. His comments should take about 15 minutes and then, we will answer your questions.", "In keeping with SEC requirements I advise that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Black & Decker Corporation, please review the reports we have filed with the SEC including the 8-K filed today.", "In addition, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included on the Corporation's website under the Investor Relations sections.", "Now, I will turn it over to Mike.", "Mike Mangan", "Thanks Mark. This morning, Black & Decker announced earnings per share of $1.58 for the second quarter. We exceeded our guidance of $1.40 to $1.50, as a result of operating performance inline with our estimate and roughly $0.12 of favorability in tax expense. This is a decrease from $1.75 per share in the second quarter of 2007. Given the continuing macroeconomic pressure and commodity inflation, we are pleased with our performance.", "Sales decreased 3% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, also inline with our expectation. Our GAAP volume was down 7%, price was negative 1% and foreign exchange contributed 5% to sales.", "The US market remains weak for housing related products and deteriorated in the Automotive and Consumer Sectors. Conditions in some Western European markets also weakened this quarter, but our performance in the rest of the world remain strong, especially in Latin America, which had better than 20% growth again in the second quarter.", "Operating margin decreased to 8.4% for the quarter. Sequentially, this is slightly better than the first quarter excluding a restructuring charge. Gross margin decreased 190 basis points to 32.7%. The main driver was approximately $35 million of component inflation, which was somewhat better than our forecast. We successfully reduced inventory 4% year-on-year, even with currency adding 4 percentage points. This had a negative effect on our gross margin due to unfavorable fixed cost absorption on lower production volumes.", "In addition, we incurred cost for excess inventory which we liquidated or wrote-down during the quarter. SG&A expenses rose 70 basis points, as a percentage of sales, entirely due to negative leverage. SG&A spending decreased despite 4 points of unfavorable currency, as our restructuring and other cost control efforts read through meaningfully.", "Free cash flow was $157 million in the quarter versus $163 million last year. We are pleased with this performance, particularly in inventory management, under difficult circumstances. Following negative free cash flow in the first quarter, this brings the year-to-date total to $46 million. We expect solid free cash flow in the second half, and remain on track to convert approximately 100% of net income for the full year.", "We repurchased approximately 1 million shares during the quarter, nearly 3 million in the first half, and 7.3 million over the past four quarters. Our approach to share repurchases remains opportunistic and our cost was roughly 7% below the average closing price for the quarter.", "As I mentioned, taxes were favorable to our estimate, with an effective rate of 21.1%. This reflects favorable settlements, which occurred in the quarter. As we have discussed, as a result of FIN 48, our quarterly tax rate will be more volatile than in the past. Lower taxes, share count and interest expense all helped reduce the EPS impact of a difficult business environment.", "Now I will discuss our individual businesses. Sales in our worldwide Power Tools and Accessories segment decreased 10% year-on-year. This was the same as in the first quarter with similar trends for most key parts of the business.", "In the US Industrial Products Group, sales decreased double-digits reflecting lower demand across all key categories and channels. In addition to the weaken construction environment, we continue to face cautious inventory management by our customers.", "Sell-through at the home centers was down approximately 7%, which was an improvement from the first quarter and less severe than the decline in orders. Going forward, we expect a net benefit from product listing changes due to gains at key customer.", "In the US Consumer Products Group, sales decreased by more than 25% for the quarter. As we discussed last quarter, this business has been effected by reduced pressure washer listings and transition from the Firestorm sub-brand to Porter-Cable These two changes accounted for over half of the Group's sales decline this quarter.", "Sales of outdoor products also decreased, following a large load-in during the first quarter, but were nearly flat year-to-date. Excluding pressure washer, sell-through at the home centers decreased mid-single-digits. As in the industrial business, this represents an improvement from the first quarter driven by outdoor products.", "In total, we expect a less severe sales decline in the second half for the consumer group, as we get past the peak season for pressure washers and begin shipping the new Porter-Cable line.", "In Europe, sales declined mid-single-digits for the quarter. Credit tightening and slow residential construction costs, sales pressure in the UK, Southern Europe and Scandinavia. Customers in these countries were also reducing inventories in anticipation of further weakness. This directly affected the industrial market, but the consumer business also slowed during the quarter.", "Eastern Europe and Middle East continued to contribute solid growth, but not enough to offset the trend in Western Europe. Our Latin America business continued its impressive sales growth, exceeding 20% again this quarter. All key product lines grew double-digits, of that each key region. In Asia, sales continued to grow, including a double-digit increase in China.", "Return on sales for the Power Tools and Accessories business decreased this quarter to 7.9%, roughly three quarters of the decline was in gross margin, due to component inflation, pricing, cost absorption and inventory write-downs. SG&A spending was down a solid 5%, but not enough to match the decrease in sales.", "In our Hardware and Home Improvement segment sales decreased 5%. While the housing downturn continued to affect this business, results were significantly better than in the first quarter.", "Sales for the Kwikset and Weiser Lock business in the US declined at a mid-single-digit rate. The new construction channel continued to drive the decrease with more than a 25% decline.", "At retail, sales increased this quarter, reflecting the continued success of SmartKey and favorable order timing. The Price Pfister faucet business posted a low single-digit sales decrease, in contrast to a decline in the teens last quarter. As with the core lockset business, the new construction channel was down significantly, but we grew at retail as we started to see benefits of recent line reviews. This should continue to offset much of the residential construction weakness in the second half.", "Operating margin, for the Hardware and Home Improvement segment decreased year-on-year to 9.3%. Most of the decline, this quarter, was in gross margin against our best quarterly margin in 2007.", "HHI has reduced inventory roughly $30 million or 13% since year-end and, therefore, faced negative cost absorption. Other productivity improvements, however, continue to offset commodity inflation.", "In the faucet business, cost of store resets pressured margins again this quarter. SG&A percentage increased due to lower sales, but actual spending was down. It's also notable that operating margin in this segment improved sequentially from the first quarter due to better volume.", "In the Fastening and Assembly Systems segment, sales were essentially flat. This is our most global segment and we continue to post solid gains in Europe and Asia. We believe our market share is rising as our automotive division sales have gone faster than automotive production in these regions.", "In North America, however, sales fell double-digits primarily due to the severe decline in domestic automotive production. Operating margin for the Fastening segment increased 20 basis points to 16% for the quarter, as we continued to manage cost carefully.", "Now let me discuss the outlook for the rest of 2008. The macro-environment in the US remains very weak especially for our sectors. This has not changed meaningfully since we gave guidance in April. In Europe, it is becoming clear that a construction downturn in some countries will affect us in the second half and we now anticipate a sales decline for the year.", "While some of the pressures in the US consumer business eased somewhat in the second half, we face a tough third quarter comparison for Kwikset due to the SmartKey launch. Our key new product launches for the second half remain on track and should help mitigate the impact of the economy.", "The new line of Porter-Cable tools, including a competitively priced Lithium Ion drill will start shipping in the third quarter. We are excited about this new line and expect it will be well-received by light contractors and high-end do-it-yourselfers. ", "Under the Black & Decker brand, we will expand the SmartSelect and AUTO SELECT lines in the US and Europe. DeWalt will be introducing a number of key corded SKUs in the fourth quarter and has continued to expand the 18-Volt franchise with products such as a Cut-Off tool and heavy-duty work lights. And HHI, Price Pfister is expanding its lavatory offerings with a body spray shower system and a high-efficiency trough faucet.", "In total, we continue to expect a mid-to-high single-digit organic sales decline for the third quarter and full year. If exchange rates remain favorable, this would result in a low-to-mid single-digit decrease in reported sales.", "On the cost side, steel and resin prices have risen sharply since our call in April. As we have discussed in the past, most of our commodity exposure is in purchased components, which reduces and delays any impact on our margins.", "Our forecasts for year-on-year inflation have increased by $10 million to $145 million for the year. Therefore, we now expect full year operating margins of 8% to 8.5%, excluding the first quarter of restructuring charge.", "In addition, our full year net interest expense forecast is anticipated to be around $65 million. Our estimate includes an assumption of 26% tax rate for the year, reflecting favorability in the first half.", "We expect a diluted share count of approximately 60.5 million shares in the third quarter and 61 million shares for the full year. In total, we expect diluted EPS in the range $1.30 to $1.40 for the third quarter and $5.25 to $5.45 for the full year. This full year range excludes the $0.20 restructuring charge we took in the first quarter.", "In summary, Black & Decker continues to weather a very difficult environment. A few points, first our operating performance met our expectations, again this quarter. Second, the Latin America business continued its outstanding growth trend. Further product development remains a key competitive advantage and we are excited about the Porter-Cable line and other products launching this fall.", "We continue to execute cost reduction plans and decreased SG&A spending. We generated strong free cash flow of $157 million for the quarter. And remain on track for 100% full-year conversion. We reduced inventory significantly with the year-on-year change inline with sales. We repurchased stock at attractive prices and continued evaluating potential acquisitions with a disciplined approach.", "And finally, after nearly $500 million of commodity inflation over the last five years and a severe residential contraction, we remain solidly profitable with the strong balance sheet.", "Our management team is the strongest in the industry, and has the experience to get us through this downturn in a strong position. We remain confident that we can execute our strategy effectively to drive growth and shareholder value, when our markets recover.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I will turn it back to the operator and we will answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "And your first question will come from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning, guys.", "Mark Rothleitner", "Good morning.", "Mike Mangan", "Good morning.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to ask you about your margin trajectory. Obviously with the forecast you headed back to, or maybe even below the lows you saw in 2001. Now, obviously, the environment is pretty different, much more severe, sales declines, much more substantial commodity cost inflation.", "Last time around, you obviously had a fairly dramatic response with the restructuring and recasting your manufacturing footprint. My question was, is there potential for an encore? I am not saying exactly the same thing. Obviously you can't recast your manufacturing footprint twice, but are you considering dramatic actions of any sort or to respond to what has happened? Or is it the case that you're pleased with your positioning and it\u2019s simply a matter of weathering the storm?", "Mike Mangan", "I guess somewhere in between the issue, I guess it will be the best way to put it. Certainly, we do not have on tap or considering a major restructuring plan to address our cost structure because can only think our cost structure is second to none in our industry; however, we'll continue to take action.", "You saw a relatively modest restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter with a $20 million charge. We took some actions to consolidate some operations and take out headcount.", "Followed that on with some more significant actions in the first quarter, closed two plants, our UK facility as well as the Decatur facility that was manufacturing pressure washers; announced a significant headcount reduction as well as a restructuring of the management structure of Power Tools business.", "Those actions will throw-off a $20 million of savings this year and incremental $20 million again next year. That really is just now going to begin to find its way to the P&L back, the savings are very much backend loaded here for 2008.", "As we look forward, we will continue to take actions if appropriate, given another selling environment and in the cost environment. Maybe one of the notes for here is since year-end; we have reduced headcount in the corporation by 10%. We came into this year with 25,000 employees. We're now at 22,500. So, we've taken by many measures, significant actions. We'll continue to take actions if necessary, but we don't have on the drawing board, if you will, a one big restructuring plan as you would have saw back in the 2001 timeframe.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "How about your portfolio of businesses? As you're facing this environment, where we could see depressed demand in a number of end-markets for several years, perhaps, might want to assume that commodity inflation persists at these high levels or even worsens, has your perception of the attractiveness of any of your businesses changed because of this? Or are you pretty happy with the mix of businesses that you have right now?", "Mike Mangan", "Mix of businesses and the segments that we're in today, we very much like and continue to plan to be in all three segments going forward. We've made significant progress in the last five years and globalizing our businesses. Some of the benefits that we've seen in our Power Tools businesses have gone through this slowdown.", "Going forward, with our product roads and our investment in people has really been directed outside the US to be able to continue to capitalize on the opportunities there. So, you'll seethe business change and that will becoming a much more global company. But in terms of the categories and areas where we participate in, we very much like where we are today.", "", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Just one other quick question on the Firestorm to Porter-Cable transition. In last quarter, it was just in one retailer, Lowe's I believe. How is that going to be rolling out across the rest of the year? What was the staging of that as you roll that out more fully?", "Mike Mangan", "Yes, it is rolling out later here in the third quarter. About 17-plus SKUs has been rolled out, portfolio of corded and cordless Nickel Cad as well as Lithium Ion products. From a retail standpoint, the product will only be in Lowe's. We will have broader exposure globally as well at other channels. But in terms of a retail presence, it will be just at Lowe's.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Good morning.", "Mike Mangan", "Good morning, Mike?", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "How are you, Mike?", "Mike Mangan", "Good, thanks.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "The first thing you mentioned in the raw materials, other companies have raised their raw material impact a bit more than you have. Any comment to that, in part it was due to other components reducing and delaying the impact from the higher commodity costs we've seen. Do you have any sense of this 145 for this year, what that might be in terms of a rollover effect into '09?", "Mike Mangan", "Don't have a number for you at this point, Mike. Once we get closer to yearend, we'll start giving guidance into '09. But given the pressures that we've seen here in 2008, it\u2019s reasonable to expect, we will have some incremental inflation rolling into '09. Orders of magnitude, I think, is less than the 145, but I don't have a number for you at this point.", "And given where we are, in the cycle as we get to in-and-around next year, inflation comes through, primarily our component contract. So, feel pretty good that the 145 is a pretty good number for the year. I would not expect that to change markedly absent some huge change in commodity prices.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay. And, I guess just on that in terms of the supply chain management, which you've done a great job. How do you say your thinking is in terms of, maybe moving even out of some of the areas that you're in right now in Asia in terms of the manufacturing into even further lower cross countries be it, Vietnam or Eastern Europe or other opportunities that you might be looking at? Or is it do you see those types of moves as, like you've said before, just singles and doubles instead of home runs in terms of order of magnitude?", "Mike Mangan", "In large part, our three centers are manufacturing in Asia and China and Mexico and Czech Republic, I think, position us pretty well. We're exploring other areas of the world. I am sure you have heard a lot talk about places like India and Vietnam and we're exploring opportunities there. Do not expect a wholesale change in our manufacturing footprint.", "But over time, you could see some movement. When you get into things like infrastructure and quality of workforce and what not, we still see, today, China being the most cost effective place on the globe to manufacture things like Power Tools. That could evolve over time into some of those other markets. We're watching those and exploring those carefully, but at this time, we are not expecting any wholesale change in our manufacturing footprint.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay. One last question, if I could? And I'm sorry if you hit on this earlier. I was late on getting on the call. But could you address what you're seeing right now in Europe and in terms of the quarter and what you've baked since your guidance in terms of back half outlook for European performance?", "Mike Mangan", "Europe, as I mentioned, in the remarks, has slowed. We mentioned some of that on the first quarter. I think actually, there after question on the last conference call about what I worried about.", "And as I mentioned the time I worried about the economic environment in Europe. What we saw were some, double-digit declines in our sales and markets like the UK and Nordic and Iberia, again markets that were very much driven historically by strength in housing and you are seeing some of that pull back.", "Eastern European markets, Middle Eastern markets, again very, very strong, double digit positive growth. Central European markets like Germany and France, relatively flat performance. So, depends on where you are, which is driving overall results. As we are about to the year now, where we would have expected potentially some growth in Europe during 2008, we're now expecting our sales for the year will be down.", "Given some those weakness we're seeing in some of those markets that I just mentioned. And as we get into the back half, sales will be in and around flattish year-on-year, based on some new product introductions, as well as some promotional activities that we have planned in our European business.", "So, again, while we were seeing, obviously, some mid single-digit growth, I believe, last year in a lot of these markets, this year overall, it will be down low single-digits back half, based on comparisons in some products and promotional initiatives, in-and-around flattish.", "Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman and Associates.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates", "Good morning, everybody. Mike, with respect to the business, obviously there is a lot of uncertainty and one of the things I think people really can't get their arms around, is how much of earnings erosion could you have in worst case scenarios and realizing that the back half of the year you are assuming gets better.", "If you took the play devil's advocate and assume it didn't get better and the economy just continue to spiral downward. Can you help with us some sensitivities on, maybe, what the down side?", "Is there a possibility in your mind that you could see the company in any way not make money? I mean, is that even a feasible possibility and, maybe, if you help frame your bear case in the worst circumstances that you can ever imagine, what that would look like for the company? I think that would really help people, because certainly looking at sharp earnings, where you would be trading right now, would be clearly a very significant upside, just on valuation.", "", "Mike Mangan", "I guess from a management speculation here, I feel in many ways, but in going through a worst case scenario, as we look at our performance here in 2008 The one of your questions, do I see any reasonable scenario, where we do not make money and the answer, that is no.", "I do not see us not making money in the back half in the third or the fourth quarter, any reasonable scenario to the company. We're not expecting markets to get better in the back half. If you look at the components that we sell into, like housing, we're not expecting to get better, we are not looking for the consumer to strengthen, and we\u2019re not looking for the repair market to get better. In fact, we're expecting all of those markets to continue to be down.", "If you look at international, in contrast to discussions earlier this year, we're expecting that market to be flat to down. And when I say flat to down meaning some mix of our overall businesses. Europe is under some pressure but certainly other markets like Latin America and Asia continue to generate very, very solid growth for us.", "On the industrial-commercial side, the commercial construction market certainly is not getting any better, its trending negatively, that's factored into our forecast and obviously, with the Fastening business, we're looking at some pretty tough scenarios here relative to automotive production. ", "So, when we factor all of that together, this quarter versus a quarter ago, actual outlook for the overall end markets it actually weakened a little bit. Having said that, we've got a very strong product growth that's rolling out for the back half. We've got promotional activities slated with a number of customers that we feel good about.", "So, we think as we look to the back half, these are obviously very good and reasonable numbers and setting the expectation. Could it be worse? Sure. Could it be better and could be as well.", "So, we're copying off of, as you may recall some pretty weak numbers back to 2007. In particular the fourth quarter of 2007 it was a worst case scenario it may just (inaudible) for book with some challenges in markets as well as we had a recall built into our number there as well. ", "Again look at the 525 to 545, I mean I think that\u2019s a very realistic range based on a very cautious outlook for the back half of the year.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates", "I guess to follow-up on Mike's comment or Nishu I think who asked about margins that being below where they were in the last downturn. One of the concerns would be if I told you that housing starts to go down another 20% to 25% and the consumer would weaken significantly further.", "Can you see a floor in margins because of your efficiencies and productivity and all the efforts that you had to keep around on the cost side, if demand were to substantially fall further from here? And I think, you had talked about at one point that you thought margins were at worst case would be around these levels you're at today, under any circumstances.", "I'm just trying to get a sense from you, if you take it down another leg, which is definitely our outlook, we think we're going to have another leg down, not status quo, but significantly lower, can you frame for us what kind of margin pressure and bear any scenario you might experience?", "", "Mike Mangan", "I can't give you a number there. I mean obviously it will be a function of what that environment looks like if they gets weaker, will put pressure on our margins. It's realistic to assume that pricing, obviously, would be a key component of that as well as what happens with commodities. I'm sure you can develop a better scenario where and we go into depression or something very deep recession, where housing continues to weaken and commodities go to the moon and we never get price. That would impact our margins.", "Having said that, any kind of realistic scenario for an outlook, I think operating in and around this, low8 margins is a realistic expectation for you, where you should expect us to perform. Could we drop the rate or that certainly is possible? I would not at this point call that probable.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates", "Great, thanks, Mike. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Mark. How are you?", "Mark Rothleitner", "Fine, thank you.", "Mike Mangan", "Good morning, Sam", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Couple quick questions, first off, this maybe my own error in terms of my notes, but on your corporate adjustments eliminations line in the segment reporting, I thought, perhaps, that your original expectations were for that line to be about $80 million or $85 million dollars outside of translation adjustments for the year and it looks like for the first half, you are running fairly well below that. Is there something structurally different or some way we should be looking at that line on a go-forward basis? Or is there a catch-up in the second half?", "Mike Mangan", "I think we had guided you in the first quarter Sam, around $70 million, I would tell you today $65 million to $70 million is the right number to think about. That's slightly better than what we talked about in the first quarter, but not dramatically different. That 80 number is, I'm not sure where that came from.", "If you look to the first half here, about $70 million in both of the quarters, I mean that's a pretty good run rate to think about The one structural change year-on-year and why that number is lower than 2007 is we have lower pension expense.", "So, that's a $20 million-plus favorability year-on-year, absence some other increases. Again then, including some productivity, lower cost that we've generated in corporate with headcount reductions and other cost control initiatives places in the $65 million to $70 million range for 2008.", "And I would again think about it, $70 million per quarter. So, I look for 17 third quarter, 17 fourth quarter. Now that\u2019s fourth quarter number will be, I guess, down from the number because it included a one-time environmental charge, if you take that environmental charge out, then it would be up from that fourth quarter number.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Got you. Second question, this is more strategic, I guess. What your thoughts, Mike, about where you are with Lithium Ion? Both with the Nano and the overall assortment vis-\u00e0-vis NiCad and are you looking to, perhaps, back off LI until maybe a next-gen comes around next year?", "I know you had that drill it\u2019s going to be released in the third quarter. But generally speaking, what are your thoughts competitively, about LI and Black & Decker's competitive positioning thereabouts?", "Mike Mangan", "Continue to see Lithium Ion being a part of the market, certainly probably outside the US, a bigger part than inside the US I guess maybe just to clear a few points there. First off, if you look at Lithium Ion overall, if you look at our positioning in premium drills overall, including Nickel Cad and Lithium Ion, we actually have done very well and certainly have maintained our position.", "I guess the one thing that gets noticed by folks, and again you need to segment Lithium Ion like you need to segment all Power Tool and cordless markets. In the compact Lithium Ion market, one of our competitors, as I am sure now Makita has had a drill that has been pretty successful.", "That's the one place in the Lithium Ion range where we've not been as successful as we'd like. Near-term, that will be addressed with some marketing and promotional activities over the longer-term, near-term it will be addressed with a product offering.", "So, going forward, Lithium Ion continues to be a critical part of our portfolio, a critical part of our overall strategy to address the cordless market. We continue to have very strong market shares when you look at the premium drills, including both Nickel Cad and Lithium Ion. We would expect that to continue. You'll continue to see product rollouts, particularly as we get into 2009 to further strengthen that overall portfolio. And it will continue to be a meaningful part of your business.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Last question, expected pricing in the second half down 1% in the second quarter on the one hand you had competitive pressures, on the other hand you have raw material inflation. Do you anticipate in the third and fourth quarter pricing to continue to be down that 1% to 2% range? Or how would that deviate from current levels?", "Mike Mangan", "I have two comments. First off, inherent in our guidance is that our pricing for the year will be flat. So, that would imply there is still a little bit of positive price in the back half. At that point, in the back half, across both our HHI and Power Tool businesses and across the segments within that, we're rolling out. Some have already been rolled out across portfolios and across channels.", "Price increases in the back half. Some of those have been done. Some of those are yet to come. And we're in the middle of negotiations with a number of our customers regarding the timing and scope of those price increases. So, we're expecting positive price for the back half. We have modeled that relatively conservatively. Again, we're in discussions.", "So, I'm not going to get into specifics about by channel, by product line and specific amounts. But we are getting and going after price.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Do you consider mix part of price or part of volume?", "Mike Mangan", "I guess mix is mix. Mix would be different than price.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay. So, mix will be included within, when you are citing volume versus price versus FX, mix is included within the volume of category?", "Mike Mangan", "I mean, if we go down to break down to categories, sometimes we actually isolate mix. But generally, if it's not isolated, yes, it would in volume. It would not be in a discussion around price. We do not benefit our price calculations for mixing up. Our price calculation is like-for-like product year-on-year.", "So, product X sold for $10 last year and $11 this year. That's $1 positive price. If we change that product, we discontinue the product from last year, with a new product this year, and even if those prices go up, that is not included in the price calculations. So, it\u2019s like-for-like, year-on-year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Very helpful, thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.", "Mike Mangan", "Hi. Good morning, David.", "Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research", "Good morning. This is Leah Villalobos in for David. Just a quick question about your promotional spending. How is that comparing year-over-year?", "Mike Mangan", "Overall promotional spending during the second quarter in Power Tools business, an example, was down, year-on-year, down significantly, and our consumer business, up a touch, and our industrial business. So, the combination of those two was down year-on-year", "", "Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research", "Okay. And what are your expectations for the remainder of the year?", "Mike Mangan", "Promotional probably in-and-around flat, I don't have those specific numbers in terms of the breakout of our forecast. But we do have some increased promotions plans for back half. So, flat to maybe a bit down year-on-year.", "Leah Villalobos - Longbow Research", "Terrific, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Mike Mangan", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good morning. A couple of things. First of all, the pricing efforts, how is that going in an environment where we have seen some deflation? How are the competitors behaving and the retailers responding to your efforts to put through price?", "Mike Mangan", "Some have been completed; now retailer likes to accept the price an increase, given what's going on in the cost environment, understand the need for that. We have some specific evidence of our competitors increasing price, when you get into certain channels, a lot of that communication goes via letter and we've actually seen some of those letters go out from some of our competitors increasing price, when you get into big-box environment those are one-on-one discussions with the client.", "So, while we had some anecdotal evidence, noise, that the price increases are being requested, across our competitors, don't have specific evidence of that happening. And again, a number of these are in various stages with across all channels. There have been discussions in across all channels. There have been certain product categories acceptances. So, we're getting in across against portfolios and channels.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Secondly, can you talk a little bit about the share situation in Power Tools? It sounds like at least on the industrial side and perhaps on the consumer side there are some expectations of share progress in the second half of the year.", "It sounds like from a Nano or Lithium standpoint that the traction has been okay to this point from your offering and you've got some, perhaps some exciting corded tools coming out. Can you talk about why you think the share gets better in the back half of the year, if that indeed is the assumption?", "Mike Mangan", "This year, I think we have mentioned before, we add a key customer here; we did pick up some significant listings. I speak to it, because I think everyone knows, it\u2019s Lowe's obviously with the Makita and Milwaukee exclusives with Home Depot, they have exited Lowe's and we've picked up a number of SKUs on the DeWalt side in response of that.", "We saw a bit of that benefit in the second quarter of that will be further as we go into the third and fourth quarter. And we do have a number of other new products. I mentioned a couple in the script, but a number of new products coming out. So, when you say share, tend to think about that a little bit differently but certainly we have listing increases going on that will benefit our back half as far as comparability and favorability as well. That will aid the second half as well..", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then lastly, you talked about growth in Latin America. How big is the Latin American business?", "Mike Mangan", "That business is orders of magnitude. I am trying to grab a number here, one second. Okay. So, Why let me just [sort for] that number? I'm looking through a stack of paper here and rather than hold everyone up here. We'll circle back with you in terms of order of magnitude.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay, perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Susan Maklari with UBS.", "Susan Maklari - UBS", "Good morning.", "Mike Mangan", "Good morning.", "Susan Maklari - UBS", "Despite the pullback in the stock this quarter and the stronger cash flow that you saw, your share repurchase slowed relative to the first quarter level. Can you just comment on how you're thinking about that? And maybe how we should be thinking about future share repurchase?", "Mike Mangan", "Our policy is opportunistic so if we take look at our market and make judgments about when to buy. Again we bought 3 million shares year-to-date, so orders of magnitude gets that was about 5% of our outstanding. So, we think we've been very active.", "We will continue to consider that as a use of our cash here in the back half, along with acquisitions. So, in terms of specific guidance, I can't tell you or predict very exactly what we'll do other than we do have some constraints, which is to make sure we maintain a solid balance sheet.", "From a policy standpoint we want to remain solid investment grade and maintain our current ratings which would put some limitations on our ability to buy back stock. But within the investment grade rating, meaning if we were to get downgraded, we'd have significant capacity. In any event it's a opportunistic play and we will make decisions as we go through the quarter.", "Susan Maklari - UBS", "Okay. And then you noted that you continued to look at acquisition opportunities that come up. Can you give us any updates there is in terms of are you seeing any increased activity? Or any changes in the overall deal flows that you're seeing?", "Mike Mangan", "Certainly, the competitive environment for acquisitions has changed with what's going on with financing availability. So, as a strategic buyer, we're in a much better position. Prices, I wouldn't say, have changed dramatically. Even the multiples come in a bit in some of the businesses that we're looking at are in sectors that have actually continued to perform pretty well.", "So, got a handful of deals that we are looking at. A couple that are well-along the way. Always predicting if they get to the finish line is difficult. But we do have a couple of small, smaller, bolt-on type acquisitions that we're excited about and are well-along in the process so, hopefully, we will bring those to the finish line yet in 2008.", "Susan Maklari - UBS", "Okay. And then, just one follow-up there. You had always recently guided us to more smaller bolt-on kind of deals. As the deal environment changes, though, is there any thoughts or maybe you would do something that\u2019s a bit larger again?", "Mike Mangan", "Certainly a possibility. I mean, ideally, if we could do acquisitions in the $200 million to $500 million side we would consider that ideal. Realistically, in terms of near-term, don't have much of a long list of deals that would fit that category. So, I think you should continue to primarily think of us as a bolt-on player doing deals from lets call 20 to 250 it\u2019s probably the more likelihood, then, say 250 to 500.", "Susan Maklari - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "Good morning, everyone. Mike, I thought I heard you right. Were there inventory write-downs in the Power Tool segment in the quarter?", "Mike Mangan", "Yes, there were. We talked about it in the prepared remarks. One of the impacts on our second quarter margin were some actions that we took to write-down our inventory.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "All right, I'm sorry, I missed those. Was there a number provided?", "Mike Mangan", "No, I didn't. But it impacted the quarter, orders of magnitude, about plus $12 million. Some of that being of excess write-downs and as well we took some actions on some [DPX] inventories that impacted the quarter as well.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And then, if you just look at the intangibles on the balance sheet, any concerns that we might have to suffer through some write-downs given how the end-markets are at this point on the intangible side?", "Mike Mangan", "Obviously, we test that or consider that every quarter and go through a very formal testing process every year. And we think from a goodwill stand point, our intangibles are in right shape.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "Alright. And if I look at the inflation hit that you took in the quarter, its $35 million, if I remember right, the number in the first quarter was $55 million. So, it looks like it\u2019s ramped down and maybe back half implication is some ramping down? I assume that just you being able to offset the increased cost with price. Is that the right way of think about things?", "Mike Mangan", "That inflation number is incremental inflation and incremental cost side. So, again it gets into timing of contract roles and how much you're carrying. And so, to your point, we have 55 in the first quarter; announced 35 here; 145 for the year.", "The third quarter will probably be not unlike the second quarter in terms of amount. And then anniversary a lot of these historical increases the fourth quarter, from an incremental standpoint should be as best, let's call, in and around the $20 million to $25 million dollar range.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Michael [Sheridan] with Cobalt.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my call, gentlemen. I have two questions. I listened to one of your domestic competitors with kind of the same footprint that you guys have regionally. And I think that what you guys are saying strikes me is much more of what I would expect to hear from companies.", "And I wonder, is there some difference between, I\u2019d think that the markets in Europe that you're working in are fairly driver by the same monetary economic trends, demand trends, broadly speaking. Do you have any thoughts on the widely-diverse views on Europe, both residential and commercial construction, going forward? And activity and demand?", "Mike Mangan", "I'm not sure how widely-diverted the views are. I guess the only thing I could, maybe, potentially offer and not knowing exactly what you're talking about? I mean Europe is\u2026", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Well, I could tell you, Stanley Works sounded more upbeat and maybe I don't understand the businesses because I'm new to the Group, to covering the Group.", "Mike Mangan", "And again to define Europe, the very, very broad term.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Right of course.", "Mike Mangan", "And folks\u2026", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "But it all has tight money in my mind.", "Mike Mangan", "Well, the UK, some people consider that to be Europe; some people do not consider that to be Europe.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Well, yes.", "Mike Mangan", "The UK and I am not trying to be all the technical.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "No. I understand.", "Mike Mangan", "UK market has been a market that had some very robust growth. It was driven by housing and housing it taken a hit there. So, that is pulled back, places like Iberia, again very much affected by housing growth that pulled back.", "Other driven more Central Europe markets like, Germany, Benelux, France, actually we have seen reasonable performance in those businesses. Stanley is an example I know did an acquisition a couple years ago, which is centered in France.", "So, again, I don't know, how diverse their product and sales are, but France has been a market at least from our position as well has been doing okay.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Okay.", "Mike Mangan", "It hasn't seen a pull back up. There are more centered around a French and Central European sales environment, they maybe seeing some better dynamics, than you'd see in the UK or Southern Europe. Because the places like Eastern Europe continued to grow very, very strongly.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Unless you look at hungry, which is not really growing, but thank you, your answer was helpful. And one another question just in the region if you talk about, I believe you talked about European retailers as well bringing inventories down and would that be at the distributor level as well?", "Mike Mangan", "Well, I guess the comment that we made is that given some of the slowdown that we've seen in some of those markets. We don't think our results were impacted per se by people often talk about inventory corrections, where we saw retailers take massive actions here to reduce inventory.", "Obviously given the economic environment and the slowing that they're seeing, obviously, we are seeing, some retailers take action to bring down and tighten up the inventory positions given the current state as well as some of the projections for weaker environment.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "So on a sequentially basis quarter-over-quarter it wouldn't be normal to think at receivables should have grown, should they Q1 to Q2? Like for you guys from that particular type of end market?", "I mean I think receivables should have come down; right? If inventories are coming down and sales are going through?", "", "Mike Mangan", "We got a couple of dynamics going on there. One is we've got seasonality in our business, where sales are significantly higher in the second quarter than the first quarter.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Okay.", "Mike Mangan", "Year-on-year they're down. So, you got to watch your comparisons there.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Yes.", "Mike Mangan", "Like that we have got some depending on where those sales are, in general, outside, it's a general statement outside of North America, you will see longer terms than you would see within North America.", "So, on average in terms in Europe and Latin America are a higher number of days and you see generally in North America.", "And then thirdly, if you gets into the nuts and bolts, with the timing of sales within the quarter. So, sales don't always slow evenly within the quarter. So, year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter, depending on the sales are more front loaded in the quarter or back loaded in the quarter can impact receivables as well. I mean our day sales outstanding went up a few days year-on-year.", "", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Okay.", "Mike Mangan", "It can be significant part of that has to do with mix. Again the day sales thing is because of the relative strength of outside of North America versus inside of North America and as well there is a technical issue relative to a number of our European customers pay on the last day of the month.", "This year our quarter for the second quarter ended on June 29th. So, our quarter-ended before the calendar quarter ended. So, I'm sure we saw some significant cash inflows on June 30th, but that have no part on this quarter.", "", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "For you guys do you happen to know what that cash delta would have been, as you rolled forward to June 30th? Just in dollars, just for my own verification?", "Mike Mangan", "That\u2019s not in my company and so.", "Michael Sheridan - Cobalt", "Okay. I'm sorry, one last question. And then, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s escaped my mind. Your answers have been very helpful. I'll bother you with the question that I've forgotten another time. Thanks for your help.", "", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. You may continue with any closing marks.", "Mike Mangan", "Thank you very much, Mark, Roger and myself, the team will be available this afternoon to follow-up on any additional questions.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  ", "I would like to introduce Mr. Greg Waybright, Interim Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Greg Waybright", "Thank you, Laura.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning.  On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley\u2019s Chairman and CEO, and Jim Loree, Stanley\u2019s Executive Vice President and CFO.", "I\u2019d like to point out that our third quarter earnings release which was issued this morning and a presentation supplementing today's\u2019 call which we will refer to during the call are available on our investor relations website. ", "This morning, John and Jim will review Stanley\u2019s third quarter results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. This entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay of the call will be available beginning at 2 pm today.  The replay number is 1-800-642-1687 and the access code is 57411309.  As always, please feel free to contact me with any follow up questions after today\u2019s call at my number which is 860-827-3544.", "Finally, two brief comments before we proceed.  One is a reminder that we issue and/or update earnings guidance on an annual basis in our press releases at the beginning of each quarter and we cannot comment on such guidance thereafter.  However, if our guidance changes materially, we will issue a press release and conduct a related conference call.", "Secondly, we will be making some forward-looking statements during this call.  Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainties.  It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K which we filed with today\u2019s press release and in our most recent [34-F] filings.", "With that, I will now t urn the call over to Jim Loree.", "James M. Loree", "Thank you, Greg.  During the recent turbulence in the financial markets, some of the characteristics of our financial strategy have become critical success factors in today\u2019s environment.  These would be things like strong cash flow, conservative financial position, and proactive liquidity management.  Certainly we\u2019ve been able to accomplish all of those in recent years and just some of the highlights as we sit here today is our long-standing strategy to remain Single A Single Unsecured and A1T1 Commercial Paper have served us very well.  We were the first industrial in the United States to issue bonds since September 10 when the dislocation began on the 24th of September.  We were able to issue $250 million of senior unsecured notes, five year paper, and we issued that at 6.2% which was just a hair over 300 over Treasury\u2019s which in today's market looks like a pretty good coupon. ", "During this time our access to the commercial paper market has been uninterrupted and our commercial paper pricing today remains very attractive at about 25 to 75 basis points over the fund.  We also took early and decisive action this year to enhance our liquidity.  In February we upsized our revolving credit facility to $800 million from $550 million and we extended the majority out to February of 2013.  In May we also increased our commercial paper line from $550 million to $800 million, increasing our capacity for short term liquidity.  ", "Our cash flow remains strong.  Our estimate remains at or slightly below $500 million.  For 2009 as we look forward we see no reason to believe that is going to decrease materially.  A lot of that has to do with the Stanley Fulfillment System.  John will talk about that later.  This is an initiative that\u2019s been in place for many years but has gained considerable steam in the last year or two and as a result we\u2019re getting excellent working capital performance, and our working capital terms are improved last year, they\u2019ll improve again in 2008, in spite of a really gut-wrenching unit volume situation based on external conditions.  Our dividend record has been maintained.  We currently are at about a 3.5% yield and that dividend is very safe and reliable.  So we are a very strong company with a solid foundation.  ", "With that as context, let\u2019s talk about the external environment.  We all know that the economic conditions are very difficult right now with the instability in the credit markets although in recent days that looks to be stabilizing somewhat, but around the world, credit markets have created all sorts of dislocation in the economy.  We see currency as very volatile right now with the euro, the British pound, the Canadian and Australian dollars all of which are currencies that we have exposure to based on our worldwide activities, all down by about 15% since the beginning of the quarter just a few weeks ago.", "In the US, I don\u2019t need to tell you folks that it\u2019s tough, the industrial production is beginning to show big declines, capacity utilization is decreasing, housing starts are at really incredibly low levels, down 40% versus prior year.  Unemployment has spiked to 6.1%, and while the slowdown is nothing new in Europe it is clearly intensifying as we went through the third quarter, with industrial production down in the Euro area, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and so on.  Steep decline in construction permits, especially in Spain, the Nordic companies, and the UK, and basically GDP slowing in all of Europe.  You can see the percentage declines in Germany, France, Italy, and we too saw as lowdown in our European business in the third quarter, especially after July.  ", "Moving on now to the quarter, we recorded earnings per share of $0.98 down 7% versus prior year.  We were still able to obtain a very healthy 14% operating margin in the quarter.  Revenue growth was 1%, we\u2019ll talk more about that in a minute, but the story here was preservation of earnings per share and limiting the decline to a modest amount in the face of minus 4% organic growth and as we go through the charts I\u2019ll give you more color on that.  ", "The diversity of our end markets was helpful in the quarter.  It certainly dampened the effect but did not negate the sales volume contraction.  It\u2019s important to note here that about a third of our business is in the residential construction, only about a third of our business in residential construction, and even within that, only about half or so slightly over half, is in the US, so about 17% total US residential construction.  As you can see, we have a diverse array of other sub-segments that we are exposed to.  12% of our revenue is in commercial construction, 8% in retail, primarily through our security business, and then health care, education and government comprising about 12%.  Automotive repair including the Mac business and [Sacko] about 9%, and then the remaining 24% associated with industrial which includes core industrial manufacturing type industrial as well as  utilities, distribution, power, rail, oil, and gas, etc.  ", "So we continue to have exposure to a diverse array of end markets around the world but in some respects that has been very helpful for us in terms of dampening the blow from the economic issues.  Moving on now to revenues, as I mentioned, we experienced significant unit volume decline, perhaps as significant and more pronounced than in any quarter that I can recall since my time here in 1999.  Beginning in 1999 we look back certainly more pronounced than any quarter in the \u201990, \u201991 time frame when we had an economic recession and going back all the way to 1981 to see a quarter where we had that kind of a unit volume decline and we all remember... Those of us that do remember 1981 remember that.  It was a very tough economic environment.  I think this one is equally as bad.  The breakdown for the revenue if you look at it, the minus 7% volume decline was offset by about 3 points of price which was consistent with our expectation and organic growth in total was down 4%.  ", "That was offset somewhat by currency which was up 2 points and acquisitions which added 3 points of revenue in the quarter, so we managed to eke out a modest 1% revenue growth in the quarter.  When you look at it by segment, construction, DIY, was down 2%, industrial was flat, security up 7%, and when you step back and peel off the onion layer there and see that the organic performance was down 5% in construction DIY down 4% in security. Now I have to say with security, excluding the hardware business which is suffering the loss of its former major customer and that will anniversary in the fourth quarter.  That was a $55 million loss for that business.  When you look at it excluding that loss, the security portfolio performed at a 1% organic growth rate and so that at least was positive.  ", "As we look to the fourth quarter, we can expect slightly better volume, we think probably more in the neighborhood of minus 5% to minus 6% as the hardware loss anniversaries, and we have some load in from a relatively significant win at one of our larger customers in the CDIY consumer tools and storage segment.  In addition, price is likely to stay strong, if not a little bit stronger.  Acquisitions are likely to pick up in the fourth quarter vis a vi the third and currency I think will probably flip to a slight negative on a year-over-year basis so all in, we expect fourth quarter sales to be approximately flat with prior year.", "So moving on to gross margin, with all that negative pressure from unit volume declines, it is truly remarkable that we were able to achieve record gross margins, third quarter gross margins at this time and furthermore, we did not really experience the classic historical sequential dip in the third quarter that we do normally experience.  You can see we had it in \u201906, we had it in \u201907, and we avoided it in \u201908 and this margin rate accretion was attained with a 7% reduction in year-over-year -- [blank audio]", "Operator", "Excuse me, Mr. Smith?", "James M. Loree", "-- contributed to both the working capital reductions as well as substantial productivity and you can see even with the pricing success that we had and now I\u2019m looking at that 3Q \u201908 VPY points box, the light blue one there, where it says inflation net of pricing cost us 2.2 points in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.  Even so, we didn\u2019t recover all of our inflation although our full year estimate is still consistent with what we mentioned last time.  I\u2019ll get into that in a minute.  But we were able to achieve a 1.5 point increase in productivity despite the headwind from the lost absorption from the volume and the decline in inventory decrease.", "So Greg\u2019s story on margins, I think what you see here is the fundamental shift in how we are managing the business which has evolved over the last five years or so, but as I recall back in the \u201902 time frame, \u201901, \u201902, the gross margins often average 33% or thereabouts and today we\u2019re knocking on the doorstep of 39% so very significant change in the company.", "As we move on now to the pricing inflation update, we\u2019ve encountered steady inflation increases in our estimates, I\u2019m looking at the left hand side of the chart right now, throughout 2008, up to a point where we were forecasting as late as the second quarter earnings call, $150 million up from $100 million in the first quarter earnings call, and up from $75 million based on the initial guidance that we released, and over that time frame our ability to recover that inflation with pricing power and pricing execution has been strong.  In fact, it strengthened during the year as we went from an 80% recovery in the beginning of the year to a 90% recovery even as the amount of inflation doubled in the estimate, and as you can see, if you look at the history there, in the \u201905, \u201806 timeframe, it\u2019s about $50 million a year, so triple that this year and the pricing has been there to protect our margins.  ", "When we look at the sources of inflation this year for, and that\u2019s on the right hand side of the chart, you can see that of the roughly $150 million of inflation, approximately half of that has been encountered in relation to steel, and then another $20 million in regard to freight, so two items there that have the seeds of stabilization and even slight dips have been the source of most of our inflation exposure.  Now that will take a few months to work its way through into the P&L statement, but we are cautiously optimistic that in fact it\u2019s probably the one silver lining in the backdrop of all the other issues in the economy that we probably will experience some lowering of that inflation rate as we go into \u201909.", "Then we have a look at SG&A.  SG&A was up $23 million in the quarter and when you kind of look into that with a little more detail, you see that $11 million of the $23 million was related to acquisitions.  $7 million wage inflation, salary inflation.  $5 million of foreign exchange related increases.  $9 million of emerging markets and other strategic investment which relates primarily to increasing the size of the sales and service force in the electronic security business was $9 million and then the cost reduction, some of which we implemented in the post 2Q earnings release accounted for a $9 million benefit, so we\u2019re continuing to monitor and place emphasis on SG&A control.  Clearly this will be a significant focus for us in the fourth quarter and as we go through 2009.", "Then as it relates to free cash flow, simply put, it was a great story.  Our third quarter free cash flow was up $19 million at $138 million in the quarter, a very impressive performance led by a $66 million favorable swing in working capital which we can attribute almost exclusively to the success of Stanley Fulfillment System which John will comment on in a few minutes.  Then our year-to-date performance, we\u2019re right at about the same level we were, slightly above, $4 million above, the same place we were last year, a year in which we generated a record $457 million of free cash flow and we see no reason why at this point that we can\u2019t have another great year for cash flow, so with one quarter to go, we\u2019re able to reiterate our total year estimate of free cash flow equal to just under $500 million and that\u2019s a very good sign for the health of the balance sheet and our ability to pursue capital deployment both in the fourth quarter and as we go forward.  ", "Looking at working capital in a little more detail there, as you can see from this chart, the inventory was down 7% to $571 million.  That was a five day improvement.  The receivables were flat with prior year, a one day improvement, and I would also note that on the receivables that are delinquencies in this area have actually improved as the year has progressed, again directly attributable to the Stanley Fulfillment System.  Our accounts payable, despite the inventory decline, were up 9% and that\u2019s largely attributable to the fact that as we were absorbing price increases that resulted in the inflation, we were requiring the vendors that were giving us increases to extend their terms with us, so those payments are in accordance with terms.  Those payables are in accordance with terms and up 9% or a five day improvement.  ", "With all that put together, we achieved a 4.8 working capital term performance, a 0.4 point improvement over prior year, and John will talk in a few moments about what drove that  As we look at the balance sheet, the balance sheet is in good shape.  It\u2019s very, very consistent with the same time last year.  Our debt is in the same zone.  Our equity is up and our cash position is about the same and this was achieved after spending about $380 million on strategic acquisitions year-to-date.  ", "So with that said, John Lundgren will now walk you through some more color on the Stanley Fulfillment System and touch upon some other elements of our performance and I\u2019ll turn it over to you, John.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman and CEO", "", "Thanks, Jim.  For those on the call, I understand there may have been a minute or two of technical difficulty, particularly during Jim\u2019s comments on market conditions and RN markets so rather than go back and trace over that, I will be sure to touch on the high points that may have been missed although they were on the visuals.  ", "As Jim suggested, we feel the third quarter\u2019s been a strong performance in a relatively difficult environment.  An important question of course is what is driving the performance in general and the continuously improving cash flow in particular?  The answer is our Stanley Fulfillment System.  It is a transformation of processes, systems, as well as structure, with three very important objectives.  First and foremost, we\u2019re striving for a scalable platform that\u2019s capable of supporting an ongoing acquisition growth strategy, in other words, a business that\u2019s much larger than the current business we have today.  ", "We\u2019ve had good success with our integration history.  Our business is twice the size as it was five years ago but we\u2019re working very hard to be sure that the platform that we\u2019re putting in place is capable of handling a business much bigger than our business today as we look down the road.  Second, we\u2019re focused on a material improvement in working capital terms.  Jim\u2019s already showed those results.  That\u2019s freeing up substantial cash for productive uses.   Historically, as we\u2019ve suggested in our press release, two-thirds of the cash has been used for acquisitions, a third has been returned to shareholders pretty much in equal proportions on the dividend and stock repurchases, and we\u2019re suggesting or we\u2019re looking at a slight modification to that going forward as we respond to the short term environment in which we\u2019re working.   ", "Any improvement in working capital terms at the expense of service would clearly be a losing proposition, so the third key objective of the SFS process is to have best in class service levels which will ultimately drive organic share gain which we\u2019re experiencing despite the down markets.  We focus on lead times, fill rates, and all forms of customer related execution.  Fill rates have significantly improved from year ago levels or the levels over the last 12 to 18 months and they\u2019re currently at or approaching record levels across virtually all our businesses, so SFS is a top knot initiative.  That being said, it involves all Stanley employees from the executive office to the factory floor.  ", "What are the elements?  What\u2019s creating the value or importantly, what are the drivers behind SFS?  Specifically there are three.  First and foremost, lean.  We\u2019re implementing lean throughout the plants, throughout our supply chain, throughout our entire organization with a focus on cycle time, inventory reduction, and service excellence.  Each metric is systematically reported and recorded and reviewed at all levels of the organization.", "Second, we\u2019re re-engineering four processes, and we\u2019re standardizing them company wide.  We\u2019re striving to achieve excellence in customer facing processes as well as extract the maximum efficiency from back room activities.  Another way to look at that very simply is if it touches a customer or an end user, it\u2019s done locally in the marketplace, and if it doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s done one way in one place or a limited number of places across Stanley.  ", "Last but certainly not least, we\u2019re implementing SAP as a company-wide systems platform.  We\u2019re not implementing a big bang with insurmountable business risks.  It\u2019s a sequential execution where we\u2019re focusing on the businesses with the greatest needs or the businesses where we\u2019ll achieve the greatest benefits in a very logical time sequence way in terms of both expense and internal resource allocation, and the process is proceeding nicely.  All of these activities are well underway or in a full implementation mode.  ", "So let\u2019s move briefly to some of the individual segment results.  Then we\u2019ll wrap it up and open it up for questions.  Our security segment was clearly a bright spot in the third quarter.  Strong revenue and profit performance in general and outstanding if we exclude the hardware business that we\u2019ve talked about the loss of a major customer about a year ago.  Specifically, revenue\u2019s up 7%, 14% without hardware, profitability up 8% in absolute terms, it was 27% excluding the hardware loss, and the profit rate improved 30 basis points to 220 basis points without the loss of hardware.  We reference that in our press release.  Jim touched on it.  We lost a $50 million in annual business with about a 40% gross margin just about a year ago.  That will anniversary midway through the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll move on from there, but I think it\u2019s important to remind everybody that was a tremendous headwind that our mechanical security business faced, roughly $12.5 million worth of business a quarter since February that will anniversary in the middle of the fourth quarter.", "Our convergent business performed extraordinarily well with 21% sales increase driven primarily by the Sonitrol acquisition but we continued our margin expansion with the US systems integration business, primarily as a result of the successful reverse integration of the legacy Stanley systems integration business into HSM and the thus far successful integration of Sonitrol.  The mechanical access business grew 5% in total, 2% organically, excluding the impact of hardware, and as already suggested, the segment profit rate was aided both by execution in all of the businesses within security as well as productivity and pricing actions.  ", "A brief look at our most recent acquisition.  The French company, Generale de Protection, is a leading independent provider of electronic security solutions in France and Belgium, and we\u2019re enthusiastic about this acquisition because it creates what we\u2019ll say an HSM-like continental platform for Europe for security expansion.  You\u2019ll recall that most of our European business right now is UK-centric and this is a major geographical expansion into continental Europe.  ", "GDP has the direct sales model to small and mid-size commercial customers.  Again, the focus being on commercial or B2B.  Very highly recurring monthly revenue content, approximately 60%, with a 75% customer renewal rate.  Very high numbers for the industry.  It\u2019s roughly $87 million at current exchange rates and annual revenues with operating margins at or above 20%.  Basically it will be earnings neutral in \u201908 and a modest impact in \u201909.  We paid roughly $166 million or 118 million euros and just for those who follow acquisitions in the securities space, that\u2019s roughly 33 times RMR or recurring monthly revenue or 1.8 times revenue.  We think a very fair and reasonable purchase price for a good piece of business.", "I would like also to remind everybody, we at Stanley have a very strong track record in our industrial tools group and in our company with good French businesses with good market positions and capable management teams. We viewed GDP as more of the same and it creates a platform for our convergent security business in continental Europe.", "Looking briefly at industrial and CDIY, both markets performed negatively and certainly were impacted by the end markets in which they compete. Revenues in our industrial tools group were flat and profitability was down.  The profit rate was down 40 basis points.  Organic growth in total was down about 4%.  Industrial and automotive repair tool revenues were handicapped a little bit as [Mycolum] did maintain its revenues in very difficult market conditions while North American revenues declined slightly.  Our engineered solutions business continued to experience some nice results with growth in both industrial storage and hydraulic tools businesses domestically and abroad and the segment profit rate as I\u2019ve already suggested declined due to both higher inflation as well as some volume pressure.", "On the CDIY side, the business facing probably most headwinds of any of our businesses, revenues in total were down 2%.  Profit rate declined 380 basis points from a comfortable 16.5% level down to 12.7% for the quarter with a 5% decline on organic growth.  Obviously there was softness in the North American or US residential and construction markets.  European organic revenues did decline as a result of slowing demand in the UK and other European markets that Jim cited in his overview, as well as the decline in our lower margin storage businesses across the company or plastic storage business sold through the home centers.  ", "[inaudible] continue to shift towards more profitable business but the segment margin rate was negatively impacted by inflation in the third quarter as well as a continuation of weakness in the US markets.  So no surprises there, but all in all, 13% operating margin on a 2% decline in revenues.  ", "So in summary, global markets continue to be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic conditions. No surprise there, which you might have missed in the technical blackout.  Jim talked about our diverse portfolio, the advantages it\u2019s having, which does insulate us but certainly doesn\u2019t make us immune to those conditions.  ", "US residential construction and retail markets are soft.  33% of our total business in total is focused in construction and DIY.  About half of that or 17% is in North America.  The North American industrial markets contracted, particularly the US automotive market, and the European growth is continuing to slow.  As Jim indicated, the slowdown in Europe happened rather abruptly.  In our case or certainly in the markets we serve where normally we see a very nice strong pick up in September after a return from the August vacation period.  The pick up really never took place and we don\u2019t see the situation as any more robust or healthy in the fourth quarter.", "Commodity inflation set a record high.  That\u2019s the bad news.  The good news is it\u2019s beginning to taper off and our full year 2008 estimate remains unchanged since July at about $150 million.  That trend arguably could get a little better and Jim did review our estimates for recovery.  Despite that level of inflation, our current estimates suggest we\u2019ll have 90% of it recovered, which is strong pricing performance across most businesses, due largely to the brand strength and secondarily just due to a good internal process to get out ahead of it, identify where the inflation is coming from, and try to be proactive in recovering as much of it through price and productivity as possible.", "Internally within Stanley, I think it\u2019s clear the balance sheet and cash generation do provide stability and ample liquidity.  I think Jim provided just what you need short term in a snapshot to reaffirm that.  Our earnings guidance of $3.75 for the year is down 3% and it\u2019s relatively stable despite the unprecedented volume decline that Jim talked about.  Cash flow estimate is unchanged at near $500 million.  SFS does continue to aid in terms of the positive cash flow benefits.  I\u2019ve talked about timely pricing actions where together we have that\u2019s doing a lot to mitigate inflation and as we sit looking at the remainder of the year into 2009, we think we\u2019ve done what we can and we are well-positioned to weather a difficult economic environment as long as it lasts in 2009.  ", "We have good priced momentum with inflation abating as we enter 2009.  We have about 60 million of carryover from gross cost actions, about $25 million of which will be incremental in 2009, and the portfolio refinements specifically the addition of Sonitrol, GDP, and XMark continue to give us a more stable earnings base less susceptible to significant economic downturns looking forward.  As I\u2019ve discussed and we\u2019ve mentioned in our press release, our short to intermediate term capital allocation will shift as we think about repurchase within our current rating constraints, and with that we\u2019ll open it up for questions and answers.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", " ", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Jim, you commented on the outlook for revenue growth in 4Q that basically implied that volumes in the fourth quarter would be I guess similar to what we saw in the third quarter.  First of all, can you confirm that\u2019s right, and then secondly, the thinking within that one considering the trends that you\u2019re seeing underlying in Europe, why the numbers wouldn\u2019t be worse in 4Q and then as we go into 2009.", "James M. Loree", "I can confirm that I said that.  Whether it\u2019s right or not only time will tell.  The unit volume was down 7% in the third quarter.  Price was 3%, organic was down 4%.  We think that unit volume will be slightly better, partially because the third quarter in Europe, a lot of the softness was already reflected in the third quarter number, so from a sequential perspective, there\u2019s not a lot of negativity to happen, but also because the two things that we have going on, one in security, which is the mid quarter anniversary and the fourth quarter of the hardware loss, which is worth about $10 million to $20 million.  It\u2019s a $55 million a year loss so on a quarterly basis it\u2019s about $12 million and about half of that is $6 million so you can see that\u2019s working in our favor, and in addition to that, we did have a win, I don\u2019t know if when the telephone cut out if you heard it or not, but we have a relatively significant win with a major construction DIY customer impacting consumer tools and storage and that load in has begun and it\u2019s a rather significant win, so for all those reasons, we think that the volume... Assuming that the market conditions were similar in the fourth quarter to the third quarter, and the late third quarter in Europe, that we would probably be a point or so maybe favorable on a unit volume perspective.  ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Then secondly within Europe, can you frame a little bit how the year-over-year Europe numbers have moved as we\u2019ve gone from 2Q into 3Q and kind of where that\u2019s going, just sort of what the overall year unit numbers look like?", "James M. Loree", "Europe is running about a point negative in terms of organic growth.  Probably about 4 points negative in terms of physical volume, unit volume.  ", "John F. Lundgren ", "An important thing to think about, Eric, in 3Q and 4Q, FX is having a tremendous impact of course.  Jim touched on the volatility and relative strength of the dollar, weakness of the European currencies as it relates to the third and fourth quarter.  You can do the math but remember, 45% of our business is outside the US.  So roughly it\u2019s $500 million a quarter and with a 10% currency change is fairly significant in terms of reported revenue growth despite the fact we don\u2019t put FX in organic, so you\u2019ve got a big swing there that began in the middle of the third quarter that will carry through the fourth quarter.  ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And the down four units... Do you know what that number was in the second quarter?", "James M. Loree", "Are you taking about Europe?", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Yes.", "James M. Loree", "I think we showed it last quarter, I don\u2019t have it in front of me, but I\u2019m guessing it was probably down a point maybe. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Do you think down four units is as bad as it gets or does it get worse than that and stay worse than that for a while similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the US?", "James M. Loree", "I don\u2019t know.  I think that since the first month of the quarter was strong, I would guess that it could get a little worse than that in the fourth quarter, and if it\u2019s anything like the US, it could be in the minus 7%, 8%, but I think that\u2019s factored into our fourth quarter view.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Third, in terms of security growth and pulling hardware out but as you look at the underlying organic growth which it sounds like mechanical is up a little bit and conversion, I\u2019m not certain but it looks like conversion maybe was flat organically, can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of end market demand in that business as we see slowing commercial construction.  I understand you\u2019ve got a diverse customer base, but just talk about one perhaps, the order book or the outlook is for how the growth is going in that business.  ", "James M. Loree", "I think the security growth continues to be stable.  The principal reason that the... There\u2019s two reasons why the convergence was slightly, I think it might have been down a point in electronics, and one of them is that there\u2019s still a little bit of a hangover from the reverse integration of HSM which should be behind us by the first quarter, and a lot of that has to do with business we\u2019re simply walking away from because it doesn\u2019t have monitoring revenue attached to it on an ongoing basis.  Then the other part of it is there\u2019s a small business in relation to the overall company but maybe large in relation to conversion business that we inherited with one of our acquisitions, I believe it\u2019s about $20 million a year in revenue, which we were literally just walking away from because it\u2019s a non-value added business for us, it\u2019s inconsistent with our strategy, it\u2019s something called the Com Group.  In fact, we\u2019re potentially even going to sell it in the fourth quarter, and if so, it\u2019ll become a discontinued operation, but that\u2019s been a bit of a drag all year on the organic growth in convergent as well, so if you took the two things that I mentioned out, I think we\u2019d be in a much better place, probably closer to 5% organic growth in convergent, and hopefully both of those issues will take care of themselves here in the next quarter or so.", "John F. Lundgren ", "I just think the other point that Jim and I are asked a lot, a relatively small percentage of our security business particularly that one, 15 to 20 is our internal estimate is purely driven by commercial construction or new commercial construction.  The advantage of our installed base, and I think the reason there\u2019s been relative stability in the top line despite the rather pessimistic both views and news is when there aren\u2019t new store openings amongst large retailers where you know we have an extraordinarily large install base and position, as well as other commercial construction, the bad news is new starts are falling dramatically.  The good news is when that happens, existing facilities step up their retrofit activities and their maintenance activities and given our strong install base, that\u2019s an important partial mitigator.  Our view right now, Brett\u2019s and Justin\u2019s view, would be that\u2019s why the business is holding up as well as it is.  In total, despite what you\u2019ve indicated, a meaningful decline in new commercial construction.", " ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And so I guess the last point as you look at the order book in as much as exists in either of these businesses, does the order book suggest the overall business should be able to sustain the rate it\u2019s at before we consider some of the one-ups that Jim mentioned as you look over the next 90 or 190 days where you see some easing along with the overall ease n the commercial spending.", "James M. Loree", "The answer is yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh.", "", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "You  mentioned the $150 million in inflation would remain static in terms of your expectations for \u201908.  If oil and steel and all the other various base metals remain flat from here on out at current levels, what is the \u201909 inflationary situation versus \u201908?", "James M. Loree", "We don\u2019t really have a number that we\u2019re sharing at the moment because it\u2019s such a dynamic environment and we don\u2019t really... I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done a static analysis as of the last day or two, but I will say the reason I put the chart in there that shows what we buy is so you can come to your own conclusions about what you think the commodities will do.  If they stay flat to where they are today, steel\u2019s come down depending on the type of steel, dramatically, in the last month or so.  Obviously oil prices have come down and that may iterate into the freight rates at some point and so when you look at on the chart, the pricing and inflation update, number eight, hang on one second while we get the chart.  Eight please.  ", "You can see that steel is about half of the $150 million.  The inflation is about $20 million.  That\u2019s a pretty substantial part of the $150 million, so if that were to reverse in some fashion, you can kind of come up with your own estimate as to how significant it could be, recognizing that $1.1 million is a penny a share for the company.  ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Okay, I guess what I was getting at is whether there were any hedging or time lags with respect to when you see the commodities impact your bottom line versus when we would see on the spot market.  ", "James M. Loree", "There\u2019s always a certain number of days of raw and in process inventory in the plants and so on.  It helps obviously to have the inventories as lean as we have them right now, clearly that will reduce the time frame.  There are sometimes we don\u2019t really hedge steel but sometimes we buy ahead a month or two to make sure that when the prices were going up, that we get the best pricing, but I think typically you\u2019ll probably see about a three month lag before you really see the P&L effect from something like this.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "My next question would be piggy backing on what Eric was asking.  When I look at a lot of your businesses, John, that are economically sensitive, to a certain extent the CDIY, Bostich, some of the industrial businesses, certainly the mechanical access with the 15% to 20% of your security business.  What gives you the confidence that things don\u2019t get worse or that you are being conservative enough in your expectations because it sounds like you\u2019re assuming a similar type run rate in Q4 at least despite the fact that things got progressively worse as Q3 progressed, so what gives you confidence that things will stabilize in some of those more economically more sensitive businesses?", "", "John F. Lundgren ", "I\u2019ve tried to answer that twice, Sam.  I\u2019ll try to answer it one more time.  We\u2019re not economists any more than anybody on the phone.  We read the same macroeconomic reports that you do.  I think our biggest, if you will, internal or operational hedge in CDIY as well as mechanical security or security in general excluding our industrial tools group is the fact that when new commercial constructions don\u2019t start or even new residential constructions don\u2019t start, there is more retro-fit in commercial construction and more quite frankly remodeling [inaudible] ", "James M. Loree", "", "Laura, hang on one second, I think John was... ", "John F. Lundgren ", "I think Sam might have gotten cut off. Anyway, Sam, we have both those businesses, we think the partial mitigator in that more service and maintenance gets done when the new construction isn\u2019t starting even in the automotive business while it\u2019s going to take a while, very little of our business is OEM to the car manufacturers in Detroit or around the world.  That being said, when people aren\u2019t buying new cars, they\u2019re driving their existing cars longer, they may skip maintenance for six months, but eventually that\u2019s going to have a positive impact on businesses like Mac and Facom so I\u2019m not confident any more or less than anyone else could be on the macroeconomic drivers.  All I feel is I have faith in our portfolio being more diverse, automotive repair, rebuild, maintenance, etc. that\u2019s going to insulate us from some of that decline.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Pete Lisnic.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "I guess the first question is sort of a housekeeping item.  In terms of the working capital reductions that you\u2019re showing, do those comparisons... are they impacted at all by currency to a great extent or are those pretty clean the way you were looking at them?", "James M. Loree", "Very small impact from currency the way we\u2019re looking at them.  ", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "If you look forward in terms of the cash generation profile and the benefits that you\u2019re getting from SFS, it just seems to me like the cash generation has actually improved or accelerated because some of these initiatives... how do we think about that in terms of\u201909?  Should we expect to see some more improvement on the working capital front and thus another relatively robust year from a free cash flow perspective?", "James M. Loree", "I think the words in the pitch and in our press release, if we haven\u2019t given \u201909 guidance yet, and I have to apologize because when Jim talked about it, it may have been when we were in our technical difficulty problem. We see another robust cash flow in 2009. Why do we say that without putting a number out there?  Why do we think we can duplicate this year\u2019s performance?  A huge source of cash flow is working capital improvements and as of 2010 is just beginning to really, really gain traction.  We\u2019ve been at it for a while.  So our view is to the extent the cash flow could be adversely impacted by more volume decline than we\u2019ve anticipated, we think continued improvement on working capital, an inventory reduction in general on working capital turn improvement.  In particular, is going to help duplicate this year\u2019s cash flow performance.  Remember, as Jim pointed out, 7% volume decline if we still took inventory down, we took receivables down, despite a precipitous decline in our actual unit production.  That gives us our confidence that this thing is gaining traction, the organization is focused on it and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that that trend will continue. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan", "Hi, good morning guys, this is actually Ray Huang in for Mike.  A couple questions, first question, given the current weak market environment, I was wondering if you guys had any type of updated terms of what you expect for your cash contribution towards your pension this year and over the next couple of years.  I think, in the 10-K you guys talk about $15 million of cash contributions in \u201808 but I think that was based off of a 8% expected return but you\u2019re giving... With the S&P down 20% to 30% percent this year, what does that do in terms of your cash out flow for the pension?", "James M. Loree", "This, first of all, let\u2019s understand pension a little bit here at Stanley.  We froze our defined benefit plans about eight or nine years ago in the US and subsequently froze them in Australia, UK and so on.  Basically all we have today is the stub that remains from that as well as a little bit of defined benefit plan exposure that we\u2019ve picked up along the way from various acquisitions.  So we don\u2019t have a massive pension overhang to begin with.  It just so happens that the funding status of our pensions this year requires almost no incremental cash contribution, largely because they are not very significant plans and as we analyze their funding we found that we need to make no contributions this year.   ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Sheridan.", "Mike Sheridan \u2013 [Cobalt Capital]", "", "Quick question, you said that fill rates were good in virtually all of the businesses.  Could you talk about where they were not good and why?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, probably that, when I say in virtually all the businesses, we were struggling for quite a period of time in our UK home center business, in our North American proto business as well as hardware as we consolidated in, as we consolidated for the exit of the business from a large customer and dramatically increased SKU count.  They\u2019re virtually at targeted levels, they are at targeted levels at UK home center business and in our proto business. We are still sorting through the consolidation of the national and the Stanley Brand significant reduction in SKUs and the consolidation of business in Rock Falls.  The business could still stand some improvement which represents about 6% of Stanley revenues is in our builders\u2019 hardware business.  Tough business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Shitra Bandalam].", "[Shitra Bandalam]", "", "Thank you.  Could you discuss the foreign exchange impact on international operations, and I mean by that, revenues of the local currency, how do costs typically get incurred in the two product segments in construction DIY and industrial? ", "", "John F. Lundgren", "They tend to move in the same direction.  As you\u2019re probably aware, we buy commodities centrally and globally.  They are global commodities.  That being said, they tend to move in the same direction.  As a European or Asian currency weakens, so does the commodity price in that area.  There\u2019s a time line like anything else, but simply said,  if you see a decrease in revenue, a comparable, obviously with the margin increase impact in cost all be it with a two to three month time line.  ", "James M. Loree", "And although, I\u2019m not sure if the circuits were on when I was talking about currency, but we\u2019ve experienced, the whole world has experienced a rather significant strengthening of the dollar, the euro, British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar all of which are very important currencies to us, especially the euro and the British pound.  And since the beginning of the quarter, this quarter we have seen a 15% decrease in the value of most of the currencies and a 28% decrease in the value of the Australian dollar and, so where as in past quarters we\u2019ve had some modest benefit from currency translation, as an example, in the first three quarters of this year we averaged about $.05 a quarter.  In the fourth quarter we will experience a 5% negative impact from the weakening of those currencies assuming that the currency rates stay where they are today.  ", "[Shitra Bandalam]", "Yeah, I guess that\u2019s where I was going, all of that we understand.  Obviously we see that as impacting the revenue line.  I just wanted to get clear the cost as in the production senses and all that stuff.  We were producing stuff for a local area in general to learn the cost of the airlines. ", "James M. Loree", "It\u2019s mostly alignment, you know, we have some cross border currency flows, most of those are hedged a year out, so really the issue for us is more about translation.  Obviously the gross margin rates, cross margin dollars come down, the SG&A dollars come down and the difference between those is really what the effect is for us for the most part.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicole [DiBlaze].", "Nicole [DiBlaze]", "", "How are you?  I have a couple of quick questions for you.  On restructuring, you guys had said that you were planning on doing $15 million in 2008.  Seeing that you only did $5 million in the third quarter, can we assume the rest of that gets pushed into the fourth quarter?", "James M. Loree", "", "Well, some of that was actually done at the tail end of the second quarter; I mean we had $17 million dollars of restructuring in the second quarter.  So you can assume that the fourth quarter will be similar to the third quarter in terms of restructuring volume.  But, I think it\u2019s important to note as we go into 2009, we expect to have around or approximately $30 million dollars of restructuring embedded in the comp so that as we look at the sales outlook for \u201809 as we get closer to the actual first quarter, we will have the flexibility to determine whether we want to deploy that $30 million that\u2019s embedded in the comp, kind of pay as you go, if you will, in terms of additional restructuring to deal with the volume declines that we may have.  Or if the volume picture is better than what might be implied that we require a significant restructure, we\u2019d have the ability not to spend the money in which case the comp would kind of not be required to repeat.  ", "Nicole [DiBlaze]", "", "Ok, that makes sense.  And then, you guys are under STIPO accounting in the U.S. and LIPO internationally, so is it fair to say that the margin pressure could be rebuilding going into 4Q, especially in the industrial segment?", "James M. Loree", "We\u2019re actually under LIPO in the U.S. and STIPO internationally, but under that, with that as a sort of the factual background, do you want to re-ask your question or is it a moot point?", "Nicole [DiBlaze]", "No, I\u2019m still curious about what that could do as far as margins go.  ", "James M. Loree", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a dramatic impact.  There\u2019s a lot of, when you think about all the variances that arise from the basically the FIFO accounting from the inflation and then our capitalizing the FIFO account and we\u2019ve had that going on for quite a while.  As you get currency impacts in there, and as the inflation starts to abate, I think you\u2019re going to get fairly, there will be fairly insignificant in terms of overall impact of the company.  ", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.  Mr. Waybright, do you have any closing remarks?", "Greg Waybright", "We\u2019ll thank everyone for their participation, apologize for the brief technical difficulty which is obviously beyond our control, but I think you\u2019ve got the gist of the message.  Third quarter is behind us with I think pretty good earnings in light of a volume decline.  The conditions remain difficult, the cash flow continues to be very, very strong.  It will remain an area of focus and we think we\u2019re well-positioned to weather the storm and the conditions ahead regardless of what the market services.  Thanks a lot for your attention.

And Jim\u2019s going to talk about some of the sources both of cash as well as the programs driving the improved turns. It was particularly encouraging in the fourth quarter, the improvement in turns.", "Price realization continues to be encouraging as we virtually offset the overwhelming majority of our inflation headwinds. For the last two years we\u2019ve averaged about 85% and I have a slide that will give you a little more granularity on that, but we\u2019re making a lot of progress via our pricing center of excellence.", "The high point certainly for us in the quarter was the performance and for the year was the performance of our convergent Security Solutions business. Revenues grew 21% for the year, 32% for the quarter and operating margin expanded significantly. And again Jim will get into some more detail when we talk about the segments and give you a little bit more granularity on what\u2019s taking place inside our Security segment.", "And finally, the Security segment currently makes up the largest portion or made up the largest portion of our fourth quarter sales at 38% as our portfolio transition proceeds and Security thus far has been less adversely affected by the macroeconomic conditions.", "Moving on to a closer look at revenues, revenues of $1.86 billion were down 5% from fourth quarter \u201907. As you know there\u2019s not a lot of seasonality in this family business, and the primary factor contributing to the revenue decline was the 10% volume decline as you see on the bottom left. And importantly that followed a 7% unit volume decline in the third quarter, and the 10% Don will talk to you a little bit more later on. That\u2019s not inconsistent with the outlook for the first half of the year where we\u2019re looking at or assuming 12% of volume decline for the foreseeable future.", "Price was a good story, as we realized a 4% net price increase year-on-year resulting in a 6% decline in organic revenues. Currency was a negative, as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the British pound as well as the Australian and Canadian dollars, those four currencies making up the overwhelming majority of our foreign currency exposure. ", "And acquisitions primarily and securities, secondarily in our Engineered Solutions business, contributed about 6% to our top line. So the net result is a 5% decline in revenue, with a 10% unit volume decline.", "Looking briefly at the segments, as I suggested Security performed well. The CDIY business was off 16% in total, 10% of which was organic. And Industrial was off 10%, 9 of which was organic.", "Moving on to margin, we were pleased with our ability to hold gross margin rate for the year despite the decline in volume. You see gross margin holding steady at 37.8% as a result of a business mix towards the higher margin portfolio, as well as the realization of many of the planned costs synergies from recent acquisition.", "You see that operating margin did decline 140 basis points. And the difference between flat gross margin performance and the 140 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the volume decline, which of course was the catalyst for our announced fourth quarter initiatives.", "Looking at pricing, I alluded to in the highlights you see at the top a history of our recovery of all our inflation, 81% in 2005, a 45% in 2006 although it was against the lower base, but then 83 and 88% the last two years. ", "We\u2019ve talked about this on earlier calls, but several years ago we established a corporate pricing center of excellence which is really gaining traction. That has evolved in addition to the corporate center with a subset of pricing center of excellence or expert attached to each major business unit, and that\u2019s really starting to gain some traction. So we\u2019re pleased with our ability to thus far, at least the last two years, compensate for the overwhelming majority of materials inflation that we\u2019ve received and we anticipate that to continue going forward.", "Looking quickly at inflation, because it\u2019s moving very quickly and there\u2019s tremendous volatility, on the left hand side it\u2019s clear commodity prices have declined significantly in recent months, yet we\u2019ve still absorbed a tremendous amount of inflation. The materials inflation accounts for 60 to 75% of Stanley\u2019s [cogs] inflation, depending on the quarter. And then depending on spot prices, 50 to 75% of Stanley\u2019s material inflation is normally steel.", "So you see the quarterly walk of materials inflation and all of our cost of goods inflation on the left hand side, where we\u2019re continuing to absorb in excess of $40 million a quarter. Looking at the right, because steel is the single most prominent element in our cogs inflation, you see first quarter \u201908 Stanley paid on average $660 for steel. In the fourth quarter that was up to $940, with the average for the year being $826. And that\u2019s the average that was included in the chart on the previous page.", "Looking forward into the first quarter, we\u2019re anticipating an average cost in our P&L of about $790 a ton. That of course is above the current spot price, but I think \u2013 and it creates $130 a ton headwind for us in the first quarter. And I think it\u2019s important to note we did a good job throughout the year delaying some of these increases three to six months. ", "And we do have steel in inventory and that we\u2019ve purchased in the fourth quarter and contractually even into the first quarter at higher prices. And we\u2019ll see some of the deflation that we\u2019ve talked about in previous calls and the anticipated deflation starting to show up in our P&L midway through the second quarter.", "So on a year-on-year basis, inflation will be a reality in early \u201909 and of course the jury\u2019s still out, but Don\u2019s guidance talks a little bit about how we\u2019ve accounted for that in our P&L. ", "Let me now turn it over to Jim Loree, who\u2019s going to take us through the segments and then we\u2019ll go on to Don Allan.", "James M. Loree ", "", "Thank you John. We were very pleased with how the Security segment performed during the quarter. We started building this business back in 2002 in order to diversify our revenue base and to provide a long term source of growth. And in the quarter we certainly accomplished both of those objectives.", "As you can see, revenues were up 14%. It\u2019s now at a run rate of about a $1.6 billion annual revenue business. Segment profit was up 28% to $75 million and the segment profit rate surged to 18.4%. A lot of this was driven by the convergent \u2013 the convergent Security Solutions business, also known as our Electronic Security business which is installation and monitoring electronic security systems. ", "We had two major acquisitions during the year, Sonitrol and GDP and we also enjoyed the benefits of the reverse integration of our United States Systems integration business into the HSM business model, really reaping the synergies that we expected when we did that acquisition. Great story and kudos to [Brett Bontrigger] and his management team for excellent execution in this area.", "Mechanical Access had a solid quarter under the circumstances. They had to deal with a continued loss of the Home Depot hardware business, which has now finally anniversaried, and they did really well offsetting their volume declines with both price and productivity. So all in all a pretty good story in the Security segment.", "I\u2019d like to talk a little bit now about the portfolio shift that we\u2019ve been undertaking since 2002. And as you can see from the next chart here, back in 2002 the revenues from our Construction and DIY segment were approximately two-thirds of the company and Industrial and Security were the remainder. As we look to 2008 on the upper right part of the chart, you can see a much more balanced revenue diverse revenue base in the company with the Construction and DIY business being 36% of the company, but the other two segments being very close in size, so a very balanced portfolio.", "It\u2019s even more interesting, I think, when you look at the bottom part of the chart and look at how the operating margin mix has changed over the last six, seven years. Where the Construction and DIY business was contributing about 80% of the company\u2019s operating margin back in 2002, you can see today that\u2019s down to 31% although it has increased in dollar terms. The growth in the other two, the Industrial and Security segment, have dwarfed on a percentage basis the Construction and DIY.", "And now Security represents in terms of operating margin 43% of the company\u2019s operating margin. So a really good story there and certainly one that served us well during this timeframe. And as we move on to the next chart, you can see we\u2019ve also accomplished a reasonable amount of diversification as it relates to the end markets. And the residential construction part of our business is now approximately 33% with about half of that directly in the U.S.", "But we also have considerable positions in other areas. As you can see, 24% is in this Industrial area on the left upper part of that pie. We also have some commercial construction, about 12% of our revenue base which has held up well even though the market has been down in the U.S. in particular over the last year. We were slightly positive in terms of our revenue performance in commercial construction.", "Then you see retail. We have some activity particularly in our Security business in retail and mostly in the Access Technologies automatic door business, and that business actually had positive revenue growth last year. So again, even with the exposure to retail they\u2019ve been able to gain share and they\u2019ve been able to do a lot of refurb type of activity in that particular market.", "Then we have exposure, about 12% of the end market, in healthcare education in government, automotive repair which is not the manufacturing type of automotive volume but rather the auto mechanics, supplying tools to auto mechanics. Again that market has held up reasonably well. Mac and Facom you know are the big elements of our activity there. And then I mentioned Industrial and other.", "So a good, diverse revenue base in terms of end markets which has also served us reasonably well in this market. But that said, we haven\u2019t had a \u2013 we haven\u2019t been immune to the market declines in the Industrial segment and the CDIY segment. I think this next chart sort of puts that in crystal clear perspective.", "In the quarter for Industrial as we look at the left hand side of the chart, revenues were down 10% and the operating segment profit rate fell to 10.3%. It was down almost 500 basis points in light of the steep volume declines. Industrial and automotive repair revenues, particularly hurt by the Industrial markets in Facom. Organic revenues declined 8%. That was a pretty significant drop for them.", "In our North American Industrial and automotive repair business we did have the issue of economic contraction, particularly in our Industrial business. And then in the automotive repair business most of our issues there were self-inflicted as the driver count decreased in that particular business. And we are working diligently on fixing that issue as we speak.", "We also had growth. In Engineered Solutions we were up in double-digits there. That was driven primarily by acquisitions and a modest improvement in our storage business.", "If we look over at the Construction and DIY segment on the right-hand side, you can see even more dramatic revenue declines and even a more marked profit rate decline, almost 700 basis points, the operating profit dropping to about 6%. We like to think that this is a kind of trough profit rate for this particular business with these types of revenue declines that we\u2019re experiencing. But we continued to have weakness in the U.S. residential construction markets. I don\u2019t think that will surprise anybody. ", "And in Europe we also had organic revenue declines, which were different than in the beginning of the performance in the beginning of the year when we actually had increases in Europe. So as time went on during the year, and we had talked about it on some previous calls, the organic weakness spread to Europe in the construction markets. And so now we pretty much have it across the board, and as well in the emerging markets. So it\u2019s a global phenomenon not surprisingly.", "And the Bostage margin rate was negatively impacted by inflation, as steel inflation surged again although we don\u2019t see that continuing in the future here in that particular business. And then their volume had some decline related to their continued market weakness.", "So that\u2019s the story of the segments. Now as we move to working capital, I think this is a tremendously positive story. John mentioned the 0.6 of a turn improvement from 5.3 to 5.9 turns. That was $133 million reduction in absolute dollars of working capital and over $120 of that was directly cash related. There was a little bit of exchange impact as well. ", "But as you look across the board, inventories came down $41 million. If you think about the fact that we had a double-digit unit volume decline, the degree of difficulty in order to accomplish that was extremely high and we were able to do it. And then on the receivable side we brought the accounts receivable down $128 million, which included $40 million or so of reduction in overdues from a year ago. So in this difficult economy with the credit issues and so forth we were actually able to reduce the overdues in our portfolio by $41 million with a concerted effort.", "And then of course payables dropped slightly, not surprisingly with the reduction in volume in inventories. What this says basically is that the Stanley Fulfillment System that we put in place several years ago is gaining momentum as we speak and it couldn\u2019t be happening at a better time. ", "I want to emphasize that the benefits from the Stanley Fulfillment System are primarily process related and they are not a one time phenomenon. These are fundamental changes that we\u2019re making to the company\u2019s processes and the way we do business that are having a positive impact on our cash generation. And in that regard as I said they are very timely.", "We\u2019ve been at it a couple years. As I said this is not an overnight sensation. This is three yards and a cloud of dust. There\u2019s four elements to the Stanley Fulfillment System. It involves something we call transformational lean, which is Stanley\u2019s version of lean manufacturing, and enterprise lean. ", "Also tremendous progress in something we call S&OP which is the way you synchronize the front end of the business with the back end of the business. And we\u2019ve made enormous improvements across the company in S&OP and that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to endure a volume reduction of this magnitude and still bring our inventories down.", "On top of that, we have two other elements. One is complexity reduction and that is reducing the complexity of our products, the way we do business and our manufacturing footprint; and finally platform standardization. And so all of these things are progressing as we speak and contributing to this tremendous improvement in working capital. And obviously as I mentioned that\u2019s had an impact on cash flow. ", "And now I\u2019m going to turn it over to our CFO, Don Allan. He\u2019s going to talk about our cash flow performance.", "Donald Allan Jr.", "", "Thank you Jim. On Page 13 I just want to spend a few minutes and talk about that cash flow performance, focused primarily on the year. As Jim mentioned the working capital contribution really bolstered our cash flow and our free cash flow performance for 2008 with about ", "$127 million of a contribution in that regard.", "And our operating cash flow was $560 million which was an increase over the prior year of about $20 million, which is an impressive performance when you consider the fact that our net income from continuing operations before the restructuring charges in the fourth quarter was actually down 12%. And so with that decline and with the focus on working capital, we were still able to achieve a sizable or decent increase in operating cash flow.", "John mentioned earlier on that our capital expenditures were slightly higher than we anticipated. It did increase about $50 million versus 2007. Approximately $30 of that was really planned strategic investments that we had in the pipeline since the beginning of the year. And then we had about $20 million of certain leasing structures that were terminated in the fourth quarter that due to the difficult credit markets we were not able to enter into new leasing structures at that point in time. So that\u2019s really driving that increase.", "But still a very healthy free cash flow performance of almost $420 million in 2008. Regarding CapEx, as we look at 2009 we would expect that our CapEx would get down to more historical levels as a percentage of revenue, which would be about 2% as we mentioned in our press release this morning.", "The next page, if we take a look at our credit and liquidity status, it\u2019s something that obviously everyone is concerned with the current economic environment. And we thought it would be good to just refresh everyone\u2019s memory on a few things related to that. The first thing we want to mention is obviously we\u2019ve had a long standing strategy to remain single A as far as our credit rating, and it\u2019s served the company very well over the years. That is still a very important strategy for us going forward.", "In addition to that, we took several actions, two in particular in 2008, to insure that we had ample liquidity. In particular, in October when the markets were fairly turbulent, we did term out about $250 million of debt that will mature in 2013. In addition to that, we increased our credit line which really gives us approximately $800 million of liquidity, and in this time and economic circumstances it is a wonderful thing to have available to us.", "And then the third thing to mention is we really have no major unfunded obligations until 2012 as the chart depicts here on the right. Due to the equity unit structure that we entered into a few years ago, we will have a cash inflow as a result of the shares issuance in that transaction of", "$330 million in 2010. That will help us fund the bond obligation we have of $200 million in that year. So we feel that we\u2019re in a very strong position regarding credit liquidity at this stage. ", "As John mentioned earlier, we saw unprecedented unit volume declines in the fourth quarter here, 10% of volume decline. In our press release in December we indicated the importance of having to realign our cost base and our cost structures due to that, as well as due to the outlook we were seeing for 2009. So we took some significant actions as that press release indicated.", "Specifically our headcount was reduced over 2,000 employees which is approximately 10% of our workforce. We did certain reorganizations and elimination of management layers. And then we also had a closure of three plants in the United States as part of that restructuring. Then last but certainly not least we did suspend certain U.S. employee benefits on a temporary basis to really assist in those cost reduction actions, and to avoid to have to do additional headcount reductions.", "The cost associated with these actions was for the year, the entire restructuring was $92 million. The specific fourth quarter restructuring was $67 million, which is about just less than $0.60 EPS. The total year restructuring charges were $0.80 per share.", "The cash outflow associated with these restructurings we would expect about 85% of them are cash outflows and the remaining 15 are non-cash, in other words asset impairments. And we would estimate about 60 to 70% of that cash would be paid in 2009 and the remainder would be paid in 2010, as it does the process in Europe is much longer for doing these types of actions.", "The savings associated with all this is $140 million associated with the headcount reductions and that includes what we did throughout the year, not just in the fourth quarter. And so we feel like we\u2019ve taken the appropriate steps there. In addition to that, we really attacked our discretionary costs, $55 million of actions, focuses on T&E and car and fleet costs, etc. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to attack as we go through 2009.", "The EPS impact added a positive $1.75 per share as a result of those actions, with $0.24 of that carrying over to 2010. ", "Moving to the next page, we made a decision as you saw in our press release, not to provide 2009 guidance at this point until we see the economic conditions and the end markets begin to stabilize. However, we continue to constantly monitor these variables and we\u2019ll post them as we go forward. ", "But we did want to be able to provide as we indicated in our December 11 press release some assumptions to assist the financial community with some things that we\u2019re seeing in \u201909 as well as some assumptions to assist you with your modeling. And we have updated that in this press release this morning.", "If we start with unit volume, which is clearly the largest variable that we have at this point, as we head into the year it appears that the 10 to 12% unit volume decline is what we\u2019re seeing in the early stages. If that was to continue throughout the entire year, the negative impact on our EPS would be $2.00 to $2.25. Now some of that\u2019s volume associated just from the lost sales, but of course this is also an impact of under absorption in our plants that\u2019s factored into that EPS assumption.", "Currencies as we mentioned in our December press release will have the same significant impact as well, as the U.S. dollar strengthened against some of the major currencies that we have like the euro, the Australian dollar, and the Canadian dollar in particular. And we\u2019re estimating that on current exchange rates that it would be about a $0.50 negative if those exchange rates remain constant throughout the year.", "If the exchange rates move 5% either way, it probably is about a 10 to 12% impact, positive or negative depending on which way they move. Now the impact will likely be most of it will occur in the first half of 2009, about 90% of that is what we expect as exchange rates begin to or the U.S. dollar began to strengthen as \u201908 continued on throughout the year.", "Looking at inflation and pricing, which is an area which everyone is very interested in, we do expect as John mentioned to see some inflation especially in the first quarter and the early part of \u201909 as we have that carryover effect. If we look at commodity prices today, there is a possibility that we may have some deflation in the back half of the year, but that\u2019s difficult to predict at this point in time.", "Pricing, we will certainly have a carryover effect as mentioned in our press release. That would likely contribute $30 to $50 million of a positive. So overall our view is that we will likely have some type of modest positive impact as a result of those two items. But clearly there\u2019s variables that could change the result of that going forward.", "I mentioned the cost reduction program of $1.75 already. As far as restructuring charges, we mentioned in our press release this morning that we expect to probably have approximately 50% of our \u201908 level charges, which would be about $0.40 EPS in 2009.", "And then last but certainly not least, accretion for the 2008 acquisitions that we\u2019ve already done, will be at $0.10 to $0.12 EPS. So we feel this is helpful information for all of you as you begin to look at our company in 2009. Just keep in mind that we continue to be committed to take the actions to protect our earnings and our cash flow and our balance sheet going forward.", "As we summarize the call this morning, just looking back, a few things to point out. We feel we\u2019ve taken as I mentioned the aggressive and proactive restructuring actions to adjust our cost base and prepare ourselves for 2009 and be ready when the economic conditions begin to improve. We also demonstrated the ability to mitigate inflation with customer pricing actions where we had $140 million inflation in 2008, with offsetting $123 million in price recovery.", "Free cash flow is a great story, really driven by that strong working capital performance with a proven success of the Stanley fulfillment system. As we look forward, we are dedicated as I mentioned to continue to take steps needed to maintain our upper tier credit rating. And I had also mentioned that we have no unfunded debt obligations until 2012 and we feel very good about our liquidity position.", "As all companies who are multi-nationals like us, we will be subject to potential negative impact of fluctuations in currencies and that is something that we monitor as we go throughout the year here. And certainly last but not least is we will continue to be focused on successful integration of our acquisitions we\u2019ve done and maximize those synergies going forward, as well as focus on SFS in 2009 and beyond.", "Kate White", "", "Jennifer, now we are ready to take question and answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Your first question comes from James Lucas.", "James Lucas ", "", "Factoring in the volume decline of down 10 to 12% and you look at your contingency planning and 2009, at what point do you think about having to take additional actions or do you think that you\u2019ve got the cost structure in line if things were to remain stable today? And secondly, cash flow has been a fantastic story and otherwise there hasn\u2019t been a lot of good news. When you look at the job you\u2019ve done on working capital, what opportunities remain there?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Jim, this is John. Good morning. I\u2019ll take the first half and I\u2019ll let Jim take the second part of that question because he took it in the presentation and some of the initiatives that he\u2019s leading are really, really the drivers in cash flow.", "Your question on contingency planning if you will, or is there yet another way that is right on it\u2019s  a topic that as recently as the middle of December and again already this year we\u2019ve discussed with senior management. If volume continues to decline at the rate it\u2019s declined the last two quarters, and we may well need another round of downsizing businesses later on in the year. Without being terribly specific, it would be in the second half of the year. Everything we\u2019ve talked about and everything we\u2019ve done it\u2019s going to take us six months to get it implemented.", "So sometime between April and June, we\u2019ll have a look forward. Hopefully the situation will be a little more clear. If it\u2019s no worse than it is now, what Don\u2019s put forward in terms of guidance suggests we\u2019ve done everything we can do with a reasonable payback. If the situation\u2019s worse, sometime in the third quarter we have contingency plans, I would say 50% developed and we\u2019ve got three to four months to finalize those for yet another round, which of course we\u2019re hoping isn\u2019t necessary. But I think we\u2019d be less than responsible as an executive management team if we didn\u2019t have those contingency plans in place.", "I\u2019m going to let Jim talk about the continued operations and on continued opportunities in cash flow, primarily via FSS because as Don suggested it\u2019s working capital in general is a huge source of cash for us. We are not going to let up. And I\u2019m going to turn it on over to Jim.", "James M. Loree ", "", "Okay. Thank you John. Well I think first of all, we could have done better than 5.9 in turns had it not been for the precipitous volume decline and so I think there is a calibration that can occur where we clearly believe that in \u201909 that we can do better than 5.9 turns. Starting with that, I think that is relatively clear to us. As we get into north of 6 turns and north, it gets a little murkier. We do know that we have great momentum. We do know that we have a business process transformation and not just a one act play. ", "And there is a lot of act \u2013", "[Audio Impairment \u2013 22 seconds]", "John F. Lundgren ", "", " - that historically we\u2019ve proven that providing it gives more information to more people than quite frankly we want to have out in the public domain. We\u2019ll say two things. Acquisitions contributed for two reasons. One they were positive and Brett\u2019s team did a really good job bringing them on board quickly and having them up and running as part of our business in absolute terms.", "Secondarily, we acquired albeit at relatively high prices, we acquired some very high margin businesses with the equivalent to become even higher margin when we started to realize the synergies. ", "Number one. Number two, their markets were not as adversely impacted as I suggested by some of the macroeconomic factors, so there was some reasonable organic growth. Third and last, offset by as Jim touched on on the mechanical side the continued headwind from the loss of about  $50 million annually or $12.5 million a quarter of high margin hardware business.", "So to summarize, great performance in convergent, both in terms of growth and margin enhancement and synergy achievement; solid performance in our mechanical side, somewhat offset by the volume in margin drag of hardware which as Jim pointed out has anniversaried so we see some potential for some reasonable momentum in the mechanical segment going forward.", "[Unidentified Analyst]", "", "What I\u2019m wondering is, has the structural profitability of the convergent business improved when you do take out the acquisitions that sort of mix up the margin?", "James M. Loree ", "", "Absolutely. I mean, what I think you basically have \u2013 when I talked earlier about the benefits of the reverse integration, that is said another way, what\u2019s happened is we\u2019ve taken the legacy systems integration business that we had before we bought HSM and we\u2019ve converted it to the HSM business model. Now what that means is recurring revenue has become an extremely important part of \u2013 first of all, you can\u2019t distinguish between the two organizations any more. They\u2019ve become one.", "And secondly the folks that used to sell systems integration, which was basically installation, are now selling monitoring in addition to their installation which in and of itself drives higher gross margins and higher operating margins. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And the segment is basically legacy operating margins have gone from mid-single digits up to double-digits. And at the same time HSM brought in very high operating margin and Sonatrol with the synergies in addition to GDP all mix up the operating and the gross margins.", "Kate White", "", "Next question, Jennifer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from is from Eric Bosshard.", "Eric Bosshard", "First of all, the lack of providing 2009 guidance you attributed to the volatility. Can you just talk about where you see the greatest volatility or uncertainty in 2009 that\u2019s sort of pushing you to that decision?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "I think yes, Don provided the guidance obviously with a unanimous agreement from Jim and me and others. And a big piece of it of course is volume because we\u2019ve had a 7 and 10% consecutive volume decline. So economically and numerically that\u2019s the biggest piece. But Don why don\u2019t you address the first \u2013 the first half of Eric\u2019s question?", "Donald Allan Jr.", "", "Yes, Eric, I think the volatility clearly is in the unit volume. And the difficulty of seeing out beyond a few months is very hard for many companies including us to see. And the performance we saw in the fourth quarter with our different segments where we are CDIY and Industrial segment having significant volume losses, and those would be the ones that we would be the most focused on. You know, what it would mean for them going forward into 2009. ", "Obviously the Security segment we want to monitor closely as well to insure that there\u2019s no volume loss and impact there. But it\u2019s the first two segments that we\u2019re really focused on going forward.", "John F. Lundgren", "", "And Eric so you don\u2019t cut off and you get to ask your second question, let me just add, you know our business extraordinarily well. With the exception of some of our Security business and our Engineered Storage Solution business and hydraulics, these are very short cycle businesses. Particularly CDIY and Bostage and many of our smaller Industrial tool business, I know you know and most of the people on the call, you know, understand that a major customer orders on Monday and we ship it on Wednesday.", "And that\u2019s, you know, we have our supply chains linked as well as we can. But you know simply said that the short cycle nature of those businesses and the recent history that\u2019s just so out of proportion with anything else we\u2019ve ever seen is what causes let me say our lack of clarity into the even short term future. But you had a follow-up I know.", "Eric Bosshard", "", "Yes. The follow-up is in Security, the flat organic performance in the fourth quarter is impressive. As you look at historically and you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the order book in that business and can you just give us a little bit of sense of what that looks like and how we should even be thinking about that business in total for 2009 based on sort of indications in orders and quoting activity you\u2019re seeing now?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "No, all we want to say you know although I\u2019d argue we have probably better visibility into Security than others, but we really don\u2019t want to be talking about order books on this call. Two things happened. Two things that I think are appropriate and hopefully helpful. One is a relatively small percentage of our Security business, mechanical and convergent, is based on new construction. A smaller percentage than one might think. ", "Second, regardless I could give you a number for the order book and it would not help you unless I were to give you more granularity than is readily apparent, because it could be a contracted breadth business as won for a new hospital that\u2019s going to be constructed in December, or it could be an installation at a retailer next week. So the number itself depending on when those projects are scheduled to be performed you know really wouldn\u2019t help you. But candidly it\u2019s a fair question, but it\u2019s not just one we want to be talking about on an earnings call.", "Kate White", "", "Next question, Jennifer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh.", "Sam Darkatsh", "First off, your pricing in Q4 was up 4 and if I recall correctly it was up 3% in the third quarter. Does that imply that you had perhaps a small round of price increases in the fourth quarter? Or was that a timing issue as to when the pricing went through in the third quarter? Was that mixed? That was the first question.", "Second question would be, what are your trends you\u2019re seeing sell through versus sell in? And the last question would be, I don\u2019t recall whether you said what convergent organic growth was. You mentioned what it overall was but not organically. Those are my three questions.", "James M. Loree", "", "Okay. Well, let\u2019s address them in reverse order. How about that? Although I think the limit is two questions, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s all right. We\u2019ll do both of these. So as far as the convergent organic growth, it\u2019s very difficult to give an accurate number for the sub-segment of convergent because the HSM acquisition and all the acquisitions are mixed together. But as far as we can tell, we were up modestly, up a point or two. Something like that. Nothing dramatic. But I wouldn\u2019t take that number to the bank and bet on it. But I think directionally it\u2019s accurate.", "The sell throughs, sell in, retailers in the United States were very judicious with their inventory management. If anything, they\u2019re average to slightly below average levels with their inventory at this point in time. So I think that bodes \u2013 you know our inventories are in good shape. Their inventories are in good shape. If we ever get any stabilization in housing prices, it could be very interesting in terms of volume. But we don\u2019t see that at this point in time. Or housing sales. Housing prices we\u2019re beginning to see some stabilization.", "And then the third question was \u2013 yes, do you want to take that one?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Simply said, Sam, very few pricing actions implemented in the fourth quarter. What you saw in the third quarter or fourth quarter were actions taken in the second half of the year and reflected in Don\u2019s outlook is the fact that despite what\u2019s going on in materials market it took us a while to get those prices. We do see some carry forward that is going to help us in the early parts of the year and of course it should be clear as close as you follow Stanley what focus we place on price realization through our COE and maintaining those prices as long as we can. ", "Because it took us three to six months to get them, despite 88% recovery. So it\u2019s important that they don\u2019t decline faster than it took us to realize them. And that\u2019s the positive lift. But it\u2019s much more carry over than it is new actions.", "Kate White", "", "Next question, Jennifer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nigel Coe.", "Nigel Coe", "", "Inventories was obviously just a fantastic storage in the quarter particularly when you think about the price inflation within those inventories. What impact did that have on the margins year-on-year?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "The impact of the price inflation arbitrage? Is that what you\u2019re \u2013", "Nigel Coe", "No, no, no \u2013 it\u2019s inventory reduction.", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Oh, inventory reduction. Well the exact impact on margin year-over-year is difficult to assess. But certainly as you lower your volumes, you lower your inventory, you definitely get a negative impact to your margin rate. And it can \u2013 it\u2019s certainly part of the kind of assumptions we gave you for \u201909 related to the volume impact. As far as inventory, I would say that it was not a huge impact in 2008. But it did have a slight negative impact.", "Nigel Coe", "I think S&P announced last week they\u2019re putting you on reviewing the rating. Can you just confirm that there would be no impact from losing a notch or two of your rating?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Well, last I heard it was Moody\u2019s and not S&P and what they did was they put us under review for possible downgrade from single A where we are at this point in time. That is about a several month process, where we have the opportunity to go talk to them and explain our situation in more detail. And then have a discussion with them about what we might to prospectively if they have continuing concerns after that. And we\u2019ll see how that plays out. So there\u2019s nothing that is cast in concrete at this point in time.", "It clearly is a possibility. We don\u2019t see why it makes sense. However, you know, we want to talk to them and get their perspective on it.", "Kate White", "", "The next question, Jennifer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Seth Weber.", "Seth Weber", "Could we just go back to the Security margin and acquisition question again for a second? Do these acquisitions that you made, do they change the historical seasonality that we\u2019ve seen in the margin in that business, you know where fourth quarter is typically lower?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "A little bit. You\u2019ll recall there were two things. And what it will do is partially mitigate it. The two things historically driving the large swings in margins 200 to 400 basis points in a quarter were second and third quarters were historically higher than fourth and first quarters were primarily in our mechanical security segment. Those seasonality elements still exist, which is one reason we\u2019re not providing margin by sub-segment within sub-segment, because it\u2019s more information than anybody can realistically or practically use.", "But we do a tremendous amount of mechanical locking business on university campuses. We normally do that when university students are not there. Those tend to be the months of June and July, which are in the second and third quarter and that\u2019s very good. It\u2019s incremental high margin business, which inflates second and third quarter at the expense if you will of first and fourth quarter. ", "The second issue is on installs, which relates primarily to our access technologies business, secondarily to some of our monitoring and other businesses where we encounter site readiness issues in the first and fourth quarter, where we show up to put in a door and the concrete hasn\u2019t been poured because of the snowstorm or because of rains in the Southwest or something of that nature. ", "Again, so we get some unanticipated and difficult to plan volume reductions, weather related in the first and fourth quarter which are rarely an issue in the second and third calendar quarters. Because HSM, Sonatrol, GDP have added meaningful revenue and they\u2019ve added it in convergent and they are less susceptible to site readiness issues and slightly less involved in particularly campus university installations, although they do do some of that, that seasonality will be partially mitigated. But it will not disappear.", "Seth Weber", "And if we could just flip over to the other two business segments, I think on the call last quarter you talked about a new fairly large contract or some sort of award that you\u2019d won on the CDIY business. Did that weigh on the margin at all in the quarter? And then my follow-up question would be, I think Jim you had mentioned that you kind of hoped the CDIY margins have bottomed here. You didn\u2019t make that some comment on Industrial. Do you think Industrial margins could yet still go down further?", "John F. Lundgren ", "", "We as a policy don\u2019t name customers names on this call, but the contract we won is encouraging. There was little impact in the fourth quarter although what impact was there was positive, you know, and it will offset some of the headwinds going forward in the first quarter. On the CDIY business, Jim, do you want to take the second half?", "James M. Loree", "", "Yes, I mean, I think there\u2019s a number of things that are going to occur within Industrial, that might occur within Industrial, that could move the margins down a little bit. Probably not precipitously from here; on the other hand they could go up. So it\u2019s a little bit of the same kind of issue that we had relative to guidance. There\u2019s the big $64,000 question is what\u2019s unit volume going to do? And what\u2019s the economy going to do? And clearly there\u2019s a healthy dose of fixed costs in the Industrial business, definitely as much as anywhere from a manufacturing perspective in the plant system.", "And so there is a significant absorption issue in this segment when volume goes down. By the same token, you get benefits when it goes up. So I can\u2019t give you a specific answer per se, although I will say that the unit volume declines that the company has experienced over the last two quarters are unprecedented. In looking back all the way to the \u201870s, we have not ever had two quarters where the unit volume declines were greater than 7% for two consecutive quarters.", "So now we have had that, for the first time, and so we\u2019re now in uncharted territories. We expect as we indicated in our documentation, we expect that we\u2019ll have similar unit volume performance in the first quarter that we had in the fourth. That would be three consecutive quarters. It\u2019s difficult for me to imagine that this could go on at this level for an extended period of time. However, you know, we have to prepare for the possibility that it could and we are preparing for that possibility, although we don\u2019t expect it to occur.", "If we had a dramatic further drop in volume in Industrial, yes, they could go down further. And yes, we would take action.", "Kate White", "", "Next question, Jennifer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut.", "Michael Rehaut", "First question just on unit volume, you know, when you did the prerelease about a month ago you indicated expectation for volume down 12 to 14% and it came in a bit better than that. But you also at the same time in the \u201909 sort of guidelines kind of took the range a little bit lower, I guess being a little bit more cautious or conservative there in terms of first negative 10, you went to negative 10 to 12. ", "I just wanted to know if there was anything that occurred I guess in the December month that you know caused the 4Q volume decline to be a bit better than initial guidance and if that had anything to do with a little bit more conservative take in the \u201909 guidelines?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Yes. I mean simply said, December ended a little better than we had anticipated, given where our order book stood on December 11 when we did a prerelease. The teams did a nice job, shipping what we had on order. At the same time as Jim demonstrated quite well, we did nothing to pull any business forward. We worked hard on balancing production with demand. And as a consequence the last two weeks of December were a little better than we anticipated that they might be.", "And as a consequence we said this wasn\u2019t our intent but to the extent that any of that came out of the first quarter, the first quarter could be a little softer. As I know you\u2019re acutely aware, the home centers and all large retailers given that their fiscal years end January 31, the month of January is a very, very difficult month to project business. And it\u2019s not even always a good indicator of the quarter. Specifically, it\u2019s the way the business models work, orders tend to be light as do shipments in the month of January.", "And quite often the lighter they are in January, the better they are in February and March, thus making first quarter a relatively normal quarter in terms of volume. Given the tremendous uncertainty out there right now, it makes it even more difficult to project December actuals and January orders into a first quarter number. So simply said, we\u2019ve changed nothing, Mike, from the long term perspective.", "December was a little better. We said if that unintentionally came out of the first quarter of the year, it might be a little worse.", "Michael Rehaut", "First just a follow on to that, where was it a little bit better in December than you anticipated? And I just don\u2019t want to get cut off in terms of my actual second question, but any type of comments you can give in terms of pension expense expected in \u201909 versus \u201908, given the declines in the equity markets for the extent that you can help us in terms of your thinking for budgeting there?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "That\u2019s fine, because I think it\u2019s a relevant question and because it\u2019s a non-issue for Stanley, I\u2019m glad you asked it and it\u2019s one that Don will address. In terms of the volume, quite frankly it was better literally across the board. Both Security businesses finished strong, our CDIY segment did not finish as weakly as we\u2019d anticipated, and there were as you know our Industrial segment is a very large diverse portfolio of businesses, some a little up, some a little down. But simply said it was across the board with convergent and mechanical Security finishing strong.", "Neither Bostage or consumer tools and storage finished strong but they weren\u2019t quite as weak as we\u2019d anticipated, and mixed results across our Industrial portfolio. Don do you want to talk a little bit about pension expense?", "Donald Allan Jr.", "", "Sure. As you\u2019re probably aware, you know, pension expense is not a big number for Stanley Works. We don\u2019t have many defined contribution plans which would drive a lot of pension expense. ", "John F. Lundgren", "", "We provide benefit plans. We have a lot of defined contribution plans.", "Donald Allan Jr. ", "", "And as a result, we don\u2019t expect our pension expense to go up much at all in 2009. It could be a modest increase but the overall number is relatively immaterial for the company and the increase would follow that same way.", "John F. Lundgren", "", "And as a consequence that\u2019s probably nothing we need to adjust existing models for.", "Kate White", "", "Last question, Jennifer.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Kenneth Zener.", "Kenneth Zener", "Just looking at Security and the convergent side of that business, I think about 30% of that business currently is recurring revenue. Given the backward integration that you\u2019re having in HSM and the likelihood that installs will fall at a greater rate than recurring revenue, I assume, can you talk about where that might go in terms of some level of sensitivity? If your install slides down, could that convergent get to 40 plus percent of recurring revenue?", "James M. Loree", "", "First of all convergent recurring mix and convergent is about 40%, not 30. And at the moment we\u2019re not expecting a significant contraction in the installs, nor are we experiencing one. If it were to occur, basically the profit margin on install is considerably less than it is on the recurring revenue. I mean you\u2019re talking about gross margins that are double on a rate basis on the recurring side. So you know it\u2019s not going to have a dramatic impact because it will have some negative impact if we had a big dive in installations, but not a dramatic impact because the mix - the rate mix would go up.", "It would have a longer term impact for sure because that stream of recurring revenue over time would be affected by lower installs. So that\u2019s really the dynamic there.", "Kenneth Zener", "", "And that 40% number that includes the recent French acquisition I assume?", "James M. Loree", "", "Includes everything, yes.", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Includes everything. All in breadth convergence business as we reported.", "Kate White", "", "Thank you very much everybody for your participation today. Again if you have any questions please call Corbin Walburger or myself. Our contact information is both in the press release and on the website and have a wonderful day.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Black & Decker fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Rothleitner, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.", "Mark M. Rothleitner", "", "Welcome to Black & Decker\u2019s fourth quarter conference call. On today\u2019s call our Chief Executive Officer Nolan Archibald and our Chief Financial Officer Steve Reeves will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and outlook for 2009. Their comments should take about 20 minutes and then we\u2019ll answer your questions.", "In keeping with SEC requirements, I advise that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Black & Decker Corporation, please review the reports that we have filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G.", "A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included on the corporation\u2019s website under the investor relations section. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Nolan.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "This morning Black & Decker announced earnings per share of $0.73 for the quarter and $4.82 for the full year. Excluding restructuring charges EPS was $0.97 and $5.47 for the year. As you know, 2008 was a challenging year. While we exceeded our most recent adjusted EPS guidance due to lower interest and taxes, sales and margins were below our expectations.", "Throughout the year, our management team remained focused on protecting our profitability, generating cash and positioning the company for the long term. We accomplished these objectives including full year adjusted EPS with our original guidance range despite dramatically weakening economic conditions.", "In the fourth quarter the global economy deteriorated even more than we had anticipated in October. Sales decreased 17% including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency translation. This was well below our expectations particularly in our European power tool business and fastening segment. Our operating margin of 5.9% excluding restructuring was also a bit below our guidance due to lower volume. ", "For the full year sales decreased 7% including a 2% favorable impact from currency translation. Our operating margin excluding restructuring charges decreased to 7.8% for the year reflecting lower volume and the ongoing impact of component cost inflation. Pre-cash flow was $347 million for the year, slightly above expectations. Due to careful management of capital spending and inventory, we continued to cover over 100% of net earnings to free cash flow.", "Now, let me discuss our business segments. Sales in our worldwide power tools and accessories segment decreased 13% for the quarter and 10% for the full year. The North American business has faced weakened housing and discretionary spending all year and the slowdown in Europe has accelerated in recent quarters. In the US industrial products group, sales decreased low double digits for the quarter, depressed housing and slowing commercial construction continued to hurt our sales this quarter in all major product categories.", "Sales were down more than 20% in most channels primarily reflecting weak industry demand. However, our sales increased significantly at one major home center due to listing gains earlier in the year. Sell through at retail was weak and got worse as the quarter progressed. Accordingly, we anticipate retail in flow an inventory corrections in the first quarter.", "For the year sales in the US industrial products group were down low double digits. Sales declined across all major product lines and most channels due to broad market weakness. In the US consumer products group, sales decreased more than 20% for the quarter. Demand for tools and accessories fell off sharply reflecting lower consumer discretionary spending and fewer new gift items this year. ", "The new quarter cable line was well received in the market place and shipments were around our expectations. However, they were below the combined level of Firestorm and BPX a year ago. Our sales also decreased significantly in cleaning products and the automotive and electronics business. The outdoor products line had very strong shipments ahead of the spring selling season, partially offsetting the weakness in other categories.", "Full year sales of consumer products in the US were down more than 20%, similar to the fourth quarter results. Loss pressure washer listings and the transition out of Firestorm accounted for roughly half of the decline primarily in the first and second quarters. Most other product lines also saw decreases mitigated by growth in outdoor. ", "In the European power tools and accessories business sales decreased approximately 20% for the quarter. As in recent quarters markets in the UK, Iberia, Scandinavian were particularly depressed. The economic slowdown worsened in these and other parts of Western Europe. The Eastern European market which had been expanding has begun contracting as well. Weak economies were compounded by retailer inventory reductions, cancelled promotions and some loss market share in cordless.", "From a product line perspective both industrial and consumer tools had significant sales declines with outdoor products the one positive note. For the full year, European sales decreased at a low double digit rate. This reflects a rapid deterioration in the second half following a mid single digit decline in the first half. ", "In Latin America sales increased double digits again this quarter but, at a slower rate than prior quarters. While the increase was driven largely by Brazil, sales for most product lines and regions grew. For the full year our Latin American business again delivered outstanding performance with sales growth in the high teens. Results in other parts of the world were mixed. Our Canadian business posted growth in the quarter and full year. Asia Pacific sales were down for the quarter primarily due to Australia and New Zealand but up for the full year. ", "Return on sales in the power tools and accessories business were 5.6% this quarter due to product recall costs in the fourth quarter of 2007, the segment\u2019s margin increased year-on-year. Compared to the third quarter however, it was down significantly. Gross margin reflected increasing pressure from component cost inflation. This was also unfavorable as normal lines performed worse than promotional business. This segment\u2019s SG&A percentage was down again this quarter despite lower volume as we aggressively reduced expenses. ", "For the year, return on sales for this segment decreased 270 basis points to 7.4%. The decline was primarily in gross margin driven by inflation, mix and fixed cost absorption. Price pressure was largely offset by productivity gains. SG&A percentage increased for the year as sales decreased faster than spending. ", "In our hardware and home improvement segment, sales decreased 11% for both the quarter and full year. This was driven largely by the Kwikset and Weiser US lock business which saw double digit decreases for the quarter and full year. Throughout the year this business faced declines of 25% or more in the new construction channels, similar to the trend in housing starts. At retail sales were nearly flat in the fourth quarter. Retail sales were down mid single digits for the year reflecting load in volumes for the SmartKey launch in 2007.", "SmartKey has exceeded our expectations even in the slowing economy and took market share from the competition. Price Pfister faucet sales decreased mid single digits for the quarter and high single digits for the full year. At retail sales grew for the second straight quarter exceeding our expectations in a tough environment. Compared to Kwikset this business benefitted from a higher concentration in remodeling and the retail channels versus new construction. ", "Operating income for the hardware and home improvement business decreased to 5.8% for the quarter. Gross margin and SG&A percentage were affected significantly by lower sales and production volumes. We continue to face component cost inflation as well as product transition costs. For the full year this segment\u2019s operating margin decreased to 8.6% primarily due to lower volume and inflation. ", "In the fastening and assembly systems segment, sales decreased 13% for the quarter. Historically this business is our most consistent both in terms of sales and profitability however, it could not overcome the dramatic slowing in the global automotive industry this quarter. Our automotive division sales declined sharply in all geographic regions but less than the 23% drop in global auto production. We continued to grow market share and content per vehicle outside North America offsetting some of the macro pressure. ", "Sales in the industrial division were down low single digits with continued growth in Asia. For the full year, sales for the fastening segment decreased 2% as strong sales in Asia partially offset the Us automotive decline. The September acquisition of Spiralock contributed two points of sales growth for the quarter and one point for the full year. Operating margin for the fastening segment fell to 11.5% for the quarter. While this business is quick to adjust to a changing environment, it was not possible to fully compensate for the sudden change in demand. For the full year, operating margin decreased 80 basis points to a respectable 14.7%.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the time over to Steve who will discuss our financials in more detail.", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "Starting with the income statement, sales were $1.4 billion, a 17% year-on-year decline. Organically volume decreased 13% for the quarter. Price was flat representing an improvement from the negative 1% impact in recent quarters. Currency translation had a -4% impact in line with our guidance.", "For the full year sales decreased 7% with volume down 9% partially offset by 2% from the currency. Price was flat for the year and the acquisition of Spiralock did not have a material impact on the quarter or the full year. ", "Gross margin was 31.6% for the quarter. This was virtually flat to last year with a negative impact from lower volume, unfavorable mix and ongoing component cost inflation and a favorable comparison to the 2007 product recall costs. For the full year gross margin was 32.8%, a decrease of 110 basis points. Inflation had approximately a $40 million impact on the quarter and $160 million for the year. ", "Due to existing contracts in place, we expect the benefit from lower commodity costs will be phased in during 2009. Also bear in mind that the RMB appreciated against the dollar through the third quarter and a negative comparison will exist through the front half. ", "In the fourth quarter we continued our progress on SG&A reducing expenses by $88 million. While $32 million of this drop relates to an environmental charge in 2007, we reduced SG&A 14% excluding that charge. The power tools and accessories segment again decreased spending in every major category and even reduced SG&A as a percentage of sales. For the full year consolidated SG&A decreased by $104 million or $72 million excluding the 2007 environmental charge. It increased as a percentage of sales by 70 basis points on lower volume excluding the charge. ", "During the quarter we recorded a restructuring charge of $21 million which had a $0.24 impact on EPS. This charge is primarily of work force reduction of nearly 1,200 positions in response to the global slowdown. Roughly two thirds of those positions are in manufacturing. We anticipate that these actions will generate annual pre-tax savings of at least $30 million most of which should be realized in 2009. Since the fourth quarter of 2007, we have eliminated over 2,900 positions, including more than 1,000 salaried personnel. In total, our restructuring actions generated approximately $23 million of savings in 2008 and are on track to deliver incremental savings of $60 million in 2009. ", "Interest expense of just under $18 million for the quarter was lower than the prior year and our October guidance. Underlying rates and spreads both came down from peak levels as the quarter progressed. For the year, interest expense decreased $20 million to $62 million reflecting favorable average rates globally. ", "Our effective tax rate had a significant effect on earnings again this quarter. As we have indicated in the past, book taxes will have significant quarterly variability under the Fin 48 accounting standard. The resolution of certain income tax matters and other adjustments resulted in a 2% rate for the quarter or 11% excluding a restructuring charge. This contributed approximately 20% to EPS relative to the tax rate assumed and our previous guidance. For the full year our tax rate of 20% was significantly below our expected long term run rate of 30% primarily due to the resolution of issues with several tax jurisdictions during the year. ", "Now, I\u2019ll discuss the balance sheet and cash flow which continue to be a primary focus area for the company. We generated $347 million of free cash flow for the year converting over 100% of net earnings for the seventh time in eight years. We have averaged more than 20% conversion of this period. Inventory decreased 11% for the year compared to 7% decline in sales. We also limited capital expenditures to $99 million, our lowest level since 2002.", "Because we have put our share repurchase program on hold, our cash flow enabled our net debt $35 million during the quarter. Net debt was down slightly for the full year as free cash flow roughly matched outflows for share repurchases made in the first half and dividends. We have no long term debt maturities until 2011 and believe our balance sheet and liquidity are in solid shape to support our business.", "In addition to our operating performance I\u2019d like to discuss the accounting impact on recent events on cash flow and the balance sheet. First, the stronger dollar will have an effect on reported free cash flow in 2009 as we define that term. Cash inflows and out flows related to our currency hedging activities are classified in the cash flow statement under operating activities or investing activities based on the nature of the hedge. Hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries are classified as investing activities and hedges of our foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and forecast to transactions are classified as operating activities.", "As you recall, our definition of free cash flow is cash flow from operating activities, less capital expenditures plus proceeds from the disposal of assets. As a result, cash flows related to net investment hedges are excluding from free cash flow. Due to the rapid strengthening of the dollar late in 2008 we experienced much larger gains and losses on these hedges than usual. Therefore, based on current exchange rates we expect cash out flow on operating hedges will significantly reduce free cash flow in 2009 largely offsetting cash inflows from net investment hedges will be excluded from our defined free cash flow. ", "Therefore, when evaluating our cash generation in 2009 hedge settlements should be considered in addition to free cash flow. The bottom line is that we expect to generate cash in excess of earnings in 2009 and that our net debt will be down modestly. Second, as you would expect a decline in equity markets has reduced the value and funding position of our pension plans. The negative P&L impact of this will be roughly offset by lower service costs on a smaller work force so we expect roughly flat pension expense in 2009. In terms of cash, our full year contributions to the plans are expected to increase by approximately $15 to $20 million based on current regulations.", "Regarding cash deployment, in the near term we remain focused on free cash flow, liquidity and a solid balance sheet. We will continue to look at compelling bolt on acquisitions but these will likely be small. In addition, we do not expect to be active in the share repurchase program in the near term but will return to this tool as conditions warrant. ", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Nolan to discuss the outlook for 2009.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "As you know, we are facing a financial and economic crisis unlike anything in our professional careers. We have recently seen housing starts at a 50 year low, US auto sales down more than a third and customer confidence at a new low. All in all data points suggest that our end markets will deteriorate significantly in 2009. ", "Our company has taken many cost actions over the past two years to right size our business and protect earnings. We continue to evaluate additional actions however, we have been careful to target these cuts and have left our product development capabilities essentially intact. This should help us to protect or even expand market share with new products in the future. Notwithstanding this, we expect macro conditions will result in a double digit organic sales decrease for the year.", "At current rates, foreign exchange would also have a negative impact of roughly 5% the next few quarters. For the first quarter we expect sales will decrease approximately 20% reflecting weak demand, likely inventory adjustments at retail and unfavorable currency. Under this demand scenario, our margins will come under more pressure especially in the first quarter. Component cost inflation and currency will also be unfavorable for the first half of the year.", "While we have implemented some price increases we anticipate price will roughly be neutral again in 2009. We\u2019ll benefit from restructuring savings but not nearly enough to offset other challenges. In total, we expect margins around 5% for the year and approximately 2% in the first quarter. We expect interest expense will stay around the $18 million quarterly run rate. We\u2019re assuming a full year tax rate of 30% and diluted share count remaining around $60.5 million.", "In total we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.15 and $1.75 to $2.25 for the full year. Partly because of the currency hedges Steve described, our free cash flow will decline significantly in 2009 however, free cash flow plus certain currency hedge gains should exceed net income therefore out net debt is expected to be down modestly for the year. ", "In summary, Black & Decker is weathering the economic crisis and is in a good position for long term success. We continue to generate earnings and met our original guidance for 2008. We continue to deliver innovative new products. In tools we have new cordless and corded platforms from DeWalt. In outdoor products we have 36 volt Black & Decker string trimmer and in Porter-Cable a new line for job sites and home workshops. In addition, we are excited about the new environmentally friendly products from Price Pfister and Kwikset. ", "We are reducing SG&A and right sizing the business for anticipated demand. We generated $347 million of free cash flow for the year and again exceeded 100% conversion. We significantly reduced inventory and capital expenditures and we maintained a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity to help us through this challenging environment. I believe that our talented management, solid financial position and sound strategy will drive long term growth and create value for Black & Decker stockholders.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. I\u2019ll now turn the time back to the operator and we\u2019ll answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities.", "David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "The first question I had was about the free cash flow projections and the sensitivity around free cash flow in \u201909 to changes in top line and sales. What kind of sales decline do you think you could experience about the kind of guidance you\u2019ve given so far and remain free cash flow positive?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "It kind of depends a little bit on the timing of that decline but we expect to be free cash flow positive. We could withstand I think a pretty sizeable decrease from here and still be positive on a free cash flow basis.", "David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Is there any way to put some quantification around that?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Generally our goal has always been to covert at least 100% or we\u2019ve been guiding 90% to 100% of our net income to free cash flow so if net income were to come in lower we still think on a falling sales we should be able to generate positive working capital, etc. so we should probably be able to hit a positive free cash flow as well with our conversion in and around 100%.", "David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities", "Then just a quick follow up question, can you give us some more details about the tax rate? I know there were some broad comments about it, maybe just some specifics about some of the resolutions you had in terms of taxes that drove it down and maybe kind of as we would look forward if we would expect to see any kind of similar behavior in future years?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "Sure. Actually there was no one large settlement that we had in various jurisdictions around the world, we had some settlements and we had some statute lapses, a number of which cumulated in this rate that we saw here in the fourth quarter. I think you should expect that those types of things will continue to happen and we\u2019ll see a choppy tax rate going forward. I think the base rate as Nolan mentioned going forward will be about 30%. The choppiness can go both ways, this happened to be all favorable in 2008.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "The first question just on the cost structure side obviously, there\u2019s been a big pull back in raw materials and I just wanted your thoughts there in terms of what you expectations are for material cost inflation, if any, in \u201909 or if maybe there\u2019s still a lack where you\u2019re still seeing higher costs in the channel? Also, if you could comment on the price side, you said that you expect pricing to be roughly neutral in \u201909 and given the sharply weakened demand environment particularly on the power tool side as well as the other segments what gives you the confidence to say that it will be neutral rather than perhaps giving up some price.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "You\u2019re first question, we are clearly seeing a moderation in our commodity costs. However, we\u2019ve got some contracts that we\u2019ll continue to be paying at a higher rate through the first couple of quarters of the year. We clearly benefited from those hedges the last couple of years but we\u2019re going to pay the price the first couple of quarters. We should see the benefit of that in the second half of the year. ", "The reason we\u2019ve assumed that our price will remain neutral is we have taken some price increases that we\u2019re not reflecting in our numbers. We\u2019ve tried to be very conservative as we have projected in this very difficult unprecedented market that we\u2019re in right now and therefore we think it\u2019s a rather conservative assumption even though we\u2019ve had some price increases and they are sticking. We just believe with promotional activity and the difficult market that we\u2019re not going to benefit from those already implemented price increases and therefore will be neutral for the year.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "The second question, just on bigger picture, back in the 2000, 2001 downturn and certainly that in many ways pales in comparison to today, you guys rolled out a pretty aggressive restructuring program in terms of shifting manufacturing capacity. You\u2019re taking actions today but I think on a comparative basis to a lesser degree. Anything in the works over the next year, anything that you\u2019re looking at in terms of on a larger level in addition to the actions taken today to repair the margins or is this more going to be a volume driven margin recovery over the next few years?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, the difference between our restructuring in early 2001 was our manufacturing footprint. We were manufacturing at a lot of high cost areas in Western Europe and the US and we dramatically changed our manufacturing footprint to low cost areas. We are in low costs areas and I think have a very good manufacturing footprint now so that opportunity to the same extent is not available to us.", "However, we continue to look at low cost regions. We\u2019ve seen cost increase recently in China and therefore we continue to look at India and Vietnam and other places. As you recall when we put those plants in these low costs areas we put them in such a way where we wouldn\u2019t have the dramatic costs of shifting our manufacturing from one facility to another or even to lower costs countries.", "So, we continue to evaluate that and we\u2019ll make manufacturing footprint changes as the market demands. We feel like we have been fairly aggressive, we\u2019ve taken out about 13% of our work force dramatically increasing our SG&A. If you think how fast sales have gone down due to market conditions and that our percentage is lower than that, I think that\u2019s fairly aggressive cost reduction and we\u2019ll continue to look at additional costs reductions.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "One more question if I could, just on the new product front, you mentioned a few new products. If you go back to the mid to late 90s when there was that large expansion of the DeWalt product portfolio, it appears that in recent years you haven\u2019t had those types of bigger entries in to adjacent categories. Anything over the next year or two on the new product front that you would consider kind of larger than kind of let\u2019s say singles or maybe doubles or triples in terms of order of magnitude or impact?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "I just mentioned a couple of examples in my prepared remarks. We have a very, very good new product year ahead of us. We\u2019ve got some significant additions to our cordless lithium ion line that we\u2019ll be seeing this year both in 18 volt and all this is completely compatible with our battery and charging system out there. We have a DeWalt coil framing nailer, we have DeWalt one half inch corded drills, two of those coming out. We have the Delta unisaw, we have a [minilay] that\u2019s five speed with variable speed. We have a significant number of accessories.", "Porter-Cable the new tradesmen line that we introduced with about 20 SKUs, we\u2019re going to be expanding that line. That clearly is a major product introduction that we had in the fourth quarter and just as likely rolled out DeWalt with 20 or so SKUs. We\u2019ll be adding to that Porter-Cable line, that\u2019s our tradesmen line that we think will go right at the heart of a lot of our competition.", "We\u2019ve loss some market share in the low end lithium ion cordless market and we think our new Porter-Cable tradesmen line will go directly at that as well as some additional DeWalt introductions that we\u2019ll have later in the year. In outdoor I mentioned in consumer Black & Decker the 36 volt string trimmer, we\u2019ve got new 12 and 14 volt hand vacs coming out, we\u2019ve got a number of new products in our automotive and electronics business. In HHI we\u2019ve got an aggressive plan in both locks and [inaudible] so new product share for 2009 throughout the year will be very, very good this year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to ask, your forecast for double digit sales declines through the first three quarters, I was just wondering about the phrasing of that and your kind of macro assumptions that you\u2019re making. Are you by virtue of what you\u2019re saying there assuming that the economy is going to start improving towards the end of the year or what does that mean in that respect?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "We are not assuming improvement in the year. We are going to have not as low of sales in the last three quarters. What we have done in the first quarter is adjusted for some inventory buildup in our customer\u2019s inventory and we think there will be some adjustment of that. So, we think our lowest quarter will be the first quarter but that\u2019s not economic related. ", "We believe that we\u2019re going to have a tough year throughout the year. Housing starts, we saw the latest numbers there of around 500 to 550 single housing starts. We think that could even deteriorate more. We\u2019ve tried to be conservative in our projections and our assumptions and adjust our cost and expenses accordingly. Steve do you want to add to that", "", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "", "Our sales forecast is really projecting current run rates out and you start to get a comp in the fourth quarter which is why we phrased it that way. We still think it will be difficult in the fourth quarter next year but not in a double digit range.", "Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The next question I wanted to move on to was the pensions, the over $350 million charge you took to equity to kind of up the pension obligation gives us some sense of the change in your funding status. That would seem pretty obvious given the deterioration and the investment environment and obviously the lower discount rates you\u2019d be applying to your obligations. But, on the other hand your cash obligation only increased I think you said by $10 or $15 million for the year.", "I just wanted to get an understanding of that. Is that simply a matter of the accounting only requires that much extra contribution this year but there will be additional cash contributions in the future? How should we kind of reconcile that?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "I think it\u2019s actually more like $15 to $20 in 2009. It\u2019s hard to project out past that because it\u2019s all so dependent on the facts and the assumptions in the market place at that time. But, all other things being equal, the funding pressure will increase from there as we go out past 2009. ", "Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "What\u2019s the total amount of the funding that you\u2019re expecting this year?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "We had about $10 million this year so the total funding should then be about $25 to $30.", "Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "If I could sneak one final in there, any thoughts on your dividends here? Your yield is now above 5% based on where your stock price is now. I think your obligation is over $100 million a year so any thoughts or any pressure on that?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, we continue to evaluate that. I think a lot will depend on what happens to the market and how long this recession is going to last and how deep and long it\u2019s going to be. Clearly, we\u2019re above our normal rate of yield but we\u2019ve made no decision to lower the dividend but we\u2019ll monitor it and adjust it accordingly if economic circumstances continue longer and deeper than we anticipate.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Daniel Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in terms of your thoughts on pricing. With your comments about the sales there\u2019s implied in that that there is improvement as the year goes on and given this negative impact on operating leverage if you were to hold pricing at lower sales where you might to cut more on the SG&A side, would you think about to be more flexible on price given the focus from retailers these days on delivering lower prices to the consumer?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, we think we\u2019ve been fairly \u2013 I mean we haven\u2019t taken the full price increases that we experienced during the inflationary period of time that we\u2019ve had over the last five years. It has been unprecedented and we have not passed that along to our customers and therefore as prices of commodities have come down we have clearly communicated to our customers that we didn\u2019t take the full price increases at that time and we absorb most of those ourselves.", "So, we believe we can hold price from where we are right now and that\u2019s why even though we\u2019ve had some prices increases we\u2019ll be doing some promotions that our pricing will be neutral this year.", "Daniel Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Can you give us a little more clarity, you\u2019re talking about the [20%] decline in the first quarter, what is it you\u2019re expecting second, third and fourth, if you can give us any more clarity on that?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "I think again, projecting out the run rates will kind of be in the low double digits in Q2 and Q3 organically and around 5% currency in both of those quarters.

Reeves ", "Well I think for the full year 2008 it was $160 million. As Nolan spoke to a little bit ago I think that as we look forward to 2009 it will be much lower than that. It still will be negative by the time everything flushes through the supply chain based on some of the contracts we have in place and some of the currency impact especially with respect to the RMB. It will be negative but not anywhere near that size.", "David McGregor \u2013 Longbow Research", "Is there any way you can give us a sense of what you\u2019re using in your assumptions?", "Stephen F.

I know the savings you talked about $60 million but not any perspective charges?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "Those savings are relative to the charges we\u2019ve already taken. You certainly here in the first quarter can be digesting what we\u2019ve just done but we\u2019ll continue to look at other opportunities to save costs so if there are future charges in 2009 there should be incremental savings associated with them.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "My point is that your guidance right now does not include any restructuring charges or negative P&L impact of charges in \u201909.", "Stephen F.

How should we look at the differential there?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "I think we\u2019ll obviously need to take down inventories in line with the sales or volume declines, yes. So, we will take production down.", "Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James", "So your production will be down roughly the same as your projected shipments.", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "Yes, that\u2019s a good assumption.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Let me just add one point to the restructuring question you had to Steve and that is in our projections we have not taken any one-time off restructuring assumptions like we have.

We anticipate that they\u2019ll be above the fleet average for 2009.", "Kenneth Zener \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Can you talk about maybe competitor discounts or the competition over there? I think you mentioned some market share losses in cordless, was that in Europe or is that in the US?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "We\u2019ve had some market share loss both in the US and in Europe because lithium ion has taken greater market share in Europe faster than it has in the US we\u2019ve had slightly more market share loss. This is in the low end lithium ion compact cordless power tools. As I mentioned, this new line of Porter-Cable that we\u2019ve got as well as the new offerings that we have coming in DeWalt will address that but we have had a little bit more market share loss in that segment in Europe than we have in the US.", "Kenneth Zener \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "I guess kind of related that, what are your field teams telling you in terms of your industrial channel about those professional buyers willing to trade down? That would seem that is what they\u2019re doing in this lithium ion. With the Porter-Cable lithium ion that you hope to stem some of these losses is that really just a function of price?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, it\u2019s a function of price. We\u2019ve continued to do extremely well in our cordless DeWalt premium market. Those sales have been pretty good and we\u2019ve maintained or increased market share in the high end so it has to do with application also. Some of the application of the lower end professional power tools, the tradesmen line, people are a bit more cost conscious in this kind of a competitive environment so it is cost sensitive in that lower end of the market.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Two things, first of all can you talk a little bit further about what you\u2019re seeing with mix in the market in terms of what your power tool customer is doing? You mentioned I believe promotional sales did better than traditional in line sales but can you give us a little more color in terms of how that is behaving and what impact that is having on you and how you might be responding to that?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve seen that continued in the first quarter, it is that people are inclined to buy things that are on sale or on promotion. I think you\u2019ve seen that pretty well across the line not only in our industry but all industries. We\u2019ve tried to be responsive to that with promotional deals and therefore even though we\u2019ve put in price increases we\u2019ve had some very aggressive promotions and that\u2019s what our customers seem to be buying the most of and therefore we had the unfavorable mix. We\u2019ve anticipated that same kind of activity in the projections that we have made.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Secondly, I know in the fourth quarter that you commented that you were above your expectations in terms of results but the first quarter number is down so significantly. Can you talk about how things have trended as we moved through 4Q and in to 1Q? Then, within that how you think about 2Q and beyond, how that behaves sequentially?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, we think the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter will continue in the first quarter. The reason that our sales are affected more in the first quarter is the inventory adjustment that we believe our retailers will make as they take down their inventories. But, we don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll match point of sale. We believe that inventory correction will take place in the first quarter and therefore our shipments will be closer to our point of sale results in the second and third quarters. Then, as Steve mentioned, we have lower comparables in the fourth quarter.", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "Eric, it\u2019s a little different around the world as well. I think I might say that in the US things appeared to decelerate as the quarter went on, things held in pretty well through Thanksgiving and stepped down in December whereas in Europe it was pretty consistently down throughout the quarter.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Then I guess lastly, the inventory correction needed at retail based on the slowing in sales, is that something that you\u2019re confident is a one quarter phenomenon or might we be spending all of 2009 talking about inventory draw down at retail?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "We have pockets of inventory. It isn\u2019t across the board and we believe that the first quarter will correct those pockets of inventory.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman & Associates.", "Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Just to follow up on Eric\u2019s comment on inventory and then I have a question on balance sheet. The inventory at the home centers and major customers from many are saying are already at very low levels. Maybe you can comment historically six to eight weeks use to be sort of a good level of stock on the shelves and some SKUs we\u2019re hearing stock outs and inventory is already as low as one to two weeks. ", "So, I\u2019m just kind of curious from fourth quarter to first quarter with inventories so lean, the expectation for a more significant inventory correction seems high to digest so if you can help us a little on that and kind of compare it to where it is today and what you think that means especially since there\u2019s been a lot of stock outs. All you have to do is walk through the stores and you see it.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "Well, as I mentioned in my response to Eric\u2019s question is this is not across the board. We have some accounts that have very lean inventory and we do have stock outs. We believe retailers are going to continue to play it very close to the vest. We believe that they\u2019re going to have very lean inventories but we do have pockets of inventory and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve reflected in our projection for the first quarter. So, we\u2019ve got one particular customer that has a higher level of inventory and we think our projections have taken that in to account. But, you\u2019re right, in other categories we\u2019ve got lean inventories.", "Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Separately, just talking about the challenge with so many of the industry participants especially a lot of your fragmented customers challenged today with the lack of working capital advancements now being afforded to them by their lenders and just pressure from builders going bankrupt and seeing just so many business failures unfortunately, can you tell us what you\u2019re expecting for your\u201909 receivables? And, how much you have reserved for bad debt expense and what the fourth quarter looked like with respect to bad debt collection?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "There is clearly pressure out there and we have historically actually managed that reasonably well. We did put up some incremental reserves in the fourth quarter for some specific accounts where we felt there was a challenge. It will be something we\u2019ll watch closely. Obviously, we try and be proactive in moving credit limits down when we start to see troubles so we don\u2019t get caught with a balance sheet risk.", "Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "In terms of the reserve amount in the fourth quarter can you share that with us?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "It wasn\u2019t material to the overall results.", "Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Lastly, I think Nishu was asking you guys about the dividend and I think Nolan it was a very good fair answer, that you\u2019re obviously going to continue to access things. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts about the overall down turn. Are you guys assuming that 2009 is the trough and therefore it would only be like \u2013 assuming 2010 is worse than 2009 that maybe then you\u2019d have to step up the consideration on dividends? So, kind of what\u2019s your trigger point Nolan?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "We\u2019ll continue the to monitor it each quarter. This is a board decision and we\u2019re clearly at a high payout rate right now. We\u2019ll monitor it and I didn\u2019t mean to infer in my remarks that we promise that we wouldn\u2019t do anything with the dividend for a whole year, what I tried to convey is that we\u2019ll monitor it and look at it on a quarterly basis and depending on what is happening in the market place we\u2019ll just make that decision of what we feel like is the most prudent things for the best long term benefit of our shareholders.", "Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "I understand but do you have a view right now? Are you making a view known to us, what you\u2019re view is, if you expect 2010 to be an up year in your planning? I think as Michael Rehaut was asking about your footprint and you\u2019ve taken a lot of low hanging fruit out and yet you\u2019re saying in China [inaudible] low cost increase in the cost structure and you\u2019re looking at India and other places, I guess we\u2019d like to hear your business plan and strategic outlook if you\u2019re assuming 2010 is going to be an improvement from 2009.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "What we\u2019re assuming in our planning right now is that 2009 will not be an improvement. As I mentioned, we think there could be some slight improvement in 2010 and then more in 2011.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "I just have a few kind of cleanup questions. I didn\u2019t hear, I\u2019m sorry if you said this at the beginning of the call what the breakdown of 4Q consolidated sales between volume and price?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "Price was flat.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "Also, Nolan I was wondering if you clarify the comments you made before about losing share in the low end of the lithium ion market? More particular are you referring to the 18 volt because I don\u2019t think you really have, and I apologize if I\u2019m getting this wrong, material product offerings with the 12 volt or 14 volt in lithium ion.", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "We do have offerings in 12 volt and 14 volt but they are in [inaudible]. When I\u2019m talking about the low end lithium ion market I was speaking of 18 volt in that lower costs 18 volt market that\u2019s more of a tradesmen, high do it yourself offering than a DeWalt offering. That is the area we have loss some market share in and that\u2019s what Porter-Cable specifically addressed as well as some SKUs that we\u2019ll be introducing later in the year in DeWalt.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "Just a couple of last minute small items on the income statement, for \u201909 in taking that 5% consolidated operating margin in to account, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the negative impact of currency and I assume corporate expense would stay roughly in line with \u201908 maybe a little bit lower. So, that gets me to a negative currency translation hit of roughly $20 to $25 million. ", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "I think in your modeling you should assume actually that the corporate will be up slightly given the way we account for pensions internal to the company. The pension will be a little more negative in corporate and more favorable in the ops so it will be up slightly.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "Again, does that kind of leave me with a currency translation negative impact of about $20 to $25 million or would it be a little bit less than that?", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "[Inaudible] four or five points, right?", "Nolan D. Archibald ", "We said 5%.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J. P. Morgan Securities", "That\u2019s on the top line. I\u2019m talking about the operating profit.", "Stephen F. Reeves ", "You might think about a number a little higher than that.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions.", "Stephen F.

(Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the conference to Mark Rothleitner, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer.   Please go ahead, sir. ", "", "Mark Rothleitner", "", "Thank you, operator.  Good morning and welcome to Black and Decker\u2019s First Quarter Conference Call.  On today\u2019s call our Chief Financial Officer Steve Reeves and I will discuss our first quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2009.  Our comments should take about 15 minutes and then we will answer your questions.", "In keeping with SEC requirements I want to advise you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect The Black and Decker Corporation please review the reports we have filed with the SEC including the 8-K filed today.  In addition, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Reg G.  A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included on the Corporations website under the Investor Relation section.", "Now I will turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Reeves", "Thanks Mark.  This morning Black and Decker announced earnings per share of $0.08 for the first quarter or $0.22 excluding restructuring charges.  This is slightly better than our guidance despite an economic environment that was even weaker than we anticipated.  We have taken a series of aggressive steps to reduce costs, enabling us to remain profitable even in the worst economic downturn we\u2019ve ever seen.  Sales decreased 28% including a 5% unfavorable impact from currency translation.  In January we gave sales guidance for a decline of approximately 20% in the first quarter, however sales in our European Power Tool business and Fastening segment were well below our estimate.  We saw rapid deterioration in Europe and the automotive industry late in 2008 and another step down this quarter.", "Our pre restructuring operating margins decreased to 3.5% primarily due to lower sales volume.  Importantly however, margins were better than the 2% we projected.  We stayed disciplined on price which contributed 1% to sales and helped our gross margin.  In addition, we reduced SG&A expense by 23% a significant improvement versus last year.  While some of this does reflect currency translation we have meaningfully change our fixed cost base over the last six quarters.", "We also remain well positioned in terms of liquidity and cash flow.  As expected, free cash flow as significantly negative due to typical first quarter working capital needs as well as the accounting treatment of currency hedging that we discussed in January.", "Including cash flows from net investment hedging activities net cash generation was negative at $123 million versus -$71 million in the first quarter of 2008.  This decline was driven by lower earnings as the change in working capital and capital expenditures were similar to the prior year.", "Now let me discuss our business segments.", "Sales in our worldwide Power Tools and Accessories segment decreased 23% in the quarter.  In the US the industrial product group sales decreased approximately 30%.  We had anticipated most of this decline based on depressed construction levels and inventory corrections at retail.  Order levels were particularly weak in the independent channel and at a large customer.", "Late in the quarter DEWALT(NYSE:R) launched the next generation of XRP cordless tools featuring compatible lithium ion and Ni-Cad battery systems.  Initial orders for this line came in later than planned as the slowing economy lengthened the process of working through existing inventories.  Looking forward however, we believe XRP and other upcoming launches will bolster our leading position in cordless.", "Following a year of challenging transitions results for the US Consumer Products Group stabilized considerably in the first quarter.  Sales decreased mid single-digits, a much narrower decline than in 2008.  As we mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we had large December shipments of outdoor product ahead of the spring season.  This in turn drove the sales decline for the first quarter.", "Sales of tools and accessories increased reflecting solid performance for the new Porter-Cable(R) line.", "In the European Power Tools and Accessories business we had planned for continued sales decline, but did not expect a drop of nearly 30%.  Results were weak in all key product lines, but particularly for industrial tools.  Commercial activity in some markets was down substantially, especially Eastern Europe which was affected by currency volatility and investment flight.  ", "The slow downs also limited demand for our premium lithium ion products.", "Other parts of the world which had performed well in 2008, also showed signs of economic slowing this quarter.  In Latin America sales were flat as weakening construction activity offset strong consumer product sales, especially in Brazil.", "Sales were down double-digits in Canada significantly worse than we expected, in part to due to inventory corrections and promotional shifts at retail.", "The Asia Pacific sales were also down double-digit declines in most countries.", "Return on sales for the Power Tools and Accessories business decreased 440 basis points to 3.9% this quarter.  Roughly half the drop was in gross margin reflecting ongoing component cost inflation, absorption, unfavorable mix, and currency, which more than offset favorable productivity and price.", "SG&A decreased an impressive 16%, but as sales fell even more deleverage had a negative impact on the segments operating margin.", "In our Hardware and Home Improvement segment sales decreased 19% for the quarter.  Results in this segment continue to reflect declines of roughly 25% to 30% in the new construction channel with smaller decreases at retail.  ", "Lockset sales in the US were down more than 20% at low and mid price points the decline was less than our higher priced SPIRALOCK category.  This reflected some consumers trading down as well as a large customer closing its show rooms doors and inventory actions in the channel.", "The Price Pfister faucet business posted mid teen sales decline due to the ongoing challenge in construction and falling demand at retail.", "Operating margin for the Hardware and Home Improvement segment decreased 340 basis points to 4% for the quarter.  Gross margin and SG&A percentage were both unfavorable reflecting lower sales and production of volumes as well as the carry in of component inflation.  ", "In the Fastening and Assembly Systems segment sales decreased 34%, far worse than we anticipated.  Over 60% of the sales in the segment are to the automotive industry which reduced production in the quarter in an attempt to bring finished vehicle inventories in line.  Our sales to auto makers were down nearly 40%, slightly less than the drop in production levels.  ", "The remainder of the segment also saw a sharp decline as industrial customers reacted to the global economic slowdown and reduced inventories.  Our sales were down across major product lines and geographical regions.  The 2008 acquisition of SPIRALOCK contributed 2 points of sales growth for the quarter to the segment.", "Operating margin for the Fastening segment fell to 1.9% for the quarter.  Our management has proactively reduced costs, but could not keep up with the sales decline.", "Now we will review the financials in a little more detail.", "Looking at the income statement sales were $1.1 billion for the quarter, a 28% year-on-year decline.  Organically volume decreased 24% for the quarter and price added 1%.  Currency translation had a negative 5% impact, largely in line with our guidance.", "Gross margin was 31.7% for the quarter; this was virtually flat to the fourth quarter, but down nearly 300 basis points to last year.  As we expected component cost deflation has not worked through the splicing yet to the P&L.   The negative year-on-year impact was driven by steel, resins, and the appreciation of the Chinese Renminbi.  The mix also remained negative as some of our highest margin product lines and businesses were disproportionately affected by the weak economy.", "In the first quarter we reduced SG&A by $92 million or 23%.  Currency contributed 6 points to this decrease.  Expenses were down in every major category and in each segment.  While our actions were generating significant results, SG&A increased 180 basis points due to the lower volume.", "As you can see from the press release corporate adjustments and eliminations is favorable to last year.   More than half of this favorability was the result of lower legal and environmental expense including a favorable ruling on certain litigation in the quarter.  The balance is comprised of lower incentive accruals, reduced corporate spending, and other miscellaneous items.  Absent the legal and environmental favorability our earnings before restructuring would have been within our guidance range.", "During the quarter we recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million which had a $0.14 impact on EPS.  As global economies have weakened we continue to reevaluate the size and structure of our business.  Restructuring actions reflected in the first quarter charge include a further workforce reduction of 1,500 positions and should generate annual pre-tax savings of more than $15 million in 2009.  Overall our workforce is nearly 20% smaller today than at the end of 2007.   ", "In total our recent restructuring actions generated approximately $15 million of savings in the first quarter and are expected to deliver over $75 million for the full year.", "Interest expense of $16 million for the quarter was slightly favorable to the prior year and our guidance.  In a moment Mark will discuss our recent bond issuance which increases our interest expense going forward.", "Our effective tax rate was 45% for the quarter, or 36%, excluding the effect of restructuring.  This is higher than the 30% rate we expect over time due to a fixed interest component to the expense.  Usually this does not affect the rate much, but on a low earnings base it increased the rate significantly this quarter.  We did not have any significant resolutions of tax matters or adjustments this quarter.  ", "Now I will turn it over to Mark who will discuss cash flow and liquidity in more detail.", "Mark Rothleitner", "Thanks Steve.  Our balance sheet remains in good shape and we expect cash flow will remain solid despite the challenging environment.  As Steve mentioned, net cash generation was negative $123 million for the quarter due to seasonal working capital needs.  We expected a number in this ballpark and are still on track to generate cash in excess of earnings for the year.  ", "Inventory decreased 17% year-on-year which we consider good progress in light of the weaker than expected sales.  We also reduced capital expenditures roughly 20% and expect a similar trend the rest of the year.", "Due to negative cash generation in the regular dividend payment net debt increased $149 million during the quarter; however, consistent with our January projection we expect net debt will be down modestly for the full year.", "Shortly after the end of the quarter we issued $350 million of senior notes due in 2014.  Over the past year we have taken steps to shift from short-term to long-term debt, maintaining a conservative position during the financial crisis.  The bond offering was a continuation of this strategy.  The bond market has been very unpredictable since September, so we took advantage of a favorable opportunity to issue in early April.  As a result, we have no long-term debt maturities until 2011 and nearly all of our $1 billion short-term credit facility is available.  However, our 2009 interest expense will increase by roughly $18 million versus our previous guidance, almost entirely due to the bonds.  ", "Our past employment priority remains net debt reduction and we continue to look at small bolt on acquisitions.  Our share repurchases also remain on hold.", "Now I will turn it back to Steve to discuss the outlook for the rest of 2009.", "Steve Reeves", "Thanks Mark.  Before I discuss our 2009 outlook, I would like to note that next week, at its scheduled meeting, our board will address our dividend.  As we discussed in January, we will evaluate our dividend pay out in relation to our current profitability, cash flow, and general economic environment, and make a decision based on the best long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders.", "Looking forward to the balance of the year most of the end market factors that caused the weak demand in the first quarter are expected to continue.  The housing, non-residential construction, and automotive industries remain depressed.  General economic conditions are still poor in Europe and decelerating in other regions.   ", "While most inventory corrections occurred in the first quarter for the Power Tools and the International Fastening businesses, we expect further actions in the second quarter in selected areas.  As a result, for the second quarter we expect sales will decrease at a rate similar to the first quarter.  This includes approximately 7 points of unfavorable currency as we comp against last years weakening dollar.  The percentage declines should then narrow somewhat, particularly in the fourth quarter, as we anniversary the step change in the global economy.  For the year we expect a sales decline of approximately 20% including 5 points of unfavorable currency.  ", "As always, we are introducing great new products, such as the updated XRP cordless and additional tools in the Porter-Cable line.  However, we also recognize that the weak economy limits the upside from these launches.", "On the cost side deleveraging will continue to pressure our margins, component costs will remain unfavorable next quarter, and due to lower volumes the benefit of commodity deflation will be slower to work through the supply chain.", "The first quarter restructuring action should result in at least $15 million of additional savings for the year.  In addition, our management team is doing a good job of controlling discretionary spending, as evidenced by the progress on SG&A this quarter, an the salary and benefit actions previously disclosed will further mitigate the lower revenue forecast.", "Pricing has held up a little better than we expected and based on this performance, we believe that price will positive for the full year.  As a result of these developments, we still expect margins about 5% for the year, despite the volume pressure.", "We now expect interest expense will increase to roughly $91 million for the year, including the incremental costs related to the bond issuance.", "We are still assuming a full year tax rate of 30%. ", "Our diluted share count assumption has come down slightly to around $50.5 million shares due to the lower stock price.  ", "Also note that last week we filed an 8-K to reflect the new accounting standard for the calculation of earnings per share.", "In total, we now expect diluted EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.90 for the full year, excluding restructuring charges.  The decrease from our previous guidance, midpoint, is $0.30, roughly $0.21 of which relates to the interest expense.  The remainder reflects lower sales volume largely offset by cost reductions and the small first quarter out performance.  ", "In the second quarter we expect diluted EPS in the range of $0.35 to $0.45.", "With respect to cash flow we now believe we have identified a further $15 million reduction in capital spending for the year.  Additionally, while we have largely held inventory turns through the decline, we anticipate further reducing our inventory in the second quarter.  While pressuring the P&L through under absorption in the first half, this will allow us to match production to demand in the back half and generate incremental cash from working capital for the full year.  ", "In summary, Black and Decker has met its key objectives in a difficult environment this quarter and is taking the necessary steps to continue weathering the storm.  We delivered positive EPS in a challenging demand environment.  We continue to reduce SG&A expense without sacrificing our innovation capabilities, or long-term growth prospects.  We significantly reduced inventory and capital expenditures.  We remained on track to generate cash in excess of earnings for the year, and we maintained a conservative financing strategy issuing bonds after quarter end to further strengthen our liquidity position.", "I believe that Black and Decker has the best people in the industry to execute our strategy and drive the Company\u2019s long-term success.  We appreciate the efforts and the sacrifices our associates are making, and we remain confident that these will create value for the Company and its stockholders. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks.  Now I will turn it back to the operator and we will answer your questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Goldberg with UBS.", "Susan - UBS", "Good morning it is actually Susan for David.  I just want to know if you can discuss what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the health of some of your smaller independent retailers.  It seems like a fair amount of the decline that you\u2019ve seen this quarter came from some changes there.  I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing overall. ", "Steve Reeves", "Sure well you know some of our independent customers are clearly hurting with this economic downturn.  We work with them to manage their credit limits appropriately.  We have not seen any significant bankruptcies or anything along those lines in the independent channel, but we are cautious and monitoring that situation closely.", "Susan - UBS", "Okay and so should you kind of see more of a shift towards the big box retailers, what do you think the impact could be in terms of maybe some of the pricing.  I know you expect pricing to be slightly positive for this year, but how is that taking into account the kind of sale mix that you\u2019re seeing?", "Steve Reeves", "If you question is relative to price, we have, as we indicated previously toward the end of last year, worked through price increases in most of our businesses on a number of our lines and those are holding up through this year.   I think outside the US, with the currency situation the way it is, there is an opportunity for currency reasons to be able to take price in some markets going forward through the rest of this year.  I think that\u2019s factored into the mix shift that you\u2019re referring to.", "Susan - UBS", "Okay and then just one more question.  In terms of the lead times, it seems like your lead times might be getting a little bit longer given the fact that things are slowing so dramatically.  Do you expect any changes in your working capital trends as we go through the year?", "Steve Reeves", "As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our intention is to take a significant reduction in our inventories in the second quarter to get them in line with the demand environments we see going forward.  So, I would say that you would expect to see some further production cuts in the second quarter, inventory coming out, payable will stay down with that. Then as we match production to sell out in the back half of the year you should see the payable trend come back and capture the cash in the current year.", "Susan - UBS", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "I would like to get a little better sense of your expectations for component costs, which has been pretty volatile over the last 12 months.  You mentioned that you expect the component costs to be higher year-over-year in Q2.  Could you just give us an update in terms of what you laid out last quarter for the full year, positive or negative, on an overall basis, and if your expectations for the back half have changed at all as part of your updated guidance.", "Steve Reeves", "Not materially.  I think we guided that inflation would be negative for the full year, which is still our expectation.  That it would be more negative in the front half as we carried in from current inflation from last year and as it takes a period for some of our contracts to reset.  That is still true.  As the year progressed you would start to see the benefits of the deflation that has been occurring since the economic slow down.", "With lower volumes it will take a little longer to get that to work through the supply chain as we have less volume to push through.  But, not a material change relative to the full year outlook.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "", "Just to kind of reiterate, if I could get a little bit better feel for the inventory corrections.  Then maybe that can tie into my third question which is pricing and your outlook for pricing.  With demand where it is and certainly the big retailers continue to be very aggressive on inventory levels, as you have noted, can you reconcile that with your outlook for still positive price?  I know you just kind of gave some comments, but particularly in the US.  You also noted that the reception might be more muted on some of your new products because of just where we are in the demand cycle.  It seems like there is this conflict in terms of very weak demand and perhaps, as you also mentioned, weak demand that is resulting in a negative mix shift.  How are you able to reconcile that with your outlook for pricing, not to get on the margin worse from current levels?", "Steve Reeves", "Sure, that was a long question.  I will take a stab at answering it and if I miss something let me know.", "Our pricing forecast is not a function of being able to take price in the US going forward.  I think it\u2019s, as I mentioned, us holding onto the price that we negotiated last year.  As you see a shift down in price points, which occurs in some of our categories, buyers are shifting down and at this point in time we have, say from a DEWALT we can shift down to Porter-Cable and Black and Decker.  I don\u2019t know that that is in our interest and so I chased the DEWALT pricing down to get that user as he\u2019s stepping down to a different value proposition.", "Mark Rothleitner", "And a lot of the pricing, Mike, is not in the United States.  We\u2019ve got different abilities and it\u2019s more of a rifle shot.  So really what we are looking at is the performance in the quarter was a little bit better, so we expect that the performance on the full year, from a pricing perspective, will continue to be a little bit better than our original estimate.  But, this is not a big change, this is a very modest change in our outlook to outlook.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "", "Can you comment on your views of whether or not you held gain, or lost share, in your DEWALT line in the first quarter?", "Steve Reeves", "It\u2019s really hard to do share count on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  There is an awful lot of noise in that.  I think in our last call we indicated that we were losing some share on the cordless side of DEWALT as the market shifted to lithium and I think that trend has continued.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "", "Thank you.  ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank Securities.      ", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities      ", "The first thing I wanted to ask you about was the Fastening and Assembly business.  The exposure, as you mentioned, substantially to the automotive industry.  The automotive industry has been suffering for a while.  Sales had held up a little bit better there, I think partly because of an international mix issue.  I\u2019m just trying to understand the sensitivity to the industry and why sales would have just fallen off a cliff there.  In particular I was looking to understand how much this has to do with the distress at the US automakers; along those lines, if it is related to a potential bankruptcy or more than one bankruptcy how would that affect it further going forward?", "Steve Reeves", "I think, as you look back over time our Fastening business, the majority of it, is outside the US.  I think you would have seen the Asian and the European automakers even having been performing reasonably well, you are right that the automotive industry has been depressed for some amount of time.", "What I feel we saw in the first quarter was that as a global statement the automotive companies slowed down because their finished goods inventories had built up.  So, you saw the Asian and the European automakers take production out to get their inventories back in line with historical trends.  I think that occurred largely in the first quarter, and so we should be pacing with sales going forward.", "I think in the US, while there was an attempt to get their inventories in line, I don\u2019t think, at least the domestic aspects of the US automotive market did not achieve that goal, and there is still some substantial overhang in inventory in North America.  But, I think that as you look at the bigger part of our business, which is outside of the US, their inventories are back largely in line with where they want them to be.", "If in fact we lose GM and Chrysler through this downturn people will still buy the same number of cars and so we supply to virtually the entire industry, so the exact effect will be dependant upon the individual company that picks up the sales ultimately, because we will have different penetrations in different places, but people will still buy the same number of cars, even if those two go bankrupt.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities      ", "That\u2019s very helpful.  The next question I wanted to ask was kind of a bigger picture question.  The last couple of years has just seen one shoe drop after the other, housing, non-residential, your sales in Europe, now fastening and assembly.  So, what is left that could go wrong here?  As I look across your sales Latin America still seems to be holding up a little bit better than elsewhere, but I guess, what else is there beyond that that could fall apart here in the coming quarters?", "Steve Reeves", "", "You are right; it has been a challenging environment.  If you were to look at the risks, it is how far down is industrial and commercial construction going to go?  I mean it is off significantly.  When will that rebound?   All of the sectors, as you pointed out, are down, and have gone through some cataclysmic changes, so I don\u2019t think there are any particular areas that have been left untouched by the economic downturn.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities      ", "The debt rising, I\u2019m just trying to understand the rationale here.  You have used maybe $200 or $300 million out of your billion capacity.  Nowhere close to the full capacity.  You are only pushing out your maturity by, I think, two years here, because I think your revolver expired in 2012, assuming it couldn\u2019t be renewed or extended, and it is coming at a pretty significant cost.  I was just wondering, I understand your desire to be conservative, but it seems like a pretty high cost to pay for the extension of liquidity you\u2019re getting.", "Steve Reeves", "Well, hopefully everything turns around and the worlds good and maybe it will prove to be a mistake, but I think with the uncertainty in the marketplace right now and the rating changes that we incurred in the first quarter, which limited our ability to access commercial paper, it is prudent to lock in extra liquidity at this point in time. ", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities      ", "Okay, thanks a lot. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Daniel Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. ", "Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse ", "I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about pricing volumes.  You talked about the price being better than you expected this quarter.  It seems as though you are favoring price over volume.  As you talked about the second half of the year expecting some recovery based on the easier comparisons there, should we expect substantially more use of discounts there should the sales not recover as expected?", "Steve Reeves", "I think you only want us to use price if we\u2019re really going to drive volume with it.  I think we\u2019ve incurred a fair amount of commodity costs and we\u2019re going to try and hold onto the pricing that we\u2019ve gotten, would be my observation as we go forward.  We will deal with each intentional action on a case-by-case basis and where the right cost benefit is. But, our expectation now is that we will not. ", "Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse ", "I am also wondering, you talked about the favorable legal environments to expenses.  How material was that this quarter?", "Steve Reeves", "The favorable legal environment was a little over $6 million.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse ", "Great, thanks very much.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Capital.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "I was wondering if you could give us a little feel for the quarter.  When you guys reported at the end of January you were looking for down 20% for the quarter.  It came in at about down 27%, 28%.  It seems that the quarter has deteriorated substantially, probably 30% declines in those overall in the last two months.  Can you talk about the trends that you saw, and given that significant weakness, how you were able to offset?  I would like a little more detail, really, on the operating leverage that\u2019s embedded in the business given that it deteriorated so significantly.", "Steve Reeves", "I think as we saw the volume not coming back and it\u2019s hard to get into a month by month comparison, but we took the effort to do this initial restructuring charge to try and get our costs in line both on the manufacturing side as well as in SG&A and just to clamp down on all discretionary spending.  As we noted, we asked our employees to take a scaled pay cut for the balance of the year as well.  It\u2019s really not a lot more complicated than that.  Those are the broad actions we took.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay so you\u2019re saying that when you guys were expecting 20%, did it deteriorate, because that was already one month into the quarter.  ", "Steve Reeves", "Yes it did.  I think as we were providing our guidance for the first quarter back in January, and January is a very small month and it is hard to draw a lot of conclusions from that month.  But, we were forecasting, say on the Fastening side, a much different automotive production level and the production just did not come back as fast as we had anticipated it would.  And we saw further deterioration in Europe than what we were expecting.  ", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "Okay so focusing on Europe where that went down largely on the professional side.   Could you give us just a feel for how much of that split between the pro versus the consumer in terms of exposure to that market on a dollar basis, as well a the margins.  I think in the past you guys have said it\u2019s been fairly equal between the pro and consumer over in Europe.  If you could update us where that is in terms of the margin spread between those businesses. ", "Steve Reeves", "The revenue split is roughly equal.  We have not historically provided profitability detail at that level and I\u2019m not going to at this point in time.  In total we are deleveraging in Europe as the sales drop there.  It is a reasonably high fixed cost business, so our margins are off relative to what they have historically been.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "But, you are saying it really was the pro that fell, not as much as the consumer.  I mean was it kind of half the magnitude?", "Steve Reeves", "They were both down.  Pro was down substantially more than the consumer business was.  I suspect related to the commercial construction.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "Can you talk about specifically in PTA and HHI what sell through was in terms of could you quantify what the rationalization efforts of the retailers taking out their inventories might have contributed?", "Steve Reeves", "", "Sure.  I think in PT&A we saw kind of mid-teens sell through declines and in HHI, I am trying to remember off the top of my head here,  I think it was down slightly less than that is my recollection.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "When you refer to pricing expecting to be positive for the year, is that ASP which would include mix, or is that like for like pricing that you\u2019re referring to?", "Steve Reeves", "Like for like.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "Like for like pricing, so would mix be a detriment, would it be a favorable all in including mix within mix?  How should we look at mix?", "Steve Reeves", "Well mix is in some ways it\u2019s all other, but as we move between price points, profitability changes not always in the way you\u2019d expect.  So, I think it is our current forecast that we\u2019re going to mix down on profitability perspective based on what where we think the sales are going to occur.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "Should we factor that in from a modeling standpoint or is it just real, real modest, or mild expectations?", "Steve Reeves", "It is a very modest expectation, so I wouldn\u2019t consider it to be material at all. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "Okay and as it relates to the definition of your debt covenants should we back out the favorable ruling and also the restructuring expenses from your EBITDA when we\u2019re calculating the fund of that to EBITDA ratio?", "Mark Rothleitner", "Generally we would not adjust for sort of normal C&A adjustments, favorable or unfavorable items.  Obviously the environmental charge, the large one that we took back in the fourth quarter of 2007, we did adjust for, but no, the normal quarterly changes in legal and in environmental we would not adjust for.  We would adjust for the restructuring. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "So we would back the restructuring out?  So, the EBITDA would include the $12 million or would not include the $12 million?", "Mark Rothleitner", "EBITDA would not include the $12 million charge or we would add it back.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "I got it, but then it does include the $6 million from the favorable ruling?", "Mark Rothleitner", "It is included in NOI and that is all the other costs, positive and negative are included.  That is neither large enough nor unusual.  We get a lot of settlements through out the year on that kind of stuff.  The one we did carve out was the large environmental one a year and change ago. ", "", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James ", "", "All right, thank you very much gentlemen.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Macgregor with Longbow Research.     ", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research     ", "Just looking at your guidance of $150 to $190, you\u2019ve got revenue guidance of down 20 including -5 on the currency.  I was just wondering, it was quite a range at the EPS line given a 20% forecast down at the top line.  How much variability is there in that 20% top line guidance?  Also, maybe to the extent that there isn\u2019t as much variability in your thought there, can you talk about the opportunity to get costs down further as an earnings driver over and above the $75 million restructuring benefits?", "Steve Reeves", "Sure. It\u2019s a very difficult forecasting environment, so I don\u2019t think we mean it to be precise.  I think what we\u2019ve tried to capture is the current run rates that we\u2019re seeing and provide an allowance for where we think things are going to climb further in coming up with that 20%.  It is not a precise calculation by any means, so there will be variability in that.", "We are working on what our contingency plans are relative to any further step down in demand that\u2019s significant.  As you can imagine this far into a cost cutting initiative, it gets harder and harder as we go along, but there is always opportunity and we are working through what leverage we might pull, if in fact we do see a further deterioration in the top line.  ", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research     ", "Are we talking about fixed costs primarily in that contingency plan?", "Steve Reeves", "Depends what you mean by fixed costs, but yes.  Generally speaking, yes.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research     ", "You mentioned last quarter you got some hedges coming off here and that you were expecting some relief in the second half from that.  At that time copper was $150, now it\u2019s $210 it is up 40% and a number of other commodities have started to move as well.  I\u2019m just wondering if maybe that opportunity on the variable cost side is less than what you though it might be.  I guess I\u2019m just trying to size up what the cost reduction opportunity might be from this point forward beyond the $75 million.", "Steve Reeves", "We\u2019re still working through our plans.  I couldn\u2019t give you another number.  We will react as we see demand tail off as we have through out this downturn. ", "Mark Rothleitner", "Yes, I mean you have seen us, David, take a number of actions through out the last six quarters.  So, you can appreciate that we continue to look at what costs we might be able to eliminate if things do not hit the guidance or the expectations that we have.  So, we certainly do not want to telegraph what those items are, but certainly we\u2019ve got to look at contingency plans if we don\u2019t achieve the top line numbers that we have now built in, the new reduced top line numbers that we have built into the guidance.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research     ", "Okay good.  My second question is just on the Power Tool business.  You mentioned your consolidated pricing was, I think, up 1%.  Is there any chance you could give us a little more feel for what it might have been just in the PT&A?", "Steve Reeves", "No, I don\u2019t want to split it out in that level of detail.", "David Macgregor - Longbow Research    ", " ", "Okay, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dennis McGill with Zelman and Associates  ", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "My first question just has to do with the sales guidance.  I appreciate that you said it is on a specific target and I understand the variability there, but when you think about the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, it sounded based on the financing decisions you guys made to that markets that you appreciate the significant amount of uncertainty in the marketplace and are being cautious there.  But, the guidance would imply that you\u2019re going to see significantly less negative results in the back half of the year.  ", "I was hoping that maybe you could just talk through some of the bigger level of assumptions by end channel on where you could see things get at least less negative as we move into the second half.", "Steve Reeves", "Sure.  I think the biggest change as you look at it on a year-over-year comparison is the comp to the step down that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.  We\u2019re still calling the fourth quarter down, but not at the same level of decline often already reduced number.  Additionally you, especially when you get to the fourth quarter, you start to anniversary the significant strengthening of the dollar that we saw last September.  So currency, once you get out to the fourth quarter, is flat to maybe just slightly negative.", "I think it is more of a comparison issue.  We are not seeing signs of recovery in the business at this point in time.", "Mark Rothleitner", "It is just easier comps as the quarters roll by.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "Okay so fundamentally you see the last couple quarters of the year kind of similar to what, at least the current quarter, is looking like for Q2.", "Steve Reeves", "Yes there was some inventory adjustments that are occurring in the first quarter, probably will spill over into the second quarter here.  But, for all material purposes it is a comp issue that you\u2019re seeing there. ", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "Okay and then that leads into my second question on the inventory front, kind of two parts.  First you mentioned bringing down production second quarter.  Could you talk about which segments you are seeing that primarily in where we will see under absorption?  Then kind of similarly, the revenue declines in Europe sounded like they were certainly more than expected and quite large, obviously, on the pro side.  Are you guys seeing any inventory problems there?", "Mark Rothleitner", "Do you mean with respect to our inventory?  We are going to bring production down actually in all three of the segments.  It is probably most significant in the Power Tool business, but we have plans in place and we\u2019ll execute that and then we will take the absorption medicine here in the second quarter and hopefully match reduction with sell out as we go through the balance of the year. ", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "As it relates to the [inaudible] inventory is there any more or less build there relative to the domestic?", "Mark Rothleitner", "No, it is pretty similar.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "", "Then my last question, I would appreciate as much help as you can give me here.  As we think about the SG&A number year-over-year I guess it was down somewhere around $90 million.  Can you talk through how much of that would be variable and then of the fixed reductions kind of the key components outside of salaries or payroll reductions?", "Mark Rothleitner", "We reduced spending virtually everywhere.  We had the restructuring benefits that we\u2019ve undertaken over the course of the last year as well as, well actually our salary reductions really don\u2019t take affect until the second quarter, but it is predominantly the restructuring actions taken through out the course of 2008 as well as just a clamp down on discretionary spending through the quarter which will carry over through the year.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "Of that discretionary side, how much of that would relate to things that would be product related, whether it\u2019s advertising, R&D, marketing.", "Mark Rothleitner", "We have cut back on promotion and marketing.  What we have left intact largely is our R&D, our new product development activities have largely been untouched through these restructuring actions as we work through.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "Is there a rough number you could give me, as far as a reduction, how much of that would be a fixed reduction?", "Mark Rothleitner", "Do you mean in terms of the decline?  Obviously transportation would have been largely volume driven.  There may be some other distribution expenses that would be largely volume driven, but most of the other expenses are probably, except for perhaps some element of compensation, would be fixed costs.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman and Associates  ", "All right, thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.      ", "", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company      ", "First of all, in reducing the sales outlook by about 10% and the earnings outlook is not really that much different than your original guidance, excluding the interest expense, perhaps $0.10 difference.  It doesn\u2019t seem like the detrimental margin is much up.  Could you just talk a little bit more through how such a significant reduction in sales is not translated into that much on the bottom line?", "Steve Reeves", "Sure.  I think if you think about it you will split the sale take down in two parts.  There is the organic take down, which you would expect.  Historically we\u2019ve seen kind of a 25% to 35% read through on that, which is not inconsistent with what we\u2019re expecting.  And you have a currency take down, which typically is not dragged with it much in the way of earnings and it is not dragging much with it this time either.  So if you bifurcate the sale take down into those components, we are able to offset that with the incremental restructuring actions, the other personnel actions that we\u2019ve spoken to, as well as other non-employee related SG&A actions as we go through.   Then you have the slight over drive that we had in the first quarter is different, the main components along with the favorable pricing that we spoke to earlier.  ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company      ", "Within the expense reductions that you\u2019re taking here, when sales turn around will you have to reinvest incrementally, or are there things that you pulled out that you clearly have to put money back into on the way up or will you be able to sustain this cost structure and allow the margins and the up side to flow through it at a pretty rapid pace?", "Steve Reeves", "I think in terms of the cost reduction activities, I think if we saw a material up turn in the business we certainly would think about reinstating salaries.  But, in terms of the actual head count actions that we\u2019ve taken, it is probably more on the permanent side that we won\u2019t be adding back positions and you should see pretty good operating leverage on this business when the economy turns around and we start to get some sales growth. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company      ", "It appears that the home centers have chosen to promote some of the categories a bit more than power tools, at least relative to a year ago.  Is there any influence on what\u2019s going on with pricing in your business related to how the home centers are behaving differently with your category?", "Steve Reeves", "No not particularly.  You are right that the promotion activity is down in certain places relative to where they were last year.  But, that is not a particularly big part of the pricing activity.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company      ", "Someone asked you earlier about market share and power tools and I know it\u2019s not a perfect science of how you\u2019re doing.  But, at what point and for what reason do you think you will be able to get back to holding or improving your market share in the power tool business?", "Steve Reeves", "Generally in most categories we are holding our share and doing reasonably well.  I think our particular issue is around the cordless and the chemistry transition and our product road is certainly focused on addressing that and you will see us continue to evolve our lithium platform and our new product launches as we go out of 2009 and into 2010.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company      ", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "If we look at the down 20% that you\u2019re looking at, can you maybe give us a sense as to back half of the year for US based businesses versus Europe?  It sounds like that European Power Tools business, especially in the eastern  parts of the country, could be suffering some pretty significant declines even going through the back half of this year and probably into 2010.  So I would appreciate some color on how you think about geographic guidance relative to that down 20%.", "Steve Reeves", "I think that if you stick specifically to the Power Tool business, I think our outlook on Europe is probably a little worse than the total corporation.  Our expectation would be that the automotive business in Europe will recover faster than the US business will.  So, it is really a function of which segment you\u2019re speaking to.", "I think Eastern Europe\u2019s problems will be with us for quite awhile there. They are most acute in the far eastern part of Russia and Ukraine and the availability of credit in those markets is very limited and it\u2019s difficult to see how that is going to change.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "Okay and then competitively the share conversations we have been having.  Is it the same case in Europe as well?", "Steve Reeves", "Yes, it would be.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "Okay great and then just to tie up the cash flow forecast a bit. CapEx around 80ish is my read right on that?", "Steve Reeves", "Yes, 80, 85, in that range.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "Okay and then I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear on this, because we\u2019ve talked about it in the past, but in terms of the hedging, the net cash impact for the year would be around neutral.  Is that the right way to think continue to think about that?", "Mark Rothleitner", "Yes, neutral, maybe slightly positive.  It depends obviously on where rates go from here, but it could be a slight positive for us.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "Okay, then on materials costs, I may have missed this, but in the K, I think you were talking about a number of around $50 million of impact for the year.  Is it still the same sort of ballpark?", "Steve Reeves", "Yes.  There is really no material change in our expectations there.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. ", "Okay, great.  Thank you very much for your help.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Seth Weber with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.     ", "Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch     ", "If we are looking at another 30% decline in the fastening business, do you think that that business stays profitable through out each quarter for the year?", "Steve Reeves", "Do you mean another 30% oh top of where we are now?", "Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch     ", "No, I mean another year-over-year 30% decline.", "Steve Reeves", "I think that yes, I do.  I think that that is probably a pessimistic look, but I do believe it will be profitable even at that level. ", "Mark Rothleitner", "They\u2019ve taken a lot of costs out there as well. ", "Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch     ", "Okay and just kind of a housekeeping issue.  Is there a number that we should think about for the corporate expense for the full year including the first quarter number?", "Steve Reeves", "I think for each of the quarters going out you should think about $16 million a quarter for quarters two through three.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch     ", "Okay and then have you quantified what your debt reduction number target for the year is?", "Mark Rothleitner", "No we haven\u2019t.  We have just said modestly and depending on where you are from an earnings perspective and we did say we would expect net cash generation to be in excess of earnings. So you can kind of back into it based on our guidance.  But, we do expect a modest reduction.", "Seth Weber - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch     ", "I got it.  Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Tony Fiore with Silvercrest Asset Management", "Tony Fiore - Silvercrest Asset Management", "With respect to the change in payables during the quarter, a pretty big use of cash flow.  I understand lower production levels were a factor.  I am wondering if you saw, or if you are seeing any sort of structural changes from your suppliers in terms of them trying to shorten payment terms?", "Steve Reeves", "No.  I mean we obviously monitor the supply base for key suppliers that are struggling, and we have some that kind of cross over with the automotive industry.  We will, on occasion, accelerate payment in specific circumstances, but that is not a broad or a particularly significant factor.  What you are seeing there is really the function of taking production down.", "Tony Fiore - Silvercrest Asset Management", "Okay and I may have missed this, but as you look out over the full year do you expect working capital to be a source or use of cash?", "Steve Reeves", "It will be a source of cash.", "Tony Fiore - Silvercrest Asset Management", "Okay, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "The bolt on, you had mentioned, it was one of your last prepared remarks that you continued to look at small bolt ons.  I was wondering if you could give us any more color on that or granularity with regards to which segments you\u2019re looking at more than others.  Also if one of those segments, I believe would continue to be the PT&A, if there are specific product categories that you\u2019re more interested in that perhaps you don\u2019t have a presence in right now.", "Steve Reeves", "We are still continuing to look at small bolt ons.  I think that there are and will become more compelling valuations out there as time goes on.  I really don\u2019t want to telegraph specifically where we\u2019re looking at this point.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "All right.  But, would it be safe to say that you are not necessarily expecting to pick up an activity over the next couple of quarters?", "Steve Reeves", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean.  I think we continually look at things, as valuations become extraordinarily attractive we will continue to look at part of the stuff.  I don\u2019t envision a more intense search though, if that is your question.", "Mark Rothleitner", "But some additional things may be able to come across the goal line given valuations, Mike.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "Right, absolutely.  I would just like a couple of numbers.  The US business, you had mentioned earlier that you estimated that the sell through for PT&A and I would think you\u2019re talking about the US sell through down in the mid teens.  You gave us US Industrial down 30, US consumer down mid single-digit, but I don\u2019t have the exact revenue split.  Can you just give us what the overall US business was down revenue wise for your own business?", "Mark Rothleitner", "Do you mean the total US?  We try and give you some color on that from a pro and consumer perspective, Mike, as opposed to kind of consolidating it into a number.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "Yes and I am just trying to get the apples to apples.  If you\u2019re saying that sell through is down mid teens. [Interposing]", "Steve Reeves", "Sell through was down less than sell in.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "Right, so I am just trying to gauge if that was a 3% difference, a 5% difference?", "Steve Reeves", "When we give you sell through information it is also not on the entirety of the population.  It is really difficult to pin that down that precisely.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay.  Just corporate expense, you expected $16 million per quarter for the next three quarters, but if you add back the $6 million of environmental, legal, that gets you to a $10 to $11 million number, which is roughly in line at the quarterly rate that you were doing in 3Q08 and 4Q08.  Am I missing something there in terms of why it would necessarily be higher than that?", "Steve Reeves", "Well I think it has fluctuated pretty greatly over time.  I think in addition to the legal, environmental, there was some other reserve movements in there that aren\u2019t of a recurring nature, so, ergo the $16 million run rate; $16 is actually I think reasonably similar to where we\u2019ve been in my recollection over time and that\u2019s kind of the a little higher corporate pension expense offset by some favorability on spending; relative to thinking about it to the last year.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan ", "All right thank you.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time.

The entire call is expected to last approximately an hour and a replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release which again is on our website and as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today\u2019s call at 860-827-3833 or Corbin Walburger at 860-827-3937. ", "We will be making some forward-looking statements today during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as they involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the Form 8-K which we have filed today with the press release.", "With that I will now turn it over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren ", "Thanks Kate. Let me just spend a minute just on the highlights from the first quarter and the state of Stanley, I think it will help ground everyone. First quarter, as cited in our release diluted EPS from continuing ops $0.48 that did include about $0.08 of restructuring charges that we plan to take this year that we have been fairly transparent in terms of what we think they will be and when we think they will fall, and Don will talk more about that later.", "The highlight was security, I think validating the portfolio transition that we began five or six years ago, 12% revenue growth and 33% profit growth. Of course that was primarily driven by acquisitions, but that being said, we\u2019re very pleased with the integration status of both Sonitrol and GdP. As they are on ahead of schedule in terms of where they need to be on cost savings Brett Bontrager in the integration teams continue to do a really good job in that area and it really helped four to five this quarter. ", "Overall, sales unit volumes are down 19% versus prior year, but in that environment gross margins still improved to a record 39.6% for us in the first quarter. Where they are more about it later on, but we\u2019ve taken additional $100 million cost reduction program that we initiated, that should generate up to $45 million in savings this year or $15 million of that, we will reinvest in some brand development programs and some organic growth initiatives, some of which has already been reinvested and Jim will talk a little about that in his portion of the presentation. ", "Despite the volume decline, working capital turns improved to 4.8, and 2009 GAAP EPS guidance was introduced for the first time in the range of $2 to $2.50. That includes $0.42 of restructuring, so about 20% of the restructuring that we intend to take this year took place in the first quarter. Free cash flow, we still expect to be above $300 million. ", "Looking briefly at the financial results. The chart itself explanatory, we were pleased to be able to hold operating margin at about 12% given the precipitous volume decline, but you see earnings excluding the $0.08 charge at $0.56 are down 30% from the first quarter a year ago. Revenue down 15% will be more explicit on that in the next chart, tax rate constant, number of shares outstanding constant. ", "I think importantly to note, we did not maintain margin by producing for liquidations and building inventory. Inventory was down about 13% in absolute terms and there is only a modest four-day increase in day sales in inventory despite the 19% volume decline. So, the benefits of SFS are clearly showing up in terms of our ability to manage inventory, manage working capital and Don\u2019s going to give you some more detail on that in light of the volume declines. ", "Our ability to maintain OM reflects price acquisitions, productivity and favorable mix offsetting the adverse impacts of course the volume decline effects and still a little bit of our cost of goods inflation in the first quarter. ", "Looking more specifically at revenues on chart five, down 15% as I said, but looking at a quick walk, volume down 19%, and just for everyone to recall, that fall had a 7% volume decline in third quarter and a 10% volume decline in the fourth quarter. So the 19% was in fact significantly higher than we anticipated as we ended the year. We\u2019ve reacted to that. Jim is going to talk to that in just a minute or two. We got favorable price impacts resulting in organic revenue decline of 16%, hurt by currency, helped by acquisitions so revenue down 15% with the poor security being the bright spot.", "Looking at the segment results, you see Security up 12% with volume being down 8%, but the both Industrial and CDIY businesses, volume down 26% and 22% leading to the 19. As it relates to Security and we\u2019ve talked about this a lot, it\u2019s insulated from but it\u2019s certainly not immune to the economic headwinds that we are facing as the installations were down, but that was certainly partially offset by some healthy resigns and obviously from a margin perspective, the recurring monthly revenue of our convergent security business.", "On slide six, no area escaped the headwinds, if you are looking just quickly top left, North America accounts for about 64% of Stanley\u2019s revenue and Canada was down 16% in total, 12% organically and the US down 14% organically. In Europe fall came later, but more precipitously. Europe was doing pretty well up until about September 2008 and declined quickly from September onwards and certainly remained soft at this point in time. ", "Australia, given its small size, is a relevantly important market for Stanley, but it was down 6% organically, 31% in total as currency was the big factor and Asia down as well after some significant consecutive quarters of growth. Looking at margins on slide seven, the high point of the quarter may well have been our gross margin achievement of 39.6% as I alluded to earlier, price acquisitions and mix as well as strong performance by our security business. ", "Operating margin did decline 40 basis points versus the first quarter 2008 and 80 basis points sequentially, due primarily to volume. SG&A was down and I\u2019ll give you some more detail on that in the next slide, but obviously it was down less than volume as we are not able to adjust it quickly to a volume decline 400 or 500 basis points above what we had anticipated as we entered the quarter, but to give you a closer look that add SG&A down 8% in total but there are a lot of moving pieces so we prepared this [work] that we thought would be helpful. ", "I think on the whole we did a good job controlling SG&A, given the level of volume decline. As I said, down 8% in total but down 16% excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Most businesses, which is not on the chart, but most of our businesses, were down in excess of 20% with the exception of Security and the Security businesses were down mid-single digits, but again but not facing quite the marketplace headwinds as our industrial tools in CDIY business were down a little bit less. ", "As you look at the work, it\u2019s pretty straightforward acquisitions adding $23 million investments, adding $4 million to the spend and that\u2019s some of our incremental brand support, most particularly supported expansion of our very successful to-date Major League Baseball program, I wanted [Jim Loree] is going to talk about that a little bit and we are very exited about the brand building and potential volume building aspects of this program. ", "Inflation was another $2 million and then all the savings, 13% reduction versus our 1Q \u201908 cost basis between headcount, foreign exchange, a lot of moving pieces in discretionary spending, the biggest of which is T&E or travel less, fewer promotions, virtually no temps on our payroll, everything write down to office supply, is $20 million in the quarter and so again a pretty a fairly formidable effort controlling expenses which helped maintain margins. ", "Now as we detailed in our press release, we did take additional actions in the first quarter as we absorbed the volume declining more than we previously anticipated. Jim\u2019s is going to give you a little more granularity on what those actions are the impact is it relates to restructuring cost and what to look at of the rest of the year. Then Jim\u2019s also going to give you some more detail on each of the segments. ", "I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Loree. ", "", "James Loree", "Before we dive into the new actions which are the ones that we took in the first quarter, I would like to just refresh everybody by summarizing the actions that we took in 2008, primarily in the fourth quarter. We exited the year with about $220 million in cost actions, of which about $195 million of that or $1.75 per share impact 2009\u2019s cost base, another $25 million will impact 2010. About half of the impact related to headcount for those actions with about 2,000 people coming out of about 10% of the workforce. ", "Another quarter of the savings came from discretionary items such as the suspension of our 401(k) match and some deep cuts in to things like T&E and other discretionary items, some of which will come back in fact I think we can be fairly certain that about a quarter of these will actually come back in 2010 and then the remaining 25% are other expense reductions that are more permanent in nature, the type that typically will follow headcount actions. So about 75% of those 2008 actions we expect to be permanent. ", "Then we move on to the first quarter \u201909 actions and as you may recall, as we exited the year we committed to produce the contingency plan that would protect us in the event of the volume forecast for 2009 was less robust in the minus 10% and as the quarter went on and as you can see from the organic growth in physical volume declines, it became clear that it would be appropriate to implement these actions at the end of the quarter.", "So, as we look at the 1Q \u201809 actions, we have an additional headcount reduction of 550, bringing our total to 2550 from the beginning of last year or about 13% of the total workforce. As mentioned that\u2019s about $100 million of annualized savings associated with these cuts, about $45 million in 2009 of which 75% of that are related to the headcount and then the other remainder are from costs that follow headcounts. So again these will be primarily all permanent in nature.", "The charges associated with are $45 million restructuring, most of which is related to the 4Q \u201808 actions, $0.42 a share and the charges are going to be primarily 90% cash, so as you can see mostly severance and items of that nature. So, we talked quiet a bit already about the savings, you have the $1.75 a share from the 2008 actions, and then an additional $0.51 in 2010 from that combined benefit of $0.75 in 2010 will largely be used to offset the cost pressures from those costs that I mentioned from the \u201808 savings that will be coming back. ", "I think it\u2019s fair to expect that about $0.40 to $0.50 of those 2008 actions could be coming back, especially the 401(k) match and some of the T&E reductions. Now, one of the nice elements of this was that we were able to take $15 million of these savings and reinvest them in organic growth in the Security business, particularly in the electronic business and it\u2019s our intent this year to add about 150 sales people into the electronic security business. ", "We have the ability to gain share, we have a market that is willing and able to accept additional sales resources, and these folks can be productive and we have some competitors that are retrenching to some extent so that we can hire folks that are already up to speed and have an account base. So, we are making that move. ", "In addition to that, we will talk in a minute about the brand investments in Major League Baseball and the NASCAR sponsorship, but I think it\u2019s also important to note that these actions, unlike those in the fourth quarter, I would characterize that actions in the fourth quarter has more traditional cost cutting. These actions were very thoughtful in terms of changing the structure of the company in ways that could actually improve the effectiveness and not just the efficiency or not just drive efficiency benefits. ", "So for example, as we\u2019ve announced in the press release, we combined the CT&S and Bostitch businesses under one management team, under Jeff Ansell. This will provide significant benefits we believe in the form of accelerated product innovation, channel efficiencies since many of these customers are end channels, in fact overlap and provide us I thin with significant share gain potential in the coming years. ", "In addition, another change that we made as we took our Supply & Services business and combined it with Mac, and now we\u2019re able to use the supply chain associated with Supply & Services which has a terrific operating performance of some thing like 10 working capital turns, very efficient supply chain and that will actually replace ultimately the Mac supply chain over time, so another example of ways we are extracting effectiveness and not just efficiency. ", "Then the third example is, we took the company\u2019s healthcare business units, several of which were in security, and several of which were in engineered solutions and for our internal purposes we\u2019ve combined those under one leader and we expect to gain additional efficiencies from that included in the cost savings, but also, the begins of a new growth platform for the company and healthcare solution. ", "I think the difference between these cost actions and the ones that we took in the later half of \u201908 are that we had enough time to think through these very carefully and do some things that we thing will improve the effectiveness of the operation on a go forward basis. ", "Now I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about the brand reinvestment initiative and those of you who have either follow baseball or watch ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter, you may have noticed the growing Stanley presence in Major League Baseball Parks from coast to coast and as it turns out, we are now in eight Major League Baseball parks, the interior generally in the outfield or scoreboard areas. ", "We took advantage of a situation where the banks and the auto companies have backed off from as much advertising as they were doing for obvious reasons and the pricing came down dramatically, we\u2019ve been circling this type of a sponsorship for several years now on contemplating on doing it, but we felt it was a little too expensive in the past but with the other prices coming down the way they did, it was a great opportunity for us to team up with Major League Baseball and the eight teams represented on the page. ", "Of course we have the Boston Red Sox, pilot have been going on for about a year and half and so the additional seven teams that have represented here are all new and I would say that one of the thrush here was to concentrate on the Hispanic market. So you will see several of these are in areas where there are significant Hispanic concentration such as Florida and Texas and California. ", "The purpose there as we try to continue to develop the brand with the Hispanic community, we find that baseballs are great way to reach that particular demographic. So that\u2019s one area you can see the pictures there, you have got US Cellular Field in Chicago, you can see a large Stanley sign there and then Hubert Humphrey\u2019s Metrodome in Minnesota are the right field walls are literally covered with five Stanley logos in the Twins Ballpark. ", "We also continue our investment in NASCAR. We upgraded the number of races this year. We upgraded the level of sponsorship, as you saw we are in the Daytona 500 with a number 19 car driven by Elliott Sadler placed number two in the Daytona 500, got tremendous press from that and then finally on the left hand side of the page, I want to call your attention to a new innovative advertising medium for us on the iPhone. ", "In an iPhone application, we actually have a level application where the iPhone actually works as a level and you can actually go to the App Store on the iPhone search for Stanley, it\u2019s a free download and quite a few folks have done that already and this functions as a level but it also have significant product information associated with it. So I urge anybody has access to an iPhone to check it out. I think it\u2019s indicative of the fact of how we are trying to contemporize our advertising messages as well. ", "So let\u2019s move on now to the segments. Security was the bright story of the quarter for us, clearly with revenues up 12%, just modest decline in organic sales just down 4%. Segment profit up a third and margin expansion of segment profit to 18.9%, 290 basis points, which was also a sequential improvement of 50 basis points versus the fourth quarter performance. ", "Convergent had a terrific quarter with their acquisitions of Sonitrol media last year, and Generale de Protection in September of last year providing revenue growth and offsetting the mid-single digit organic volume decline that was experienced primarily from lower installation sales as John earlier pointed out and the mechanical business also had a terrific quarter on a relative basis. ", "I think if you look into some of their competitors and their performances, I think you will see that they clearly gained share in the quarter. They had about 4% revenue decrease, but they had excellent margin performance as the cost reductions that we\u2019ve talked about earlier and some good price inflation arbitrage kicked in and helped them with their operating profits. So, good story there as well and Security continues to buttress the overall company\u2019s performance in this very difficult environment. ", "Then we move on to the other segments, Industrial being the topper, I guess of the two stories from the standpoint of sequential performance with revenues down 29%, organic growth of minus 24% versus minus 9% as an example in the fourth quarter and what we have going on here is a weak market for sure, but on top of that we have a very massive inventory correction going on. I think it\u2019s exacerbated by the credit crunch so that the distributors in the supply chain really have some challenges in terms of gaining financing and maintaining the level of inventories they would like to maintain, and also just being cautious. So we think about eight points of the decline was associated within inventory correction, which we think well probably continue into the second quarter. ", "Our segment profit was down about 50%, down to $25 million and the segment profit rate while it was down 420 basis points we were pleased to be able to deliver still a double digit operating profit under those circumstances. ", "So moving on to Construction & DIY, another tough revenue story with total revenues down 25% exchange exasperating that issue with organic growth minus 18%, but the order rates were about 3 points better than the organic growth, do that\u2019s encouraging. I think the other item of note is that the point of sale for our seven largest North American customers was only down 9% during the quarter and it was fairly stable. So I think that\u2019s indicative that the end markets are really not in as bad a condition as the performance would indicate in the segment.", "Europe was very difficult as organic revenues declined 20% and the cost actions that we\u2019ve taken are lagging clearly in Europe because of the normal time delays that are involved with reducing headcount in the European area. The other thing to note on the page I think that is also encouraging is that the operating profit rate in the segment was 9.5%, which was higher by about 3 points than the fourth quarter. So, we talked about our last quarter the 6.4% might potentially be a trough and it looks like that may well be the case as we go here. ", "Moving onto a working capital on the next page. We continue to exhibit good control over our working capital with our inventories coming down 13% to $504 million with a four day improvement there. We like where the inventories are positioned right now, because the overall reduction in inventories is relatively consistent with our overall organic growth forecast for the quarter, which means that while we brought our inventories down responsibly, we are also positioned to serve if and when the market comes back and I think that\u2019s very important. ", "Receivables are a terrific story, down 24% to $659 million, down over $200 million. The big story here is not only as you might expect coming down in proportion to volume, but also delinquency is coming down. Greater than one-day delinquencies are down substantially about $90 million year-over-year. So in this tough economic environment we continue to focus on making sure that the receivables are collected and that we keep our delinquencies down. ", "Payables was a user of cash on a year-over-year basis and also on a quarter basis, they dropped over $100 million year-over-year as the inventory reductions took their toll and in addition to that the SG&A reductions also affect payables, and so that\u2019s what you see going on there. But all in all, 4.7 last year 4.8 turns this year, very much in check and I think we are positioned nicely for the type of environment that we are in. ", "Free cash flow for the quarter, minus 18, nothing to be concerned about our outlook of 300 plus for the year stands. The working capital usage in the quarter was a negative 45, had a big payables impact hitting that and as you can see from the box there, the working capital typically is negative in the first quarter. So that\u2019s nothing that has its overly concerned. Although it was a little lower than usual we had about $30 million outflows and cash associated with some derivatives related to exchange which was the anomaly there and we would expect to see the reminder of the year very strong from a cash flow perspective. ", "Moving on to page 16. The next page is our balance sheet, and it\u2019s very, very stable from fourth quarter to first quarter, as you can see the debt-to-capital hanging in there at 48%, and the adjusted debt-to-capital for the hybrid financing and the convertible in the 35% to 37% range. ", "You will note that we were downgraded during the quarter by Moody\u2019s and we were reaffirmed by Fitch and we are at this point have not seen anything from S&P at this point in time. However, at the moment we have a split rating, but it\u2019s still a single A in both Fitch and S&P, and then A- from Moody\u2019s. So that\u2019s the state of affairs there.", "I will turn it over now to Don Allan who will take you through the guidance. ", "Donald Allan", "Thanks Jim. On page 17, as we mentioned in our press release today, we feel that we have sufficient visibility into our end markets and wanted to provide some detailed guidance today for the reminder of the year. We do expect sales volume weakness to continue for the reminder of year and as you can see with the first assumption as we walk from our $2.82 of GAAP EPS in 2008 that our range of unit volume at the negative 13% to a negative 15%. ", "The assumptions behind this is that, as you\u2019ve heard from John and Jim earlier negative 19% in Q1 was the unit volume result. We expect that likely to continue in the second quarter and then in the back half the year as the comparisons get easier we expect our unit volume to approximate about 10% to get to that range of 13% to 15%. ", "Just to keep in mind, the EPS estimate of $2.90 to $2.40 associated with this is not only the volume decline, but it\u2019s also the plant under absorption impact as we see those negative volumes year-over-year. ", "The next item is currency. Currency, it\u2019s moved up and down a lot in the last three months, but as of last day or so it\u2019s pretty consistent with where it was in January, provided this $0.50 assumption year-over-year. So, it s relatively consistent and also keep in mind that the main currency that affect us are the Euro, the UK Pound, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Last but not least on that matter, any 5% movement on either strengthening of the US dollar or the weakening of the US dollar by 5% would have an EPS impact of about $0.10 to $0.15 either way.", "Moving on to the cost initiatives. Jim touched on the $1.75 or $195 million of actions already. So I want repeat that. The next item is the first quarter cost reduction initiatives which are net of that reinvestment that Jim described. So the gross savings are $45 million as he mentioned on the $100 million annualized program and $15 million of our reinvestment which nets to the $0.28 EPS or $30 million.", "The acquisitions of GdP, Sonitrol, Xmark and Scan Modul carryover effect of that consistent with our January guidance or January factors we provided of $0.10 of positive, and then last but certain not least we do expect lower restructuring charges in 2009 versus 2008 of $0.45. ", "As you remember, we had $92 million of charges in \u201808 and we expect to have $45 million in 2009, $35 million of that relates to the new production programs we are talking about today that we initiated in the first quarter. So the end result of that is a range of $2 to $2.50 EPS, and the main variable obviously is unit volumes that you can see. ", "So to summarize this morning\u2019s call, we feel that we\u2019ve positioned ourselves very well by taking some important strategic restructuring actions to lower our costs further beyond what we did in the fourth quarter of \u201908, but at the same time, we took some of those savings and reinvested in important areas like our brand and organic growth opportunities in our Security business. ", "We will continue to be focused on paying down our debt as our free cash flow. Our estimate should be greater than $300 million this year. We will be able to deleverage ourselves during the year by about $200 million. As always, we are dedicated to go forward with our SFS success and drive working capital benefit throughout the year and see the types of returns we\u2019ve seen over the last year or two and we\u2019ll continue to be disciplined about our pricing approach with our customers in maintaining our SG&A in the right levels to maximize our margins as we go forward. ", "That concludes the presentation portion of our call today.", "Kate White", "Chen, we are now ready for the question-and-answers.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "", "Good morning. In the Security business, the performances there are obviously quite good relative to the other business. As we look through the rest of the year, is the organic revenue decline in 1Q, what you expect or what are you seeing go on in the business that would suggest kind of where the demand is going to go as we work through the year in that business?", "John Lundgren", "I think, Eric, this is John. I think what you said is what we would continue to expect. There is no question that installations are down and depending on the business mechanical versus convergent, installations account for a larger percentage of the revenue. We would expect to see installation stay at the low rate they are. ", "The long term issue with that of course is without robust installations we can continue to increase our recurring revenue base. Short to intermediate term, the advantage of that of course as installs were down, recurring revenue becomes the larger percentage of the base going forward that is very, very favorable in terms of mix, but a modest decrease of high single to low double digit decline in installs is our projection for the remainder of the year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "So when that rolls back up to the overall organic performance out of security and I know you are not giving guidance by segment, but should we assume that security is going to continue to run down on that kind of 5% range?", "Donald Allan", "", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a good assumption Eric. I think there is enough uncertainty but your logic is right on, it\u2019s consistent with our thinking and without giving specific guidance that\u2019s certainly how Brett adjusted in their teams are planning their quarters rolling forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "", "Pricing was up 3% and you are not expecting any inflation, I suspect you are not looking for a net pricing on a year-on-year basis. So, are you already starting to see deflation or what are the chances that the pricing is favorable for this year and how should we look at price mix for \u201809?", "Donald Allan", "Hi Sam, this is Don. I think the assumptions that we have provided all of you in the first quarter around pricing and inflation on a net basis still hold true and I think we have seen a slight positive benefit of price versus inflation in the first quarter, but we continue to monitor that going forward. So those estimates that we provided for the year in that timeframe on a net basis was quite positive, I think still holds true. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Is this sort of the deflation that you would see, I\u2019m guessing would be mostly CDIY and Industrial. So if we are trying to look at how pricing affects each of those segments, is that how to look at that and how much of a degradation might we see in CDIY and Industrial from a pricing standpoint?", "John Lundgren", "I don\u2019t think we want to get into specifics about pricing around CDIY and Industrial, but I think in general, you can take the assumptions that I provided prior to those two segments. ", "Donald Allan", "And any degradation in pricing, Sam is going to depend a lot on commodities pricing. Obviously the pricing pressure is going to be directionally consistent, but lag commodities deflation which we are starting to experience at this time in the second quarter. ", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "Do we hit this as model for essentially applies between materials and pricing that would be okay from a modeling standpoint? ", "Donald Allan", "It sounds logical to me. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Company", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Company", "I was just wondering if we can explore this concept of structural savings and maybe to begin with talk about from these restructuring programs how that filters through down to the segment level, and then is there a volume dependency to where the 75% or so that\u2019s permanent becomes lesser of a number?", "John Lundgren", "Certainly there is always going to be some slight flex in SG&A and in gross margin costs associated with volume, but it is really not going to be substantial, it\u2019s not a huge \u2013 if it was that large you would have seen it coming down and we wouldn\u2019t have to take all these costs out. So I wouldn\u2019t make that a very large part of my analysis. I\u2019m not sure what exactly the question you wanted to ask on the structural side was, maybe you could try that one again. ", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Company", "Well, what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is, we\u2019re got the permanent down. I\u2019m trying to figure out by segment what\u2019s the incrementals or decrementals are look like going forward, because it sounds like the structural profitability of the businesses is changing in some of these actions?", "John Lundgren", "Fair enough. Let me give me you some rough, rough numbers that will allow you to do what you want to do. Roughly half the cost take out thus far from the two initiatives is in the CDIY segment and then the other two are about 25:25 and that is probably enough to get you what you need.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Can you update us on what you are seeing on the security side with churn and cancellations, and if you are seeing any kind of unusual pricing there?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s business as usual, which is changing rapidly. In terms of churn, you read what we read as retailers go out of business, obviously that\u2019s short term those are lost opportunities, two issues there. From a credit perspective not much of an issue at all as you know monitoring contracts and most of the security recurring revenue of our business are paid well in advance. So, one of the reasons Don\u2019s team was able to achieve the tremendous improvement it did in receivable just because there is little or no risk of default on the security side. ", "The churn is there, the good news is our security business as you well know is overwhelmingly B2B, not consumer or residential and when our large customer such as the Circuit City goes out of business at least 200 locations are open. Those buildings don\u2019t stay empty forever and as competitors or different businesses move in, we are very active and very successful on what I have alluded was calling it resigns. So, we\u2019ll go back and keep that account. ", "That\u2019s a big mitigatior in terms of the business that\u2019s loss, so the challenges to resign the overwhelming majority of any business that was lost due to customer business failures. In terms of churn fighting for share etc. that goes on every day, the market is slightly smaller, we have several viable competitors in this business and we are all are testing our business models. We happen to believe ours is superior based on results to date, but no tremendous pricing pressure or predatory activities or targeted activities, anything of that nature that doesn\u2019t go on everyday under better circumstances.", "Seth Weber - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks, if I could ask a follow-up. Jim, as you talk about structurally changing the company a little bit, would that include sharing some assets or maybe if you could give us some idea of where you might be thinking on the acquisition side, whether it\u2019s more healthcare that kind of stuff?", "James Loree", "Yes, I\u2019m glad to answer that question, because I did want to make the point at some point during the call that the capital allocation for this year is really focused on deleveraging. So, don\u2019t expect to see much if anything in the way of acquisitions in the current year. Once we get our debt to the levels that we\u2019re comfortable with, which would be at a minimum to get all of our short-term debt paid down this year, then as we into next year and we are building a pipeline for that eventuality. ", "But as we go into next year, I think you will start to see some acquisitions in the healthcare area and also electronic security and mechanical security, and then possibly some tool consolidation acquisitions. It\u2019s quite possible in this distressed environment when you start looking at the massive over capacity and the volume declines that some of our competitors are experiencing, which in some cases are steeper than ours. I think that there is a good chance that there maybe some consolidation in the tool industry at some point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Nicole DiBlaze \u2013 Unidentified Company]. ", "Nicole DiBlaze \u2013 Unidentified Company", "A question on inventory, you guys obviously did a really good performance year-on-year, if I look quarter-over-quarter however it looks like inventories are broadly flat. So my question then is what\u2019s your plan for inventory reductions in 2009, is this trough inventory level that we\u2019re currently at, and then in what businesses are you guys seeing the highest inventory levels?", "John Lundgren", "", "Don will take that, I think he can give you some specifics that we were very comfortable with.", "Donald Allan", "Now to answer one of your questions, we don\u2019t expect the inventory level we saw in the first quarter to be where we are to where it\u2019s going to stay for the rest of the year. With the programs that we have in place under SFS, specifically around lien to transformation or transformation to lien in our plans as well as the S&OP processes we put in place, we do believe we will continue to see inventory reduction this year of a significant nature. ", "What you are seeing in the fourth quarter and the first quarter just continue reaction to our volume decline sequentially, the accounts payable portion went down, you see inventory declined in the second quarter most likely and continue to decline after that. So I would expect the trend that we saw last year to continue in inventory.", "John Lundgren", "Yes, and I\u2019ll just add, Nicole, because I don\u2019t really get cut-off if you try to ask a follow-up. Often we\u2019re asking where do customer inventory stand, Jim alluded to the fact in the industrial segment the data isn\u2019t as good and we don\u2019t get it as quickly, but our estimate is about a third of our volume decline was due to de-stocking, credit issues in the two step channels and within our industrial account. ", "On the retail side, roughly I\u2019m comfortable saying, inventories are not out of line. As you know, the large home centers run at 10 to 12 weeks and our sense is that\u2019s where they are, comfortable saying that obviously that 10 to 12 weeks of a lower base, but there are certainly nothing from the marketplace perspective that suggests we are going to be significantly impacted by that as we move to execute our own programs to continue to reduce our inventories.", "Nicole DiBlaze \u2013 Unidentified Company", "That\u2019s helpful and then one follow-up if. If may, if you guys could quantify how much benefit from the headcount reductions you\u2019ve taken thus far you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter that will be helpful?", "James Loree", "Yes, if you look on the walk that we did for SG&A, you can certainly see a 13% reduction in the first quarter and then you have a portion in cost of sales as well, which is probably about $10 million to $15 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities.", " ", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "", "Looking at securities relative to the installation trends, how would you guys say you were you kind of outlook, do you guys use things like the architectural billings index and then could you also comment on perhaps the return prospects or payback payer, hoping to get out of the new convergent sales force?", "James Loree", "", "Well, there is a lot of different factors that go into forecasting installations, for instance how many feed on the street, what\u2019s the sales, where is productivity, what does the market look like, and there is no magic to it. So, we feel that the installations as we go in to the next several quarters are going to down consistent with the first quarter. The sales force adds, we are talking about roughly 8% increase in the feed on the street in the convergent business that is put in perspective.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "Then given obviously that you guys have been very successful or aggressive on your restructuring actions, and consistently taking out what\u2019s harder and harder for you to get. If there were another step down, I mean how much of that costs because I think you guys have been fairly aggressive or actually left in your guys opinion, I mean, have you gone seven-tenths of the weight to what you really think is reasonable?", "John Lundgren", "", "I would argue that academically or theoretically we can continue to reduce costs consistent with volume declines not quite as fast almost in perpetuity, do know recognized that 45% of our revenues are outside the US and as Jim and I both touched on in our pieces of the presentation. Right now our volume in Europe of the last five or six months is down even more than the US, and while we have the exact same objectives and strategy, I think everybody on the call also aware it takes a lot longer to right-size a European manufacturing operation than it does the US or an Asian operation. ", "So, the plans are in place and plans are proceeding, but it\u2019s going to take us allow to get those results. Our hope is by the time we see those, this will be over and volume will start to improve, but right now the cost benefits have been primarily in the US, secondarily in Asia with Europe still to come, or say differently the European cost based needs to ketch up with the volume decline in Europe and our team is well aware of that and we are working with the appropriate works counsels, unions and government and government officials to reach the right solution.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "First question, just on the security margins, very impressive continued stable performance on the margins and I was just wondering going forward, what is your expectation if volume drops from here. It appears that a lot of the actions that you have taken have been in the restructuring actions have been more on the industrial and CDIY side, which is obviously borne very positive fruit in terms of the margins holding up there as well. On the security side, if you see a similar drop off in sales, what are your thoughts in terms of down side to margins for let\u2019s say every 5% and do you have similar kind of plans in place that would allow you to take quick action?", "James Loree", "", "Well, Mick as we said in the past, we really don\u2019t make a practice out of forecasting segment margins or trying to be that question about what might happen within certain segments. However, I guess what I can say is that there is a lot of cost in the security business, there is a lot of fixed cost and it\u2019s actually there is more fixed cost in the security sales and service structure than probably any other such structure in the company, because you have thousands of sales people, thousands of vends, technicians, etc. In a manufacturing type of a segment, those would be up in all and not the sales people, but certainly the service and the installation and so forth, if there was such a think would be in variable cost, but in our case it\u2019s in the field structure. ", "So, if the revenues were to come down precipitously and we don\u2019t think they are and the reason we don\u2019t think they are is because there are so much recurring revenue and I think you\u2019ve seen us fairly stressed out distressed quarter in the security business and this kind of what it looks like. So we don\u2019t expect it to get worse, but if they work the next step would be to accelerate some of the cost reduction actions that are out there, opportunities that are out there in the field structure, and thus far, we\u2019ve avoided doing much of that. ", "What we have done has been centralizing some functions and things like that that we have before provided in the field, but there is definitely the ability if we steam it necessary to go in and do some surgery with respect to the cost structure in the field. Hopefully, we wanted to do that and as you can see we are adding back resources, not taking the amount at this point in time. ", "John Lundgren", "Yes, Mike, this is John. Remember when I gave you a little granularity on SG&A, there was no business or segment split, but I alluded to most businesses, CDIY and Industrial, SG&A was down in excess of 20% and in security by design it was high single or low double digits because security has not experienced the types of volume declines and margin pressure as our two tools businesses, and as Jim just pointed out in fact we\u2019re in the process of trying to build for the future and maintain volume by adding 8% to our sales force, which last half full it should add 8% to our revenue last half empty would preclude an 8% further decline depending on how you look at the business.", "James Loree", "That\u2019s an important point, because we haven\u2019t really factored in any volume associated with those reinvestments and surely at some point in the year they are liable to through out some positive volume which will be a nice cushion against further market decrease.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "Right. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up, I guess this is what you\u2019re referring to before about the fact that organic only down 4% in such a difficult environment. If you could just remind us, give us your split for recurring revenue. What is that as a percent of the sales and if possible that percent mix by CSS and MAS?", "James Loree", "", "Yes, Mike, we\u2019ve been public with that before and it hasn\u2019t changed. Roughly, to the nearest 10% off because we are not going to split decimals within, on the convergent side it\u2019s slightly in excess of 40% and we\u2019re trying to grow it, and if nothing else as installs go down and we don\u2019t lose any customers it will grow as a percent of total, but it\u2019s basically constant recurring on a lower base. On the mechanical side, it\u2019s about 20%. Those segments are almost identical in terms of size so the math gets you to 30% in total.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions. Ms. White, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you.", "Kate White", "\t", "Thank you everybody very much for their participation in the call.

My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Works second quarter 2009 results conference call. (Operator Instructions).", "Thank you. At this time I would like to hand the call over to Ms. White. Please go ahead.", "Kate White", "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, this is Kate White, the Director of Investor Relations for the Stanley Works.", "Thank you all for joining us on the Stanley Works second quarter 2009 conference call this morning. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley's Chairman and CEO, Jim Loree, Stanley's Executive Vice President and COO and Don Allan, Stanley's Vice President and CFO.", "I would like to point out that our second quarter earnings release, which was issued this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on our home page, which is www.stanleyworks.com.", "This morning John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's second quarter 2009 results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay of the call will be available at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release and as always feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today's call at 860-827-3833.", "We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today.", "We direct you to the cautionary statements in Form 8-K, which we have filed with today's press release and in our most recent 34-A.", "With that I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate and good morning everybody. Let me start just with an overview as I think that many of you have said it has been helpful in the past on how we see the state of affairs at Stanley and just some of the highlights from the quarter.", "We did post GAAP earnings of $0.89 that included a $0.34 gain on the extinguishment of debt, so our normalized EPS from continuing operations was $0.55. You'll recall that the debt to which I'm referring was $103 million of our ETPS instrument that we used to finance the FACOM acquisition in 2006. It was a great opportunity and our treasury department capitalized on that.", "We also announced a $50 million cost-reduction program due to the steeper than expected unit volume declines in the second quarter and about half of that will be realized during 2009. I think it's important to stay ahead of the curve given the volume softness but I think it's equally important to note that the lion's share of the cuts that were recently implemented were in the areas of G&A and not at the expense of brand support and important future growth initiatives.", "We are really pleased with our gross margin of 39.9%. It was a record for the Stanley Works, despite the 24% drop in unit volume versus the prior year. Jim and Don are going to provide a walk later showing you how we got there, as well as why we believe we'll stay at or near that level for the second half of the year.", "Security posted an 8% revenue growth and a 13% profit growth. A lot of that due to acquisition but organic growth fell only 8% in the midst of this environment, which to us further validates our belief that while the segment that security isn't immune from macroeconomic downturns, it's certainly well insulated and it's certainly more resistant than many other businesses.", "We did see some indications within our CDIY segment with year-over-year sales trends are showing us some signs of improvement. More detail on that in the segment breakup. On Monday, we announced a dividend increase for the 42nd consecutive year, 3.1% to $0.33 per quarter. It's obviously an important element of our total shareholder return. It also reflects our confidence in future cash flow generation, and our ability to achieve our forecasts.", "We're also quite proud of the fact that it's the longest consecutive annual record of an industrial company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Our Stanley Fulfillment System and the Processes contained therein remain a top focus for us and the majority of our free cash flow we are going to generate in the second half of the year and that we have generated in the quarter did come from working capital improvements. We think it's a very credible achievement in the current reduced volume environment. We have had a lot of questions running up to the call with respect to free cash flow, our forecast as well as our ability to achieve it.", "Don is going to provide quite a bit more insight on that towards the end of the presentation, but I think it is important to note up front that three of the last four years, more than two-thirds of Stanley's free cash flow came in the second half of the year. This is not a new phenomenon for Stanley and Don will, I think, help provide more clarity and transparency on our projections.", "Moving on to worldwide revenues, volume and sales essentially were down everywhere. The market slowdown has affected all regions where a year ago we were able to report growth in every region of the country. The US of course is most important, it represents almost 59% of Stanley's revenues and we were down 14% in total, 20% organically. Europe was most heavily impacted, down 25% organically and 30% in total. The other regions also were down comparably. It is probably important to note, Australia relatively small region but important to Stanley and the impacts of both currency and volume declines did have an impact on our business.", "Now the US, as I mentioned, is showing, I will say, signs of strength or maybe better said stability. It obviously entered the recession earlier and based on historical precedent, could be expected to emerge earlier. Also just arithmetically we are facing our lower comps in the first and second quarters as we will go through the second half of the year.", "Moving on to slide five, we don't normally spend a lot of time on this call talking about the macroeconomic environment or things that everyone on this call can read about and read the same documents we do, but, given the extent to which it affects our business in general and our industrial segment in particular, we thought we'd spend a minute on it, as well as include some data that we think is quite revealing in the appendix.", "The GDP declines accelerated through the first quarter, particularly in Europe, as most countries fell into recession and it particularly affected our CDIY and industrial segments, and that was reflected in our results. We don't have it on this page, but you'll see in the appendix after quarters, of about minus 1.7, 1.8, both the UK and the continental Europe or the Euro zone, GDP was down almost 5%, 4.9% in both cases.", "The US GDP outlook indicates a continued decline with based on current projections, a slight abatement in the fourth quarter. After mid 2% declines, 3.7% followed by the current projection of minus 1.4 in the fourth quarter.", "I mention all this, because it's quite consistent with our outlook, for the business in general, the environment in which we are operating, as well as it relates to installations in our security business that Jim's going to talk a lot more about later.", "Industrial production declines are leveling off. That's the chart that you see at the bottom of this page. As we've talked about on earlier calls, the declines came much later in Europe than in the US. The fall was steeper and sharper, but of late has shown relative stability and I think that's quite clear, just graphically looking at the chart, the left being the UK and the right being continental Europe or essentially the Euro zone.", "Last but not least, construction project delays have accelerated but the abandoned projects have stabilized. There's a lot of detail, you can look at later on page 26 of our appendix, but again it is consistent with what we're seeing in our security business and as a consequence we're going to spend more time on this call than normal, trying to relate installations to RMR by size of project and type of project and I think that you will find that quite helpful in understanding what's driving our security business and what's contributing to its stability.", "Let's turn quickly to the results. There is nothing on chart 6 that isn't contained in more detail in the press release. Our GAAP earnings of $0.89 including the $0.34 gain from extinguishing the debt, normalized EPS of $0.55 as I said, operating margins down but still strong given the high level of volume declines and tax rate was actually 100 basis points higher. It's primarily business mix with lower earnings, in foreign countries our blended tax rate obviously increases.", "Looking quickly at revenues, on the next page, we see first quarter 15% decline followed by a 20% decline in the second quarter. Sources of growth or lack thereof to be more correct, volume down 24% which has been our focus, price held up fairly well. Currency remained a headwind but slightly less than in the first quarter, it was minus 4%, acquisitions contributed 6%; so in total you see revenues down 20%.", "On the right-hand side I won't spend much time on this because Jim's going to walk you through each segment but the number that jumps off the page is 40% in the industrial segment. We're going to talk to that and how we think that looks going forward.", "I did mention that at the outset, one of the highlights, certainly of the quarter was gross margin, and the achievement and how we're thinking about that going forward. I am going to pass the baton to Jim who is going to walk us through margin performance and take a look at the segments, and then he is going to turn it over to Don.", "Jim Loree", "Okay. Thanks, John. I must say, when I look at long-term trends, I love this chart almost as I love our ten-year cash flow history chart. This is a very positive trend for us with 39.9% gross margin in the second quarter, up a 160 basis points versus the second quarter of '08 where we were at 38.3. As you look at the long-term trend, it clearly is a positive trend and corroborating the theory that our gross margin percent then correlates with the strength and the differentiation of our value propositions. This performance, in particular, this year has been key to avoiding the steep declines in the operating margin rate that we otherwise would have faced in the phase of the volume challenges that we've had that are market-related.", "We were able to do this while bringing our year-over-year inventories down about $100 million or 17% over the prior year. The real story implied by this chart is the transformation of the company both strategically and with respect to our operational excellence. What this means when you step back from it is that, we are extraordinarily well positioned for operating leverage in any kind of a growth environment. Slow growth environment will be just fine, we'll be able to generate significant operating leverage.", "As we move to SG&A, I think we've also done a fairly good job of focusing on resizing our SG&A to calibrate with the revenue size implied by the current economic environment. When you look at the 255 and adjust it for the 23 million associated with acquisitions, the expenses are actually down 18% versus the second quarter of '08, just slightly less than our organic revenue decline. So, in a pretty good shape there.", "We've been able to do this while reinvesting about $20 million annualized in security sales force ads, particularly in the convergent business and in our Major League Baseball brand awareness campaign, which this quarter we've now added Yankee Stadium and the stadium where the Toronto Blue Jays play. So we now have brought our MLB presence up to 10 teams this quarter.", "Moving on to security, a look at the security segment, a great story. The business now running at an annualized revenue run rate of about $1.6 billion with revenues in the quarter of approximately $390 million or up 8%. Segment profit, up in double digits. The profit rate, not a new record but is certainly an excellent performance at 19%, up 80 basis points over the prior year.", "Convergent revenues grew 29%, clearly benefiting from acquisitions, including Sonitrol and GDP which added, when taken in combination with some smaller acquisitions, about $50 million of growth in the quarter. The monitoring margins expanded from the continued excellent execution by the team in convergent. The organic recurring monthly revenue was up 9% and the acquisitions brought us some great accretion as well.", "I'm going to talk in a little bit more detail about the recurring revenue and the revenue picture in convergent, because there is a real story there which I'd like everybody to understand in the face of negative 8% organic growth for the segment, overall segment. I think you'll see that the convergent business is quite healthy as well as the mechanical business.", "Mechanical business had a 7% revenue decrease which was buffered by what we believe to be some share gains in a really tough market environment, realized good price and kept their cost structure in line, and managed their working capital very well, down $16 million during the or versus the prior second quarter of last year.", "I want to spend a few moments, as I mentioned, on the improving mix in electronic security. When you just simply look at the organic revenue decline in convergent, it doesn't really tell the whole story. You have to kind of peel a few layers apart here. If we look at the US, and we look at the sub-segments within US convergent, we have large projects, national accounts and core commercial. The installation margins and the recurring revenue content of those particular businesses is correlated in exactly that order.", "So the large projects are the lowest margin and then the core commercial are of the highest margin. And what you have there are steep organic installation revenue declines, large projects down greater than 30%, national accounts down somewhat greater than 20%, and the core commercial business, down less than 10%. So single digit organic installation revenue decreases in those businesses.", "And as you can see, the core commercial and the national accounts really represent the bulk of the business. The large projects are really more of a legacy from the prior, pre-HSM Sonitrol business.", "What's really interesting here when you look at it is the RMR, new RMR sales. So that is the new RMR that was added in the quarter, as a percent of the installation revenue sales is increasing across all three of those segments but it's increasing dramatically in the core commercial which indicates that the sales ads that we've been making and the compensation plan changes that we have made to really focus folks on the core commercial accounts in this environment, as well as the recurring revenue content, are really paying off and obviously the recurring revenue has a much higher gross margin than the installation revenue regardless of the segment.", "So in effect what you have here is a very, very positive mix change going on which is allowing us to weather this economic storm in good stead. And as you can see at the bottom, the sales force ads, the emphasis on recurring revenue and decreased dependants on the lower margin were cyclical large project business is helping us.", "We grew our organic recurring monthly revenue by 9% in the quarter despite the 8% organic decline in the overall segment, and that itself is a big reason why the segment profit was up 13%. So that is a great story in my view.", "As we move to industrial, this is a very, very difficult market situation that our industrial folks are facing. Revenues down 40%, organic revenue down 36%, problems in the markets in both US and Europe. Segment profit down only 56% in the face of a 40% revenue decline, while not great. It certainly is a good story that we're able to contain it to that level. The segment profit coming in at 9.4% is pretty much a low point over the last few years for this particular segment.", "The industrial channels were definitely down more than the automotive channels, that makes sense when you think about the benefits from the aging car fleet in the United States in particular. We believe that inventory corrections represented about 50% of the overall decline in the segment, and then the just lower production volumes and weak economy in terms of inherent demand really represented the rest. When I say inventory corrections, I'm talking about drastic inventory corrections throughout the supply chain of our customers and the entire industry.", "The storage business though was kind of consistent and maybe not quite as steep in terms of revenue declines and pretty much on a par sequentially. I think a couple of positive things; we really believe we are maintaining our share in this very difficult market. We have taken aggressive cost actions and we know that, not all of our competitors have done that, which is good.", "We do feel like the market here is stabilizing, albeit at a very low level, and our cost actions while somewhat delayed due to the concentration of this particular segment in Europe are kicking in, and that we're likely at a trough in this particular quarter in terms of segment profit rate.", "Finally MAC is doing quite well. Our financing program with GreenSky is intact. We will not have to take any receivables associated with financing onto our balance sheet as a result. So a couple of highlights there, but in general, a pretty tough story in that particular segment.", "Moving on to Construction & DIY , very encouraged by the profit rate in this segment, coming in at 11.3% on the heels of a 9.5 performance in the first quarter and a 6.4% trough performance in the fourth quarter of last year. So we were pleased with that. I think the cost actions are definitely kicking in. The revenue is stabilizing in this particular segment and even showing some very faint signs of improvement. We won't get euphoric at all, but point of sale is steady to slightly up, inventories at the customer level are stable and organic growth seems to be stabilizing in the kind of minus 20% sort of a range. It was minus 19 in the first quarter, minus 23 in this quarter, but as the quarter went on, it was a slightly better picture sequentially. So, we're feeling good about the stability frankly in this segment. I think we also believe that as we do start to see some signs of improvement in the economy that this will be in all likelihood an early cycle improver in our portfolio.", "The final thing I'll say here is that the Bostitch integration that we undertook in the earlier part of this year is well underway and on-track and really is a positive for much more positive than just the cost reduction aspect of it as we talked about last quarter.", "With that I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Don Allan", "Thanks, Jim. As both John and Jim have mentioned earlier today, we have talked a little bit about our acquisition impact and the positive accretion we're seeing in our margin rate. So here on page 14, you can see that we wanted to give you a quick update on primarily our 2008 acquisitions. What we have here are three acquisitions that we did in 2008 that represent about 85% of the total acquisitions in that year, and in particular there's Sonitrol, Xmark and Generale de Protection.", "This chart we've shown over the years in various presentations around our integration process and how we drive significant synergy realization through that process. You can see that each one of the acquisitions has a significant accretive impact from where they were on their operating margin percentage before we acquired them.", "As an example, Sonitrol with 22% operating margin, a very strong operating margin to start with and now it's after the integration process has been complete it's greater than 30%. So some of the key features we thought we'd touch on in our integration process, just as a reminder to all of you, that we go through a very robust processes especially in the first 100 to 180 days and we develop an integration plan actually in advance of the closing of the acquisition that has the target management teams buy-in in essence before we close on the transaction.", "Then subsequent to that we go through a weekly and monthly senior management pulsing process and many of those acquisitions include John, Jim and myself in those pulsing processes. We've developed some very experienced integration managers primarily over the last five years. They really understand our process and how to drive these benefits.", "Then last but certainly not least making sure that we do have a native or in-country integration team and that was very critical and a great example of that is for GdeP. So as we move forward to working capital, we feel like we've continued to exhibit good control over our working capital as our working capital dollars decline 21% inline with or slightly better than the revenue decline of 20% which resulted in working capital turns improving from four-eight in the second quarter of last year to 4.9 this year.", "So if we dissect working capital a little bit and look at the three different pieces, why don't we start with accounts receivable because it's certainly been a terrific story for us especially in the last three or four quarters and we continue to see that in the second quarter of this year, down 29% to about $650 million and well outpacing the decline that we saw on revenue and really what's driving that out performances our focus on delinquencies. As we've mentioned in previous calls we started a robust set of processes around ensuring our delinquencies around A-R are minimized and compared to last year we had about a $70 million decline in delinquencies. Next is inventories, Jim mentioned and John mentioned inventories are down 17% versus last year.", "What's very impressive as well is that if you look at the first quarter of this year our DSI was 83 days and now we've moved on to 77 days. So we're seeing sequential improvement, which is really the benefits of our SFS processes and primarily in this area would be our sales, operations and planning rhythms that we've put in place over the last few years and they continue to mature and we see the effect of that as we're able to really drive our inventories down very close to being in line with the revenue declines.", "The one negative at this point is really payables, payables is a user of cash year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but you're really seeing the effect of the inventory reduction as well as the expense and CapEx reductions we've been driving toward this is year that are pushing that number down.", "We expect that to really stabilize through the remainder of the year and the bulk of that decrease is behind us. Moving to free cash flow, which is clearly benefiting from that working capital performance, as we saw positive working capital benefit in the second quarter of $30 million.", "One item of note here in our free cash flow is that John mentioned the gain on the debt extinguishment, so we have about 27 million of income and the net income line associated with that. Then this other line of $91 million is where that gets backed out. So it's not included in our operating cash flow.", "Some other things in that other line include reductions in accrued expenses, some derivative settlements as well as restructuring payments that we've made associated with our various cost reduction actions that we started in December of last year.", "So our performance in general was really driven by working capital, and free cash flow. We feel good based on the second quarter performance that we can achieve our $300 million estimate for this year. I'll walk through that in a little more detail a few pages from now.", "Shifting to the balance sheet, we continue to feel good about our position on our balance sheet. We've had our debt to cap ratio move down slightly from what it was in the first quarter, down to 46%. Then when we adjust from that for a hybrid equity and debt instruments, it's somewhere between 34% and 37%. So it's close to where we expected it to be for this period of time. As we mentioned in previous calls, we're driving towards an objective of trying to deleverage ourselves by about $200 million this year, and that continues to be an important priority and we've made it, some nice progress so far through six months where we've deleveraged ourselves by about $70 million in that time frame. So we feel like we're on track to achieving those goals at this stage.", "Focusing on guidance, which is the next page and I want to spend a little bit of time on this page, make sure we understand what's going on here, if you focus on the left side of the page which is EPS, these are changes compared to our last guidance that we've provided in April.", "The first item is a revised 2009 unit volume outlook. As John mentioned, we believe for the year we're going to be down negative 18% to negative 20% as we saw negative 19% and negative 24% in the first two quarters of this year for unit volume declines. That would be an implied negative 14% to negative 18% in the second half of this year. In essence it represents really the run rate that we're experiencing on unit volume, and it, when you have the easing of the comps in the back half of the year as we were down negative 7% and negative 10% in the third and the fourth quarter of 2008 is why that number gets smaller compared to what experienced in the first half of the year.", "The impact of each point of a decline, as we mentioned previously, is about $0.20 EPS, so as a result it's a dollar negative EPS to our previous guidance provided. That being said you heard a lot of the good performance we experienced in gross margin rate and with 39.6% in the first quarter and 39.9% in the second quarter.", "We expect that in the second half of the year we will experience similar rates, probably in the range of 38% to 39% that will drive a margin rate improvement and offset about three quarters of that negative unit volume that we are expecting to experience for the year. That's really the trend that we have seen in the first half of the year. So we are expecting that to continue in the back half of the year as we see those benefits in gross margin.", "That being said, we felt that there still was a gap to our objectives of achieving $2 and $2.50 EPS that we laid out in April of about $0.25. So we embarked on the new restructuring program that John mentioned earlier that would provide about $25 million of benefit in the back half of the year. A little bit of detail on that, the whole program is $50 million of annualized cost actions that we executed and completed in the month of July. At this stage about 35% of it is headcount related and about 90% of it is associated with SG&A as John mentioned. So that results in a total set of actions of $265 million in 2009. When you combine it with the previous two sets of actions we have done, which commenced in December of 2008.", "The last item on here that is changing is obviously the gain on the debt extinguishment of $0.34, affects our guidance that we provided previously. So that gives us an end result of $2.34 to $2.84 guidance range, if you adjust for the gain it's consistent with the range that we provided last quarter of $2 and $2.50.", "All the other factors that around FX and previous cost actions, acquisitions and restructuring charges are consistent with our previous guidance. We believe that the restructuring charges of $45 million is still the appropriate number for this year, as we've seen a little bit of benefit in our European restructuring program at a lower cost, and we are able to utilize that excess to pay for the current actions that we just embarked on.", "Moving to free cash flow, which is a topic that many of us are interested in. As we mentioned previously on the call, we believe that $300 million in free cash flow is achievable for this year, and it's based on several factors. Let me start with a little bit of historical and analytical information.", "John had mentioned that three of the last four years, 67% of our free cash flow occurred in the back half of the year. In this particular case, if you assume that the $300 million is achieved, that means we'd achieve about $200 million of free cash flow in the back half of 2009, which would imply about $225 million free cash flow.", "The other factor to look at is that, our second quarter is also an indicator of the year as well. Our second quarter in the last two years tends to represent about 15% of the total year of free cash flow. So if you take this year's second quarter performance, that would calculate to about $285 million of free cash flow, so that gives you a range of somewhere between 225 and 285.", "So why do we think we can do above and beyond that to get to $300 million? It's really predicated on that release that we can achieve a 10% working capital turn improvement over last year's performance of 5.9. If you remember in the fourth quarter of last year, we had 5.9 working capital turns. We believe that we can get to 6.5, 6.7 working capital turns, because of the detailed plans that we've put in place in our businesses to ensure that we're driving towards those types of objectives. Each business under the Stanley's fulfillment system processes and rhythms has those plans in place and are being pulsed on a regular basis, and they have to do with transformational lean techniques as well as continued enhancements of our sales and operation planning processes as they mature.", "Really our ability to increase our dividend was indicative of our belief that we can achieve this $300 million free cash flow.", "So in summary, we believe that we're well positioned to gain market share as we've done appropriate actions along way to ensure that our cost base is adjusted. We have also made certain key investments along the way that both John and Jim have indicated earlier.", "Our gross margin success in the first two quarters is very pleasing to us and we believe that we can largely maintain that for the remainder of the year. We continue to be focused on paying down our debt as I mentioned $200 million in 2009 and we feel like we're on track to achieve that so far. Then last but certainly not least, our dedication and focus on SFS. We believe that's a significant source of cash for us and ultimately is a competitive advantage for Stanley. So that concludes our presentation portion of the call.", "Kate White", "Jennifer, we'd like to start the Q&A portion of the call right now.", "Question-and-Answer session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jim Lucas from Janney Montgomery.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "I wanted to ask a specific question on the industrial side of the business. With the inventory corrections seeking out there, could you maybe give us a little bit more color of what you're seeing in terms of customers just still needing liquidity and using inventory correction for that versus what they're seeing in terms of their ability to get access to credit. And going forward, are inventory levels now to a point where stock outs are potentially occurring or is this just resetting to the new demand levels?", "John Lundgren", "Hey, Jim. This is John. I'll start and turn it over to Jim who is going to give you even little more detail. Remember we are talking industrial and we've learned a lot in the last month or so. I would say up until then we would have thought of third of the volume decline was due to destocking. We've done a lot of granular analysis that caused us to raise that estimate to 50%.", "Importantly a huge portion of that for us is in Europe. It has had a tremendous impact on Facom's volume declines that's where a lot of our updated guidance or updated analysis comes from. Hard to talk about out of stocks in the industrial segment given the B to B short delivery cycles, a lot of it through distribution but I don't know if Jim add even a little more color to that because he has been doing a lot of work on Proto Facom, MAC in particular and as well as some of our storage businesses.", "Jim Loree", "Yes, I mean I think the key to the inventory correction phenomenon is really the word of caution on the part of the customers and it derives from both liquidity concerns, concerns about what the ultimate size of the market really is and just overall questions that I think the distributors have in their minds about the business model that they are going to have on a prospective basis and how much volume is really going to be there. Nobody wants to get caught with their pants down on inventory in the chain and what they are finding is they can have where they used to have 20 SKUs on a rack. They can have 20 units of a SKU on a rack they can now have two and order much more frequently. To an extent that's okay because it keeps them liquid and in business.", "However, at some point in time the overall market's ability to deal with that issue or that situation changes when the demand returns and those SKUs units go off direct faster and we can't replenish them fast enough to meet the end market demands.", "So I think we're going to see in my estimation we're going to see a fairly significant rebound in terms of this inventory restocking as opposed to destocking. I don't know when that's going to occur. We have incorporated a neutral into our outlook on a prospective basis for the remainder of the year. However, if there were to be some significant restocking that would be a positive.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "So is the key going to be order activity in terms of what you are going to get from a visibility standpoint given that short cycle order what they need as opposed to building out quite a bit that's needed?", "Jim Lorry", "I think we're prepared to respond without question despite the fact that our inventories are in really good shape. We are prepared to respond. The Stanley fulfillment system has been instrumental in terms of bringing our lead times down across the various businesses including industrial.", "So I think visibility to the order patterns is good. I think that what we really need in the chain is some confidence restoration at the customer level and when they start to see signs that demand will recover at some level on a year-over-year basis. I think we'll start to see that restocking occur and we'll be prepared to serve at that time.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery", "Okay. Final question on this topic. When you look at across the multiple end markets, is this very broad-based? Are you seeing when you say industrial, are there any particular end markets that are jumping out and then with regards to SFS, could you maybe give us a little bit more color of what type of lead time reductions you've experienced?", "John Lundgren", "Yes, first of all, Jim, I say it's broad spread. That's why I mentioned it as we look at our industrial segment, in the sense that sub-segments, industrial and automotive tools, industry and automotive repair and, if you will, infrastructure solutions. Only the latter of those three which is less than 20% of the segment has long lead times. There we've cut the lead times dramatically.", "In more importantly in things like Vidmar boxes, we've build a Vidmar box in a day. There's not much lead time to be cut from that. So, our businesses very well. In our made-for-stock tool businesses, the Proto's, the Mac's, the Facom's, we've already taken 25% and more out of our lead times. A lot of that has come from when and if we source components, the rest of it has just come from leading out our factories so it's going to vary dramatically by business.", "Some, always room to improve but approach world-class, Vidmar being a classic example and then 25% to 40% coming out of lead times, some of which didn't start at world-class levels for the rest of our industrial businesses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning, guys. It's actually [Mark] stepping in for Eric. In terms of the security segment, organic was a little bit softer and just kind of looking back to last quarter you guys thought that for the year it would run around that down mid-single digit rate, so second quarter a little bit softer than that. How should we think about the second half organically within the security segment? Is 2Q a better run rate or is the first quarter a better run rate for the business?", "Jim Lorry", "I would say Mark that the second quarter is probably not the best run rate for the back half of the year, it's most likely a blend of the first half and what we are assuming for the back half of the year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Within that piece of the business pricing in total for the company still favorable but slightly less favorable than 1Q. Was the pricing pressure relative to the first quarter within the installed business in security or are you seeing some pricing pressure elsewhere?", "Jim Lorry", "The pricing pressure within security is definitely on the install business, in particular the national accounts pricing is under a lot of pressure. As our customers just like we look to cut costs they are going after their vendors and clearly when they have leverage, purchasing leverage, they are willing to exert it much more so than in a typical environment. So, we are not seeing dramatic pricing pressure in the core commercial accounts which is good and the margins are holding up well there and we know we are walking from some business in national accounts where we are just not capitulating on price to the extent that some of the other competitors are.", "We believe strongly in our value proposition and the performance of the business substantiates that and so we are trying to hold our prices at a fairly constant level in that business, even in the national accounts.", "John Lundgren", "Okay. Mark, this is John, I'll just add onto that so you don't get cut off. It may appear on the surface to be a rather bold statement that we are holding prices particularly in national accounts and not theoretically, in reality losing some business. We are cautiously optimistic and there is a lot of historical precedent to say that much of that business will come back to us when whoever's taken it, regardless of whether it's a large national competitor or a small local competitor, on the national accounts level, it's much more likely to be a larger competitor.", "When and if, they fail to deliver at the level that we've delivered in the past, you know and it's clear in the industry, our attrition rates are not among the lowest, they are the lowest in commercial security. There is a reason for that and a business that an account that is won on price will can and might well ultimately be lost on service. We'll get it back on our terms at our price that does take some time. We're very patient in that regard, because we think that's the right strategy for a business that's such an important part of our future.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Jeff Saut - Raymond James", "Thank you. This is Jeff calling in for Sam. First question, it surrounds the restructuring, you mentioned 35%, but its headcount, of the other 65% of that, is any of that discretionary spend that you would expect to come back faster, if units stabilize?", "Don Allan", "Jeff, this is Don. We won't expect any of this to come back faster than the previous restructuring programs we've done. We believe that these particular items are very similar items to what we've done before, so with additional cuts around T&E, and other discretionary spend. It's a real question mark for next year, how much comes back. It's really about us as a management team and how we control it and what decisions we make and what we allow to come back. It's really going to be dependent on what our ultimate thoughts are on the end markets and our revenue projections for next year.", "So, there will be some cost pressures that we talked about before around certain employee benefits that could be $40 to $60 million. It's difficult to really know of the carryover benefit we're getting, how much of that that comes back, as you say, or what pressures we have that offset it because it's really going to be dependent on our decision and what we allow to come back and it's going to be based on our revenue projections.", "Jeff Saut - Raymond James", "Okay. Second question, the improvement in gross margin, or the change, old guidance to new guidance for gross margin, I assume is mostly mix but my question is the second half degradation in gross margin if you are guiding towards 100 bps or so, is that all related to price? And can you talk about the price versus material inflation relationship and where you see that going in the second half?", "Jim Loree", "", "We actually benefited on a year-over-year basis by about, slightly over 300 basis points from the combination of productivity projects, price and acquisition mix. Some of those aspects will abate as time goes on because in particular, price, the vast majority of our pricing was implemented in the second and third quarter of last year. So when we look at a back half year-over-year analysis, clearly price will not be increasing sequentially at the same rate. That said, inflation is a crapshoot and that's why we have a range because we had modest deflation in this quarter, very modest, but there was a point in the quarter when we thought we were going to have inflation.", "So, as you know, in the March-April timeframe, commodity prices were spiking, they subsequently abated and it's not clear from here, you know, what commodity prices are going to do. A lot depends on the perception of the economic recovery and when it occurs and what the speculators do and so on in the commodity markets. However, that clearly is the reason that we have a range and what we feel is a relatively conservative range for the gross margin that we indicated.", "John Lundgren", "This is John. Importantly, it is a sequential decline arithmetically but from, if you will 39.5% to 38.5% the midpoint of the range that Don required, I'll live with that in this environment, if we can continue to achieve it, but you know, arithmetically you are correct and I think that Jim explained the rationale behind it.", "Jim Loree", "And when you think about the pressure on unit costs that is created by this volume issue that we have relative to the marketplace, that also is a big variable and we're anxiously looking forward to the day when we can actually have some volume to run through our factories and benefit from the absorption of overhead that will create. Now the contribution margin and the gross margin in this company varies by about 10 points and so that's going to really bode well for us when we do have some kind of a resurgence or at least some kind of up-tick, would be a better word than resurgence in volume.", "John Lundgren", "And then just last point, just to add a little color to the same subject. We've made it very clear working capital is a focus, working capital returns is a focus. It goes without saying, but it's worth for us, but it's worth repeating. We no longer run our factories for liquidations, the mantra is sell one, replenish one is how we think about it. And to Jim's points with the soft volumes, we're not going to simply run product in the inventory, miss our working capital returns, but to the extent in that reduced volume environment, we continue to basically produce to fulfill demand and nothing more that has pressure on margins. So it all contributes, but the objective being to maintain it within 100 basis points of a 163 year record first half performance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning, guys, this is actually [Nicole] asking questions on Nigel's behalf. First of all, if we can just go into a little bit more detail on the price inflation dynamic, if you could quantify that for the current quarter it would be helpful?", "Don Allan", "This is Don, Nicole. We really don't want to get into that level of detail for various reasons. I think we've been very clear that prices are positive and productivity was as well and mix of security with a little bit of deflation, as Jim just indicated and that's really where we would like to leave it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then, if you could speak to the head count reductions, how many have you actually taken out so far and then could you provide the mix between US and Europe?", "Don Allan", "The new set of actions are about 200 headcount, so I don't have the other ones right in front of me. We can certainly get that to organize; it's about 2000 people roughly.", "Jim Loree", "200 on top of 2000. The 2200 in total the combination of the three programs.", "John Lundgren", "This is John that is skewed toward the US; A, 60% of our revenues are in the US and B, as I think everyone on the call realize the costs have been recognized in the charges but in terms of cash flow, there are very rigorous and serious sets of legal and procedural guidelines that one follows in Europe and we understand them very well. We've successfully been through in the past and we're not going to attempt to circumvent or accelerate any of those processes and procedures that are there for a reason.", "So we will ultimately get where we need to be in Europe, the dialog and the collaboration with the unions and the works councils has been all we could hope for. There is tremendous reality and I think outstanding perspective on what the situation is. They have been skewed in the US, heads that come out later on will be and the cost associated with that, certainly from a cash perspective, will be skewed more towards Europe just due to the time lag.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital", "Hi, good morning, guys. Just going back to the security segment and specific to the convergent business, you guys talked a little bit about the increase in RMR and speak a little bit about attrition and pricing and where you're seeing in particular areas of either strength or weakness. Thanks.", "Don Allan", "", "Well, I feel like we've pretty much have covered, I am not sure if you caught the first part of the call Michael, but we delved into that in a fair amount of detail. If you want to call offline to Kate afterwards, she can run you through it, okay?", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital", "Sure, I apologize.", "Jim Loree", "", "Page 11, on the presentation, Michael, that's more detail than anyone has ever provided on this subject in a call of this nature, so if there is something beyond that that you need, Kate if she is able, will provide that for you offline, if that's okay?", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital", "Okay. So, I missed the beginning part of the call earlier.", "Jim Loree", "I think you'll find that pretty helpful. We did it for a reason and the reason was your question is a valid one, but let's not do it twice.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital", "Okay, sounds good. And then just maybe more in general terms, can you talk a little about the framework for RMR relative to installations, installations obviously have been under pressure from the macro environment and how we should probably think about RMR going forward?", "John Lundgren", "", "Michael, it's the exact same answer. Jim spent five minutes on it. It's on page 11. And why don't you have a look at that and then give Kate a call, but hopefully you will get more than what you need on that explanation.", "Jim Loree", "", "Our hypothesis going into the call was that, that would be a topic that people would want to understand, so we took the proactive step of providing that information in great detail. So, I think you will really get what you need from that when talking to Kate.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kenneth Zener, Macquarie Capital.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Capital", "I wonder if you could just kind of talk about the competitive landscape specifically in tools, given the extreme downturns that we've had, and I think you guys are managing your business very well and at a reasonable leverage. How is it looking relative to the private label competitors that you see, whether they are European or Asian, and how has that impacted the M&A landscape that you see?", "John Lundgren", "Well, I guess that's two very different questions, Ken. If I can try to dissect them, I will. We have talked about this on previous calls and other than our Stanley associates we certainly value the Stanley brand as our most important asset. What happens in any branded category, and this is both industrial and CDIY, but if you particularly think of the Stanley brand and Bostitch brand, we are number one or two in every category where we compete and that is a very good place to be. There are numerous recessions or periods of economic downturn over the last 30, 40 years where two things happen; private label and even generics as you've suggested grow, and the leading brand growths, and it's the brands in the middle that get squeezed out.", "Why is that? Obviously people in the middle are trading down to private label, but the customers want and need the leading brand as a reference point, so they can even widen the gap between private label or the retailers brand and the leading, if you will, national brand or the leading premium brand.", "So the winners, year in, year out, through these periods of economic downturn are the number one brand. Thankfully we're it in almost every category. And private label, and it is at the expense of particularly the numbers three and four brand.", "How that has impacted the M&A landscape? We've talked over time, there's tremendous, if you will, consolidation opportunity in the industry, but quite frankly there's little or nothing going on and our view is that hasn't affected it at all. Any and all companies, our views are very cautious in terms of protecting their balance sheets and there's been no more or less activity than we've seen in the past. So that's a long way of saying no change.", "Jim Loree", "I mean our hope would be that the industry would consolidate at some point, the hand tool industry, and that some of these number three and number four brands, owners of these brands would want to consolidate their activities with us. As John said, it's actionability are implied. Actionability is everything when it comes to that and if there is no desire, there is no activity.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Capital", "Understood. The second question I have, just further clarity on the impressive benefit you guys are getting on the gross margin line. You guys were just talking about in terms of the percentage basis, but the implied 75 million, that's primarily from a more realistic view about your input costs?", "Don Allan", "No. It's a combination of productivity projects, price and acquisition mix offset and that's over 300 basis points, as I mentioned. Offset by significantly higher unit cost related to lack of absorption in the manufacturing area.", "John Lundgren", "Yes. Our view, Ken, is we think that something a lot of folks are missing, we can talk about modest deflation and it looks like there maybe some. Our volumes are down 20%. Our actual costs all other things being equal are up dramatically. A 20% volume decline and that much less volume flowing through our factories overwhelms the modest impact of any deflation, which Jim and Don already suggested, we're only beginning to see. So, it's taking a lot of hard work on three other fronts. Our normal productivity funnels, short lead times purchasing, you name it to keep up all the benefits to come from our SFS initiative, it's taken all of that to keep us where we are and input costs are a very, very small piece of any positives we've seen in the past. Quite frankly, a very small piece of our belief that we can maintain within a 100 basis points those margins going forward in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Ray Huang - JPMorgan", "This is actually Ray Huang on for Mike. You guys talked about the market share gains in CDIYs, I'm wondering if you could break out or give some more detail on which end markets or channels are getting share and then, if you had any detail on any specific products or initiatives that are driving the gains.", "Jim Loree", "Well, the end market is defined by the name of the segment, which construction in DIY. There is no particular differentiation there between construction and DIY. I mean the share gains coming in the US at large retailers in particular, one very large retailer, the largest retailer in the world and we've got substantial share gain there. Then in Europe we've a number of smaller customers, when taken in the aggregate representing reasonably significant share gain.", "Ray Huang - JPMorgan", "Then if you think about CDIY stabilizing in the back half of the year, how we should look at the margins on in that segment, are you kind of thinking in the 10% range for the back half of the year?", "Don Allan", "We're not going to forecast margins by segment. We never have. I think what's important that Jim Loree mentioned in quite a bit of detail, when he went through that segment is three sequential quarterly increases that we're very encouraged by and that's coming not just from the cost benefit of combining our former Consumer Tools and Storage business the path that's, but also by essentially having a larger combined team to focus on the same end markets and we're seeing, the cost benefits I say are fairly obvious and straightforward.", "They're easy, but the share gains have come or beginning to come and we think will come in the future, due to the fact that we have the strength and strength, the combined professional organization, a product development process, focusing on the same customers and the same end markets, which was the logic for putting these two businesses together in the first place.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Kate White, Director of Investor Relations. Miss White you may begin your conference.", "", "Kate White", "", "Thank you so much, Sarah. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us on The Stanley Works third quarter 2009 conference call. ", "On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, Stanley\u2019s Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Stanley\u2019s Vice President and CFO.", "I would like to point out that our third quarter earnings release, which was issued this morning,  and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to you on the call and are on the webcast are available on the brand new Investor Relations portion of our website, www.stanleyworks.com. ", "This morning John, Jim and Don will review Stanley\u2019s third quarter 2009 results and various other topics followed by a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow up questions after today\u2019s call at my number which is 860-827-3833.

Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in our 8-K which we filed with today\u2019s press release and our most recent 34-A.", "With that I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "", "Thanks Kate and thanks for all of you on the phone for joining us this morning. Let me spend just a minute on the state of Stanley in terms of an overview. ", "First of all, we reported third quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.77 a share. Regrettably in reporting our results one or two of the news agencies dropped this number, which was actually in the headline of the press release we issued this morning, so some of you may have had to search the text and our exhibits a little bit more than we intended. But it\u2019s $0.77 EPS, very clear and straightforward which compares to $0.97 a year ago from continuing operations, 3Q \u201908. And on a GAAP basis the $2.04 that we recorded last year included $1.07 gain on the sale of our CST laser measuring business. So hopefully all that\u2019s clear and we can move forward from there.", "We are still experiencing mid-teens volume and revenue declines versus a year ago, but we were encouraged by modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter given the lack of seasonality in our business. We were even more encouraged by margins, a record quarterly gross margin of 41.3% which was achieved due to good pricing discipline as well as some meaningful cost productivity initiatives.", "Commodity deflation which we are experiencing was essentially offset by the impact of the volume under absorption. So those in a sense offset one another on an equal basis.", "Cash flow was also encouraging, $158 million for the quarter. That was up $55 million versus the same period year ago as we continued to execute our Stanley Fulfillment System and that process and program gains traction. And as a consequence we\u2019re able to raise our cash flow guidance for the year, and we now expect to exceed $300 million in cash flow.", "Security segment achieved a 3% revenue growth and 13% profit growth versus prior year. And within our convergent or electronic sub-segment organic revenues increased 5% sequentially which was also encouraging given the state of the market. ", "CDIY did show signs of sequential demand stabilization around the world. The focus going forward particularly in the fourth quarter is going to be new product roll outs, which we tend to do twice a year in waves and normally in the second and fourth quarter to stimulate further demand. ", "As a consequence of third quarter results, as well as our assessment of the environment over the next two to three months, our full year EPS guidance has also increased to a range of $2.84 to $2.94.", "Taking a geographic look at revenues, all major regions continue to absorb double digit declines which is indicative of the weakness in global economic conditions. The U.S. which accounts for nearly 60% of our revenue was down 17% organically, 16% in total. Europe was off about 22% organically, 16% in total as acquisitions played a role there, as well as Asia and Australia down similar measures. So no particular large geography in terms of our revenue was affected [inaudible] it\u2019s a fairly broad scale softness which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard on many calls and Don\u2019s going to talk a little bit more about what we\u2019re experiencing later.", "In terms of our third quarter results per se, operating margins rose 40 basis points to 14.4%. You can see the EPS of $0.97 that I referred to a year ago versus $0.77 this year. Tax rate was favorable by 240 basis points, 22.2%. And we were a little bit affected by share count being up marginally, up 800,000 shares to 80.6 million. So pretty straightforward in terms of EPS. Reasonably a strong performance despite the continued volume headwinds which is obviously having an impact.", "Looking at revenues for the third quarter as mentioned they did improve sequentially to $936 million from $919 million in the previous quarter, but importantly we\u2019re down 16% versus the same period year ago. Looking at the left of the chart in terms of sources of growth, as mentioned volumes down 20%. We got some help from price with continued discipline of 2% favorable so that\u2019s the organic 18% revenue decline to which we referred.", "Currency was negative but less so than in previous quarters, as you can see the trend as the dollar strength changes relative to foreign currencies. And acquisitions was positive, but that was also less help than in previous quarters. It added 4% to our total revenue base versus 7% and 6% in prior quarters. So in total revenues down 16% versus the same period year ago.", "Looking at the segments, I won\u2019t spend too much time on revenue because Jim is going to take a much deeper dive into that a little later on in the presentation but it\u2019s clear from the segment chart that our Industrial businesses around the world are under the most pressure in terms of revenue. CDIY is still experiencing external headwinds but certainly it appears to be abating to some extent. And Security\u2019s holding up pretty well under the circumstances and obviously contributing to some of the stability that we\u2019re experiencing.", "Moving on to volume trends, they are stabilizing to some extent and that\u2019s due in part as to simply the mathematics of weaker comps that are present beginning 2Q \u201909 which was essentially the beginning of the downturn. The chart I think is fairly straightforward where you see our third quarter unit volume down 20% and revenues down 16% which I suggested. And those comps will be a little easier or a little more favorable in the fourth quarter as we look to close out the year.", "We were encouraged by our working capital performance. Despite a 16% revenue decline, our turns improved 8% as previously mentioned as the Stanley Fulfillment System gains further traction. ", "We took three days out of inventory versus the same period year ago, nine days out of receivables. Payables were unfavorable by seven days. The negative impact is due to a combination of lower volume, less CapEx, and in some cases concession on terms as we\u2019ve leveraged our strong balance sheet to get more favorable discounts and pricings based simply on an ability to pay our bills on time. And supplier credit is always good to have and so were large discounts when you\u2019re able to achieve them. ", "So in total we\u2019ve seen turns improve from 4.8 to 5.2% which as Don has talked on previous calls is a tremendous source of cash flow.", "Finally last but not least for my piece a minute on our record gross margins of 41.3% and very strong operating margin of 14.4%, which hopefully this chart indicates is not a short term phenomenon. A lot of things going on to achieve this as well as the cash flow, especially within our core businesses. It\u2019s not happening on their own and what Jim\u2019s going to take you through is how SFS or the Stanley Fulfillment System are driving both margins and cash flow, as well as a little more granularity on SG&A. Jim\u2019s piece will show you that we\u2019re building our brand while still maintaining I think very good control over discretionary spending, and then a closer look into the segments. And Don\u2019s going to close with a look at some of the market trends that are affecting both our cash flow and our fourth quarter guidance.", "So let me turn it over to Jim Loree, our COO.", "James M. Loree", "", "Okay. We\u2019ll stay on the margin chart just for a minute here and I find this extremely encouraging considering the 16% volume decline and the 23% reduction in inventory. As John mentioned we closed out the quarter 41.3% gross margin and that\u2019s an all-time record for the company as he did mention, and the first time in my ten years that we\u2019ve been greater than 40% which is a big milestone. ", "And this was done at a time as I mentioned when the production volumes are down greater than 30% versus last year. And to expand a little bit on some of the key drivers, the strength of our value propositions has really enabled us to achieve solid price realization. And that\u2019s offset cumulative $440 million of inflation since 2004.", "The Stanley Fulfillment System is a key to this and transformational lean has been driving productivity in our factories and in our supply chain for quite some time. Business mix has also helped as Security\u2019s become a larger part of the portfolio. And of course the $370 million of cost cuts, a portion of those were in cost of goods sold and have helped enable us to deal with the steep volume declines while protecting our margins.", "And all this raises the obvious question is this sustainable? And there will be some headwinds going into 2010 as tools and storage mix is up and some of the cost cuts, probably about 25% or so, come back. But it\u2019s safe to assume that we\u2019re now operating in the neighborhood of 40% and that\u2019s what we expect to record for the year and I would expect that you can think of the company as a 40% gross margin company on a prospective basis.", "I mentioned the Stanley Fulfillment System. I want to spend a little more time on that. It involves four components. Let\u2019s start with the upper right, Sales and Operations Planning. This is simply keeping supply and demand in balance, so not making too many things when you don\u2019t need them. When volume is down you make less. When volume is up you make more. We have a phrase we have coined, sell one, replenish one. And the idea is to try to make every day what the customers need that day. We\u2019re not there yet, but that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going in and I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of keeping our inventories in check through a robust sales and operations planning process throughout the company.", "Now we\u2019ll move to the lower left, Transformational Lean. This is the implementation of lean in all our factory supply chains and back offices. Now many, many companies do lean and do this every day. I think the thing that differentiates us is that we actually have trademarked our Transformational Lean phrase because what we try do is to instead of just incrementalizing improvements we try to step back and say how can we change the business model utilizing lean to create a sustainable competitive advantage. And done that in a few cases, not throughout the company but that\u2019s starting to take effect. And the benefits from lean are felt every day in our productivity performance.", "Now moving to the lower right, Standardization of Processes and Platforms across the company to provide us with scalability. That\u2019s another important part of the Stanley Fulfillment System. ", "And then finally, the toughest nut to crack but the one that we\u2019re making some progress on now and we\u2019ve been at it a few years is this Complexity Reduction or Complexity Management. And this is all about simplifying every aspect of the business to drive profitability and asset efficiency. You can see that manifested in the results.", "Now move on to SG&A. The SG&A expenses are down 9% versus the prior year, but that doesn\u2019t tell the full story because when you net out the acquisitions we\u2019re really down 14%. You can see the $16 million increase from acquisitions. We\u2019ve also made $5 million worth of incremental investments in the third quarter, about $20 million annualized. Had a little inflation. Some benefit from foreign exchange. And then the actions totaling about $41 million have really enabled us to achieve that minus 14% performance in SG&A.", "And despite that reduction in SG&A, the company now is really aggressively building its brand up there globally. But let\u2019s start with the USA. It\u2019s playoff season. That means our major league baseball presence is at its strongest. Right now we are in three out of the four playoff teams in a very prominent way and we\u2019re starting to see some early evidence of increased aided brand awareness in a quantitative sense. And we\u2019ll have much more information on that as we close out the season and we\u2019ll probably share some of that with you at our analyst meeting in November.", "The next and newest area is our major thrust into global brand development. And we are sponsoring the English Premier League and International World Cup qualifiers with signage at the base of the perimeter of the field, electronic signage which comes up and is seen on TV and often seems to be prominent right at the time when goals are scored or people are watching. This is seen by more than 1 billion viewers per week and interestingly 40% of the impressions are actually from outside of Europe. And you can start to, when you talk to some of the Asian folks in our company, you can start to hear the buzz about what their customers are saying about the Stanley brand and the fact that they see it on football.", "Moving up to the upper left we\u2019re also moving aggressively into social media. Four months ago we had no presence on Facebook and Twitter. Today we have over 1,000 followers on Facebook and 800 or so on Twitter. And then finally I\u2019m pleased to invite you to surf our just upgraded IR website at StanleyWorks.com. And it\u2019s a very impressive piece of work.", "Now I\u2019m going to spend some time on the segments. Well Security once again was the gem of the quarter. Revenues were up marginally, up 3%. Organic growth was down slightly, down 6%. But segment profit was up in double digits and the profit rate exceeded 20% which was very, very impressive performance.", "Convergent, the electronic business, revenues were up 13%, organic was down 5% but recurring monthly revenue was up 5% organically. The profit rate was up 150 basis points over the prior year and even though the declines in installations slowed, the national account installations increased. And the CapEx constraints while not completely gone are starting to loosen. ", "The big news in mechanical access was the profit rate as well. They did a nice job on price realization, class reduction actions, etc. But the Stanley branded hardware rollout at a major North American retailer is well underway now, will be meaningful from a revenue perspective in the fourth quarter and next year. And the early signs at the point-of-sale are very encouraging. ", "Moving on to Industrial, the steep revenue declines took their toll on profitability in this segment during the quarter with organic growth down a staggering 30%, not unexpected but certainly a difficult story to deal with from a profitability perspective. And our costs in Industrial tend to come out a little bit more slowly than they do in the rest of the company because this is the most concentrated segment that we have in Europe where the cost take-outs take a little longer to manifest themselves. Segment profit was down 53% to $19 million and the profit rate was right around 9%, which is where it was in the second quarter as well. We believe this is kind of a trough area of segment profit rate for industrial and we\u2019ll talk a little bit about what we think is happening on a prospective basis in a minute.", "The inventory corrections continued to be a headwind. We expect them to continue perhaps at a slightly lower level into the fourth quarter. And then they should be gone by the first quarter as the Industrial buyers start buying in proportion to their production volume which is increasing now as we look at the economic statistics. ", "We\u2019ve divided the segment into two sub-segments for the purposes of describing it to you. It also happens to be the way we manage it at the company, Industrial and Automotive Repair Tools which is Facom and Proto on the left hand side in the lower left. Facom was down 27% in revenue but their new product development remains strong and the Facom products are also being cross-fertilized in some of the other areas such as Proto and Mac. I mentioned the European cost reductions and the lagging effect there. On Industrial and Automotive Supply, which is Mac, Vidmar and Supply and Services, the Mac profitability was encouraging. They did have double digit revenue declines but they made good progress from a profitability perspective.", "I think the good news when we step back from the overall segment is that the gross margin and the contribution margin rates are holding up. So we should as I said be in a trough here and positioned for strong leverage when the volume resumes, probably in the first quarter.", "Moving on to CDIY, from my perspective CDIY was a pleasant surprise this quarter. Volume was still anemic. You know revenues were down 23%, organic growth down 21% but the segment profit was down only 11%. And very encouraging was the segment profit rate resumed its expansion and is now hovering around 15%, up to 110 basis points over the prior year and also up 210 basis points versus second quarter.", "The organic revenue declined. We\u2019re seeing some early signs of stabilization as John alluded to and I think most encouraging here is that the Bostitch integration benefits, which yielded significant cost productivity gains in this segment, are taking hold. They\u2019re ahead of plan. Bostitch profitability is strong and improving and I think, knock on wood, that the long saga of Bostitch related profitability problems may be in the rearview mirror.", "And then finally, the wave of new product introductions that is taking place in this overall segment is going to be significant in the fourth quarter and is expected to accelerate our market share gains. So stay tuned. This strong, strong franchise is going to get even stronger with an array of new, exciting products in the fourth quarter. And on top of that, we have the intensifying brand support and brand strength that I talked about earlier. So we\u2019re very, very excited about the future here coming out of hopefully trough conditions in the marketplace.", "And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Don Allan who will take you through some more color on the segments.", "Donald Allan Jr.", "", "Thank you Jim. Page 16 is a new page we added this quarter which is a way for us to help communicate some of the key trends in the three different segments, both historical, and then some of our thoughts going forward here in the short term. ", "So if we start with the Security segment, which is on the left side of the chart, the top part of the chart gives a historical trend of the segment profit rate which is the line and then the bar graphs are the unit volume declines that we\u2019ve experienced in each segment. ", "So as we dive a little bit deeper into Security and start with the convergent business, convergent revenues as you know from installations has been down but we believe its likely bottomed out in the second quarter. And we also think that attrition peaked in the second quarter as well. And we\u2019re beginning to experience some stabilization in our order rates in the convergent business which is a positive sign.", "One thing that we\u2019ve discussed in previous calls is commercial construction and some of the delayed and abandoned projects that we\u2019ve seen. That continues to be a headwind. But the good news in that particular story is that it\u2019s still more of a delayed situation versus an abandonment of projects. And as long as that continues, that trend, then we believe that we\u2019ll be able to continue to show modest declines and eventually growth in this segment over time.", "Focusing on commercial construction as an impact to our company, as many of you know from the end market charts that we provided in the past, it\u2019s important to remind you that commercial construction is only 15% of our Security segment and only slightly greater than 10% of the total company. So even though we are experiencing a little bit of headwind there, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that it\u2019s not a very significant portion of our total company.", "And last but certainly not least, as Jim mentioned in the previous slides, the profit rate accretion in Security has been a very good story considering the declining volume environment we experienced over the last seven quarters where we\u2019ve gone from a 16% segment profit rate in the first quarter of \u201908 up to almost 21% in this particular third quarter. And that\u2019s really all those actions Jim mentioned around pricing with our customers, cost actions and then as some benefit of deflation in commodities, and in particular mechanical Security business. ", "Shifting to Industrial in the middle of the page, clearly Industrial proven in this particular set of businesses is lagging behind CDIY in particular and obviously Security. And as [inaudible] we continue to see improvement in Industrial production data, which is showing positive growth and moderating signs. However, our business does lag those indicators and we would expect that we would eventually feel that positive impact as that trend continues, likely in early 2010.", "The inventory corrections have clearly been significant throughout the year and will likely continue at a modest pace in the fourth quarter of \u201909. ", "We believe the profit rate has stabilized but we would expect improvement in that profit rate to be likely in the fourth quarter, as many of the cost actions will be completed in our European operations and we do believe that those inventory corrections will abate.", "Last but certainly not least is the CDIY segment. As you can see, Jim mentioned this, that the operating margin rate or the profit rate has gone to 14.8%. So it went from the bottom at 6.4% in the fourth quarter of last year and has really kind of emerged back to very normalized levels for this segment, or very close to normalized levels.", "But economic conditions continue to be a little tough in this area, although we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of positive signs. In particular, the U.S. housing starts have stabilized. We believe they\u2019ve bottomed out. Consumer confidence is improving in both the U.S. and the Euro region in comparison to the second quarter of this year. And as a result, you\u2019re seeing the impact in our revenues as our revenues are flattening out on a sequential basis when you look at the second and the third quarter. And we would expect that trend to likely continue into the fourth quarter. We do expect to experience some modest revenue growth in the beginning of 2010 or the first quarter of 2010 if these trends continue. ", "And last but certainly not least that significant profit rate as I mentioned is largely due to the CT&S and Bostitch integration that Jim discussed. So we feel like that\u2019s a nice summary of our three segments and key trends based on history and then some thoughts going forward. ", "Moving to free cash flow which was a really nice story this quarter, our third quarter free cash flow exceeded prior year levels and that was while our continuing ops earnings was actually down from $78 million to $62 million or 21%. Another item to focus on here is working capital. As John mentioned earlier, a very nice working capital performance where we had a positive working capital benefit and cash flow of $32 million when we had a 20% unit volume decline in the same quarter.", "One thing I want to point out here is the other line. If you look at last year, John had mentioned that the sale of CST, there\u2019s a gain of $84 million that\u2019s showing as a negative in other last year and also the taxes paid on that of about $34 million, which is really driving that. And the total of that is close $120 million of a negative out flow. So if you remove that, it\u2019s a slight positive and its more in line with the $25 million positive that we saw in the third quarter of this year.", "CapEx continues to be a good story as we continue to control where we\u2019re spending our money and make sure we\u2019re spending it efficiently. And we\u2019re tracking to that $85 million number for the year and on pace for that.", "So the end result is free cash flow of $158 million versus $103 last year, which is a 50% improvement year-over-year with earnings being down 21%. ", "As I mentioned on the last quarter call, we have set a guidance of $300 million of free cash flow for the year. And at that point in time we were at about $1 million of free cash flow year-to-date. Now we\u2019re at $183 million, which would be a little more than 60% of that $300 million previous guidance we have provided. Based on the work that we\u2019re doing in working capital and all the different efforts around SFS, we actually think that we can exceed $300 million this year. And that would be consistent with some of our historical trends if you look back through three quarters. We tend to be anywhere between 57% or 65% through three quarters in comparison to the annual objective.", "Moving to the balance sheet, it continues to be a positive story for us. As many of you know we\u2019ve been focused on de-leveraging our balance sheet this year. Our goal we established was $200 million of a debt reduction or de-leveraging goal. We\u2019ve achieved $161 million of that through three quarters so we feel like we\u2019re tracking very nicely to that objective. And our debt to capital ratio is now down [audio impairment] which sequentially improved where it was at 46% in the second quarter. And when you adjusted for our equity and debt hybrid instruments, its now 31% to 33%, which again is an improvement from the second quarter where it was at 34 to 37%. And we feel very good about our de-leveraging plan and how we\u2019re on track in that regard.", "The next page is an update on guidance. As all of you have seen we have increased our guidance compared to July, so what I\u2019d like to do is just walk through some of the changes in that guidance. On the left side of the page, our July guidance was a range of EPS of $2.34 to $2.84, which was a $0.50 range. What was driving the bulk of that range was [audio impairment] assumption, which we assumes a negative 18 to a negative 20% at that timeframe for the year. We are starting in the start with our midpoint to that range, which is $2.59. That implied guidance assumption of about a negative 19% unit volume, which is what we\u2019re currently estimating for the year.", "If we take our gross margin rate improvement that John and Jim both talked about earlier, we believe that for the year we will be approximately 40% gross margin. And in July I indicated that we thought for the second half of the year we would be somewhere between 38% and 39%. So now we believe we\u2019re going to be above 40% in the second half. And its really being driven by all of the things that were articulated earlier around price, productivity, around cost, deflation and etc. So we feel positive about that going forward. ", "The last item is what we call Other, which is several different things. Clearly we\u2019ve benefited from FX as the weaker U.S. dollar versus some of the major currencies that are prominent in our world such as the euro and the Great Britain pound. But we also think that we could have potentially lower restructuring and slightly lower taxes as well as we close out the year.", "I will point out that the restructuring we\u2019ve provided, the guidance is about $45 million the previous call. We expect it to be probably somewhere to be between $40 and $45 million so it won\u2019t be significantly lower than that number.", "So the end result is a current guidance range of $2.84 to $2.94. If you exclude the gain on the debt extinguishment, that means its $2.50 to $2.60, which is an increase from the $2 and $2.50 that we provided in July. ", "Moving to free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier we expect to exceed $300 million in free cash flow. And that\u2019s really due primarily to two things as you can see on the chart here. First our improved earnings outlook, which is about $0.25 to $0.35 EPS. And then our continued belief that we will be able to exceed prior year working capital levels. In the fourth quarter of \u201908 we achieved 5.9 working capital turns and we still feel that we will be able to achieve in excess of 6 working capital turns by the end of this year, which is all being driven by the Stanley Fulfillment System and the process controls that we\u2019ve put in place as Jim articulated earlier on this call.", "So in summary, we feel like we\u2019re well positioned to continue to gain market share. We\u2019ve made investments as you know around our brand and in some cases advertising. We continue to invest in new product development and increase our direct to customer interactions in the Security segment in particular to really drive those results.", "We\u2019re seeing modest signs of sequential improvement which are encouraging and particularly in Security and CDIY. Industrial is lagging, but we do believe is 2010 begins that that segment will begin to improve. And operating margins are on track and remain strong for the full year. And as Jim mentioned, we do feel that we\u2019ve established a new line around gross margin, what we think we\u2019re now a 40% gross margin company.", "And then last but certainly not least, we continue to be dedicated to our ongoing success of SFS, both as a source of cash as well as a competitive advantage.", "Kate White", "Sarah we\u2019re ready for questions whenever you are.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Peter Lisnic.", "Peter Lisnic", "", "I guess first question on CDIY is if you look at it in dollar terms, $100 million decline in revenue and operating income only down $6 or $7 million, can you give us some color commentary on exactly how that\u2019s occurring in terms of the structuring savings, mix and price? Because that would seem like you know things are holding up a lot better than I thought they would be in that volume pressure.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, Pete, things are holding up better than you might think in terms of the volume pressure. The biggest driver, Jim touched on it and didn\u2019t get much more granular than we intend to. The biggest driver is improvement within the Bostitch business. We talked about you know our intent when we started a massive improvement effort on Stanley Bostitch to take it up maybe 100 basis points a quarter for eight quarters to get it back to double-digit operating margins. We were well on the way a year-and-a-half ago with that program when Bostitch was the business within Stanley hit the hardest by the both Industrial and the domestic housing downturn. ", "We made the decision this time last year to basically combine the CDIY and Bostitch business, excuse me the CT&S, our consumer tools and storage, and Bostitch business which in retrospect was a good decision and we knew it was. Not only because we took a lot of cost out, you know business running separately that we were running as part of a CT&S business but it really reinvigorated the product development program, the focus on margin, added some rhythms to a business and both at the customer level and internally. That\u2019s had a tremendous impact. We don\u2019t intend to get in the margin by business because we found that you know all that by sub-segment, all that really does is creates more questions than it raises. But we have Bostitch back to historically I\u2019ll say high or it\u2019s [wide] average profitability level. That in and of itself is 70% of the improvement.", "Jim may want to add a little more granularity to it.", "James M. Loree", "Think Bostitch improvement within CDIY, Pete, and that\u2019s the big one.", "Donald Allan Jr.", "And I\u2019ll just address the other 30%, and its really a combination of all the things I talked about extensively on that gross margin page. You know the Stanley Fulfillment System, the transformational lean, the price inflation recovery and all of those elements. As well as there may be some minor mix in CDIY as well with the Bostitch improvement.", "John F. Lundgren", "", "And I\u2019ll just follow up so you can get in your follow without getting cut off. We\u2019ve talked about SFS. We\u2019ve talked about it a lot because our consumer tools and storage business was a large, well managed, global business with a global platform. They were 12 to 18 months ahead of the rest of Stanley in terms of truly implementing SFS. The S1R1 to which Jim referred. And so we\u2019ve gained more traction quicker in that business and of course the Bostitch business has benefited from that as well.", "Peter Lisnic", "", "A follow up question on pricing, again a plus to this quarter and plus all year. How sustainable is that? You know what piece of that is just related to unrecovered commodity costs that you\u2019ve incurred in the past versus new products and you know proactive pricing policies, I guess?", "James M. Loree", " ", "Most of the 2 points is carryover. If you recall we had a big surge in inflation in the middle of last year. It was in third quarter of last year that we really aggressively implemented price increases to cover that inflation and we\u2019ve benefited from those in the fourth quarter of last year and the first three quarters of this year. But we\u2019re going to start to see the price realization kind of adding back to a more normalized level. It may be up 0 to 1%, something like that. And most of that will be in all likelihood in the businesses that incur some sort of commodity inflation. And we have a mixed bag there with different businesses. ", "And as you can imagine, with all the different commodity fluctuations that go on, if steel goes up you know the nail business is affected more dramatically than say the Security business. So you can\u2019t really predict which segment it might occur in. But we will continue to price to our value proposition and continue to price to recover inflation as and if it occurs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sam Darkatsh.", "Sam Darkatsh", "Jim in your prepared remarks you mention that in 2010 a number of the discretionary cost cuts that you made in \u201909 and would likely be coming back. Can you help quantify that a little bit? And would that entirely be on the OpEx line?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, it would entirely be in the OpEx line. And you know there was $370 million of total cost improvements that were implemented. And of the $370, it\u2019s our collective view here that about $100 million or so is likely to come back you know at some point. Whether they all come back next year or not we\u2019ll see. But there are things like discretionary cuts where we may have cut travel by pick a number 40%, and maybe we\u2019ll let 20% of that you know come back, because we have the volume to compensate for it.", "But that said we\u2019ve changed a lot of our practices related to areas and you know T&E is a good example where today we have implemented extensively Telepresence, Cisco\u2019s Telepresence. And you know that\u2019s providing us a structural cost reduction in T&E so we don\u2019t expect all of the T&E cuts for example to come back. And I think there\u2019s many other stories like that you know as we look at the cost cutting.", "In addition to that we\u2019ve made several structural changes in our various businesses and John already talked at length about the Bostitch and CT&S integration. That\u2019s not coming back. You know that\u2019s a permanent change. We also made some changes in the Industrial business where we combined and you saw the subsets and when I was going through the Industrial page we combined the management of Focom and Proto and we combined the management of Mac, supply and services in Vidmar. And those changes aren\u2019t coming back. So we feel very comfortable that approximately 25% or so of the cost cuts will come back in successive years. And I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll all be next year but that\u2019s the way I would think about it.", "Sam Darkatsh", "And then where you look at raw materials right now, assuming it\u2019s essentially flat on a go forward basis, what is the 2010 versus 2009 variance look like from a raw materials standpoint?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "We\u2019ve gotten to a stage where we have some pluses and some minuses but we\u2019re not looking at any significant deflation or inflation at this time.", "Donald Allan Jr.", "", "And I\u2019ll add, Sam, to Jim\u2019s point that he made during his prepared remarks, whatever benefit or I guess it was actually my prepared remarks, we obviously do this as a pretty collaborative effort. What we benefited this year from raw materials deflation and you know us well enough that 60 to 70% of our raw materials are steel, then its non-ferrous metals, plastic resin, etc. What we benefited from we\u2019ve more than lost in volume absorption or lack thereof. So you know what\u2019s going to affect our margins as much or more than the inflation pricing hedge or arbitrage you know is where volumes settle out next year relative to this year.", "But I think we\u2019ve gotten much better at responding quickly to inflationary pressure in terms of our pricing. Jim\u2019s words, and they\u2019re the right ones, were you know pricing to be paid for our value proposition. And where we don\u2019t think we have a value proposition to shrink or get out of those businesses as quickly as we can.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nigel Coe.", "", "Nigel Coe", "You\u2019ve talked about the CDIY margins in some length already, but just interested to get your perspective. You talked about this being sort of a mid-teen, 15% type margin business but given that Bostitch is back on track, you\u2019ve got also some SFS coming through, if you recapture that [inaudible] volume drop, do you think margins will be sort of more towards the high teens going forward?", "John F. Lundgren", "", "We\u2019re not going to forecast margins by segment, Nigel. By now you should know that your question is a logical one and a fair one. We\u2019ve just got a lot of history that says forecasting margins by segment and sub-segment, we\u2019re never rewarded for it when we get it right or exceed it and we\u2019re punished for it when we don\u2019t. It\u2019s not good for us internally or externally. It\u2019s why we have three distinct segments that we think gives us some internal diversification, so your observations are logical but we\u2019re simply not going to go there.", "Nigel Coe", "", "Then maybe just going a little bit closer to home. You know you talk about the Industrial cost savings in 4Q. Can you maybe just quantify those? And I\u2019m assuming that they will be sufficient to get you back into the double digits in 4Q.", "James M. Loree", "You\u2019re looking for a quantification of the Industrial cost savings in the fourth quarter that might be incremental to what was in the third quarter? Is that the question?", "Donald Allan Jr.", "", "Because of the European action.", "James M. Loree", "Oh, yes. It would be difficult to put an exact number on that but you know I would say that the cost reductions we implemented were roughly distributed equivalently across the three segments. Security was a little bit less than CDIY and Industrial. So on a proportionate basis you know the $370 was allocated essentially that way. And so it\u2019s fair to say that if Industrial is you know pick a number, 25% of the revenues roughly, then 25% of the $370 applies to Industrial and you can assume that probably about you know 10 to 20% of that is yet to be materialized.", "Donald Allan Jr.", "And Nigel we know you\u2019re not going to get to ask a follow up. That\u2019s just the way the process works. But to just elaborate a little further, the other point being 50% of our business in Europe is Industrial. So some of the costs will come back as Jim referred to. But some of the cost actions we\u2019ve taken as you understand well, it does take longer to realize the benefits of those cost actions in Europe. So there\u2019s as large a benefit but a meaningful delay in [audio impairment]. That will provide a little bit of an offset to the costs coming back. So we\u2019re looking for sequential improvement.", "James M. Loree", "And just to be clear about my math, if we say 25% of $400 is $100, then you know 10 to 20 of that might actually be yet to be realized, you know we\u2019re talking $10 to $20 million. That\u2019s annualized so you\u2019d have to divide it by 4. So that\u2019s probably roughly ballpark what you could expect there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard.", "Eric Bosshard", "I have two questions. First of all, I understand not projecting margins by segment, but getting to that 20% margin in Security, that was a long, long ago projection so it\u2019s nice to see that number achieved after the long ride.", "James M. Loree", "", "Well we took a lot of heat for like four or five years which is why John said what he said.", "Eric Bosshard", "The two questions that I have, first of all you talked bullishly about the CDIY volumes and that you saw improvement across a number of regions, the U.S. volumes I think in CDIY were identical, the year-over-year decline was identical, 3Q as it was in 2Q. And you mentioned in your script that you thought actually you could have some growth out of that segment in the first quarter, so I\u2019d love to get a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in terms of the improvement there. And should we see improvement in 4Q? And then secondly, can you just talk about the incremental cost saves that you should achieve in 2010 from the programs that have been implemented over the last nine months.", "John F. Lundgren", " ", "If we start with the CDIY question, as I mentioned in that particular chart you know we\u2019re clearly seeing a stabilization effect in that particular business. And even some modest improvements. And its really being driven by the two economic factors that I mentioned in the U.S. as well as in Europe. So as we look at the business going forward, you know we don\u2019t expect a dramatic improvement in the fourth quarter around revenue. There could be a slight improvement due to some new products roll outs in that particular quarter. But at this point in time we\u2019re not anticipating that.", "But in the first quarter we do expect to see some modest improvement in growth in that particular segment because we will first of all have anniversaried a lot of the significant declines. And its under the presumption that these economic conditions have stabilized around housing starts and consumer confidence in particular. And we\u2019ll begin to see very modest growth rates there.", "The second question was around carryover effect I believe. As Jim mentioned you know we do have about $100 million of cost carryover into next year. And so we had $370 million of costs that were executed on, $265 are 2009 [audio impairment]. And then about $100 [audio impairment] or more [audio impairment]. The real question is how much of that will be sustained and Jim gave a lot of feedback [audio impairment]. Over time, which he was referring more to long term, 25% of that will probably creep back into the system. That does not mean in 2010 that $100 million of costs will creep back into the system to offset the carryover effect that we expect to experience. [Audio impairment] estimate for 2010 that you know we would be able to maintain anywhere from 50% to 75% of that carryover in 2010.", "Kate White", "", "Sarah, we can move to the next person.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Zener.", "Kenneth Zener", "I wonder if you could comment on Security integration, to maintain your growing share and how that relates to you know the people you\u2019ve acquired so your feet on the street approach,  your market share enhancement and if that really did impact smaller accounts.", "James M. Loree", "I think I understand your question, Ken. Let\u2019s start with we\u2019ve made one mid-sized acquisition in the last two years and it\u2019s going extraordinarily well. We at this stage would regard Sonitrol and HSM as fully integrated and functioning as a very cohesive unit under Brett Bontrager\u2019s and Tony [Barley\u2019s] direction. You know producing nice margins, doing a good job on national accounts, as you know we have a very strong presence in retail. Retailers in general are under a lot of pressure so when a retailer goes out of business the objective is to get more than our fair share of re-signs, which we are doing and doing a pretty good job at. So we\u2019re maintaining or gaining share with national accounts and Tony\u2019s team\u2019s doing a real nice job with some of the smaller businesses, you know rolling them up and gaining share at the local level.", "In Europe, the GDP acquisition hasn\u2019t a full year anniversary yet. I can say that\u2019s going very well at the same time. As we\u2019ve mentioned on previous calls, our Security business in Europe is relatively small. It was UK centric. We\u2019ve inherited an extraordinarily capable management team with GDP, a management team that was interested in carrying on with Stanley. And they\u2019ve done a very, very nice job leveraging their strong market position and gaining share, primarily in France and Belgium where they\u2019re a strong number two in the marketplace as well as expanding across borders. So I hope that gets at the question you were asking.", "Kenneth Zener", "", "And then could you talk about the contribution from the load in or sales that you expect as the hardware reloads and how that can impact 2010 organic?", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure. We\u2019re happy to do that. Go ahead Jim.", "James M. Loree", "Ken, you may not recall because I don\u2019t think you were following us at the time, maybe you were, February \u201907 analyst meeting we talked extensively about the loss of a major customer in the hardware business which actually cost us over $50 million of lost revenue. And we indicated at the time that we would pursue other customers because we really believe in the strong brand pull and user demand for Stanley hardware in the marketplace. And so we indicated at the time we thought for various reasons we weren\u2019t going to recover anytime soon with the customer we lost the business with that we thought we would pursue other customers, and in fact committed at the time to replace at least 50% of the lost revenue over the coming years. And as it turns out I think this program that we\u2019re implementing right now with about 300 stores into it and has about 1,400 to go next year, annualized it should have an impact of greater than $30 million and next year probably three-quarters of that.", "John F. Lundgren", "So simply said we\u2019ve replaced more than 60% of the lost business and we think in due course we will have replaced it all. But its going to take another year or so to get us there.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Michael Rehaut.", "Michael Rehaut", "", "The first question just and I know you don\u2019t get into you know forecasting by segment, but more just trying to get a sense of timing if you will. You know when you look at the CDIY improvement and you know certainly a good portion of that from Bostitch but also from your you know productivity in SFS, etc., you know I would assume obviously you\u2019re doing a lot in the industrial segment as you\u2019ve been mentioning as well, can you give us a sense of timing in terms of perhaps when you might expect those cost saves you\u2019ve mentioned that you would expect them to bear fruit in 4Q, but are we looking at like a 12 month or 24 month improvement? Or maybe even shorter than 12 months, given the solid improvement that we\u2019ve seen in CDIY?", "Donald Allan Jr.", "Mike, this is Don. I\u2019ll be happy to answer that question. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, our cost programs have been fully executed except for the European actions and some small actions in our CT&S and Bostitch integration. We would expect by the end of this year 2009 that all the European actions will be complete and behind us. And Jim mentioned that you know on an annualized basis those actions in Europe probably add up to about $20, $25 million on an annualized basis.", "So by the end of this year those cost actions will be complete and behind us. And what I was referring to earlier for 2010, around $100 million of carryover, that would be the carryover costs of all the actions that we completed this year. And that\u2019s specifically what I was referring to.", "Michael Rehaut", "And just a second question, you know on the new product rollout that you\u2019ve mentioned. You know earlier in the presentation you talked about you believe it\u2019s going to be a very positive impact, market share gains, etc., a wave of new products and I think I heard towards the end of the presentation perhaps Don you had been talking about more of a slight improvement from new product rollouts. So I\u2019m just trying to maybe reconcile those two comments and trying to get a sense of what actually you\u2019re expecting in terms of a contribution to sale growth.", "John F. Lundgren", "Mike, this is John. I guess two things. As you know because you\u2019ve followed us a long time, we have a tried, tested and proven, steadfast, etched in stone rule. We don\u2019t talk about or show a new product to the investment community until our customers have seen it. That\u2019s served us well over time. And that won\u2019t change. You\u2019ve been invited to and hope you can make our we think very comprehensive analyst meeting on November 17 in New York where our business heads, specifically Jeff Ansell, Brett Bontrager, Justin Boswell and Jim and three of his leaders in the Industrial segment will be talking about all of their products. Then you\u2019ll actually be able to see them because we will have presented them to the customers. We intend to have a vitality index that stays above 25%. ", "And the reason I couldn\u2019t answer your question even if I wanted to, you know that\u2019s what\u2019s new, how much of it is incremental, we were very pleasantly surprised when we introduced FatMax Xtreme as a good example, going back a year or two, that far less of the Xtreme volume cannibalized FatMax. So in fact that was a much bigger lift on a net basis than we\u2019d anticipated. We have no way to predict that at this stage so I couldn\u2019t answer your question if I wanted to other than historically. You know we\u2019ve had as much as $70 million on an annual basis of revenue growth from new products. The question is that\u2019s never 100% incremental. Its how much of its cannibalized and it remains to be seen.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. We now turn the call back over to you, Miss White.", "Kate White", "We want to thank everybody for participating in our call and our webcast today. As I said at the beginning of the call if you\u2019ve any questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out to me.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.", "It is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Mark Rothleitner, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please begin.", "", "Mark M. Rothleitner", "", "Thank you operator. Good morning and welcome to Black & Decker\u2019s third quarter conference call. On today\u2019s call are Chief Financial Officer Steve Reeves and I will discuss our third quarter results and outlook for the remainder of 2009. Our comments should take about 15 minutes and then we\u2019ll answer your questions.", "In keeping with SEC requirements I advise that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the Black & Decker Corporation, please review the reports we have filed with SEC, including the 8-K filed today. ", "In addition, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of SEC Regulation G. A reconciliation of the differences between these measures with the most directly comparable financial measures, calculated in accordance with GAAP, is in included on the corporation\u2019s website under the Investor Relations section.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "", "Thanks Mark. This morning Black & Decker announced diluted earnings per share of $0.91 for the third quarter. This was consistent with the update we gave last week and well above our initial guidance of $0.35 to $0.45. Of the roughly $0.50 of improvement, $0.14 related to favorable tax adjustments. A smaller portion of the outperformance came from early shipments of promotional items in the U.S. More than half was driven by other favorability in operating margin.", "Return on sales was 7.5% for the quarter versus the 5% or so implied in our July guidance. This primarily reflected lower SG&A from ongoing cost control, volume leverage and better productivity, and [commode] cost of inflation than we projected. ", "Sales were down 23%, reflecting 21% lower organic volume, 1% positive price and a 3% unfavorable impact from currency translation. The decline was approximately four points better than our initial guidance, and primarily related to early shipments of promotional items and favorable currency. We are not yet seeing a recovering demand but continue to see stabilization.", "Net cash generation was $256 million for the third quarter and $368 million year-to-date. Despite lower earnings, cash generation is nearly $100 million ahead of last year\u2019s pace. ", "Inventory is consistent with the second quarter level and down $231 million since the end of 2008. Capital expenditures also remained below the prior year, but we continue to invest appropriately in our new product road.", "Our outstanding cash generation positioned us well, with strong liquidity and better debt metrics. We have no long term debt payments due until 2011 and the full $1 billion short term facility available at quarter end.", "Now let me discuss our businesses in more detail. Sales in the worldwide Power Tools and Accessories segment decreased 21% for the quarter. In the U.S. industrial products group, sales decreased more than 20%. Sharp year-on-year declines in both residential and commercial construction continue to affect all key product lines and channels.", "The independent channel, with greater exposure to commercial construction, has been particularly hard hit. This ongoing trend was partly offset by sales of promotional items that we had expected to ship in the fourth quarter. Even without those orders, however, the business saw some sequential improvement from the second quarter.", "And as we have discussed before, this fall we are launching a new line of DeWalt compact lithium ion tools, improving our position in a key segment in the cordless market. ", "The U.S. consumer products group saw a sales decline of approximately 20% for the quarter. This is well below the second quarter performance as we had expected, largely due to a much smaller outdoor season. Our Porter Cable line of tradesmen tools continued to do well, but not enough to offset the impact of continued weak demand in the core tools category.", "In addition, we did not pursue some low margin business and discontinued several SKUs in another portfolio. While that put a little pressure on our top line, our focus on cost and improved mix has helped this business deliver much better profitability in 2009 than last year. ", "We have a strong holiday lineup of new products including the innovative Flex Canister Vac, user friendly Smart Select tools and the versatile Ready Wrench. ", "In the European Power Tools and Accessories business, sales decreased by more than 20%. Sequentially sales were similar to the second quarter level but against [year\u2019s] comparison. The consumer business had a slightly smaller rate of year-on-year decline than the industrial business. As we have discussed in recent quarters, this market suffered double-digit declines with another drop of nearly 50% in Eastern Europe.", "In other regions, results were mixed. Sales in Canada fell approximately 30%, largely reflecting economic pressure. Latin American sales were down mid single digits, but sequentially improved versus the second quarter. Strong growth in the Southern Cone mitigated the decline in the northern part of the region as most [tied] to the U.S. economy. In the Asia-Pacific region, tool sales increased with gains in India and Australia.", "Return on sales for the Power Tools and Accessories business was flat to the prior year, 7.6% this quarter. Gross margin improved due to positive price, restructuring savings and component cost deflation. This offset a higher SG&A percentage on lower sales volume. We continued to reduce SG&A spending both year-on-year and sequentially.", "In our Hardware and Home Improvement segment, sales decreased 17% for the quarter. Locks and faucet businesses in the U.S. posted similar rates of decline.

", "Sales to channels serving new construction were down but much less than housing starts have fallen. Sales at retail also decreased at a larger rate of decline at higher price points. In the Price Pfister faucet business, sales for the new construction channel were down over 30%, in line with the housing starts trend. At retail this business experienced both lower remodeling demand and cautious reorders by customers.", "Operating margin for the Hardware and Home Improvement segment increased 160 basis points to 12.9%. Gross margin continued to improve, primarily reflecting lower commodity prices and better productivity.", "SG&A spending was down in most categories, partly offset by investment in the SmartKey media campaign. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased due to volume de-leveraging. ", "In the Fastening and Assembly System segment sales decreased 24%, with similar declines in the global automotive and industrial divisions. Sales declined double-digits in all geographic regions and key product lines. While our sales of automotive fasteners were generally in line with auto production trends, the industry has cut back dramatically on capital for new assembly systems. The 2008 acquisition of [Spiral Lock] contributed 2 points of sales growth for the quarter. The segment\u2019s results were modestly above our expectations, however, and a solid improvement from the second quarter. This was driven by a sequential gain of more than 25% in the North American automotive business as vehicle production rates rose from the depressed levels of the front half.", "Operating margin for the Fastening segment fell to 9.3% for the quarter. Gross margin and SG&A percentage both deteriorated year-on-year, primarily due to lower volume. The improvement in operating margin from 5.8% in the second quarter reflects modest volume leverage and continued cost actions. As we have expressed in the past, this business is more vertically integrated than our other segments and margins should recover more quickly with volume.", "", "Now we\u2019ll review the financials in a little more detail. As I mentioned earlier, sales were down 23% to $1.2 billion for the quarter, including 3% of negative currency. Gross margin was 33.1% for the quarter, 70 basis points above the prior year. We continued to benefit from positive price, restructuring savings, component cost deflation and productivity initiatives. In addition the fixed cost absorption pressure we experienced in the first half has largely subsided.", "SG&A decreased $64 million or 17% including 4 points of currency. Consistent with the first half trend, expenses decreased in each segment and across all major categories. Because volume fell more sharply, our SG&A percentage increased 180 basis points. In absolute terms, SG&A was up modestly from the second quarter, in part due to planned promotional spending and currency.", "As noted earlier, we benefited from an 18% tax rate compared to 22% last year and the 30% rate that we had expected. This reflected the net effect of certain favorable tax adjustments based on resolved items or new facts. As we have indicated in the past, these adjustments can cause significant variability either favorable or unfavorable in our quarterly tax rate.

The restructuring initiatives we have undertaken in the past two years generated over $20 million of savings in the third quarter and we continue to expect over $75 million for the full year.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to discuss interest expense, cash flow and the balance sheet.", "Mark M. Rothleitner", "Thanks Steve. Interest expense of $22 million was a little below the second quarter and our expectations, partly due to strong cash flow. It remains above the prior year due to the bond issuance early in the second quarter. ", "Other expense was fairly typical this quarter but unfavorable compared to a gain on the sale of an asset in the prior year. ", "It was another very good quarter for cash as we described earlier. Year-to-date net cash generation increased to $368 million, well above net income. The primary driver of the high conversion level is still outstanding working capital performance.", "Inventory is down year-on-year more than sales and remains in line with our demand forecast. By taking aggressive inventory actions in the second quarter, we\u2019ve subsequently been able to match production more closely with sales. As we resumed a more normal level of raw material intake, payables have increased, resulting in further cash flow benefit in the quarter.", "Due to strong cash flow, net debt was down nearly $350 million year-to-date to just over $900 million. Our cash balance of $822 million and $1 billion short term line give us a very healthy liquidity position.", "Now Steve will discuss the outlook for the rest of 2009.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Thanks Mark. Looking forward to the fourth quarter we expect stabilization will continue in most of our markets. However, there remains significant economic risks including the weak employment picture entering the holiday season. ", "In a typical year our fourth quarter sales should be higher than in the third quarter. As I described earlier, we have a strong new product lineup for the quarter, including several consumer giftable items. However, taking into consideration the early promotional shipments we mentioned earlier, we expect our fourth quarter sales dollars to be similar to the third quarter. This will result in a year-on-year decline of approximately 12%, including approximately 3 points of favorable currency.", "For the full year this would mean a sales decline of approximately 23%, including 3 points of unfavorable currency. Turning to operating margins, we believe that the 7.5% margin we achieved in the third quarter is sustainable in the fourth. While promotional expense is expected to be higher during the holiday season, we continue to make progress on other cost initiatives. This will represent a year-on-year improvement driven by component cost deflation and productivity.", "We expect interest expense of roughly $23 million in the fourth quarter, up slightly from the third quarter due to the number of days. The diluted share count should still be around 60 million shares. While our quarterly tax rate can vary we are projecting a rate of roughly 30% for the fourth quarter. In total we are increasing our diluted EPS guidance to a range of $0.68 to $0.78 for the fourth quarter and $2.45 to $2.55 for the full year, excluding restructuring charges.", "Based on performance year-to-date we are also raising our outlook for net cash generation to over $400 million. Our top priority for cash is still to reduce net debt, but our cash performance improves our ability to pursue small bolt-on acquisitions as well. An important goal of the corporation is to preserve our investment grade ratings so we plan to bolster our debt metrics further before resuming share repurchases.", "In summary, Black & Decker delivered solid profitability this quarter and is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery. We delivered margins and EPS well above the July guidance. We continued to reduce SG&A in capital spending while funding key new products and marketing initiatives. We launched a number of strong new products with more to come in the fourth quarter. We managed working capital effectively, reducing the balance both sequentially and year-on-year. We generated $368 million of cash year-to-date, improving our liquidity position and financial flexibility.", "Black & Decker\u2019s team of associates has done a great job of focusing on what\u2019s important and delivering results in a tough environment.

Through this year, obviously a very difficult year, Latin America and Asia in particular have held up a little bit better than North America and Europe, so by our estimates those other regions as they\u2019re typically listed in your filings might end up being you know 16% or even higher of your sales. So I just wanted to understand you know the kind of drivers of that. And looking ahead can we expect after the economy does begin to recover that those areas will continue to be a more important part of your business? Or do you think those changes are just temporary?", "Stephen F. Reeves", " ", "Well I think in terms of what the drivers are I think they\u2019re largely you know macroeconomic, although in certain cases you know we are increasing our presence and/or opening new channels of distribution. If you look at Latin America, it\u2019s really two separate economies. If you look at the northern part of Latin America for us, the Caribbean and Mexico, both relatively strongly influenced by the U.S. economy and are down compared to last year. Whereas in the south in Brazil and the Andean countries they, you know sales growth is up. And that\u2019s both a function of better macroeconomics as well as us penetrating you know new channels of distribution.", "In Asia, I think as you look at that business we had I had mentioned Australia and India specifically in my prepared remarks, Australia was a listings gains that we got at a major retailer. But in India it was more of us capitalizing on the investments we\u2019re making in that developing region and further you know penetrating that market. So it\u2019s both a function of the better macroeconomics as well as I think some delivered investment on our part to grow in those particular regions.", "As we go forward, they continue to be an important focal part for us and I think as I\u2019ve mentioned in the context of you know areas where we\u2019re looking at doing bolt-on, small bolt-on acquisitions, you know a lot of those international markets remain very attractive to us.", "Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank", "", "Next question I wanted to ask was about your debt structure and your cash balance that you\u2019ve built up. Your gross debt load hasn\u2019t decreased during the past year or so. Obviously you\u2019ve paid down your line and your next maturity I think you mentioned is in 2011. On the other side of the balance sheet, obviously you\u2019ve built up a pretty significant cash balance. So since debt repurchases are a priority obviously protecting your investment grade rating, what\u2019s the mechanism going to be to bring the debt down? And you know how are you going to balance that against the need to maintain liquidity through what could be a continued difficult environment? And obviously they need to some bolt-ons as well.", "Stephen F. Reeves", " ", "Sure. Yes. As you said we don\u2019t have any near term maturities so we have that luxury to continue to evaluate this. Talking to your first question is a lot of our bolt-ons we\u2019re looking at international regions, with some of that cash being offshore that will be useful in terms of pursuing those types of acquisitions. And we\u2019ll evaluate whether there\u2019s opportunities to effectively reduce our gross debt and maybe Mark could speak to the mechanics which we could consider on those lines.", "Mark M. Rothleitner", "Sure. Everything is under evaluation this year, but certainly an opportunity to think about paying debt early sometime before the [audio impairment] the 11th. You also are aware that we have some term loans. So not planning to do anything at this point except build cash, but those are options that we\u2019ll think about during the coming 12 months or so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse", "", "I was wondering if you could talk about the margins in the Home and Home Improvement, Fasteners and the increase there. How much of that improvement was raw material driven versus other costs that you were able to take out? Just thinking about the sustainability of the improvements as you move forward.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Yes, I won\u2019t give you exact numbers but kind of orders of magnitude. I think its reasonably evenly split and we\u2019re seeing some very good productivity initiatives being driven in that business that are taking cost out of our product portfolio. So some of it is good, structural changes in the manufacturing area.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse", "", "And then secondly, wondering about in terms of the power tool business on the consumer side, what sort of trends are you seeing in terms of the sales via the big boxes versus independents there?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Well the consumer side of the business is more has less of a presence in the independent channel, so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really a fair comparison. I think the consumer business is focused largely in mass merchants and the big box channel, so the trends wouldn\u2019t be material.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Matt Lamden] for Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital.", "[Matt Lamden] for Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital", "", "I was just hoping we could get a little more color on what drove the early promotions, what specific products they were. And where do you think that strength came from. If you think it was big box restocking and if that\u2019s sustainable going forward?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "No, it\u2019s not sustainable. It was purely a timing issue. You know we work with our retail partners you know to plan promotions out, you know for a period of time. As it happened this one shipped before we had it planned in our guidance to the outside world. So it really does not represent a restocking in any way or an improvement in the underlying end user demand.", "[Matt Lamden] for Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital", "", "And secondly I was hoping we\u2019d get a little more color on your guidance for fourth quarter margins. I believe historically 4Q has lower margins as you have a bigger mix shift towards lower margin, consumer oriented products. So I was wondering what\u2019s different this 4Q or if you just think it\u2019s strength elsewhere.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "I think it\u2019s kind of been a little bit of a mixed bag over the years, but you know I think that the margins in the fourth quarter typically are affected by more promotional activity. But we\u2019re going to benefit from you know the commodity deflation or if you think back to last year we were kind of at the height of hitting the inflation into our P&L, as well as the productivity initiatives we\u2019ve undertaken this year. So I don\u2019t know that the mix shift is all that good. I think that generally you should think about promotions this year. Promotional activity will be a little bit more muted than in years past.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "The first question I guess just to hit back on inventory at retail, you know in the last couple of quarters, I think in first quarter pointed to some de-stocking and then its beginning to level off in the second and third. So where are we right now with that trend? Do you think we\u2019re kind of more even? And you know on the contrast we\u2019ve heard different things about demand. Do you see any type of building at all at retail or I guess like you said before promotions you expect to be a little bit more muted.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Yes, I think that generally our feeling as you look at the U.S. and Europe in the Power Tool business anyway is that inventories are actually pretty well balanced with the demand outlook in my view. Most of the de-stocking at you know retail occurred in the first half. We saw a little bit of carry into the third quarter and perhaps the independent channels here in the U.S., but as of right now that\u2019s reasonably well balanced. And you know obviously taking aside the early promotional shipments, but taking that out I think inventory retails where it should be. In the Hardware and Home Improvement business inventories are up slightly but that has a lot more to do with the specific commercial initiatives by our customers than I think a fundamental change in the demand outlook.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "The second question just goes back to margins and you\u2019ve had you know great sequential improvement now for a couple of quarters. You know back to let\u2019s say 2008 levels roughly, give or take at least on a combined basis. You know all things equal in terms of sales levels, you know what do we expect in 2010 in terms of incremental either savings from restructuring or incremental productivity gains that you expect just in the way you run your business on year-to-year basis? You know, assuming raw materials flat, you know how much more incremental do you think there is from the restructuring and productivity side as we look into next year?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Yes, I mean we\u2019re not prepared at this time to write specific guidance on 2010 but I think we\u2019ve spoken in the past that you know as we carried into 2009 a fair amount of inflation, going into 2010 we\u2019ll be in kind of the inverse place on that, carrying in a little bit of deflation into the year in any event. With respect to some of the other productivity initiatives, there\u2019s still some more to be wrung out of those as we go into next year. I\u2019m not prepared to give you a specific number on that.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "And your outlook for price?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Well as we\u2019ve been positive through the first three quarters, my outlook for the fourth quarter would probably be neutral on price.

Reeves", "Yes. I\u2019m not going to quantify it because its just a component, similar to absorption and productivity you know. And it was roughly neutral in the second quarter. Its favorable into the third quarter and will continue to be favorable in the fourth quarter. You know what\u2019s changed? Not a lot to be fair with you. Perhaps we could improve our forecasting just slightly in this area but in fairness its tough to pull apart some of the productivity initiatives between commodity benefit and true productivity. You know those negotiations with the supply base especially on component costs are kind of tied together.", "Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities", "When you think about it, given you guys in the last cycle moved to a less vertical platform, and this is what surprised me is how quickly the deflation would have moved through your business given Power Tools. You obviously had some benefits. You were shielded from some of that inflation on the upswing given the outsourcing. So I\u2019m just interested to see if there\u2019s been some type of shift or if you can kind of just give us a little bit more color about why that deflation now is moving so quickly when on the converse you were shielded from inflation on the way up, A, and if that seems to be obviously impacting the plumbing and the fastening which are more raw material oriented.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "We did trap A, an amount of inflation in the supply base on the way up, but we were not shielded from it. I think we took a pretty good margin hit on the way up. What you\u2019re seeing now is you know there\u2019s a lag effect from when you know prices actually move in the market to when it hits our P&L both because of the nature of our contracts with our suppliers, as well as working on to the balance sheet and then off the balance sheet as it goes through our supply chain. So you\u2019re seeing now the effects of the commodity moves, really the base commodity moves that occurred in the back half of 2008 are starting to work their way into our supply chain now.", "Obviously in the marketplace commodities are headed back up, albeit they\u2019re still below year ago levels. So you\u2019re really seeing the effect of what happened in the back half of 2008 hitting our P&L at this point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David MacGregor - Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", " ", "Just to follow up on that last question from Ken, does that imply then that we\u2019ll see the cost of inflation? I mean copper\u2019s up 20% in the last three months. Should we be looking at this in the second half of 2010, given the lag effect you just detailed?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Yes. Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair assumption. Yes.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Can you talk a little bit about the businesses you closed or rationalized? You cited low performance businesses being sidelined to. What was the impact on the P&L?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Yes. Perhaps a business would be a strong characterization. It was more some under performing SKUs or categories that we just decided not to pursue in the consumer business because we just didn\u2019t see a path to profitability. So that\u2019s been a little bit of pressure on the consumer top line. I think also wrapped into that as you think about consumer businesses, if you recollect in the third quarter of last year we liquidated the BPX business that had failed the prior year. So that also is kind of a mixed benefit as you think about consumer business in 2009.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Can you quantify the benefit?", "Stephen F.

Oh, the benefit to our mix within the consumer business?", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "I\u2019m just wondering what the benefit to the P&L from exiting these poor performing businesses.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "No, I don\u2019t think I could get to that kind of granularity.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "And then the pull forward benefit from 4Q to third quarter I think you said at the beginning it was less than the tax which was $0.14. Can you bring any more granularity to that?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "No. It was less than the $0.14. You know it was just again the timing of certain promotional shipments.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "", "Just one of your indirect competitors I guess has said that in the recovery phase of the cycle they\u2019re likely to experience greater than normal contribution margins.

Reeves", "I would say that it\u2019ll depend on the slope of that recovery.

I think valuations generally as we\u2019ve been seeing deals are coming more in line with our expectations than where they were say six months ago.

The relative to why there hasn\u2019t been a diminuation in our ability to generate revenues I think if you think through where we\u2019ve cut, in all of our businesses its our view that that product is the key driver of success and ultimately in the markets. There are other factors that apply as well. And we have attempted as we\u2019ve gone through these downsizings to protect the new product capability of the business both in terms of engineering product management as well as protecting the new product capital as we\u2019ve made our various cuts.

Morgan", "", "When you\u2019re talking about the Porter Cable tradesmen and the upcoming launch of the compact lithium ion, I was wondering if you could kind of take a step back and look at the share trends over the past couple of years and if its possible at all to try and give us a view of on the professional side, you know, how much share you\u2019ve lost and perhaps what you expect to hopefully make up with these launches you know over the next 12 months.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Sure. Yes, I think we\u2019ve talked over the last couple of conference calls about the fact that we have in the professional cordless business been losing some share as those markets have moved to lithium ion. I think you know we\u2019ve kind of characterized it as a couple points of share. We have starting with this year in the first quarter with the new XR Premium Line. Now here in the fourth quarter with the compact started to address some of the product totals we had relative to our lithium offering. ", "I would say that performance year-to-date on the Premium side has been very strong and we\u2019re very happy with where that product has been received into the marketplace. Obviously its too soon to know how the compact that we\u2019re offering now is actually performing but we have high expectations. And I guess as we look at the cordless marketplace, there\u2019s a reasonably best growing, low voltage category developing, kind of 12 volts or less, where we do not have a presence at this point in time. So as that business grows we don\u2019t participate in it, obviously you would expect we have our product road focused on that.", "So I think our product portfolio you know should be reasonably robust here as we go through 2010 and we\u2019re hopeful about recovering some of our lost position.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "And that 12 volt or less, I mean is that something that you expect to address over the next 12 or 18 months?", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Sure. You should expect that we have something on our product road that will address our gaps in our offerings. Yes.", "Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan", "", "In terms of the changing mix of product that you\u2019re selling and that we\u2019ve heard and I think you\u2019ve referred to before that you know there is a little bit of a trading down going on, I believe on both the consumer and the professional side of the market. Is there any accompanying margins with that? You know in the past I think it was viewed that you know some of your higher end, cordless DeWalt product really did carry a much higher margin than some of the other product and I was wondering if you could comment on any incremental change in product mix and what that might have relative to margins.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Yes and in our product portfolios it varies a fair amount as to whether you know where in the price point range is the most profitable of the categories so it\u2019s not an absolute statement. I think what we are seeing you know a trade down in ticket price I think that\u2019s pretty clear across both Power Tools and HHI but we\u2019ve made some pretty good strides on improving the profitability in our consumer business, especially relative to where we were last year. So you know I don\u2019t know that the mix impact of that is particularly significant.", "Operator", "And that was our final question.", "Mark M. Rothleitner", "", "All right. Thank you operator. Thanks everyone for their interest in Black & Decker. We\u2019re available to answer questions throughout the day.", "Stephen F. Reeves", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call.

Morgan", "Operator", "I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Works fourth quarter and full year 2009 results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Miss Kate White, Director of Investor Relations.", "Kate White", "Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today on the Stanley Works fourth quarter and full year 2009 conference call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Stanley\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jim Loree, Stanley\u2019s Executive Vice President and COO and Don Allen, Stanley\u2019s Vice President and CFO.", "I\u2019d like to point out that our fourth quarter earnings release which was issued this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website stanleyworks.com.", "This morning, Jim, John and Don will review Stanley\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. The entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and a replay will be available beginning at 2:00 pm today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "We\u2019ve also added a new option for you to be able to listen to the replay. You can download it as a Podcast from I-tunes and even set up a subscription for all future replays of calls that we post. You can access this within I-tunes itself by typing in Stanley Works in the search window or from the link on our website. This should be posted within 24 hours.", "And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow up questions after today\u2019s call at my number which is 860-827-3833.", "Lastly, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K which we have filed with today\u2019s press release and in our most recent \u201934 Act.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks Kate. Let\u2019s start by looking briefly at some highlights from the fourth quarter and the full year 2009. First, as it relates to the fourth quarter, we recorded diluted EPS of $0.89. That does exclude $0.22 related to the transaction and integration planning costs primarily associated with the Black & Decker merger.", "Diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis then was $0.67. I think important to note, $0.04 to $0.05 of the $0.89 was an unanticipated tax benefit and the remainder of the tax benefit was included in our guidance as explained in the press release, and that we\u2019ll cover in a little bit more detail later on in this morning\u2019s presentation.", "So for the year, diluted EPS was $2.80 versus $2.74 in 2008 again excluding the $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter related to the Black & Decker transaction. Fourth quarter was $0.89 and for the year that brought us to $3.02 which did include the gain of the debt extinguishment reported in the second quarter 2009.", "So EPS for the year up 10% versus 2008 excluding the fourth quarter charges and 2% on a GAAP basis including those charges.", "Quarterly gross margin rate 40.7% was quite encouraging and it was our second consecutive quarter above 40%. Pricing, cost productivity initiatives and commodity deflation all continued to offset the impact of the volume under absorption and that led us to a record annual gross margin for the year of 40.4%.", "Cash flow was encouraging as well, $446 million for the year, up 6% versus 2008, and working capital reached 7.9 turns, another record. And that\u2019s due to the ongoing success of the Stanley fulfillment system that Jim Loree is going to talk to you a little bit more about in his part of the presentation.", "Looking very briefly at some of the segment highlights, Security achieved 20% operating margin while absorbing a 4% revenue decline. The CDIY segment profit improved $17 million or 71% while the Industrial profit rate improved sequentially to 11.3%, and Don Allen is going to give you more detail on the segments in his portion.", "Last, but certainly not least, the planning for the pending combination of Black & Decker remains on track. Close is expected at the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter and I\u2019m going to spend a few minutes updating everyone on that which may help or even preempt some of the questions, and everybody will be on the same page.", "Two slides on the transaction; the first one is just a bit of a refresher and the second one, think of it as an update. The benefits of this combination are compelling to say the least. The strategic benefits which we\u2019ve talked about before will make us a global leader in both hand and power tools with an iconic brand portfolio and over 250 years of combined history.", "We\u2019ll have greater scale in both hand and power tools as well as storage, mechanical security and engineered fastenings, a world class innovation process, global, low cost sourcing and manufacturing platforms and additional presence in high growth emerging markets.", "Both companies are growing rapidly from a low base in India, China and the rest of Asia and Black & Decker as many of you know brings a very strong presence in Latin America to the combination.", "The financial benefits we believe are equally compelling. It will be highly accretive with $1.00 per share of accretion projected by year three, $350 million in cost synergies on an annual basis with the opportunity for margin improvement both from the cost synergies as well as embedding SFS across a larger volume base.", "Free cash flow is anticipated to be in excess of $1 billion and with $1.5 billion in EBITDA by the third year of the transaction. And of course, with that cash flow we\u2019ll have increased resources to invest in security solutions, engineered fastening, other high growth platforms as well as organic growth at the core businesses, and as we\u2019ve stated before, our capital allocation going forward is planned to be similar to what it\u2019s been in the past; roughly two-thirds of our cash flow focused on strategic, accretive acquisitions and one-third being returned to the shareholders in the form of both dividends and selected stock repurchases.", "A strong balance sheet is also important. We\u2019re going to have a strong balance sheet going in and it\u2019s going to be strengthened further over time.", "In terms of an update on the transaction, what have we done to date and what do have left to be done. As you know, we have received HSR approval. The period expired on December 29, and we\u2019ve established January 12, 2010 as the record date for shareholders to be involved in voting for the transaction.", "We filed a preliminary S-4 with the SEC for review and we\u2019re awaiting comments on the second version of that document. We\u2019ve announced an integration team with co-leaders from both Stanley and Black & Decker; I\u2019ll touch more on that in a minute, along with a new organization design and a senior leadership team for the combined company.", "And let me say what I can about that now because we\u2019ve certainly had a lot of questions and we want to be sure everybody\u2019s on the same page and has the same information.", "The senior corporate structure going forward was in fact identified in the press release. Jim Loree, Don Allen and myself will essentially have the same positions in the new company going forward as we have at Stanley.", "We have established a synergy steering committee that Nolan Archibald with co-share and [Jim Don] along with Mark Matthew, our head of Human Resources in [Mosel Agrasse], head of our European business and our global industrial and automotive platform will sit on that synergy team.", "As I mentioned, we\u2019ve established integration management office that\u2019s co-chaired by Brett Bontreger, a tested and proven Stanley executive who was involved in integrating Facom among other things, and most of our major acquisitions, along with Tony Milando from Black & Decker, who is currently Vice President of Operations for the worldwide power tools and accessories business.", "Under Brett and Tony there are fourteen dedicated teams focused on various businesses and functions with one member from Black & Decker and one member from Stanley on each of those teams and importantly, no business leaders are on those teams, and the business leaders will be charged with focusing on the core business and continuing to do what they do best, and the integration teams will collaborate closely with them to ensure that we achieve the synergies.", "Looking quickly at the segments, going forward our intent is to report externally in the same three segments that Stanley currently reports. In Security, the Convergent Security Solutions business will essentially remain intact while the Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement business will be integrated within the Mechanical Access Security business.", "On the Industrial segment, that essentially will remain intact as well with the global platform leaders in Industrial and Automotive repair and infrastructure reporting to Jim Loree as they do now.", "The Black & Decker Engineered Solutions business, probably better known as MHAR will also remain intact with Mike Tyll who currently heads that business for Black & Decker managing that business and the Stanley Assembly Technologies business will be integrated within MHAR.", "And finally, the Black & Decker worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business along with the Stanley Construction and Do-It-Yourself business will become the new CDIY segment. It will be under the leadership of Stanley executives and six of the top ten executives in that organization will at this stage, are planned to come from Black & Decker. ", "That will ensure the knowledge; the skill sets that are unique to power tools as well as the knowledge that exists within the business will carry forward in the new organization. Collaboration to the extent that we\u2019ve been allowed to do so has been quite encouraging so far.", "And lastly, on the geographies looking at Europe, Asia and Latin America, existing leaders will focus on either the core business or growth opportunities depending on the geography and there\u2019s a somewhat equal distribution at this stage of Stanley and Black & Decker executives.", "That\u2019s all that I\u2019m really able to say about the organization at this stage, but the structure as announced, is consistent with the dual objectives of protecting the core franchise while integrating the two companies as rapidly and as prudent as we can as we convey to achieve the potential synergies that are available from this transformational opportunity.", "Jumping back quickly to the slide, what\u2019s left to be done; we need to continue to execute on our 2010 goals, and of course we need to obtain the remaining regulatory approvals from the EU as well as other foreign jurisdictions.", "We need a shareholder vote. We need approval from both the Stanley and Black & Decker shareholders and of course we need to retain key talent on both sides of the organization. That all leads as I mentioned to expected close somewhere near the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter.", "Solid progress we think we have achieved on all fronts. Integration planning is well underway and hopefully that answers a lot of questions that you might have had and we can focus on some other things the rest of this call.", "So let\u2019s get back to Stanley\u2019s fourth quarter. Looking at revenues around the world, they declined in most of the world as you\u2019ll see in the U.S. on the left hand side, second from the top, revenues down 14% both as reported and organically excluding any effects of currency and in Europe, down 9%, down 16% excluding currency and acquisitions. ", "Asia and Australia did show some growth and it\u2019s a complicated chart with a lot of numbers on it but we\u2019re trying to provide you as much data as possible and hopefully the message is clear. Revenues remain down but the rate of decline was lower and revenues actually increased on a sequential basis as shown on the next slide.", "Looking at fourth quarter revenue by segment, again a lot of data on this chart but what I really wanted to point out is some of the trends by segment to supplement what we just showed you by geography.", "Volume and sources of growth is identical to what we listed in our press release in terms of the do to or the walk, but if we focus on the fourth quarter, you see volume down 16% for the entire company offset by price, was 1% favorable so organic growth declined 15%.", "Currency helped 4%. There was no impact from acquisitions in the fourth quarter as previous acquisitions anniversaried by the end of the third quarter so total revenues down 11%. That is all in our press release.", "Looking at the segment results, just a couple of things to focus on; CDIY down 8% in total, 14% volume decline which was the 8% revenue decline was obviously a significant improvement on a sequential basis.", "Security held up fairly well, volume down 9%, revenue down 4%. So the total company as you see got 11% in revenue, volume down 16%.", "Moving on to earnings, at a high level you see the 11% volume decline, but still translating to $0.89 of earnings which is 39% improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Within the fourth quarter of 2008 as stated in our press release, there were $0.59 of restructuring costs taking GAAP earnings to $0.05 a share.", "This year, per our press release, $0.89 of operating earnings, $0.22 of charges related to the Black & Decker transaction costs, resulting in GAAP earnings of $0.67.", "Looking at margins, a nice improvement of 210 basis points. Both Jim and Don are going to talk about how that worked by segment as well as what\u2019s driving that margin improvement and looking at the tax rate of minus 4.4%, you see a little bit of an explanation in the box. It\u2019s the effect of resolution of some income tax audits.", "The tax rate would have been 22% excluding this $14 million benefit. And again, as referenced in the press release, $11 million of that $14 million benefit was due to the closing of U.S. audits through 2006. The other $3 million was a favorable adjustment in the U.K. around the deductibility of certain interest payments.", "As you know, we\u2019re not allowed to based on recent FAS rule changes to release any of those reserves until the audits are formally closed. The audits closed in the fourth quarter. We released the reserves, and that\u2019s the impact as it related to EPS.", "Let\u2019s turn it over to Jim who\u2019s going to talk to you about some very encouraging margin performance driven by a combination of cost control, targeted investments and most importantly, the benefits of the Stanley fulfillment system.", "Jim Loree", "Thanks John. As you indicated one highlight for 2009 was the extraordinary in the area of gross margin. We achieved 40.4% for the year, a record with a 40.7% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year that\u2019s a 260 basis point increase over prior year, and this was achieved with the backdrop being the worst economic conditions in 60 years.", "And the 2009 performance, as well as the long term positive trend is really a function of four factors. One is the tight operational management across our businesses as it related to productivity projects, supplier management, price realization, product mix and new product vitality.", "Secondly, it\u2019s the strength of our value propositions for our customers, able to get paid for those. And we also are benefiting quite extensively from the implementation of the Stanley fulfillment system which I\u2019ll talk about more in a moment and then finally the deliberate shifting of our portfolio in higher margin, higher growth area.", "And now as we look forward, the challenge will be as we merge with Black & Decker and their gross margins in the low 30\u2019s so on a weighted basis when we put the companies together, we\u2019ll be right around 35% or so, and we need to begin this march forward over the coming years to get the combined company back up to these levels over time. And that will be an exciting challenge that we\u2019ll take on with the integration process.", "Now moving to working capital, I have to say our fourth quarter working capital performance was a very pleasant and positive surprise. Coming into the end of the year, we were confident that we had plans in place to achieve mid to upper six turns for the year and we basically blew that number away with a volume performance which was essentially in line with what we were expecting, and we achieved 7.9 turns, a feat which I think will put us in good stead with best in class as it relates to our peers.", "It was a two turn increase and up almost three turns versus Q3 sequentially and was a major driver behind our $446 million of free cash flow which was our second best ever free cash flow performance, again in this very tough economy.", "As you can see, inventory dropped 15 days. Receivables dropped 11 days. We were able to hold payables, so a nice performance across the elements and in total, a very significant $243 million decrease in working capital.", "Moving to the how, it\u2019s all about the sustained process improvement through the Stanley fulfillment system. And with Black & Decker as we integrate, we see an opportunity here as well in the coming years. They\u2019ve been making good progress in working capital as well, but not as dramatic and not as quick, and I think we can assist them with that and really unlock several $100 million worth of cash flow.", "Here\u2019s a little more information and color on SFS. As I mentioned before, it has four elements. Let\u2019s start in the upper right hand side with the S&OP process. That\u2019s all about keeping supply and demand in balance. ", "Then we move to common platforms in the lower right. That is basically standardization of process and IT platforms to provide scalability and efficiency. Now this is an area where conversely, Black & Decker can help us because they\u2019ve made excellent progress in this area in their worldwide power tools and accessories business which is about 70% of their company and depending combination will actually accelerate Stanley\u2019s standalone ability to drive towards common platforms. We\u2019re very excited about that.", "Then we move to the lower left hand part of the slide and we talk about transformational lean. Stanley\u2019s trademark transformational lean methodology combines traditional supply chain and manufacturing lean with back room and then combines what I call incremental lean which is what most people do with respect to lean, with an even more powerful application of lean to gain changing transformation of business models in order to create competitive advantage.", "In this area it\u2019s early days for us. We have some really interesting experiments going on and implementing here. We\u2019ve made good progress on the incremental part. Now we move to the business model transformation part and we see tremendous opportunity here in the coming years.", "Then finally, complexity management in the upper left, it\u2019s all about eradicating complexity in everything we do except where customers gain value from complexity in what we offer, and then it\u2019s about providing it most efficiently and then getting paid for it.", "Those are the four elements of the Stanley fulfillment system. They work in concert. They\u2019ve been working well. It\u2019s early days as we look at the implementation of the system and we\u2019re very proud of the accomplishments so far but there\u2019s many, many more to come in this area.", "My final slide today is about the brand. There are several key messages here. Number one, the spending is up. If we look at the spending it\u2019s not on the chart, but if we look at it over the \u201905 to \u201909 time frame, we were averaging about $21 million a year of spend. That\u2019s in stark contrast to the \u201901 to \u201903 time frame when we were investing $10 million a year.", "What we achieved from \u201905 to \u201909 in terms of unaided awareness improvements and frankly improvements across the spectrum of various measurements of types of awareness. In 2005 we had a 27% unaided awareness number and that went to 35% in \u201906 and 41% in \u201907, 43% in \u201908 and finally 48%, a big increase this year, and we\u2019re currently approaching the level that Stanley had at its peak historical level achieved in the early 80\u2019s of 55%.", "So lots of good progress in the last five years, and one of the other themes is that we\u2019re trying to spend our money much more wisely and get the biggest bang for our buck so very little TV advertising, and then spreading it around several different areas.", "The latest initiative that we have is we have become the official tool provider of the Walt Disney World Resort and we have a partnership with Disney which is a 10 year alliance. It brings branding in the parks, B to B opportunities and other elements with a select group of alliance partners.", "We have construction wall signage throughout the Walt Disney Resort. Stanley, Mac and Vidmar products are highlighted in the Lights Motor Action garage. We\u2019re also providing cabinets, tools, branded benches, cabinets and tools and accessories for the test track line area and the ride itself. So that\u2019s very exciting and just getting underway. ", "Of course we continue to be a Nascar sponsor. We have sustained brand exposure over 38 weekends with primary sponsorship in 20 races, extensive customer and user activation and numerous race related in store and on track promotions, and a very healthy menu for 2010.", "Last year\u2019s big story for the brand awareness moving the needle was the Major League Baseball sponsorship. In 2009 we had 11 teams. We\u2019re going to add one in 2010, thus giving us signage in 40% of all the games and we have really placed our signs strategically to maximize television exposure and we love and thank our Hartford neighbors at ESPN folks for their sports center coverage of our brand and its saturation that we get from all that exposure.", "And then of course last year we also began sponsoring the English Premier League which is the number one soccer league in the world and 650 million people around the world watch that every week and it\u2019s an exciting initiative.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Don Allen who will take you through some of the numbers.", "Donald Allen", "Thanks Jim. The next page is walk of the SG&A in the fourth quarter. As we typically try to show you each quarter, we take last year\u2019s SG&A and walk it forward. I\u2019ll start with the right side of the chart.", "If you look at the cost reductions that we\u2019ve done throughout the year, just as a reminder, in total we reduced cost by $265 million in 2009. Of that number, about $150 million impacted SG&A and the head count impacted was just under 3,000 individuals. So in the fourth quarter we saw a $37 million benefit of that which is 13% reduction to the base versus the fourth quarter of \u201908. ", "And then looking at some of the increases on the left side of the chart, we did have some integration costs associated with the planning of the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker of about $5 million. ", "FX was a negative impact year over year of $10 million and then we continued investments in SG&A. Jim just spent a fair amount of time talking through the brand investments and the significance of that. As many of you are aware we made investments in our Security businesses to put more feet on the street and focus on certain share gains we can achieve.", "And then as we began to re-instate some of our employee benefits in the fourth quarter that were suspended earlier in the year, we begin to see some cost increases there. So the net result is about a 2% decline in SG&A and we continue to see the impact of our reductions in the fourth quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to spend a little bit of time walking you through the segments. We start with the Security segment. Once again Security was the gem of the quarter. In the four quarters of 2009 we experienced in essence a single digit revenue declines but have been improving their profit rate throughout the year and year over year as well.", "So if we look at revenues, as John mentioned, revenues were down 4%, organically down 7% so a consistent trend that we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. The good news is that the segment profit was actually up 4% on that small revenue decline which resulted in segment profit rate of 19.9% so just under 20% which was off of last quarter which was close to 21%, so 150 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of \u201908.", "Looking at the two sub business within our Security segment, starting with Convergent Security Solutions first, revenues declined similar in line with the total segment, single digits. They continue to see weakness in the installation revenues and health care capital expenditures affecting some of the small health care businesses in this business.", "That continues to be a constraint as we move forward. The good news is their recurring monthly revenues continue to grow and we saw growth in the fourth quarter again in the low double digits range.", "So as we move forward looking at profit rate and revenue trends, I\u2019ll spend more time later on, but we\u2019ve seen a continual trend in the Convergent business of improving their profit rate performance because they\u2019re really been focused on the integration of the acquisitions, driving the benefits and cost reduction, productivity in their cost base, and obviously the mix towards more RMR versus installation improves their profit rate as well.", "On the Mechanical Access side of the segment, similar story but slightly different reasons for them. Revenues declined a little bit more significantly than we saw in the Convergent side. They have been affected by the slowdown in commercial construction more than we\u2019ve seen in Convergent. ", "However, they\u2019ve been very focused on retaining and maintaining certain national customers, and that\u2019s something we will continue to be focused on as we got through this slowdown in commercial construction.", "A great story for them in line with the overall working capital story for the company is that working capital turn for MAS were up 14.7% and along with that they improved their fill rates. So last but not least, their profit rate improved as well through price realization, the deflation that we saw in commodity prices and then the continued cost reductions that they\u2019ve done throughout the year.", "Moving to the Industrial segment, Industrial as you know throughout the year has really suffered on the top line. They\u2019ve seen significant inventory corrections throughout the supply chain to our end customers, and in the fourth quarter we did see significant revenue declines again, although not as significant as we saw on the previous three quarters of 2009.", "So revenues were down 23%, organically 26% and the segment profit was only down 14% versus that revenue decline as we did see many of the cost actions that we started in Europe in the spring of 2009 were completed in the fourth quarter so we saw the benefit of that in the segment profit, and as a result, the segment profit rate was at 11.3% which was a sequential improvement from the third quarter where it was at 9.2%. So we saw a nice impact of those cost actions coming through in the fourth quarter.", "As I mentioned, we did see significant destocking trends throughout the year. We believe that they have ceased in the fourth quarter in the Industrial segment and I\u2019ll talk more about what we think that means for next year later on in the presentation.", "Facom\u2019s revenue decline has slowed to 11% where we saw significant declines in the previous quarter in the mid 20% to 30% range, and they\u2019ve been very focused on their new product development along with the Proto business and how we can actually gain share in this type of declining environment and that continues to be something that\u2019s always been significant in the Facom business and will be going forward.", "The last item to mention is the Mac tools business. Mac has significantly improved their profit share over the year and that was despite an 18% drop in their unit volume as they were very focused on price realization and actions with the end customers and cost reductions.", "CDIY had a nice quarter as well in the fourth quarter as we continue to see and experience further stabilization in this segment. The revenues were down 8% as John mentioned. Organically they were down 13%, and so in the first three quarters revenues were down 25%, 28% and 23%, and now only down 8%.", "Part of that is certainly the comps we\u2019re comparing to in the fourth quarter of \u201908, but it\u2019s also an improvement on a sequential basis, so we are seeing nice stabilization and the potential for some growth as we move forward.", "Segment profit up 71%, really being driven by the integration of the Bostitch business in the consumer tools and storage throughout the year, significant productivity within the plants, some of them associated with Bostitch but also just the normal productivity programs that we implement and then certainly SG&A actions that they\u2019ve taken have assisted in getting to almost a 12% segment profit rate in the fourth quarter.", "The last think I\u2019ll mention here on CDIY is that the working capital turn has improved to 7.9 turns. That almost a two turn improvement versus the prior year. So clearly, SFS has really taken hold on our CDIY segment.", "On the next chart I\u2019d like to spend a little bit of time talking about some of the key trends as we move forward. If we start with Security, the way this chart works, we showed it for the first time for you last quarter, is up top, the yellow line represents the segment profit rate over the previous two years, and then the gray bars represent the unit volume decline within revenue.", "In Security, as I mentioned earlier, installations within our Convergent business are showing some signs of slight improvement in Europe but they continue to be very weak within the U.S. and that will be something we continue to monitor as we go into 2010.", "Commercial construction continues the slowdown. The slowdown in commercial construction continues to impact both businesses, but even more in our Mechanical Access business. So we\u2019re beginning to focus on other areas such as education and health care verticals to try to offset the impact of that as we move forward.", "We would expect that any slowdown or recovery in commercial construction market would probably lag a recovery in the residential construction market, so it appears that residential construction has stabilized, and we\u2019ll see as we move forward what the time frame for both those recoveries are.", "Last but not least, we believe our profit rate will likely continue to very strong in our segment as we continue to focused on price inflation management as well as effective cost management, and trying to gain share in all different areas as much as possible.", "Industrial clearly is lagging behind both businesses and lagging behind CDIY. We do believe that the vast majority of the inventory destocking we saw is behind us. Industrial production worldwide continues to be up so we do believe that will ultimately have a positive impact on our business moving forward but we are cautious as we move into 2010.", "We believe the destocking is behind us as I mentioned and there is a suggestion of a possibility of improvement as certain restocking may need to take place in this segment because of the low inventory levels throughout the supply chain.", "But we\u2019ll be focused on top line weakness and really trying to maintain our profit rates as we experienced in late 2009 and ensure that our cost base is appropriately adjusted and maintained to where it is today. The profit rate has probably bottomed out in the third quarter in the low 9% range. We think that it will likely continue moving forward at a trend that we saw in the fourth quarter.", "CDIY clearly has stabilized as I mentioned and as many of you know this segment is impacted by housing starts and consumer confidence, and so we believe there will be modest growth in this segment in 2010. We do think the growth in the U.S. will be muted and emerging markets will be much stronger, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep a close eye on to see if there is a stronger recovery as we move into 2010.", "Again, being very focused on new product development, innovation, our marketing to be a key driver to our top line, gain as much market share as we can in this difficult environment. And then profit rates continue the migration back to historical levels in 2010.", "So that\u2019s the segments. Let\u2019s spend a little bit of time on free cash flow which is the next page. Jim touched on the significant working capital performance of 7.9 turns which resulted in over $200 million of working capital positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year, $226 million.", "The net result of our earnings and our working capital turn performance offset by our planned capital expenditures was $263 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter which is up significantly over $100 million versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter mostly due to the working capital performance.", "And then for the year, our free cash flow was $446 million, up almost $25 million versus last year or 6% which is a significant performance considering the revenue pressures that we saw throughout 2009.", "Next, our balance sheet; as many of you are aware we had a plan to deleverage ourselves in 2009 by $200 million. We slightly over achieved that where our debt went down $229 million and our adjusted debt to capital is right around 30% which is exactly what we were targeting for the year.", "So we\u2019re very pleased with that. Obviously the cash flow that we experienced and the significant working capital, turn improvement really facilitated us achieving that goal.", "So let\u2019s move to guidance. The first thing I want to note is that the guidance we\u2019re providing excludes any impacts of the Black & Decker and Stanley merger so this would be Stanley standalone for 2010.", "We believe that the EPS will range from $3.00 to $3.25 on a standalone basis and there\u2019s certain assumptions that we\u2019ve put in place that align with that particular net result. Net revenues should increased 2% to 4%. That\u2019s primarily unit volume revenue increases.", "We believe it reflects a modest economic recovery. Each one of our segments will be impacted differently as I just described, but we think it\u2019s a reasonable modest recovery.", "There are a couple of non recurring items in 2009 that you need to factor in as you look at our 2009 EPS and try to roll forward to this guidance, the first of which is a $0.34 gain on debt extinguishment that we did in the second quarter where we were actually able to repurchase over $100 million of our junior subordinated debt securities for about $55 million for a $44 million gain.", "John mentioned the Black & Decker transactional cost in the fourth quarter of $0.22. And then the next item would be a reminder to folks that we will have a diluted impact of some shares that we need to issue around May of 2010. It will be about $0.16 EPS dilution and it\u2019s associated with our equity unit hybrid instrument.", "The proceeds from that will be used to pay down other debt maturities that obviously mature at certain points throughout 2010.", "The tax rate we expect to turn back to more normalized levels. That\u2019s a diluted impact of about $0.20 to $0.25 year over year.", "And then the next items which is certainly significant, as we\u2019ve mentioned during the year, we expect about $100 million of cost carry over from 2009 to 2010. We have $75 million here as we have reinstated certain employee benefit costs as well as certain other costs that we are allowing to go back into the system so it nets to $75 million carry over.", "And we have certain investments we want to make, continue to make in brand and security as we move forward and those investments will certainly be monitored as we move throughout the year and ensure that our top line actually performs in the 2% to 4% range.", "Restructuring and impairment related charges should be flat to 2009. They were $45 million in 2009. We had $41 million in the restructuring line and about $4 million in the OM lines up above, so we expect that to be relatively flat as we will continue certain plan rationalization activities in line with our SFS.", "And then we expect a net zero impact from price and inflation. We currently have very little inflation in our estimates as they\u2019re based on current commodity prices and if commodity prices increase and we experience inflation, we would expect that we would be able to pass that onto our customers in a price increase.", "Free cash flow estimate is about $300 million to $350 million. We\u2019re estimating a relatively modest improvement in working capital for Stanley as we will be investing a lot of time in the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker and also trying to implement a lot of the SFS principals within the new company.", "And last thing I\u2019ll mention here is that we still are committed to the financial guidance provided with respect to the new combined company of Stanley and Black & Decker as we rolled out in November of last year.", "So in summary, we continue to move forward on a rigorous integration planning for Black & Decker. It\u2019s something that a lot of us are investing a great deal of time in at this point. We\u2019re very much focused though on making sure that our core businesses continue to perform strongly and we\u2019re focused on market share gains, customer services and keeping our fill rates up and improving them.", "We do see modest signs of growth potential within CDIY and that\u2019s encouraging, but we are being cautious as we move forward here to make sure that if a market recovery happens, we\u2019re ready and prepared to handle it, but if it doesn\u2019t we have contingency plans in place to accordingly.", "SFS is going to play an integral role in really navigating any significant upswing in demand that we experience as well as the successful integration of Black & Decker. We believe we\u2019re ready to serve our customers in the event of any volume surge that might occur throughout the year.", "That concludes our presentation.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Can you talk about the source of the 2% to 4% revenue growth? You seem optimistic about some progress in CDIY and a little bit more conservative in the other two segments. I\u2019m just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the why the 2% to 4% revenue expectation and where you expect that to come from? Secondly, I\u2019m interested in your thoughts on free cash flow especially in light of the six million additional shares coming out in 2010 and if there is any consideration to buy back stock to offset that.", "Donald Allen", "2% to 4% we think is modest as I mentioned. If you look at our three different segments, we do think CDIY will likely have some nice growth during 2010. Industrial has the potential but we\u2019re very cautious for growth as it\u2019s difficult to see how the supply chain is going to react to their customers in that segment.", "And in Security, we think relatively modest growth. There will be pressure associated with the commercial construction slowdown and how long that lags on. We think the vast majority of 2010 commercial construction will be relatively slow.", "I think obviously our history as a company around share repurchases, we evaluate those on a case by case basis. We will have a fair amount of need for cash associated with the Black & Decker Stanley merger. There\u2019s a lot of one time costs, restructuring and other payments that will need to be made.  There is about $670 million of one time costs. Of that, about $470 million is cash so there will be significant cash obligations in connection with that.", "But we\u2019ll have to see as the two companies come together what the projections we have for cash flow are in the first two to three quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "First question, on the 40% gross margin this year, and that\u2019s in the context of volume down 20%, how should we think about that going forward if we get basically volume under absorption dissipates as you progress with better comparisons going forward? And then on the strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter, does that have any implications for what you might be able to extract out of BDK and that $1 million target that you said?", "Jim Loree", "As far as the second question, I\u2019ll start with that one. We have no idea what their cash flow looks like in the fourth quarter or what it might look like prospectively until we have a much deeper integration process and we close the deal. So it\u2019s really a difficult question to answer without the requisite information.", "As far as the gross margin rate goes, we\u2019re pleased with the 40% and excited about the progress. We don\u2019t see anything that suggests that on a standalone basis the gross margin rate would go down any time soon in the company and obviously there will be all sorts of things that we\u2019ll have to deal with along the way such as the CDIY business grows at a faster rate than the Security business.", "That\u2019s going to put a little downward pressure on it. We\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019ll continue to see progress in productivity including the effect of absorption benefits that should accrue as volume begins to come back in general.", "So we those two as more or less offsetting and then we\u2019ll continue to work all the levers that I mentioned when I went through the gross margin chart, the price inflation recovery. If you go back to 2004, we\u2019re still almost $90 million short in terms of the recovery of inflation through pricing. So we\u2019re not building any kind of a price umbrella at all, and we\u2019re not over extended in that area.", "However, you never know what competitive conditions are and how they\u2019re going to evolve. So we\u2019ll continue to manage that with our pricing center of excellence and all the folks that we have out in the business coordinating very carefully on that one. Then we have our productivity, our mix management, our new product innovation and as I said earlier, getting paid for the value proposition.", "So we\u2019d like to see that 40% carry on. We think we can do it and I guess time will tell.", "John Lundgren", "Just to supplement what Jim said, with 39.9% in the second quarter and then third and fourth quarter both above 40% in the face of the volume decline that we cited, I think demonstrates we strongly believe demonstrates that we have right sized our company to make money and to achieve a 40% gross margin in a volume environment that\u2019s 15% to 20% below our highs in 2007 and 2008.", "That being said, obviously we\u2019ll get tremendous leverage from any upside volume improvement some of which will be reinvested in growth initiatives because we were really encouraged with the results of those modest investments that we experienced during 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Sam Sargach \u2013 Raymond James]", "[Sam Sargach \u2013 Raymond James]", "You have taken great pains to itemize all of the cost savings opportunities with the transaction and obviously it\u2019s a key focus of the organization. Talk about what you\u2019re dong to maintain and possibly grow market share of the combined company beyond just the verticals of Black & Decker is strong in Latin America and Stanley is strong in the automotive. Oftentimes when you have these combinations, you have cuts in sales and marketing and R&D departments and it tends to hurt market share a little bit. The second question would be what the interest expense expectation of the organic business would be in 2010?", "John Lundgren", "The answer to the first one is simple. Talk to us again in April or May when the deal is closed. Your question is a very fair one. It\u2019s one that I wish we had a better answer to. It\u2019s one where I wish we could collaborate more closely with Black & Decker because getting to know the people and the capabilities that exist within that organization has been extraordinarily encouraging.", "That being said, we\u2019re not legally able to coordinate, collaborate to the extent required, quite frankly the answer to your answer. We can do a lot of things, but we can\u2019t collaborate on markets. We can\u2019t collaborate on strategy, even product development, anything that\u2019s forward looking, and you\u2019ll understand the legal constraints for that.", "While we don\u2019t essentially compete in the marketplace, the products are complimentary, we are in the same marketplace so we essentially have to think about what we\u2019re going to do independently until the deal closes, and then we\u2019ll get the collective best heads from both companies together and we\u2019ll have a much better answer to your question than we\u2019re able to provide now.", "Jim Loree", "Let me just further say is what we can answer is on the standalone basis what we\u2019re doing, and just very quickly, in the CDIY business, the name of the game has and will continue to product innovation and we\u2019ve just sat through several days a few weeks ago right before the end of the year of an update on what they were doing, what they\u2019ve got planned for this year, and it\u2019s really exciting.", "It continues to be a new product machine let by Jeff Hansel and his team. And then in the Industrial business, they\u2019ve done a lot of work in harnessing the power of the combined platform. So whereas in the past we used to go to market as Mac and Facom and Vidmar separately, effective January 1, we put that all in one business leader with a functionalized organization as well as a regionalized organization where they\u2019re sharing new product development.", "They\u2019re sharing global strategy development and market development. So I think you\u2019re going to see a real power house initiative in terms of market share emerge from them, and then of course in Security we have new products in Mechanical. ", "We have the YQ product in particular in both Electronic and Mechanical. We have the addition of feet on the street which Don mentioned is a significant investment in Security, and all of those I think are geared along with our significant increase this year in brand investment to continue to push the needle in that area, all in there interest of market share gain.", "Donald Allen", "As you know, interest expense is about $61 million in2009. We would expect it probably to be somewhere between $52 million and $54 million in 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Jeff Kessler \u2013 Ontario Capital]", "[Jeff Kessler \u2013 Ontario Capital]", "With the increase that you\u2019ve shown in margins relative to sales in particularly in the Convergent side of Security, I\u2019m wondering what are you doing to increase your RMR component both in the quality of the RMR as well as the absolute amount of recurring revenue that you\u2019re getting from that division?", "John Lundgren", "You almost answered the question in that it\u2019s the quality of the RMR and increased percentage of RMR that is driving the margin improvement within Security. It\u2019s a bit of a double edged sword. As our business mix improves, as we fully integrate HSM and GTP, we\u2019re getting a much higher MRM component.", "That in and of itself, those very solid companies that [Rick Von Trager] and the team have done a very, very job bringing on board. That\u2019s helping a lot. The double edged sword is as commercial construction is down, regrettably install as a percent of the total revenue was also down. So that\u2019s driving a mix based margin improvement which has been very favorable the last couple of quarters.", "Importantly, you understand this business well; we need to pick up on the installations. They\u2019ll be profitable installations, but they\u2019ll be less profitable than the RMR element in order to fuel our fund that future RMR.", "So we\u2019re at a bit of a crossroads. We\u2019re at a really good position where we are in terms of mix and now with a little help from the marketplace and aggressive share gain program on the installations, we\u2019ll drive some installations to make sure the RMR pipeline stays full.", "[Jeff Kessler \u2013 Ontario Capital]", "And as a follow up to that, you\u2019ve made an announcement you\u2019ve settled the law suit with the franchisee group that was suing you. Is that issue effectively put to bed and will the cost effect along with that be put to bed?", "John Lundgren", "The issue is put to bed. The cost I\u2019ll go so far as to say diminutive and we\u2019re going to move forward. A lot of noise. You follow this industry very closely. A lot of noise and a lot of sizzle but not a lot of steak. Consider it behind us. ", "Jim Loree", "I would also say that we had a very, very satisfactory session with them shortly after the beginning of the year and I think we\u2019ve turned to corner now in terms of how the franchisees view us and we view them. It\u2019s a much more positive win win approach and now the proof will be in the execution but the spirit is there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kenneth Zener \u2013 Macquarie.", "Kenneth Zener \u2013 Macquarie", "I wanted to ask a broad question then ask about CDIY. But first, your 2010 sales guidance of 2% to 4%, I\u2019m wondering just conceptually how you can, or any comments you have relative to the 2% flat line growth you\u2019ve given for the merged companies in your 1, 2, and 3.", "Donald Allen", "Basically if you look at the Stanley projections that are in our S-4 it was about just under 2% growth for 2010. That was in there. I can\u2019t speak to the Black & Decker projections going forward whether there are any revisions associated with that. ", "But on the Stanley side, just under 2%. Now we\u2019re thinking a range of 2% to 4% and it\u2019s really I think an indication of some of the trends that I mentioned around CDIY and in particular that makes us feel a little bit better about that.", "Kenneth Zener \u2013 Macquarie", "It does seem rather low. On CDIY which did obviously good margins year over year but I think in the quarter sequentially it was perhaps a little bit low. I wonder if you can talk about the margin puts and takes there given that revenue actually in 4Q was actually than 3Q so I would have thought your absorption was there. If you could just go into some of those details; I think that was one item that might have caught people\u2019s eye in the quarter.", "Donald Allen", "Historically if you look at the CDIY business, although they\u2019ve experienced significant under absorption during 2009 even in the later stages of 2008, in the fourth quarter we do historically have significant shut downs above and beyond just normal volume trends.", "So we tend to see somewhat of a dip in the segment profit rate in the fourth quarter from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the main driver of that.", "John Lundgren", "Don\u2019s referring to the fact that you understand as well, home centers are a large source of revenue for CDIY.  As you know the home centers close their books at the end of January and as a consequence, orders and shipments are very light in late December and early January.", "Historically there are always several hundred basis point decline all other things being equal in margins in that segment third to fourth quarter which is why we don\u2019t spend a lot of time tracking sequential margins by segment and talking to it externally unless there was an unanticipated event.", "To come back to the whole year, the biggest driver in the CDIY margin improvement which we\u2019ve talked about a little and maybe not enough is the tremendous success of the integration of Bostitch within the consumer tools storage business to form the new CDIY platform.", "Bostitch which is was a struggling business and facing unprecedented volume declines, many of which were market driven has dramatically improved its margins within CDIY despite the fact that its 20% to 25% less volume. So that\u2019s a huge driver within that segment, but the sequential decline was no surprise at all to us.", "Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I wanted to get a little more color on your outlook for next year. Obviously we\u2019re just at the beginning of the year but as it more relates to the Security segment where you said that you gave some general comments on each segment but with Security said perhaps modest growth because of the commercial construction slowdown, and I was wondering if you could first, remind us of the breakdown in terms of your exposure to commercial construction by CSS and MAS and it appears that despite that, you\u2019re still looking for overall perhaps a little bit of modest growth in the segment, so how do you get there? And number two, just more broadly if you could remind us how you think about the end markets and the longer term growth outlook perhaps over the next five years as it relates to the comments that you\u2019ve made in the past about the way those markets grow and your positioning within those markets.", "John Lundgren", "I\u2019ll try to summarize the questions for Don. What is our exposure to commercial construction in our Security business and what\u2019s our view on some of the end markets as it relates to our projection of 2% to 4% revenue growth in 2010?", "Donald Allen", "Just as a refresher, there is actually a nice end market chart that I believe is in the appendix of the presentation, but Kate White can get it to anyone who\u2019s looking for it.", "Commercial construction for total Stanley is 11% of our revenues. You look at the Mechanical Access and Convergent businesses, for Mechanical it\u2019s about 12% and then for Convergent it\u2019s about 17%.", "So it\u2019s not a huge portion of the business but it\u2019s certainly significant and it\u2019s something that can have a bit of a negative impact on us and we would expect a little bit of a negative impact in 2010 from that.", "But there are other sectors as I mentioned such as health care, education, and government that are significant in both the Security businesses. In the case of Convergent, health care is almost 23% and then government and education combined is about 14% in Convergent and about the same number in Mechanical.", "So there\u2019s some nice verticals in both businesses that have not been as dramatically impacted by the slowing economy nor do we think they\u2019re going to be significantly impacted as we go into 2010. So you have a dynamic that\u2019s happening in our Security segment where they will have a negative drag around commercial construction, but we do think there\u2019s some verticals that can offset that and result in slightly modest growth for the year.", "Michael Rehaut \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And then in terms of longer term how you think about Security and the different end markets in the annual growth potential?", "Donald Allen", "We\u2019ve always said long term that we believe that the Security businesses will grow anywhere from 3% to 6%. It really depends on which component of the business. The Convergent business or the Electronic piece would grow at the higher end of that range and Mechanical at the lower end of the range.", "Who knows exactly when these economic circumstances get back to normal, but over the long term that\u2019s what our expectation would be.", "John Lundgren", "One benefit of what Don said is historically we were always in a position to say we\u2019re making a trade off. When Convergent was growing faster but margins were lower, so we were balancing growth and margin within our Security platform. Steve has done a really nice job as evidenced by Jeff Kessler\u2019s question, basically getting the Convergent margins up to or even above a level of Mechanical, and while we don\u2019t spend a lot of time focusing on margins by segment, right now we\u2019re quite encouraged because we have a high growth high margin in the Convergent security business as well as a very, very profitable but more modest growth on the Mechanical Security business.", "Operator", "This concludes the allotted time for today\u2019s questions. I turn the call back over to Kate White.", "Kate White", "I want to thank you all for spending time this morning to discuss our 4Q and full year 2009 results with us.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Stanley Black & Decker first quarter 2010 results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you, Ms. Kate White, Director of Investor Relations you may begin your conference.", "Kate White", "Thanks Louisa, good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker first quarter 2010 conference call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, President and CEO, Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO and Don Allen Senior Vice President and CFO.", "I would like to point out that our first quarter earnings release which was issued at 7 am this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on the investor relations portion of our website and accessible on our home page of www.stanleyblackanddecker.com. This morning, John, Jim and Donald will review Stanley\u2019s first quarter 2010 results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. ", "Because of the complexity of this quarter and the large amount of content the entire call was expected to last approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes in order to provide adequate time for Q&A.", "A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2 pm today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. As a reminder you can also download the earnings replay of the podcast from itunes and even set up the subscription for future replays of the calls we post. This should be posted within 24 hours. ", "I also wanted to call your attention to Stanley\u2019s 2009 annual toured and annual review website and videos that we launched yesterday. We decided to go online this year with a lot of our normal annual report content and we invite you to check up the site and explore the videos which feature conversations with senior management as well as the interactive charts and informational resources throughout the site. ", "It\u2019s a great way to become more familiar with the outstanding storey. You can access this through our home page. And as always please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions you might have after today\u2019s call. We will be making some forward looking statements during this call such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and especially involves risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the form 8-K which we filed with today\u2019s press release and in our most recent 34 act. ", "With that I will now turn the call over to our CEO John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "", "Thanks, Kate and good morning everybody. Let me just start by saying this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release, due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter. ", "So I did want tot thank those of the legacy Black & Decker and Stanley finance teams first of all for closing three sets of books at least in a very short period of time and for extraordinary efforts in that regard as well as the finance and IR teams for pulling together what we think is a clear presentation. But as Kate said she will be available as when management is necessary. Later on in the day and later on in the week to clarify anything that\u2019s still outstanding at the end of this call.", "So lets get started, diluted EPS was $0.70 and that did include and $0.04 negative impact based on the acquisition, of ADT France which closed on March 9. It excludes one time charges. We did reference the ADT transaction in the press release, so we are not going to spend a lot of time on it this morning other than to say it is strategic and to fit extraordinarily well with its GDP, general protection our French Electronic Security business and as Don will discuss in his guidance, we still believe that this acquisition is going to be meaningfully accretive $0.07, $0.08 in your tree on the expanded share base.", "So diluted EPS including the charges of $213 million was a loss of $1.9 and again Don\u2019s going to give you more of a granularity on the charges and their composition in the quarter which we believe to be quite clear.", "The gross margin rate excluding charges was 39.4% and excluding Black & Decker with the impact of Black & Decker for the three week stub period the rate improved 120 basis points versus the first quarter 09 to 40.8% and that is a first quarter record for our company. Free cash flow was positive $37 million excluding charges and payments related to the transaction. ", "Working capital was encouraging as well, reaching 7.3 turns excluding Black & Decker and 4.6 turns on a pro-forma basis including both companies in those results. CDIY segment, our largest segment profit improves to $83 million and that is up 189% excluding the charges. Industrial saw a nice rebound, profit rate improving 280 basis points to 13.2% again excluding the charges and as I had mentioned earlier ADT France closed on March 9. It\u2019s going to be a great addition and complementary to our existing conversion securities solution platform in Europe.", "The integration which I am sure everyone is curious about into how its progressing, we think very well and we are going to talk a little bit more about the synergy target and our estimates and Don is going to give you some detail on our 2010 guidance for the combined company which is now at $3.10 to $3.33 per share excluding the one time charges.", "So moving to the first quarter results of the combined company very simple and straight forward a 46% increase excluding the charges as you can see to about $2.70 for one Q 2010 and the charge is related to $213 million or translated to $1.79 a share on the new share base reflecting the timing of the acquisition. So, on a GAAP basis, a loss of $1.9. The only thing that might look a little odd is the minus 1.4% tax rate. ", "Just very quickly it\u2019s a one time event the charges had an impact of about 35.2% on the tax rate not all of those charges were tax deductible. There is also an ADT net operating loss impacting about 3.9% and the impact of the tax extender benefit impact which is about 2.6%. That gets you to a normalized rate of 27.3% which is why we have highlighted that and that\u2019s what Don will talk to in the guidance in terms of that should be your expectation going forward.", "Looking at margins on the next page we think it\u2019s important to note pretty strong gross margin of 39.4% for the combined company, as noted in the press release on a legacy Stanley basis continued its positive trend about 40.8% on a standalone basis. So we remain encouraged with the margin performance and Jim\u2019s going to talk about some of the drivers of that as he reviews the various segment results.", "Operating margin remains fairly constant around 13%. So, we\u2019re in a good place as we begin to go forward and combine these two companies and report to you on a combined basis.", "The cost synergy drivers are I think important to everyone. This chart is essentially unchanged from what we have presented on two or three occasions. So I won\u2019t spend a lot of time on it, other than to emphasize a few points.", "We continue to feel confident in our $350 million estimate for synergies, but there have been so many questions as well as the cost to achieve it at not exceeding $400 million over the three year timeframe. ", "But there have been enough questions on the $350 million but I just wanted to shed a little more light on it. As Don will point out in his guidance we are going to realize about $90 million of that $350 million during calendar 2010. So the majority of the year one achievement that we previously put in our model of course we only have nine months. ", "But in the nine months 2010 we\u2019re looking for about $90 million of benefit. But relating to the $350 in total first of all it\u2019s a very big number and as a consequence it\u2019s not easy. And I think its important to point out, if one just does, back of envelope math against the purchased base or the cost base and comes up with a number, it\u2019s really important to note, there\u2019s a couple of very large areas where there is absolutely no overlap at all between the two legacy companies.", "I mean one example and a good one is batteries in the purchasing area, our legacy Black & Decker spends about $300 million a year on nickel cadmium and lithium iron batteries Stanley spends essentially nothing, its anecdotal but its just an example of an area where there is no overlap, and on an business basis, the convergent security business is $800 million in revenue with essentially no overlap whatsoever with the legacy Black & Decker business. ", "So the base against which to focus on the up further synergies is actually smaller than one might realize at first blush. And the $350 million is a fairly aggressive number.", "Second the cost to achieve synergies in excess of $300 million may render the returns for those programs or those investments and those expenses unattractive. So while the number could be driven higher it may not be in the best interest of the company to do it and last but certainly now least as Jim will point out to the extent we achieve additional cost synergies we may well choose to reinvest to those synergies in growth initiatives as we referred to in our press release. ", "We intend to grow this combined business as soon as we\u2019ve got our synergy targets fairly embedded in the P&L.", "Looking at the status of integration over the first six weeks, we are quite pleased with where we are, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s on some of the major milestones, the first being customers and employees are very-very simply said our primary objective is to protect our core.", "We\u2019ve executed on a goal of a smooth close in the first thirty days as a combined company going well. We\u2019ve been proactive and positive with communication with employees and customers, numerous town hall meetings and market visits, Jim myself, Don Allen and the senior management team have spent as much time as ever in our careers in front of our employees and in front of customers. It\u2019s a very important part of the integration and we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And importantly let\u2019s avoid pitfalls we have thus far no major pitfalls and no major surprises, now that we are five weeks post close.", "Focusing on the cost synergies we have finalized the bottoms up synergy identification process and that will be presented to the executive steering committee in late May. As a reminder Brett Bontrager on the Stanley side who has got a wealth of experience in major integrations for Stanley and Tony Milando who was formerly head of operations for the worldwide power tools and accessories business co-leading this integration process, they are reporting to a steering committee of six people that include Jim Loree, myself, Don Allan, Mark Mathieu, Massimo Grassi in Europe and of course Nolan Archibald from Black & Decker who brings all the experience from that organization to bear on the synergies and the targets and what\u2019s a good business decision and what isn\u2019t. ", "That group meets quite regularly, there are 13 sub-teams focused on either businesses or functions. And as those of you who are familiar with our company know it\u2019s a very-very important part of the rhythm and rigor with which we integrate acquisitions and we\u2019re putting the best team we can on the field to ensure that this process continues and that its given the utmost detention from the top of the house right down to the folks executing the programs. Thus far all our findings have supported that $350 million target.", "Regarding the execution, we rigorously attract the cost synergy extraction and are quite sure that we are quantifying appropriately and not double counting. We are eagerly and rapidly deploying the Stanley fulfillment system on the Black & Decker base. I am really pleased to say that Black & Decker had a focus on operational excellence, it was their internal terminology, the elements and the fundamentals of SFS are being embraced, I think there is broad scale understanding of the benefits it has had the legacy Stanley over the last three to four years. ", "And that it can have on the business with a very similar geographic and customer base. So far so good on that, and last but certainly not least we\u2019ve identified or beginning to identify the revenue synergies and corresponding plans to get them. And I think it will come as no surprise that once the cost synergies are identified and we\u2019re clear that they are on track, it\u2019s more inspirational, it\u2019s more motivating, and it\u2019s more fun to grow the business than to take cost out of it.", "So there\u2019s been tremendous support around this initiative. So, so far so good, we are underway. No major pitfall.", "Looking very quickly at the geographical breakdown the purpose of this chart is to say that combining these two companies didn\u2019t have a tremendous impact geographically on the companies on a standalone basis. Specifically the large purple section of the pie showing 56%, Legacy Stanley, Legacy Black & Decker were between 55 and 57% of their business in the U.S. prior to the merger. ", "The primary difference being Stanley had a slightly larger presence in Europe and Black & Decker had a meaningfully larger presence in Latin America. But when you combine the two companies, you see that the U.S. is about 56% of the revenue, Europe is 25% and then Latin America, Canada, Australia adding to 14 and Asia and the Rest of the World adding to, excuse me, the Rest of the World including the 14 and Asia about 5%.", "Looking at our businesses by segment, again I think just two important points to make here on this chart. Even as a combined entity, we remain a diversified global leader and second, it is not a departure or an abandonment of Stanley\u2019s strategy to continue to diversify into higher growth emerging markets and businesses. ", "Specifically, if we look at CDIY, which includes the legacy Stanley\u2019s CDIY business, the legacy Black & Decker worldwide power tools and accessory business and the Price Pfister business which historically Black & Decker reported within hardware and home improvement, it makes up 58% of the combined total of the company on a 2009 revenue basis. ", "Security which is basically all of Stanley\u2019s Legacy security business, both mechanical and convergent, plus Black & Decker hardware and home improvement less Price Pfister, making up about 25% of the business and industrial which included Stanley\u2019s industrial portfolio and essentially the MR Technologies business making up 17% of the business. ", "The chart in the bottom to me at least is very important and it\u2019s very important that everyone understands it. In 2002, the large home centers in mass merchants, 7 customers represented 40% of Legacy\u2019s Stanley\u2019s revenue and the largest customer represented 22%. ", "By the end of 2008, as Stanley diversified its portfolio, those numbers became 13 and 6% respectively. Adding Black & Decker, 2009 base on a pro-forma basis moves those numbers back to 31% of the combined companies business as through U.S. home centers and mass merchants and 12% through our largest customer. ", "Not a tremendously concentrated business I think by most standards and while, we can say it\u2019s a step back, all it does is put Stanley where it was at about 2006 in its evolution. Its certainly not an abandonment of Stanley\u2019s strategy diversified, its simply a reflection of the math and that Stanley\u2019s been able to merge with a great company and a great set of brands at a very opportunistic time in the cycle. ", "Our strategy going forward will remain exactly as it\u2019s been in the past and as we\u2019ve pointed out on many times to continue to grow, to continue to diversify our portfolio and take some of the volatility out of our end results. ", "Looking quickly at first quarter revenues, I think the good news is here they are stabilizing versus the dramatic declines of 2009. The chart on the top I think shows that clearly from a holistic point of view but more importantly if we look at the segment results, what we see is the four sequential quarters for both revenues and volumes starting in 2Q 09 going through the first quarter and the first quarter results of course, reflect the addition of 3 weeks of Black & Decker, so the CDIY business and the industrial business are a little bit less representative, Jim\u2019s going to talk about that in just a minute but I think the important point to note is that within security, the rate of decline is slowing down dramatically. ", "The mix is strong, customer attention is as good or better than it\u2019s ever been. And it\u2019s obviously a less volatile business than CDIY or industrial, it serves Stanley extraordinarily well on the last couple of years with a less perceptive decline. And as a consequence the recovery, the market based recovery within the security business will be slightly slower. ", "But we are highly confident that it\u2019s there and in the mean time a very strong customer attention and a very solid mix in terms of recurring revenue. It\u2019s keeping on the margins of that business and a very-very safe place.", "So I am going to turn it over Jim Loree who is going to take you through both per segment results and add a little more clarity on the legacy businesses because we think that will provide some good insight into how the companies performed on the standalone basis right up until the transaction close.", "Jim Loree", "Okay. Thank you John, let\u2019s start with construction in DIY, the story here was very positive, twofold, Legacy Stanley drove a 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate on a negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well adding $30.9 million to operating margin and having an accretive impact on the operating margin rate.", "So let\u2019s break it down if we move to revenues we came in at 561 in this segment with an 85% increase 82 points of which were associated with BDK, five points currency, thus the minus 2% organic and that was about minus 1% price and about minus 1% unit volume. ", "Segment profit was up a 189%. If you take out a substantial contribution $39 million from the acquisition, if the actual rate was 14.2% and still a very impressive performance for the Legacy Stanley business as I said a 470 basis points.", "If we get in to the specifics the U.S. revenues and European revenues organically were both slightly negative, the Big-box customers in the U.S. continue to have tight inventory controls. Did not see a lot of rebuilding there, orders were modestly positive and new product development was strong, with the introduction of the Bostich hand tool line and Legacy segment profit improved 54% due to the dramatically lower over head that resulted from the significant cost takeouts over the last five quarters or so.", "Working capital was a good story going from about 2.5 turns a year ago to 6.8 turns with a $55 million inventory reduction versus prior year and only a $4 million increase in inventory sequentially versus the fourth quarter.", "So I think this is a very strong story here we will get into a little bit more color on the pro-forma Black & Decker performance in a few minutes. But I expect the next chapter for this segment will be operating leverage and as we look forward we are looking for a little more volume growth and as we get into the year so we should see some good operating leverage as we go forward here. So stay tuned for that. ", "Now interestingly as we look at security this quarter. One would say it was a challenging quarter, we expected that but ironically if we had this quarter two or three quarter ago we would have thought it was a pretty good quarter. So what\u2019s essentially happened here is security continues to kind of plug along it was really the foundation that helped the company get through some of the difficult construction DIY industrial market conditions and it continues to be very strong and stable. ", "Revenues were up 11% all of the growth in the quarter was due to the addition of HHI into the results. Legacy Stanley also benefited from the ADT, France acquisition which contributed three points and currency which contributed 3 points and currency which contributed 3 points especially get to the minus 6% organic growth. ", "If you divide that or look at the components of that, both convergent and security of the electronic business and mechanical security, we\u2019re both down roughly 6%. There were different stories, Convergent was relatively simple story, modest volume decline, slight RMR increased couple of points. ", "Stable operating margins, pretty much business as usual trying to get through the difficult market conditions but a nice aspect of the quarter for them was that the National account budget seemed to be loosening up a little bit which is good. However the core business which was the foundation of their volume story in the last year or so was week, so you had kind of a change in mix there due to that. ", "On the mechanical side, the volume decline was also expected but the operating margin did dip from about 20% in the prior year first quarter to 16%. Again a two-fold story here, absorption issues and the factories clearly contributed to that and then secondly some SG&A investments for growth, primarily for growth in Asia and for feet on the street in U.S. Got ahead of the growth curve which is not unexpected and perfectly fine, so that caused a temporary dip in the operating margin rate and we don\u2019t see that as a continuing issue. ", "Now industrial I think was a very positive story. I think its also indicative of the first signs of what a few points of volume can do for operating margin growth in this type of a business what we call operating leverage and also a nice contribution from Black & Decker\u2019s Emhart Technologies business which itself is rebounding in a very big way and again we\u2019ll talk about the Black & Decker activities in just a minute. Revenues were up 22%, 16 points of that was from the MR contribution, 3 points currency, organic growth was positive, 3% and that led to a 54% segment profit increase and without the MR contribution a 25% segment profit increase which is fantastic and that would have been about $30 million of segment profit attributable to the Legacy industrial Stanley business and if you go to the segment profit rate, we increased from 10.4 to 13.2%, 280 basis points and about a 100 of that was associated with the Emhart contribution, so 12.2% operating margins for the core Stanley Legacy business there. ", "So pretty much the story on the volume was a rebound in Europe and at Proto with Europe up 6% in volume and Proto up 14%, we all know what\u2019s happening in the industrial markets, it\u2019s a strong story. I think a little bit of that obviously, maybe more than a little bit, was restocking and when we look at the GDP, its not quite up at those levels and then we did have some weakness in our Vidmar storage business and our hydraulics business, both the Vidmar issue being driven by government spending delays and the hydraulics just a cyclical business which is kind of which appears to be at the trough of the cycle right now. ", "Now I\u2019m going to change gears here for a moment and we\u2019re going to look at the pro-forma Black & Decker Legacy segment performance. And when we look at this page and I can\u2019t help but think that the timing of this merger was excellent. ", "This chart shows the Black & Decker segments a rate on a full quarter over quarter, pro-forma basis. So this is how it would have looked had Black & Decker been a standalone business at this point in time and if we start with PT&A which is power tools and accessories which was a very large part of their business as you can see, they have 6% growth 1% organic growth, North America was the weakest part of the story although the consumer products group was strong. ", "Europe had a nice performance with positive 3% organic that was very encouraging. And Latin America was up 11% and Asia up 13% both bright spots. So good story there, hardware and home improvement shown here as HHI was up 12% mostly organic, U.S. Lock Set\u2019s primarily the quick set Kwikset Baldwin business was up 14% and Price Pfister was up 9%.", "Nice product introduction, in the mid point price point range in Kwikset, as leading to some outstanding success in the marketplace and also some nice rebound in the markets as well. And if there was any rebound in the market story within Black & Decker\u2019s Legacy businesses it was in the fastening in assembly segment which is also known as Emhart Teknologies and this is a business that sells productivity to industrial customers primarily automotive OEM it\u2019s about two thirds driven by global automotive production and about a third driven by industrial production. ", "And the story of course in the quarter was that the at the global vehicle demand was up 42% around the world with North America is up 62%, Europe up 25% and Japan up 53% thus Emhart which has historically been a mid teens operating margin performer, quickly rebounded from a trough last year of 2% to 14% very impressive performance from the folks at Emhart largely market driven but they took out a lot of cost in that business and they have got a cost structure that\u2019s really in a good place.", "So truly a terrific performance from our new colleagues from Black & Decker, this morning there were a lot of questions about how could this margin be so rich. And the story is very simple these folks took out about $300 million, slightly more than $300 billion of cost from the last five or six quarters before the merger. And their cost structure is in great shape and a little volume is going to go a long way towards big profit improvements in that part of the business.", "Another great story for the quarter in my view was working capital in the legacy Stanley business. You may recall for those of you that have been following the company that Stanley closed out last year at 7.9 turns we typically will have at least a point reduction in the turns as we go in to the end of the first quarter with the seasonal bills and so forth. ", "We were able to contain that to a much smaller increase, closed at 7.3 turns and that\u2019s up from 4.8 last year so a real nice performance there you can see good news in all fronts, inventory down 25%, receivables down 14, payables up 10% that\u2019s good. Total 34% reduction from 762 down to 504, but I just want to emphasize that these improvements are process driven by the Stanley fulfillment system.", "And we don\u2019t have the time this morning to delve into Stanley fulfillment system in great detail or the folks that aren\u2019t familiar with it. However will note there is a new section in the web-based annual report that we are issuing that we\u2019ll give you a lot of insight into Stanley fulfillment system if you are interested in learning more about it.", "But as we move to the next page here we can see that there is one huge opportunity and John alluded to it earlier and that is that rigorous deployment of the Stanley fulfillment system across the newly added Black & Decker entities will provide a huge opportunity for the company. As you can see the combined working capital of the companies although with a nice reduction from last year is right around $1.9 billion and that\u2019s comprised of $0.5 billion of Stanley, Legacy, working capital and $1.4 billion of Black & Decker Legacy working capital. ", "Now a little math, if we just annualize the first quarter for illustrative purposes, we would have $8.8 billion of annualized revenues. If we could get to the 7.9 turns that we ended the year at, that would free up $1.1 billion in cash, I mean it would free up $800 million in cash because it would be $1.1 billion. ", "So 1.9 minus, 1.1 is 800 million but I will also emphasize that this is, well its an objective, it is also a journey, and not an overnight sensation, as I mentioned, SFS is process driven. It took us 3 years to get from 4.5 turns to 7.9 but we as John mentioned, have begun the journey here and it is a very do-able journey with a very positive outcome and now I will turn it over to Don Allan, our Senior Vice President, CFO to go through some of the financial aspects of the quarter. ", "Don Allan", "Thank you Jim. First thing I\u2019d like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. ", "As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital ratio is 35%. We adjusted for the hybrid instruments that we have at 31%, exactly where we were hoping we would be as we put the two companies together, post merger. ", "A few other items of note here of significance obviously there are some large dollar variances on the balance sheet by merging the two companies when you compare to the first quarter of last year. ", "The largest changes have to do in other assets where the goodwill and the intangibles are recorded at about $5.6 billion as well as the Black & Decker working capital components being added in there about $2.4 billion on the asset side of the balance and then equity, clearly the issuance of the equity associated with the merger of $4.5 billion is increasing our equity and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the debt to capital ratio coming down from where we were last year at this point in time. ", "So we feel very good starting out our financial position as we move forward. For free cash flow in the first quarter, this chart depicts what free cash flow was excluding one time payments. ", "We had approximately $92 million of one time payments related to the merger and if you exclude that effect, the free cash flow was $37 million. Operating cash flow was $59 million which was an improvement of $55 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2009 and you can see that its driven by a net income increase and John and Jim just walked through some of the details in that area and working capital was significant negative in the first quarter in $90 million which is a normal of trend for both companies, they tend to have a working capital negative in the first quarter as certain inventories get billed going into the second quarter and then just the timing of the sales related to AR as we have a large sales month in March and that could drive our receivables up at the end of the first quarter. ", "So pretty much as planned with our working capital in Q1. Touching on the ADT France acquisition on the next page, it\u2019s not a large acquisition but it\u2019s something important that we should talk about briefly. ", "It really is a continuation of our strategy within security to expand our footprint internationally. We\u2019ve talked to many of you over the last year or two that\u2019s an important part of our initiative and overall strategies within security and this acquisition really allows us to continue to take that step forward. ", "By combining ADT France and GDP together, we\u2019re creating the largest market share company in France by doing that. GDP brings a strong core commercial orientation and then ADT has a very strong national account orientation. So by deploying these two companies together they mix well together from that perspective.", "The revenues are expected to be in 2010 to be about $125 to $135 million as I\u2019ll go through in more detail later. Last year\u2019s revenues in 09 were 132 million euro, about $175 million and the RMR component it is about 45%.", "As John mentioned earlier the accretion should be about $0.07 to $0.08 by year three as we look to remove about $35 million of cost by pulling the two companies together which would allow the operating margin to be approximately 20%. Once the synergies are completely removed.", "We feel we have a really strong and experienced management team in France that can drive this integration, improve their worth in the GDP acquisition that we did a few years ago and integrating them in to our worldwide business. And now then have the ADT France business integrated in to their local operations.", "The last thing I will leave you with there is a dilutive impact associated with operating margins related to the acquisition in 2010. It could be as much 150 to 200 basis points in 2010 to the CSS business and to the overall segment about 75 to 100 basis points. But that\u2019s just a one year phenomena as we go in to 2011 and 2012 we would expect the operating margin CSS to get back to 20% bar that we have established. We feel very good about that acquisition as we head in to this year.", "The next page is really the way that we begun to summarize some of the trends that we are seeing in our three different segments and then after that I will walk in to the guidance in a little more detail.", "We start with the CDIY segment, I want to leave you with two or three thoughts here as we head in to 2010 and beyond. We believe that we are starting to see an improvement in top line in our CDIY segment. And we expect mid single digit growth in revenue and that would be total growth on an organic basis and including currency. It does not include any impact of acquisitions going forward. So this would be on a pro-forma basis.", "We also are seeing continued recovering and merging markets around the world. So we expect growth to be stronger in emerging markets in both hand tools as wells as power tools and Bostich around the world. We don\u2019t expect the U.S. and mature markets in Europe as well to grow as significantly, but we do expect some modest growth in those particular markets.", "And as always we continue to be very focused on new product development, innovation and making sure that those roll outs help us drive more market share gains as we move forward.", "Industrial as Jim mentioned we are beginning to see a little bit effect of re-stocking throughout the supply chain. We start that in the month of March in particular in FACOM and Proto. And we believe these indications allow us to forecast or predict possibility of a high single digit revenue growth in this segment in 2010.", "This customer re-stocking is primarily the industrial portion of our businesses the automotive component has not been as strong but we do believe that it\u2019s coming likely in the second quarter.", "In the Engineered Fastening business we saw significant increase in light vehicle production in the first quarter we expect that trend to continue compared to the prior year and the second quarter and the third quarter which would drive revenue growth. And then a small acquisition in Engineer Fastening called FIT which really allows us to diversify ourselves stuff little bit away from the automotive manufacturing environment in aerospace it is a strategy that will continue to look as we move forward as a company. ", "Security talked a little bit about this already related to ADT, France but the transit I am listening here do not include the effects of ADT, France so revenue, we actually expect to decline slightly in our security business this year. This is late cycle business as many of you know and the economic recovery will come a little bit later as we\u2019re seeing some of the economic recovery in our CDIY business and industrial, we expect securities to see it either later this year or early next year. ", "So as a result, we will have a small single digit revenue decline throughout 2010. We are seeing recovery in the core commercial accounts and lagging international account customer base. Installation revenues continue to improve slightly but not significantly. I talked about the integration ADT France acquisition already and you can see the impact financially in 2010, there will be a slight drag in our operating margins as I mentioned. ", "A clearly commercial construction continues to be a drag on this segment and it\u2019s an area that we continue to focus on but we are also focusing on other verticals such as education and health care to try to offset the impact of that. While moving to our guidance for 2010 on the next page. Excluding one time charges and cost, we believe the EPS guidance for 2010 is $3.10 and $3.30 and underlining some of the assumptions in that you can see on this page, we start with the first section at the top, the remaining nine months of 2010, so this is just for the upcoming three quarters. ", "We believe the net sales will increase 4 to 5% on a pro-forma merge company basis and that excludes the impact on ADT France and that will include the impact of currency which we would expect to be relatively immaterial for the remainder of the year but I\u2019ll talk about that a little bit later as it relates to the Chinese RMB. ADT France will contribute a $125 to $135 million of sales and will be modestly diluted to EPS in 2010. ", "We believe our gross margins on a combined basis for the next nine months will range between 37 and 38% and so you see the blending effect of putting the two companies together Stanley and Black & Decker as it mixes our Stanley gross margin rate down from the 41 to 40% category that its been in the last two or three quarters. ", "But we also expect to experience some significant commodity inflation for the remainder of the year and if the Chinese RMB does revalue, that could be a significant pressure as well. So we\u2019ve forecasted the potential for a 5% RMB revaluation which equates to approximately $42 million on an annualized basis. ", "Exactly the timing of that and when that will happen is difficult to predict but we\u2019ve assumed about 2/3rds of that in our guidance. With that being said with commodity inflation coming and revaluation of Chinese currency, we\u2019re very proactive of looking at how we can pass on some of these increases to our customer base as we\u2019ve done as a company for the last two to four years. ", "It continues to be something that we\u2019re focused on and we\u2019ll continue to do that throughout 2010 but there clearly will be a lag in the timing of that as we\u2019re tended to see during its significant inflationary periods. One fact I\u2019ll leave you with related to inflation is that when you look at the steel components that we buy, to compare the average cost in the first quarter to the fourth quarter of last year, the increases have been about 7 to 10%. ", "We haven\u2019t experienced that as a company but if you look at what\u2019s happening on the commodity markets, those are the percentage increases that we\u2019re seeing. If you compare the first quarter averages to the third quarter of last year, increase is around 25%. So there\u2019s clearly as inflationary pressures that are coming. ", "We need to be proactive about how we pass those increases onto our customers and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on. Two other items to note related to this nine month period, the tangible amortization of approximately $55 million and as John mentioned, the cost synergy impact in calendar 2010 will be $90 million. That\u2019s about 90% of that $90 million will impact SG&A. ", "Looking at the full year, the bottom part of the page, our share count clearly is going to increase as a result of the merger but we also have the previously announced issuance of about six million shares related to our equity unit hybrid instrument that will occur in May of 2010. So the average outstanding share is approximately $150 million. ", "The tax rate should be about 26 to 27% as John mentioned earlier, the normalized Q1 tax rate was around 27%. So really, we\u2019ll be consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter. And in the impact of foreign currency, we would expect to be utilized current exchange rates. ", "We would expect that to be relatively minimal. Now that excludes the effect of the Chinese RMB. Anything that happens related to that is outside of that secret assumption. And then last, the structuring and related charges is not associated with Black & Decker or ADT, France will be about $30 to $40 million. ", "So the free cash flow assumption related to this, when you factor in these particular EPS guidance and excluding the effect of the one time charges and payments will be about $600 million for the merged company in 2010. The next page is a summary of the one time charges that we expect for the full year of 2010. And if you look at our GAAP, EPS forecast for guidance, we believe that we would be anywhere from a loss of $0.41 to a slight gain of $0.05 based on the exact outcome of these charges that was our remainder of the year. ", "And they\u2019re really broken down into three different components. The first is just restructuring cost associated with severing employees as well as closing facilities. And the range there is $245 to $295 million, $90 million of which we\u2019ve actually incurred in the first quarter of 2010. ", "Then we have one time cost of SG&A and the category that we call other net flow operating margins of a $100 million which relates to certain executive comp charges and investment banking fees and other advisory consulting fees that we\u2019re utilizing for the integration process. A vast majority of that was actually incurred in the first quarter about $81 million. ", "So we had $90 million of additional cost for the remainder of the year. And then last, an accounting charge related to inventory where we actually step up the value and purchase accounting. It\u2019s a non-cash charge, will be a $170 million, $42 million of that was the report in first quarter. ", "So, on a cash EPS basis excluding these different charges, we believe that the cash EPS will be $4.89 to $5.09. That assumes about $370 million of depreciation and amortization. ", "So to summarize this morning\u2019s call, we feel that we\u2019ve been very, we made successful progress in beginning the execution of the integration with Black & Decker. We believe the $350 million cost synergy target is achievable. As I mentioned related to trends we are seeing selected customer re-stocking activity in our industrial channel and signs of a bit of a pick up in the end markets that allows us to feel that a 4 to 5% revenue growth for the remainder of 2010 is reasonable. ", "We\u2019re focused on strong new product launches to gain market share and boost that top line growth as much as we can. And as Jim mentioned, the operating leverage is something that we\u2019re very focused on and we saw a bit of demonstration of that in the first quarter in CDIY industrial. ", "And then last but certainly not least, SFS we believe will play a very significant role in the successful integration of Black & Decker as well as our objectives around working capital. So with that we conclude the presentation portion of this morning\u2019s call. ", "Kate White", "Thank you all, its time for Q&A Louisa.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "Two things, first of all can you talk about the sustainability of the margin improvement which was quite remarkable in the core CDIY business as well as in the Power Tool business of Black & Decker, Power Tool business? Obviously you talked about cost improvement contributing to that but can you talk about the sustainability of what are pretty strong levels of profitability in those businesses?", "John Lundgren", "You said two things Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "That's the first part. There's a second part as well which hopefully I'll be able to ask once you're done with that. ", "John Lundgren", "", "Jim why don\u2019t you talk about COE and everything else that contributes to that?", "Jim Loree", "", "Clearly the story as I mentioned in my remarks, has everything to do with the fact that on a combined basis, these companies you know took out well over $600 million of costs, close to $700 million of cost in the last six quarters before the end of the year. ", "So that cost is obviously not all coming back and when the volume comes in, there is some cost add backs and both of the businesses but we\u2019re here to enjoy some operating leverage and make some selective reinvestments in growth as we move forward and we will monitor and allocate those growth reinvestments as we go but the expectation here is that we\u2019ve gone through a lot of pain both organizations over the last couple of years and we expect to enjoy the fruits on a more granular basis when you get into gross margins, both companies have a tried and true productivity regiment, somewhat different, we\u2019re taking the best of the best and putting them together in those cases. ", "I think Stanley has probably been a little more Legacy Stanley, has been a little more focused on pricing core competency in the organization and I think we have some opportunities to drive that through the new company and help drive some positive improvement in gross margins in particular in that area but I would also say that I think that inflation is something that we all need to be as Don pointed out, we all need to be cognizant that as this economy heats up, we\u2019re already seeing the early signs of commodity inflation, so there will be some puts and takes here as we go and we\u2019re probably not going to get a 100% price recovery just like we didn\u2019t get a 100% price recovery in legacy Stanley since 04, we got 80%. ", "We can get somewhere between 60 and 80% as a combined company, I think we\u2019ll be doing quite well but it\u2019ll be a lag time in that regard and that\u2019s why Don\u2019s guidance may seem a little cautious to some folks, including you Eric based on something I read. I think its probably appropriate, I think the margin rates that we\u2019re at today certainly seems sustainable to us but you know we\u2019re three weeks into our relationship here, so you know time will tell.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "", "And I guess the follow up, when you originally presented the targets, I think the original presentation was that there would be, I\u2019m looking at a slide that said $0.20 to $0.45 of dilution in year one and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts with these numbers I understand but can you help us understand how this guidance is up from the core Stanley Works guidance for 2010 the stand alone guidance you gave out of 4Q and so it looks like your guidance suggests that this is going to be accretive, the combination will be accretive in year one and the original guidance was for dilution, hopefully that\u2019s clear enough but can you just talk about what that is relative to where we started?", "John Lundgren", "There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes there. But Don will give you more granularity on that, we expected that question.", "Don Allan", "Eric, your exactly right, its part of the November guidance we provided. We did believe that they would be dilutive in year one, but keep in mind as you know there were some pretty conservative assumptions around top line growth in that November guidance around 2%. Total growth for the entire combined company in year one. Now obviously we are looking at growth rates that are more around four to five percent.", "Additionally we are starting to see the effects of the leverage from that volume, so you can begin to see the accretive impact of that. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that $0.25 to $0.30 improvement from what we were thinking back in November of last year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Perfect that\u2019s great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Lucas with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "", "Thanks a lot. And thank you for a lot of good material in preparation for this because I know a lot has to go into making this into a coherent form to us outsiders. First question, if we look within the CDIY business, you commented that you're not seeing a lot of orders in the home center channel. ", "Could you comment on the sell-through of what you're seeing there? And then the second question big picture as it relates to synergies, if you could comment early read on revenue synergies, of what you're thinking there? And with regards to SFS, how long do you think it takes Black & Decker to get the rhythm that Stanley has from an SFS standpoint?", "John Lundgren", "Jim this is John. I never heard four questions knocked in so quickly, well we don\u2019t have you on the buzzer but, let me try them all and Jim will jump into help. In terms of restocking and sell through, it\u2019s a little early as you know and everyone on the call knows the home centers close their fiscal books at the end of January which is always a relatively soft month for we as suppliers in terms of volume. ", "So when we shift in February and March we do believe its helping with restocking. In terms of POS all I will say is there is nothing out of the ordinary yet. And I don\u2019t want to say any more than that, the simple reason being without inventory there can\u2019t be any sell through and inventories have been so low up until about March that we think POS has been constrained, of our lack of inventory at retail. ", "So we\u2019ve seen no dramatic increases, we\u2019ve seen no decreases but the simple answer is it\u2019s one to three months early to make any kind of I would say projection or draw any kind of conclusion based on that.", "And I hope that its clear, so modest restocking, constant sell through, we think we are going, it\u2019s going to take a few months of inventories. Being at a more robust level in the stores before we can expect the kind of POS lift that we are hoping to see.", "In terms of revenue synergies its early days, we\u2019ve been in I would say file and agreement across the two companies that they are there as I referenced they are more, it\u2019s much more motivating and inspirational to work on revenue synergies. ", "But I have to say first and foremost, we need to be sure the cost synergy plans are in place. They are being executed and that\u2019s embedded.", "We\u2019ve only recently since we\u2019ve been able to put the two companies together at the very senior levels of management, top 12 people in the combined company established a process for identifying, re-sourcing and managing any potential conflict with revenue synergies relative to cost synergies. ", "Because conceivably one could get in the way or the other so there has to be a way to establish the appropriate priorities and to the extent of conflict exists resolve it. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there\u2019s actually a formal presentation at the end of May to the steering committee where we think we can, we will be a little bit more granular internally and that something material takes place. ", "Obviously, we\u2019ll be public about it otherwise we\u2019ll just talk about the status in out next quarterly review. Lastly in terms of timing for SFS, Jim said it best. It\u2019s an evolution, it\u2019s not a revolution. This is not a silver bullet, its not an overnight phenomenon, it\u2019s a very, very long journey. ", "I\u2019d like to think with the very willing audience and or if you will body and that\u2019s the entire Black & Decker operating and management team. They\u2019ve seen the positive impact it\u2019s had for Stanley over the last three years. ", "But I'll say our own experience. We started talking about it four years ago. We started really embedding it three years ago and it\u2019s taken while the improvements been gradual, it\u2019s taken three years to really, really, really see the fruit on those trees. ", "So I like to think we can do a little quicker because we have some more. As Jim pointed out, we\u2019re applying it across a much, much larger base. So that\u2019s going to have an impact as well but I think it\u2019s going to be 12 to 18 months before its appropriate to see any process driven changes that the result of SFS and I think you can expect steady improvement from there.", "Jim Loree", "", "And I think everyone needs to understand that when you\u2019re implementing $350 million of Synergies in a $9 billion company, while it may not sound like much on a percentage basis, its really all consuming and hence we\u2019re putting off the revenue synergy, deep dive kind of planning process, a couple of months and SFS may take a little bit longer to implement their cross to platform because we can\u2019t do everything at once. ", "So we\u2019re trying to sequence these things in a rational and orderly manner. But there is that huge opportunity out there and I think also the fact that there are fewer skewers in the power tool business than in the hand tool business will help us, the fact that we got the experience, the joint reference will help us expedite. ", "But it\u2019s going to be a very large undertaking and it will take at least, somewhere in the range of probably 18 to 24, maybe 36 months to get it done to that level. ", "And the last thing I would just comment on the revenue synergies a little bit. I had the opportunity to spend about four weeks visiting far flung regions of the world and meeting the Black & Decker folks and learning about their business in great detail around the world and starting to kind of frame out what the revenue synergy areas might. ", "And I think there\u2019s five really significant ones and some more that I don\u2019t know about yet that will kind of be surfaced during our betting process over the next few months. But they have a very strong organization in Latin America. They have production in Brazil which is expandable, they have a distribution center down there which we don\u2019t have and for those of you that are familiar with Brazil, those are both enormously important assets in order to be successful in Brazil which is really on fire from a market growth perspective.", "So we will quickly, as quickly as possible take advantage of that opportunity to gain market share with the legacy Stanley business down in Latin America. The business leader down there is terrific. Likewise, in the Middle East and Dubai which covers the entire Middle East and Africa region for Legacy Black & Decker and now Stanley, Black & Decker. Very strong organizations in the Middle East as well and a good infrastructure significantly bigger and better than ours in the Middle East, we will leverage that as quickly as we can and in Asia, I think we find that both companies have fledgling operations there. ", "When we put them together, I think we have sufficient scale to have a meaningful growth initiative in Asia and really leverage off each other and our distribution channel access and our talent over there, we were fortunate enough to retain both leaders from Stanley Legacy and Black & Decker legacy Asia and we have them now kind of divided up that territory within both of their regions, so they both are now we have twice the senior talent working in Asia and the emerging markets and then closer to home, I think well really, that staff the channel is something that Stanley has coveted for a long time and aspire to do better in and the Bostich hand tool launch is just an example of something that\u2019s really targeted at the staff channel but when you look at the Black & Decker relationships and the staff channel there are stronger then and their history is more successful in that channel than ours and so we hope to leverage that and then lastly in the industrial channels around the globe, as many of you know, Stanley has transformed its market approach in those channels to really drive a global platform approach across the regions and Black & Decker, well it has this entity called industrial power tools, its really far more construction oriented than some industrial but Stanley has much better channel access into the industrial and automotive repair channels across the world and we expect to leverage that as a revenue synergy as well. ", "So I hope that gives you a little color into some of the potential areas that could be very meaningful on a go forward basis.", "Jim Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott", "Extremely helpful, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. ", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "", "Good morning, guys. Hi, the first question I was hoping, I believe you touched on the home center trends within the Hand Tool business, but I was hoping you could maybe talk about what you're seeing from point of sale and new orders particularly as you exited the quarter across all the businesses there including the legacy BDK that touches that end channel? And then I had a follow-up question as well.", "", "John Lundgren", "I\u2019ve said everything that we intend to say up about order and POS at this stage, it is as you know, it\u2019s a very short cycle business, we\u2019ve only had granularity at Black & Decker power tools, orders of POS for 3 weeks and as they say, at this stage restocking has been modestly encouraging but far less than in the industrial channels and its too early to have a view on POS because inventories are only being gradually restored and we have only 3 weeks of data to go on.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "", "Okay, fair enough. The second question, I believe in the press release you guided towards $600 million of free cash flow for the year. And I was wondering if you could maybe give us some puts and takes as far as what some of the bigger drivers there are and how we might think about that relative to I believe the $1billion or so that the combined entity generated last year?", "John Lundgren", "We\u2019ll talk, there\u2019s a lot of one times in the billion Dennis and obviously the targets of billion plus on an ongoing basis which is a year 3 but we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion on that, Don\u2019s going to give you some of the highlights of where we came out.", "Don Allan ", "Dennis, the $600 million as I mentioned, was mentioned in the press release really has a very modest impact on our working capital included and so an assets what it is if you take the net income or EPS projections that we have, you add back the depreciation and amortization and subtract out CapEx, you pretty much get to that $600 million number and our CapEx tends to be anywhere between two and half percent of our revenue. ", "So even though the kind of boundary you will get to that number. The opportunity for us going forward is clearly continue top line growth and we are seeing the signs of that 2010 if these trends continue then we will have more growth in 11 and 12 but you know working capital is also a significant opportunity for us. And getting to the billion required a modest improvement in the Black & Decker working capital turns of about two turns. And that was really part of that projection that provided back in November.", "The other thing to keep in mind is that the performance last year of both companies had had on a combined basis about $450 million of working capital benefit in it and we don\u2019t expect that at this point in time and that will peak 2010 but as we move forward as Jim mentioned there is a big opportunity for $800 million of cash flow from working capital.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to echo the comments thanking you guys for all the disclosure, I know it probably required a lot of work. So maybe first of all you mentioned a little bit how you're expecting a little bit about your price inflation expectation for the full year. Is there any way you could provide some detail on pricing, when you're expecting to take pricing? Is that something that happens in the back half of the year?", "John Lundgren", "I guess Nicole always we try to be as far ahead of the curve as possible in order to maximize recovery of commodity\u2019s inflation. Steel is as Don pointed out he, he quantified exactly how much it will be, how much we think it will be, what\u2019s built in to our projections. But RMB is huge obviously with product both from our competitors and ourselves sourced from Asia, 5% RMB inflation, its $42 million on an annualized basis. The simple thing to say is when we see that inflation coming it will take one to three months for it to hit our cost of goods. ", "We would be out trying to announce and implement pricing. The second we see it coming, if you assume a six month lag in some customers from the day we announced till the day we get it. We have a three months gap to fill and that\u2019s what, Don\u2019s trying to improve. So simply said we try to be equal to or ahead of the curve, we\u2019ve done a good job, over the last three or four years driven by the central pricing Center of Excellence and people from that organization being embedded within each of the business units.", "And that\u2019s were we\u2019ll stay, we\u2019ll try to stay equal to or ahead of the curve and both commodities and RMB inflation are going to be very, very big external factors or market driven factors to look at. Importantly as it relates to the impact of RMB inflation, we are not in this alone, anyone whether its private label of the home centers or a foreign competition in CDIY they are going to be impacted as much or more as we are. ", "So while the numbers are big the forces in the marketplace will, our presence that will suggest we won\u2019t be alone in the need to achieve pricing to maintain margin.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "Okay thanks, John, that's really helpful. And then maybe if you could comment a little bit on how Power and CDIY core growth in 1Q compared to your internal plans? I guess I was a little surprised by the volume declines given the mid-to-high single-digit growth we've seen out of both Danaher and Cooper this quarter?", "Jim Loree", "Well let me start by saying that both Danaher and Cooper are far more industrial oriented than our CDIY business if you look at their before the JV\u2019s their portfolios and when you combine it together it doesn\u2019t change anything. ", "So you have to really if you want to get a Danaher, Cooper, Stanley, Black & Decker comparison or at least Stanley Legacy comparison. You really have to kind of blend the CDIY and the industrial results and I think you saw the surge in our industrial business as well which was very comparable to what they experienced. ", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. That\u2019s fair. And lastly for me, what sort of seasonal pick up do you guys expect for security in the second quarter?", "John Lundgren", "", "It\u2019s always the case that versus two in a, obviously not versus 2Q 09, but 1Q to 2Q, we get historically a good seasonal pick up in our mechanical security business. I think Black & Decker hardware and home improvement business will be a little bit less seasonal than Stanleys. ", "Specifically, ours is driven hard as you know by two things in Legacy Stanley. The tremendous penetration we have on university campuses and mechanical locking and most of that takes place in June and July which spills into the third quarter where we get on to the campuses to change a lot of locks. ", "That will be less Black & Decker\u2019s mechanical security business will not be tremendously impacted by that. The second point being our access technologies business which we love tends to have a far greater performance in the second and third quarters than first and fourth and its all weather related. ", "We have never had any slide availability issues when we go to install or in some cases, service doors or retro fit doors. That goes away. So what you\u2019ve seen on the Stanley side historically, we would expect again whilst we expect very little of it on the Black & Decker side. ", "Their mechanical security business is less university and large retail oriented. So essentially on our combined basis that the percentage increase which we often attribute to 100 to 200 basis, is cut in half just due to the business twice the size. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenhiem with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Dan Oppenhiem - Credit Suisse", "Thanks very much. You talked a lot about this in terms of the CDIY and the encouraging signs in terms of inventory circumstance happening much more on the Industrial side. In this guidance of 4% to 5% revenue growth for the remaining three quarters of the year is there any customer restocking built into that or are you assuming that it takes place later on?", "", "Don Allan", "", "Well, there is obviously is a little bit of customer restocking built into that. And clearly, we experience a little bit of that in the first quarter. And then, what we were to expect that continue in the second quarter and third quarter but I would say that a vast majority of that is really end market pick up.", "Dan Oppenhiem - Credit Suisse", "", "Thanks very much. And I guess the other question, just wondering about the, and think about the Power Tools. You talk about product launches helping to regain some market share. Do you think that as you deal with the Big-box retailers is your thought at this point that having the right products and those interests will help to you regain the market share, or is there anything different you're looking at with the relationship with them?", "John Lundgren", "", "Absolutely. It\u2019s about having the right product and importantly as the Legacy Stanley management team understands the Black and Decker power tools business better and there\u2019s still tremendous amount of expertise within the combined company, Black & Decker had a core franchise to protect in nickel cadmium. ", "So, on the one hand was slow to convert to the emerging technology of lithium-ion one of the reasons being the franchise that it had to protect. The products are available, the pipe line is full. These are the, this is the most powerful and sought after brand in the professional channel that\u2019s the DeWALT brand of course. And we believe not due to the effect that we\u2019re a larger company, we due to the fact that that we\u2019re a larger company, we do due to the fact that Legacy of Stanley brands and DeWALT brands are the most sought after brands in the industry and we have every hope and expectation to gain share as a result of that as we\u2019re able to put these two companies together and introduce our new products. ", "You\u2019ll recall from following Stanley historically new product launches take place in March and October and we start to see the benefits of that in the second obviously and fourth quarters. Every year about $100 million in revenue on the Legacy Stanley CDIY side has been generated from new products, we see no reasons why that shouldn\u2019t continue going forward.", "Jim Loree", "And these DeWALT folks and also Black & Decker power tool folks are very proud and capable people and they didn\u2019t take it very kindly when they missed this window which has cost them some market share points over a year and a half and I can tell you that the passion they have for what they do is going to be manifested in some outstanding new products and I think they\u2019re going to regain their market share both through product and also they had reduced a lot of their brand support in taking costs out and a lot of that brand support, its not a cost synergy per say and its not a revenue synergy per say, we are able to leverage a lot of our existing brand support assets such as our MLB programs we will see with DeWALT in four parts, probably already have and also in our premier football over in Europe, you\u2019ll see DeWALT at the games now and so around the world in our Nascar you\u2019ll see the same thing. So we really are beefing up the brand support, at the same time the products are going at a nice, I expect that will help the market share as well. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lisnic with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "I guess first question if we could just go back to the revenue synergies and you laid out those five as sort of the targets. I'm wondering if those are more, are they plug and play sort of initiatives. In other words, what sort of capital costs should we think about as you try to enter some of these or take advantage of some of these strategic opportunities?", "John Lundgren", "", "Pete, there\u2019s good news and bad news there. The good news is there\u2019s essentially no capital required to do what Jim talked about and I think he articulated extraordinarily well and that\u2019s the positive. ", "The negative is a lot of experience sitting around this table and throughout our combined entities, say as logical as it is and as easy as it sounds, it takes two to three times as long to realize those synergies as Mike\u2019s seen reasonable at first blush. ", "A lot of cross training on product, a lot of the fact that folks know and understand their legacy customers and product lines, that they need to be properly incented to go achieve these synergies without losing focus on the core business and as if you will qualitative or subjective as that all sounds, Jim and I and all the folks at Black & Decker, particularly in the regions, have all had the same experience. ", "It takes longer because it is not as easy as it sounds. We will get there with very little capital but its all about protecting the core while we layer this on and get out of them as soon as we can. We\u2019ll have a better flavor for what those are and how quickly we might achieve them as we live together for 3 to 6 months as opposed to 3 to 6 weeks. So stay tuned and at some point in time particularly when we get the entire investment community together for an Analyst Day, who knows a year from now and we put out some new three year projections we will have a lot more granularity on that for you. But no capital, longer time than you might be tempted to put in your model.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird", "No, totally understand. Thanks for that color. If we could just get back to the I guess the cash flow commentary where I'm a little bit, I see some optimism, guess you're doing $600 million in free cash flow this year. ", "And Jim, you talked about an opportunity of freeing up $800 million, but you also laid out a target of $1 billion pro-forma. Can you, you sort of set the bars for us when you're talking about the cost savings synergies and how to think about that. Can you also give us some of the puts and takes and why we shouldn't be more optimistic than your $1 billion target on the free cash flow front?", "Don Allan", "Peter this is Don. I think it\u2019s really going to depend on what happens over the next few years and clearly there is significant cost synergies. Jim laid out some of the working capital opportunities that we have as a company. ", "But also we have to keep in mind that those working capital opportunities will take some time to achieve. We feel comfortable that we can achieve a lot of them, but the actual to ability to achieve them in a 24 month period is much different than ultimately achieving them, so those are all factors that need to be considered as well as the volume pick up that we might experience as a company for the next two to three years, little bit of question mark. So there is different way that you can model it to be more optimistic clearly that we get you to something greater than a billion. ", "But at this point in time we still think that number makes a lot of sense and as time evolves as we go forward we will continue to update as we see appropriate.", "Operator", "That is all the time we have today for Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Kate White ", "Thanks everyone for joining in today.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Teresa, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Kate White Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.", "Kate White Vanek", "Thank you, Teresa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on the Stanley Black & Decker First Quarter 2011 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. ", "I would like to point out that our earnings release, which was issued after yesterday's close and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website, www.stanleyblackanddecker.com. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's first quarter results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session.

Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risks and uncertainties. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K, which we filed with the press release, and on our most recent '34 Act. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody.  If you will take a look at the presentation posted to the website, I'd like to first summarize some of the first quarter highlights that we experienced. Then I will say, as Kate has pointed out, this is the last quarter where we'll provide -- feel the need to provide as much pro forma data from the second quarter forward. Everything will be quite clean. As a reminder, the transaction with Black & Decker closed on March 12, 2010, so there are a couple weeks of Black & Decker performance included in the GAAP measures. And from second quarter onwards, it'll be clean. It'll be more clear. But we think the pro forma comparisons are most helpful to you in understanding our business.", "Revenues increased 9% on a pro forma basis to -- up 9%; on a pro forma basis, $2.4 billion; organically, up 4%. Strong growth in emerging markets, particularly Latin America. We had some great share gains. New products are doing well. Jim Loree is going to talk about that in the segment breakdown. And certainly, some successful implementations of the first signs of some positive growth from our revenue synergy plans.", "Diluted EPS was $1.08 reflecting a significantly favorable tax rate. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.92. Per the press release, the tax rate contributed about $0.12 to earnings relative to our planned rate. I'll come on to that again in just a sec. Free cash flow of $61 million was up $24 million versus the prior year. That excludes the $37 million of merger-related payments. ", "As a reminder, we increased our dividend 21% in February, and we've announced a $250 million share repurchase program that will begin in the second quarter. That $250 million program, when completed, will consume less than half of the $7.8 million authorization that's still outstanding. And I think it's important at this stage, Don will spend more time on it, but to be clear, the purpose is simply to avoid creep. Our stock is up 16% year-to-date, almost 30% on a 6-month basis and 80% since we announced the merger. The guidance we provided in our plans were for average share count during 2011 of approximately 170 million shares. As options have been exercised, that creep would drive us up to above 175 million shares. So with the repurchase, our current best estimate would be about 172 million shares is our share count, which is 2 million shares higher, even including the repurchase program, than was assumed and provided when Don provided our initial guidance for the 2011 year. That's hopefully will be helpful to you in your modeling.", "Commodity inflation headwinds continue to persist. We think they'll peak in the second quarter based on everything we know, and we'll recover 80% of that or more, be it pricing, in the second half as many of the price increases that we've already negotiated will take effect late in the second quarter and early in the third quarter. 2011 guidance, as a consequence, has increased to the range of $5 to $5.25 due to the tax rate favorability that I discussed.", "So far so good on the integration. And if we could flip to Page 5, I think it is important because the integration remains our top priority. So I think an update on where we stand is relevant for this morning's call.", "Our Steering Committee and our major footprint review group continued to meet regularly. We're looking at $165 million of realized synergies this year in calendar 2011. And in the first half of '11, we completed the end of a refresh process including all new opportunities, some of that we discussed on our analyst day, but we constantly monitor and update it formally on a monthly basis.", "In the first half of '11, several major footprint-related projects will have been either launched or completed. We obviously don't talk about them in advance to the -- publicly or make no disclosure until Works Councils, if it's in Europe, or employees, if it's in the U.S., have been notified and consulted. Some of those programs are underway, for instance, our Rock Falls distribution center consolidation, and some are behind us in Jackson, Tennessee. The others, we'll update you as appropriate, but no public disclosure on exactly which facilities are involved as is our policy and that just makes good business sense.", "We will have completed some of those consolidation this year. And by the end of year, we will have executed programs that represent almost 75% of our 2011 cost savings of $425 million, which as Don has pointed out, represents $460 million on an annualized basis in terms of cost synergies. And finally, revenue synergies remain -- the opportunities remain encouraging, and they're going to contribute about 50 basis points of growth already in 2011.", "Moving on to a look at our business by geography. Our largest market, of course, being the U.S., which accounts for 53% of our volume, was relatively flat. There were a lot of puts and calls that I won't talk about because Jim is going to go into it in more detail, with our Industrial & Automotive Repair platform, up; Mechanical Security, Hardware & Home Improvement, down; others, relatively stable. ", "Second-largest market, being Europe, with tremendous performance across the board, particularly in our Industrial & Automotive Repair platform as well as our Engineered Fastening business. Latin America, really strong growth. While it only accounts for 8% of our combined volume, that number will continue to grow. And as you see, growth in essentially every geography in the country and as the successful execution of revenue synergy plans continues.", "Looking at earnings on Page 7. As we reported, the $1.08, up 54% on a GAAP basis, excluding the $37 million of merger-related charges, which, of course, was a much larger number in the prior year. As mentioned in our press release and as shown at the bottom, underneath the bars, it was helped $21 million or about $0.12 from tax. ", "And as I think you all know, historically, we, and all other publicly listed companies, would estimate spread and then reconcile any tax settlements or tax reserves that we held. We're now required to report them, only when the audits are completed and fully settled, which regrettably makes for a very lumpy quarter-to-quarter tax rates. There is absolutely nothing we can do about it. It's an SEC requirement. We'll try to live with it, and we'll try to provide the best guidance we can. And Don will have a little more flavor on that as -- later on this morning.", "So the earnings were up. Volume leverage, cost synergies, favorable tax rate all helped. I've talked to the share count and what we think of the modest repurchase program we'll do to that share count. And Don will touch on it a little later in his guidance. ", "Looking at our sources of growth. I think, first and foremost, volume, up about 7% on the legacy Stanley side, which is helpful. Pricing was, again, with some puts and calls, by business was flat. Currency helped us 2% on a GAAP basis this quarter. And of course, acquisitions, overwhelmingly, Black & Decker and then several minor acquisitions that Jim will talk about, their impact and their influence on our revenues in the segment breakdown gave us an 89% lift in revenue. ", "Looking at legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker, just very, very quickly. Hand tools, fastening and power tools, essentially our CDIY segment, the legacy Black & Decker portion up 4%. Good movement on power tools. And as pointed out in the press release, hand tools and fastening was essentially flat. Nice performance on the 12-volt lithium ion introduction, which is really giving us a lot of traction in the marketplace. ", "We talked about Pfister and the loss of a significant number of SKUs in the line review early in the year, the impact that that's had on volume in the home centers. The Industrial segment, including the former Emhart or Engineered Fastening business, both those businesses showed great momentum as suggested. IAR plus -- and Infrastructure, plus 17%. And the legacy Black & Decker Industrial business, which is primarily Emhart up 12%.", "Security and HHI, again, legacy Stanley, up 4%. On the legacy BDK side, down 12%. The suggested Kwikset has performed extraordinarily well for the last 12 to 24 months. There was some meaningful inventory correction at the big-box customers in the first quarter, which did have a negative impact on Kwikset. We still feel very good about that business and its future prospects in the marketplace. So in total, we see the legacy Stanley business up at 6%, legacy Black & Decker business up 2% with lots of puts and calls. ", "Let me turn it over to Jim Loree, who's going to give you some more flavor on the performance within our 3 major reporting segments.", "James Loree", "Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. CDIY had a solid quarter in line with our expectations, except for the loss of some Pfister business that John talked about at a major customer, which is unfortunate but not surprising given the inherent challenges of that product line. I'll come back to that in a moment. Total CDIY segment sales were $1.211 billion, up 2% on a pro forma basis and up 3%, excluding Pfister, and up 4%, excluding Pfister and the exits of the various small Delta stationary and consumer auto electronics product lines. So really, when you cut through some of the dispositions or nonstrategic elements of the performance, a real nice solid 4% growth. ", "Power tools were up 4%. They really drive the segment, up 6%, taking the exits into account. Professional power tools were very strong with continued success in the 12-volt lithium ion program. And consumer products was flattish with solid power tools sales offset by some timing issues in outdoor between 1Q and 2Q; a few premerger SKU losses, some of which have been recouped already in anniversary in the third and fourth quarters; and the effect of the exits as previously mentioned. All of that was as expected.", "On a regional basis, Latin America remained a highlight, up 22% and up 19% with -- excluding the effect of FX. North America, up 5% without the exits. And excluding Pfister, the profit rate was up 90 basis points including, as you see on the chart, up 50 basis points to the 13.1% as the cost synergies and the volume kicked in and partially offset by unrecovered inflation, some of which will be recovered in the fourth quarter we expect. ", "Let me address Pfister for a moment. Back on March 3 at our Analyst Day, Jim Lucas, from Janney Montgomery Scott, asked a question and we answered it. The question was, are there other potential divestitures down the line, any, either in product lines or brands that are sticking out that are not -- don't have the potential to be #1 or #2? And I answered that question by saying, there's nothing really glaring except, I would say, in the HHI business, which is where we manage Pfister out of -- although it's reported externally in CDIY. ", "We have this thing called Pfister. And Pfister for us, we have to make a decision about whether we invest in that particular plumbing products, product line or whether we divest. And it's a strategically challenged business in the sense that a lot of what it produces or sells is actually sourced. They do a lot of the design work and it has a fashion element to it as well, which is not something that we love, and it's very concentrated with a few customers. ", "So it reminds me a little bit of the home decor business that some of you long-time followers will remember. It's a very good business if you look at the industry. There are definitely examples of companies that make a lot of money in plumbing products, but it would take a lot of effort. And so right now, we don't have the resources to put that effort into it. But we also don't have the appetite, as we sit here today, to do all the work that it would take to actually dispose of it. ", "So right now, we're in kind of a maintain mode. We'll see what the future brings. We've asked the team that runs Pfister to do everything they can to fix the strategic challenges associated with that business. And if they do it, it will only make it more valuable if we choose to later dispose of it. And if they don't, it will make the decision a lot easier.", "So when you step back from Pfister, it is a roughly $200 million business. It has 2% share of the global plumbing market. It's #5 in the U.S. with 8% to 10% share behind Moen and Delta, KOHLER and American Standard, all formidable competitors. And so the strategic challenge starts there. And then we add to that the sourced aspect of greater than 50% sourced, greater than 50% concentrated in U.S. home centers, and it's tendency to be a fashion business. So the challenges are obvious, and it's probably more valuable to others than it is to us. And the only reason we still own it is that disposition would be a distraction, with the integration going on. ", "So the loss in the first quarter of $50 million of annualized business was unexpected in terms of timing but not surprising. And we have to deal with Pfister on an ongoing basis, and we will.", "I'll finish my comments on CDIY with some thoughts on the second quarter. I think we can expect a pretty good sequential bounce in the organic growth rate in the 2Q even with the exits and the Pfister drag. Organic growth should be between 5% and 10% in this segment as new product introductions, even more new product introductions, and customer programs gain steam, the revenue synergies take hold and the timing issues between one and Q -- 1Q and 2Q work themselves out. So we're very excited and enthusiastic about what the second quarter should bring for CDIY.", "Moving now to Industrial. Industrial had a super quarter with sales increasing to $613 million, up 105% versus the first quarter of '10. The addition of a full quarter of Emhart and CRC provided acquisition growth, and legacy Industrial grew a very robust 17%, organically. On a pro forma basis, Emhart grew a solid 12% despite exposure to the Japanese auto industry, which production was down 27% in the quarter. And pro forma operating profit was up 400 basis points to 17.5%, incredibly strong performance from a margin rate and growth perspective, and strong operating leverage is evident here.", "In the Industrial & Automotive Repair business, sales volumes were up double digits across all regions due to market share gains in North America and Europe as well as strength in all major industrial distribution channels. And we note that revenue synergies kicked in, in the industrial and mobile distribution channels in North America with DEWALT products being sourced through those channels. And in the second quarter, DEWALT products, power tool products, will be launched to industrial channels in Europe, and the early signs are encouraging there. Now that's about a third of the segment. ", "The second third of the segment is Engineered Fastening, which is the legacy Black & Decker Emhart business. They had a terrific performance as well with their pro forma revenue up 18% due to additional penetration with their existing customer base and some vehicle production increases in the Americas and Europe. However, this performance was against the backdrop of 4% growth in global auto production. And they do have about $200 million of exposure to the Japanese market, and they're dealing with the headwinds from that and dealing with them very effectively, especially with the added growth in China that we're experiencing. ", "The Infrastructure segment, which is our subsegment, which is the last third of the Industrial segment, includes Hydraulics and CRC-Evans. CRC-Evans had a respectable quarter. Revenues were up 8%, organically, and Hydraulics had a terrific performance with their revenues up 49% leveraged by the strong steel scrap market. So in total, a welcome outperformance by our Industrial team, which helped to offset the Pfister issue in the quarter.", "Moving to Security. Security had a mixed quarter with pluses and minuses. The biggest plus of all was the organic growth in Convergent. At last, some of you might think as do we. The SSDS business in France, integration going well. The performance was super, and the Healthcare business, the core Healthcare growth platform, showed solid organic growth and profitability growth. On the minus side of the ledger, we had weak demand, market demand, in Mechanical Access. We had a sizable inventory correction in HHI, and we had to deal with inflation ahead of price increases. The latter of which was expected and not a surprise.", "The overall sales in the segment increased 17% to $557 million. Acquisitions were 12 points of the increase, and organic growth was accounted for 4 points. It was a tale of two businesses with the CSS resurgence and the 8% organic growth in the HHI legacy Black & Decker business down 12% on the inventory corrections. And as John mentioned, the underlying Kwikset business remains very, very healthy.", "Just to highlight a few facts on CSS. The revenue from both installations and RMR grew in the quarter, which was very encouraging, especially given that installations increased 10% and RMR increased 3%. And as I mentioned, the organic sales were strong in Healthcare. They were up 5%.", "For this quarter, we added a chart to help clarify the margin performance, and if we could turn to that. This chart shows the Security margin rate walk on a year-over-year basis, this time starting with a pro forma 1Q '10, which happens to be the same as the legacy Stanley, with a little Black & Decker mixed in last year after March 12, but it is the same, 16.3%. And this chart will walk you then to the 13.9%. ", "And we start with the impact of volume and inflation in HHI, which totaled 2.4 points. That's the first yellow bar to the right of the 16.3%. That was split between volume of 1.0 points and inflation of 1.4 points. Next was the impact of acquisitions, dilutive to the rate by 1.4 points. Then legacy MAS inflation accounted for 0.9 points of headwind, and mix in the CSS business, within the CSS business, and legacy MAS accounted for minus 0.7 point effect. That was roughly split equally between the RMR and install mix effect within CSS and weaker retrofit sales versus new construction in the legacy MAS business. Now all of that totals about 5.4 points of headwind, which was a pretty dramatic headwind within the quarter in the Security segment, but it was partially offset by a really strong performance in synergies and productivity, which provided a 3.0-point benefit. And thus, you get to the 13.9%. ", "Now of the headwinds, we think that about 5 points or so of the 5.4 were really, simply, timing related. So for instance, the HHI volume, which accounted for 1.0 point was simply related to the inventory correction. As we said, the underlying business remains strong. Inflation accounted for 2.3 points when you take into effect both HHI at 1.4 and legacy MAS at 0.9, and that will be positively impacted by price increases in the latter part of the year. In fact, because of the increase in inflation, it's actually made the whole process of achieving price increases more pragmatic. And then finally, acquisitions, with a 1.4-point headwind, they will correct themselves over time as the integrations proceeds. So what could appear to be a more challenging story than it actually is, a lot of it's just related to timing. But I think this -- I hope this chart you'll find helpful to understand what's going on in the Security segment.", "On working capital, I'll just touch up on this briefly, it was a positive story. The turns improved 15% on a pro forma basis versus the prior year. There's really no dramatic improvement in the numbers yet, in terms of absolute numbers. I mean, over $100 million is a good start minus 6% year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, and moving from 4.6 to 5.3 turns. However, the key here is that the rollout of SFS and the implementation of that initiative is well underway, and we expect to see good progress here as the year goes on.", "And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, which -- who will illuminate the financial aspects of this in a little more detail.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. And we start on Page 14, which is free cash flow for the first quarter of 2011. You can see that it excludes all the M&A charges or payments, which is about $11 million in the first quarter. ", "The working capital was a negative in the first quarter. So normal trends, historically, when you go back, both legacy companies have had a negative working capital performance in virtually all the first quarters of the last 10 years. And that's really just the trend of revenue as well as the aspect of building certain inventory levels for the spring season in several of the businesses. But the good news, from our perspective, is the relatively modest negative trend in working capital of $70 million.", "The other item of significance is other/restructuring. We had some significant timing of payments associated with various things, such as pensions and derivatives, that resulted in the $90 million negative. We do not see that as a repetitive issue. It's something that was onetime in nature in many cases.", "\t", "Moving down to capital expenditures, about 2.9% of revenue in the first quarter. So slightly above the guidance range we provided of 2.5% to 2.8% for the year. However, we still believe that range makes sense on an annualized basis. It's more of a timing aspect to it.", "The end result was $61 million of free cash flow in the first quarter versus $37 million last year. So a $24 million improvement, and in line with what our expectations were for the first quarter. And we reiterate our guidance of $1.1 billion free cash flow for the year of 2011.", "I'd like to spend a little bit of time on the next page because inflation is such a relevant topic to us and many other companies. And this is a page that I presented at our Investor Day back in March, and the focus is on the pricing center of excellence. ", "As many of you know, we have been very active in pricing actions and have implemented many of them, and we'll continue to do that as we go forward. There's two different aspects to it. There's one related to reacting to the changing cost structures, such as inflation drives in our business and how you respond with price increases to your customers. And then the second piece is more of a longer-term pricing alignment with the value that you deliver to your customers and making sure that your products are appropriately priced. Clearly, in the timeframe that we are right now in the short term, we're very focused on the inflation we are experiencing in commodities and how we pass that on price to our customers.", "We established the center of excellence back in 2004, over 7 years of experience, and we've gone through -- this is our third inflationary cycle that we've gone through since that started. We have 10 different business consultants that are focused on the analysis that needs to be done, which is really providing the data to our customers, so they understand the reasons for the price increases and why they're needed. We also have additional finance resources embedded in our major business units to assist in driving this analysis and sharing the facts that are appropriately put on the table in these discussions.", "As a result, we have over 100 years of pricing experience with all these individuals in our company. And they're really focused on training and coaching and mentoring our business units through a process like this to ensure that we're passing on inflation appropriately to our customer base. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we believe this year in 2011 we can recover 1/3 to 1/2 of the inflation through price increases. And in particular, as you hear about in a few minutes and as John has mentioned earlier on, we expect that recovery actually to be 80% in the back half of 2011 because of the recovery in the first half, due to timing, is relatively low.", "So with that, I'd like to move the Page 16, which is an update of our outlook for 2011. First of all, as indicated previously, our earnings guidance, we raised from $5 to $5.25 versus our previous guidance range of $4.75 to $5. The main driver of that is the tax rate, where our tax rate now, we believe, will be between 20% and 21% from the previous range, which was 25% to 26%. As John indicated, there's definitely a little pressure associated with share creep, and the average outstanding shares we're projecting to be 172 million for the year. So that's slightly offsetting some of that tax benefit in our new guidance range.", "The other thing that I want to touch on is when you look at the timing throughout the year of our earnings per share, there will be significant inflation impact in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And as a result, our EPS for the year and the percentage first half versus second half will be 45% and 55%. So what that means is in the first half of 2011, we believe, when you take our annual guidance, about 45% of that will occur in that timeframe, because of the timing of the inflation and the price recovery as well as the timing of additional tax settlements that are expected later this year.", "Digging in a little deeper into inflation, as I mentioned, the 1/3 to 50% recovery, which is causing that 100 basis point negative drag on our operating margin that we discussed back in January. If you look at the timing by quarter, we believe that we will see about $40 million of a net negative impact in the second quarter as many of those price increases will be put in place in late June and early July, as John indicated, which results, though, in the back half of the year of seeing us 80% price recovery on inflation. So we really begin to see the impact in the back half of the year, and then net negative is only $20 million for the entire second half of 2011.", "John touched on the share repurchase of $250 million, which is really trying to partially offset the share creep that we expect to experience and have experienced, getting to that average outstanding share number of 172 million. So those are the major changes in our guidance. ", "We are reiterating, to the right side of the slide, many of the operational components that we reviewed back in January, such as: net organic sales are expected to increase 5% to 6% on a pro forma basis off a pro forma level of $9.3 billion for 2010; the revenue synergies will add an incremental 50 basis points of revenue to that number with a modest EPS impact, as previously disclosed; the acquisitions of CRC-Evans, SSDS, GMT and InfoLogix will add about 3% growth to that pro forma base; our cost synergies are still anticipated to be $165 million in 2011; and our operating margin rate is expected to expand by 150 basis points or just over 14% for 2011.", "The one thing that I want to point out that may be lost in a little bit of various different changes here is that our Pfister business, as discussed by Jim, had a negative performance and lost some significant SKUs with a major customer. That's about a $50 million revenue impact for the year and about $25 million negative operating margin impact for the year. We're offsetting that with stronger performance in Industrial and a little bit in our CDIY business or hand tool and power tool businesses. So we were able to absorb that negative impact with outperformances in other parts of the portfolio to maintain our operational guidance numbers. And then the last thing I'd indicate is the non-merger and acquisition-related restructuring is still expected to approximate 2010 levels.", "So moving to the next page, a little bit more discussion around the segments as we look forward to the remainder of the year. Starting with CDIY. We still believe that we will see mid-single digit pro forma organic revenue growth. Jim gave you a little indication for 2Q and some of the nice growth rates we're expecting there, but the year is still anticipated to be strong in this particular area. ", "We will see operating margin headwinds in the second quarter from inflation, as I just discussed, as a lot of the inflation price recovery is in our CDIY business. The operating margins headwind in 2Q will also be impacted by the promotional spend as we disclosed back in January of this year and the timing of that versus lower levels of promotional spend in the second quarter of 2010.", "We're seeing really strong revenue growth performances across the globe in CDIY as Latin America will continue to outpace many of the other areas, as we really expand our hand tools presence down there through the existing Black & Decker infrastructure. The share gains are going to continue as we see robust product pipeline for 2011 across many of the business units. So we feel very good about the prospects of our CDIY business this year and going forward.", "Security. We believe that we will see low single digit pro forma organic revenue growth this year. We did -- I did indicate back in January that we expected a relatively slow performance from a top line perspective in the first part of 2011, which we did experience in Q1. It was a flat revenue performance overall. We believe that will continue to improve, and as a result, we'll see a low single-digit revenue story for 2011. ", "The good news, from our perspective, is CSS organic sales are strong. They were very strong in the first quarter. We believe that will continue. We will see a bit of a mix impact from installations versus RMR as we saw in Q1, but we don't expect that impact to be very significant to operating margin for the full year.", "We're very focused on productivity and pricing synergies and some additional costs actions in our MAS business to offset some of the operating pressures that we're seeing there from inflation and a little bit of lower volumes. So we're very focused on making sure that we're maintaining our operating margins across the Security segment and improving them from the levels we saw in Q1.", "Industrial. Fantastic performance in Q1, as Jim reviewed with you. We believe we will see a mid-single digit pro forma organic revenue performance for 2011. That may seem conservative to many of you, based on a 14% performance in Q1, but we do have to recognize that the comps, the comparisons get very difficult starting in Q2. As in Q2 of last year, we began to see some significant growth across this segment. So as a result, we believe we'll likely see mid-single-digit growth for the entire year.", "The Industrial & Automotive Repair tool business continues to exceed market growth, and we feel very good about the prospects for that across the year. The Emhart business, as Jim mentioned, definitely had some challenges associated with Japan, but the good news here is that production continues to be forecasted as strong in U.S. and China and in Europe, in certain cases. And we believe that stronger performance will be able to offset any of the negative performance we see in Japan as they begin to ramp up production throughout the quarter and throughout the year.", "So in summary, I like to just wrap up the presentation portion of our call today and reinforce five different points. The integration continues to proceed with success. We're very much focused on that. That is our top priority. The cost synergies are on track and in line with our $165 million objective for 2011, which will really drive a lot of that 150-basis-point operating margin expansion for this year.", "The inflation headwinds are real. We all know that. But our actions are swift, and we're trying to focus on recovery and have many things in place, at this point, that will go into increases in price in June and July of this year, which will result in that 80% price recovery in the back half of 2011.", "The revenue synergies are off, and they're progressing smoothly and yielding nice results, particularly in emerging markets like Latin America and also within our Industrial portfolio. We're very focused on SFS and rolling that across the company. And that will continue to be a cultural penetration throughout 2011 and, of course, beyond.", "And then last, but certainly not least, $1.1 billion of free cash flow is forecasted for 2011 as we really see the cash begin to generate from this great merger that happened a little more than a year ago. Our acquisition pipeline is robust, as we've indicated before, but our integration continues to remain our top priority.", "Kate White Vanek", "Thank you so much, Don. Teresa, we'll now open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Feldman. [UBS Investment]", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank", "A quick question on price cost. The basic expectation is unchanged. But in March, I think you said you didn't expect to get back to an 80% cost recovery level, actually, for a couple of years. What's going to change to make you more optimistic about the second half? And does this imply kind of that the first half is going a little bit more slowly than expected?", "Donald Allan", "Jason, it's Don. I would say there's a few dynamics happening here. First of all, we've had two waves of inflation associated with commodities over the last 6 to 8 months. We had a wave back in third, fourth quarter of last year, and then we had a significant second wave in February-March timeframe of this year. The fact that we had the additional wave, and it increased the negative impact of inflation to us, actually allowed us to have a more pragmatic factual discussion with our customers based on more significant inflation levels, which allowed us to get many of these price increases in place or they will be in place in June and July of this year. So really, it had to do with the timing of it and those two different waves. And the more inflation that you tend to have in one of these cycles, the more factual robust discussions you have with your customers and your ability to implement price increases. I wouldn't say it's easier, but it's a little less difficult when you're dealing with lower inflationary numbers.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, got it. And for power tools, specifically, obviously, very good results in the quarter. Do you have a sense of how much was related to share gains as opposed to market growth? And has you also seen changes in the competitive environment given what's going in Japan Techtronic's and Makita's position in those markets? We've kind of heard they're shipping less to the U.S. given the demand there for the tools.", "James Loree", "Yes. Well, this is Jim. The one thing I would say about the market growth is it's pretty soft in Europe and the market and in North America. And by soft, I mean, if you look at point of sale at the big boxes or the merchants, mass merchants, to see a positive POS is a good day for the total markets. So I think what we're seeing is kind of a sluggish bumping-along-the-bottom kind of market. And a couple of points have outperformance on share, in the power tools, and it's mainly the cordless, where I think that's occurring, and mainly in the 12-volt area.", "John Lundgren", "Jason, this is John. Your last piece on product coming from Japan, stay tuned and watch. You're well aware that the travesties and tragedies in Japan took place very late in the quarter. Any U.S. shipments or POS were already here. The supply chain is longer than that. So any impact from Japanese producers shipping to the U.S., as a result of the difficulties in Japan, would not have shown up in first quarter numbers. To the extent they exist, they'll take place in the second quarter.", "James Loree", "And I think you will also find that Japan power tool production tends to go to Japan, although there are some export. But most of the power tool production that comes to the U.S. is probably from China, even if it's a Japanese company. So their plants themselves have not -- we've studied the locations of their plants, and the plants haven't been impacted. The final finished goods plants haven't been impacted in any significant way from what we can tell, but we don't know to what extent their supply chain might've been impacted. We know that ours is pretty much unharmed with a one or two little, very, very small immaterial items here and there. You probably can count them on one hand. But as the Japanese companies might have a little bit more tendency to have Japanese subcomponent suppliers, and that's what we'll really have to see in the second and third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim. [Credit Suisse]", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a bit more about Kwikset. You talked about the inventory correction there. Where do you think the inventories are at this point? Do you think it's fully done in terms of correction? And just how are you looking at that in terms of the sales environment there?", "John Lundgren", "Yes, I don't think we can provide anymore direction, Dan, than we already have, specifically, inventories were too high. They were corrected, and we think they're right about where they need to be at this stage, which is why -- I worry about a lot of things, but this is not one of them. As Jim described, we really do think it was temporary. This business has performed, the Kwikset business, extraordinarily well over the last 18 months in terms of both POS, customer acceptance and performance in the marketplace. And as you know, home center inventories are always depleted in the month of January due to their fiscal reporting, and reorders took place later in the quarter than we anticipated. But that's a long way of saying we think they were a little high. They probably got a little low by the time the quarter was over, and we think they're pretty much in line with where they need to be given our customers' projections and our projections on demand going forward.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Great, thanks. And just a second question, wondering about the comment on commodity costs. You said you still expect the commodity costs to peak in the second quarter. Can you add a little, any color in terms of what's driving that, just in thinking about it for the second half of the year?", "John Lundgren", "Sure, I'll start. And Don, Jim and I are also extraordinary close to the pricing center of excellence and our global commodities sourcing team. I think we're probably all equally attuned to respond. If you think about the commodities that affects us the most, primarily it's steel, then we get into the non-ferrous metals, resins, and now that we're in the power tool business in a big way, batteries. But it's still far less of an issue than steel, non-ferrous metals and resins. We've seen pricing out through essentially the third quarter. So as Don made the reference, and it was a very good one, when there was very modest inflation in the fourth quarter of 2010, we absorbed it or tried to with productivity because it was not enough to justify a price increase. When we got it the second time, dramatic increases, particularly in steel, it was enough to go and get the pricing. And as Don suggested, most of it -- that we've had the negotiations. It will go into effect in June or July, and we think that will offset, at least, Dan, what we've seen coming basically through September. Beyond that, we don't have prices. And obviously, our prices in the marketplace will be -- are pretty much set up until that time, and we think one will offset the other.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut.  [JPMorgan]", "William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "This is actually Will Wong in for Mike. Just a quick question regarding CRC-Evans. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit about how that's backed up to your expectations this quarter, and also in terms of whether if you guys have seen any sort of weather impact on some of the operations at CRC-Evans.", "John Lundgren", "Well, we haven't seen any weather impact. I mean, the business, overall, I think is on track for what we expect for the year. It's a lumpy business. This quarter was not as robust as we would've liked, but it certainly was a solid quarter. We had 8% organic growth and low single-digit operating margins. So we're going to have to get used to the lumpiness of that business. I think we're all going to have to get used to it, especially when Infrastructure becomes a bigger part of the portfolio. But right now, we're more than happy with the integration the way it's going. I think the interesting thing, as nuclear becomes a little perceived as more risky in the wake of the Japan situation, I think natural gases and clean coal are basically the two areas that you're going to see a lot of interest in, in terms of helping supplement the energy base here in the U.S. And CRC strength is natural gas onshore North America, so we're right in the sweet spot if and when that takes off. In the meantime, the offshore business in CRC is a burgeoning area. I'd say, CRC brings more to the table in offshore and has a very small business there, but significant contracts have been signed in the last 3 to 4 months with the providers, major providers. And we really have a great value proposition. We see a lot of growth coming from that. So I think that CRC is going to live up to our expectations and maybe then some, but time will tell.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase. [Deutsche Bank]", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "So first of all, if we could talk a little bit about the repurchase. What is the timing that you guys expected? Is this more of an accelerated repurchase that will occur in 2Q, or is this going to be balanced across the year? And then also, is there room to do more repurchases based on how the M&A pipeline looks right now?", "Donald Allan", "Nicole, it's Don. It's likely that the repurchase, the bulk of it, happens in 2Q, and I wouldn't expect it to go much beyond that. And as far as additional repurchase, I mean, John gave an indication that we have approval of about double the size of what we're doing. So we could certainly look at that as a possibility. We'll have to balance that against the pipeline. As I mentioned in the summary comment, the pipeline is robust. And combining that with the fact that a lot of our vast majority of our cash is overseas, we are looking at the utilization of that. And hopefully, through acquisitions, we can do that in particular. So I would imagine that some we'll continue to evaluate as we move throughout the year.", "John Lundgren", "Nicole, let me just -- to clarify. The repurchase for the third time is to avoid creep get our share count back in the 170 million to 172 million range where we guided at the beginning of the year, and it has zero to do with lack of a robust business development pipeline. As Jim has pointed out on numerous occasions, and I think it's important to reiterate, the integration of Black & Decker remains our highest priority. It's organizational capacity, not lack of opportunity, that will allow us to tread softly and be very thoughtful in terms of which types of acquisitions that we think we can pursue. We're very pleased to have a position, from a balance sheet perspective, to be able to pursue some meaningful acquisitions. But if it's the same people working on those acquisitions that are working on the integration, that will detract from our primary objective. So that is our biggest concern, staying focused on the integration of BDK. The pipeline's robust. As you're probably aware, we have full-time BD professionals on every continent and a very, very active group. It's just something we're spending less time on, short to intermediate term, because we are focused on the Black & Decker integration.", "James Loree", "Yes. And I'd also -- and this is Jim. At the analyst meeting, I mentioned that our expectations for acquisitive capital allocation in 2011 was nothing substantial in terms of multibillion dollars or billion dollar plus. I think I said probably around $0.5 billion would be our target for the year with maybe a little bit more, but that's kind of the range that we're thinking of here. And so if anybody is worried about a major multibillion dollar transaction, you could put that aside for the rest of this year, at least. They're certainly -- that's not going to happen.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, great. Thanks for color on that, guys. And then in the outlook, what are you guys embedding for FX? And what Euro rate are you using?", "Donald Allan", "We're utilizing the -- as far as FX, we utilized the latest rates, in the last week or so. That's what we utilized in our guidance. And so whatever the Euro is a week ago, $1.43 or $1.44, in that range, is what we've utilized.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "And how much of a positive impact does that have on revenues in your outlook?", "James Loree", "Relative to what?", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "Year-on-year?", "James Loree", "Oh, year-over-year? I think that's just like 1 to 2 points.", "John Lundgren", "2% so far, Nicole. So our sense would be, unless we've missed something, that would be about 2% tailwind due to FX.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dennis McGill. [Zelman & Associates]", "Dennis McGill", "Thank you, guys. First question, just wanting to understand the creep a little bit more, because the $5 million, I think you mentioned, seems rather sizable relative to the $8 million of options that were exercisable at year-end. So can you kind of split that between new issuance and what's been exercised? And from the exercise component, everything you're laying out certainly points to a very strong market moving forward and results moving forward. So even when the stocks been strong, we certainly would hope that results continue to indicate stronger appreciation as we move forward. So can you maybe elaborate on where within the organization you're seeing those exercising?", "Donald Allan", "As far as the outstanding share creep question, the reality is, is that because of the rise in the stock price, it's not only the exercising of options, it's also the sudden impact of anyone who has options that are in the money. That has an impact on the shares outstanding and on a diluted basis. So as stock price goes up, it puts pressure on the number of outstanding shares as a result of that. And we also have -- you combine that with the fact that we do have certain tranches of options that we know will be expiring, from a vesting period perspective, later this year, which will likely result in many of those options being exercised. And so when we forecast that and look at it, it indicates possibility of $5 million -- 5 million shares of creep from the 170 million level to, potentially, 175 million. That's why we're looking at a share repurchase, which is about 3.3 million as John indicated, but it doesn't completely offset that potential creep. Now if all of those exercises don't happen, which would be unlikely, because if you have people's options expiring in a vesting period, they probably just wouldn't let them expire, they're going to exercise them. So as a result, we believe that's why 172 million makes sense.", "Dennis McGill", "Just to clarify in that point then, of the increase then, the vast majority of that is just timing of options that have already been issued as opposed to an new issue?", "Donald Allan", "Oh, yes.", "John Lundgren", "Absolutely.", "Donald Allan", "Not new shares that have been issues or new options. This is previously issued options.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay, perfect. And then the second question would just have to be around the pricing realizing there's a lot of focus here. Can you talk about, within the key power tools and hand tools area, have you seen announcements from competitors of similar magnitude? And if you had to think about the 80% recovery on a 1 to 10 scale, how confident are you in achieving that based on what you know today? Is there any uncertainty as we think about the back half of the year?", "John Lundgren", "The 80% is a back half number, which -- at the same time, inflation is abating, the price increases are kicking in. So our total price recovery is going to be far from 80% for the total year, quite a bit lower. And as far as competitive reaction, we are the market leader, so we have to go first in order for the rest of the competitors to make their decisions. And time will tell whether they follow or not. Frankly, our value proposition is so strong right now. We feel very confident that the price increases will stick. The discussions are underway. In some cases, commitments have been made. Agreements have been forged, in some cases. And we're not feeling terribly concerned right now about the willfulness of the channels to take the increases in general. Now we'll see what happens at the point of sale and whether competition follows. And we'll have to do whatever we do to protect our market share and just watch and observe and respond as circumstances unfold.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh. [Raymond James]", "Joshua Wilson", "John, Jim, Don, Kate, this is Josh filling in for Sam actually. I wanted to follow up a little bit on the last question with pricing in power tools. You talked about 80% realization overall. Could you maybe give us some sense of how much realization you're counting on in power tools given that's been historically a little tougher?", "Donald Allan", "This is Don. I would say that we're not going to, say, break it down by power tools and hand tools and Industrial businesses and Mechanical Security. But if you look at where we're experiencing inflation, the vast majority of it is in our Mechanical Security business, HHI business and CDIY and both CDIY hand tools and power tools. We do, as Jim indicated and I indicated, we do expect 80% price recovery in the back half. I don't see a significant deviations in businesses as a result of looking at each business component to that percentage. But you also have to recognize that for the year, we're only going to get 1/3 to 50% price inflation recovery. It's just the back half that we're experiencing. And if you look at previous cycles, there tends to be a period up front where you don't get the price recovery and then you get a higher percentage later on. But you rarely get to a point, across the whole cycle, where you fully recover all your inflation.", "John Lundgren", "And 30% to 50% for the portfolio would be at the very low end of our historical post-2004 inflationary era norm. So I think we're in a good place there.", "Donald Allan", "Exactly.", "Joshua Wilson", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then just a little bit of a modeling question with -- I appreciate the walk with the Security margins. Could you give us a sense of how you see those progressing as the year goes on and subsequent quarters?", "Donald Allan", "No, we don't tend to forecast operating margin percentage by segment. I think you can take the information that Jim presented. And he talked about things that he felt were temporary and things that he felt were permanent, and the vast majority of them were temporary. You can take that as an indication of the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Lucas. [Janney Montgomery Scott]", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "All right, thanks. No inflation question, but two on Security, please. Within CSS, with the installation growth, could you give a little more color of what verticals you're seeing that growth occur in? And then on the Mechanical side, where the legacy Stanley business has been a little choppy, any particular markets standing out? I mean, have we seen the bottom there?", "James Loree", "Well, in the CSS business, Jim, I think, without a doubt, it's the national accounts that we're gaining traction with. So it's the corporations and the very large commercial customers. What remains weak is municipalities and education. Government is modestly positive, although I'd say we're making good strides in government, from a share perspective, because we have a big initiative going on there. So that kind of breaks it down for CSS. Mechanical, oddly enough, the construction business is stronger than the retrofit business. But when you think about that in the context of education budgets being constrained in this environment and municipality budgets being constrained, I think it makes sense. We're not seeing any huge recovery in commercial construction. But I do think that there's a general feeling, with our people in Mechanical, that the construction market, whether it's our own execution or whether it's the market, that the volume has kind of firmed up a little bit there. And we're certainly not decreasing, I'd say, in the municipalities and education at this point in time. So it's really kind of a sluggish situation in Mechanical. We're talking the Best Access commercial, MAS, what we call, level. And I think we'll probably see a little bit of positivity, but not a whole lot. I think there are -- Electronics is going to carry the segment for the rest of years would be my guess.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And any update on the retail channel of what you're seeing there?", "James Loree", "Retail channel, it's very -- but for the inventory corrections, it's very stable. It's a point or 2 of growth, that type of thing. Nothing dramatic, but certainly no downdraft going on. And it's just -- what we saw this quarter was a little resizing in the inventories.", "James Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I was actually referring more to from construction versus retrofit?", "John Lundgren", "Yes, Jim. That remains slow, to be very candid. I mean, part of what we experienced in the second quarter was a large, very, very good customer delaying some retrofits and some store expansions. And a lot of competition in the retail space, on both the door and the locks side. So I guess the simple answer is that remains low. We think we've certainly have hit the bottom. But we'd like to see a little more robust activity in that, if you will, retail-end market or retail vertical as we refer to it, both for our Mechanical locking and our Access Technologies business. We have not seen it yet. And as you know well, having followed legacy Stanley, second and third quarters are normally the best quarters for that business due to a lot of work, no weather-related issues and just a lot more construction than normal. But it's still bouncing along the bottom, to be very candid.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard. [Cleveland Research]", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "One question. Jim, you talked about CDIY growing 5% to 10% in the second quarter, an acceleration from what you saw in the first quarter. Can you just give us a little more color in terms of what you see going on, and how much of that is end market or how much of that is new product or market share that's driving that improvement in 2Q?", "James Loree", "We're going to get a little end market, but I think it's going to be mostly ? Stanley, Black & Decker specific. We've got new product major initiative in hand tools through the DEWALT hand tools. We've got additional generations of power tool, product development that'll be introduced here as we go forward. We've got timing issues that affected the first quarter that won't repeat. We've got revenue synergies. I mean, everything's pointed in the right direction.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "From an end market -- and I appreciate that. From an end market perspective or from a channel interest in supporting or promoting or bringing inventory in the category, is there any change within that?", "James Loree", "No, the customer receptivity is as strong as ever.", "Operator", "Our next comes question from Peter Lisnic. [Robert W. Baird]", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I guess first question on the inventory, and just ignore HHI. Can you give us a sense in -- especially the power tools business, I would've expected maybe some pressure with inventory adjustment there, but may give us a sense as to what you're seeing in terms of sell-through there. Any inventory risk related to that business as you kind of look forward?", "John Lundgren", "Pete, this is John. I guess it would be naive to say there's no inventory -- there's inventory risk every day. We experienced it in HHI in the first quarter. But I think, simply said, what you're after, POS is in line with shipments and retail inventories across the board, to the best of our knowledge, and that's one area where we've really got good data, are totally in line with what we're used to seeing. Now there's a modest seasonal build because it's a busy season, but we see that there's nothing at retail to suggest a risk, in that regard, at this stage of the quarter.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, perfect. And then just second question on the Infrastructure piece of Industrial. Understand that comps getting tougher, but from the global Infrastructure players and suppliers, that piece of the economy is certainly strong and maybe even strengthening. Can you give us a sense as to how your backlog in that piece of the business is evolving? And when you say sort of a tougher comps in the second quarter and second half, does that apply to that business specifically?", "John Lundgren", "Let me start, and then Jim will give you a little more detail. The Infrastructure piece of our portfolio is extremely small right now. It's $350 million annualized revenue. About 1/3 of that is legacy Stanley hydraulics and 2/3 is CRC, which Jim talked about our optimism in that business but the lumpiness of it. If you think about the third that we've got a lot of history on, there is a very, very close correlation between our backlog and our future projections and the price of scrap steel in our Hydraulics business. And as Jim referenced, scrap steels, very high, relative to historical levels right now, which would indicate our legacy Hydraulics business is in very, very good shape. CRC-Evans is newer to us. And as Jim indicated in the segment breakdown, it comes in bigger pieces on a less regular basis. And to be candid, we really don't have the history with that business to project it quite the way and too read as much into backlog, good or bad, as we would if this had been part of our portfolio for 5 or 6 years. Jim, you may want to elaborate.", "James Loree", "The only thing I would clarify in addition to that is that when Don referenced more difficult comps, on a prospective basis, he was really referring to the Industrial & Automotive Repair business, which has been booming since the second quarter of last year, as well as the Engineered Fastening business, which has also been extremely strong if you look over the last three quarters or so. That's what we're up against in Industrial is that the comps for IAR and for Emhart are both getting tougher. Hydraulics is not big enough to matter in the overall scheme of things.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Michael Kim. [Imperial Capital]", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC", "Just a quick follow-up on the Convergent Security business. With the step up in installations, how should we think about the pull on RMR through the balance of the year as we exit the year? And then, can you talk a little bit about maybe the pricing delta between the national accounts and your core commercial customers?", "John Lundgren", "I guess, two things. We are not going to get into detail on the pricing between national and core commercial. I just don't think it's appropriate on this call. As it relates to install and RMR, as Jim said, install is up 10%, RMR is up 3%. We've been saying, for about the last 18 months, that our margins have been flatter, for lack of a better word, or certainly helped by the fact that installs were so low. And as a consequence, RMR, as a percent of the total, is higher and our margins are higher. So the shift to install is growing at 3x the rate of RMR is not healthy, short term, in terms of margins. But I think as we've alluded to all along, we feel very, very good about it because you know well, without those installs, the future RMR won't be there. Historically, we've had a tremendous national account focus. I will say that much. And the small -- the local or small- to medium-sized enterprises, as we refer to them, offer a great opportunity for us going forward. And Brett Bontrager, Tony Byerly, the North American team, are really, really focused on it. But we are not going to get into profitability by customer or by channel on this call or ever, if it helps you going forward.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC", "And then just maybe to clarify with the neutral impact to the balance of fiscal year on the mix of installation and RMR. Can you clarify what are the puts or takes then to drive sort of a flat operating margin performance for the balance of the year?", "Donald Allan", "Yes. I think our [indiscernible] -- and frankly, the impact wasn't that significant in Q1. It's not going to be that significant throughout the year. It's a relatively small impact of 20 to 30 basis points on the Security sector, and it's not something that we should be overly concerned about as a result of this year and going forward.", "Operator", "That was our last question. I will now turn it back to you for any final remarks.", "Kate White Vanek", "Thank you all for joining our call today. Again, if you have any questions or need any sort of follow-up, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.", "Operator", "And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Ms. Vanek, you may begin.", "Kate White Vanek", "Thanks so much, John and good morning, all and thank you for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, are: John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.

Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements and Form 8-K, which we filed with the press release and our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Just -- I'm going to touch on some highlights before Jim gets into some more detail on the segments but as we look back on the second quarter, we remain on a steady course of organic growth despite an unfavorable macroeconomic backdrop. We did get some better news this morning that Jim and Don will touch on as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But nonetheless, our performance and the organic growth we were able to achieve were driven primarily by new products that we introduced to the market, where we gained share in established markets and continued strong performance in the emerging markets. Again, that -- I'll touch on it a little later.", "Second quarter revenues were up 11% to $2.6 billion, organically plus 3%. And that, of course, excludes the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Organic growth in Power Tools and Accessories, Industrial and our Convergent Security Solutions was somewhat muted by weakness in Hand Tools, Outdoor Products and ongoing Pfister impact. Don talked about the Pfister impact in the first quarter, but just to shed a little more light on Outdoor, which we referenced in the press release, particularly for those of you who are less familiar with that business, Outdoor is a $550 million to $600 million business, and it is one of the few businesses that's quite seasonal. It's split roughly 60/40 first half, second half historically, with the second quarter almost every year being the largest quarter. We all know there was -- across the country the weather was terrible in the second quarter regardless of where we were. ", "But just in round numbers, it's just math, the 20% decline in the second quarter unrecovered on an annual basis is almost 70 basis points of organic growth across the entire company. So just take that in mind as Don is doing his outlook and the fact that we lowered organic growth estimates for the year, 100 basis points. The overwhelming majority of that is the result of Pfister business that we did -- excuse me, of Outdoor business that we didn't achieve in the second quarter, much of which, based on history, is gone and won't be recovered. ", "Our EPS was $1.46, excludes M&A charges and does reflect the $0.28 benefit attributable to the favorable tax settlement of the outstanding tax contingencies. GAAP EPS of $1.14 includes the M&A related charges and the $1.18 excludes the charges and as well as the favorable settlement. And that was in line with management's expectations and the direction that Don gave on our first quarter call, that approximately 45% of our core earnings would be achieved in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, based on the way the year was rolling forward for us. ", "13.6% operating margin, again, that excludes the charges. 120 basis point sequential increase in CDIY. Security, profitability to total segment increased 300 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points VPY or versus second quarter 2010. And Industrial increased 110 basis points versus the second quarter of 2010.", "Our integration remains on track. In fact, it remains ahead of plan. Good progress there and we -- as the year progresses, we were able to shed some more light on that. We've been able to accelerate some of the 2011 cost synergy realization, specifically by $35 million. So our total synergy target, we've been able to raise from -- to $450 million by the end of 2012, that's up from $425 million. And for clarity, that means the annualized impact at the end of 2012 goes from $460 million to $485 million. ", "Last but not least, as it relates to the integration, you won't see this in the numbers directly but we just completed a global employee survey, and it yielded very positive results as it relates to the cultural integration of these 2 companies. As we said at the time of the merger, there were many similarities but there were also some differences in these 2 companies, and we were very, very encouraged that 12 to 15 months later, that we received the kind of results that we did from this survey that in general suggests everyone's on the same page, everyone's focused on the same objectives, everyone's motivated, and while that won't show up directly in the numbers, I think we all know it will show up long term in the numbers and we took a lot of comfort from that survey, and it validated -- further validated the success thus far of the integration, both on a qualitative as well as quantitative perspective. ", "Working capital, another good story. Turns increased 14% to 5.8 as SFS operational principles are expanded and embedded across a larger business base. Looking at the integration specifically in some of the key milestones, the biggest news, as I think was quite clear in the press release, is that we're moving $35 million forward into -- from 2012 into 2011, yet holding 2012. So essentially, we're $100 million higher than our original estimate and we're getting it 3 months earlier. So it's, all in all, a continued good story. ", "Looking at the top left of the chart, we were able to do that because our Synergy Steering Committee continues to meet quite regularly. We did our annual refresh process and we identified $25 million of additional opportunities. Several of our major footprint-related projects that we've talked about have been launched, and we've said these are -- but even more important, we track these carefully because there is much more interdependency, there's more complexity. Some of the months that we've talked about are in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, Rock Falls, Jackson, Tennessee, all underway or nearing completion. We recently announced plans as it relates to our Redding, Pennsylvania facility. There are others in Europe that need to be worked through, our work councils, unions and employees, et cetera, that are not yet announced. But much in North America, underway or completed, Europe's starting to roll, and we continue to be very confident about our ability to achieve all of the objectives that we've identified in conjunction with those programs.", "By the second half of '11, we'll have completed the 2 major distribution center and 3 major plant consolidations. And relative to the numbers that we've talked about, by the end of 2011, we will have executed projects that represent 75% of the 2012 cost savings of about $425 million. And that was what we've said as little as 3 months ago. What we're doing with our update is saying that by the end of '11, we will have executed projects now that represent almost 85% of the 2012 savings of $450 million. So 10% of higher completion rate of a pool that's $25 million higher than we estimated at 3 months ago. So, needless to say, we are a; pleased, and b; confident. Pleased with the progress thus far and confident in our ability to continue with that pace. ", "Last but not least on the integration, compelling revenue synergies opportunities continue to surface and grow. DeWalt Tools, through the Industrial channels, Hand Tools in Latin America are among the 2 largest successes to date, and Jim will talk a little bit about those when he reviews the segments. So we're in a good place on cost synergies that allowed us to raise our estimate, which is a good thing in the face of this current economic environment.", "Looking really quickly at the region, revenue and profit growth continues to be driven by the emerging markets, really good story. The emerging markets now account for 15% of our total revenue. That's up from 11% at the end of 2010. So these markets continue to grow. We're dedicating both financial and human resources to these markets because we recognize what an important part of our future they represent. ", "In North America, on the left, organic growth of 1%. Lot of puts and calls, Jim's going to come on to those so -- in the interest of time and not wanting to duplicate efforts. I'll move on to Europe, which is our second largest geography, where organic growth was 2%. It represents 24% of the company, and Industrial performed very well in Europe. CDIY was soft but all in, we were able to achieve 2% organic growth, which is a good story in Europe.", "Latin America, up 26%, now represents 9% of our total company's revenues. We're really pleased. Canada was down 7%, primarily Weiser Locks within the MAS segment or HHI. It's a new neighbor to outdoor in terms of a lot of it is weather related, and we don't regard that as a continuing trend but it did have an impact on organic growth in the quarter. Canada, 6% of our revenue and it was down 7%, so the numbers are clear. We remain pleased with our performance in Asia. It represents 5% of the company, organically up 4%, but if you see the blue balloon, excluding Engineered Fastening in Japan, Asia organic growth was up 15%. Jim is going to talk about this a little bit in the segments about Emhart, but Japan is bouncing back nicely from the tragedy that they suffered late in the first quarter. Our largest Engineered Fastening customer is up to about 80% of its historical production levels as that gradually becomes a more normal working environment. But considering the importance of Japan to our Emhart or Engineered Fastening business, we're quite pleased with our performance in Asia as well.", "Moving on to the sources of growth, as mentioned in my first bullet point, Power Tools, Industrial and Convergent Security, they posted the more solid organic growth during the quarter, and that was partially offset by weakness in our Mechanical Security business, the Outdoor that we've talked about, and the Pfister issues that we absorbed in the first quarter, but will be with us throughout the year. Really quickly, volume was up 3%. Price was flat. A lot of puts and calls, but for the quarter, as Don guided, price was flat in the second quarter, consistent with our expectations. Currency added 5%, acquisitions another 3%, so that gets us to our 11% total revenue.", "Looking at some of our larger businesses. Industrial continues to be a really positive story, 9% organic growth. Hand Tools, Fastening & Power Tools together or our core tool businesses, if you will, up 7%. Convergent Security, up 4%; Mechanical Access, down 1%; Outdoor Home, down 17%; and Pfister, 21%. A lot of puts and calls but at the end of the day, 3% organic growth across the entire system, and Jim will give you a little more detail on each of the segments as he walks through those. ", "I'll turn it over to him.", "James Loree", "Okay. Thank you, John. Let's start with CDIY. Second quarter CDIY revenue was $1.364 billion, up 5%. Excluding FX, sales were flat. Price was flat. That's the tier of Delta Woodworking and the consumer auto electronics product line cost 2 points, and that basically offset the 2 points of unit volume growth. ", "Operating profit was $195 million, down 3% versus 2Q '10 but profit rate was 14.3%, off 120 basis points versus a year ago, but up 120 basis points sequentially. That's almost $40 million of inflation in the quarter, which was expected, that would offset the benefit of synergies. Now, the pricing actions that we've taken do not take hold until the third quarter. So some of this margin degradation that was associated with the inflation was definitely anticipated. The organic growth was a little weaker than expected. As John mentioned, it was 2%. There was a lot going on behind that number, certainly, as we already talked about to some extent. Pfister was a headwind of about 2 points, the divestitures, I mentioned, were another 2 points and the lost outdoor season that John described cost us 1 point, so total headwinds of about 5 points. So if you take the 2% growth with those headwinds, the rest of the segment actually had a terrific performance in this kind of a market, up 7%. ", "And if you look at the organic growth chart there, you can see the Professional Power Tools & Accessories and Consumer Power Tools were both significantly positive, with Professional Power Tools & Accessories up 13% and Consumer Power Tools up 7%. So very, very good performances fueled by the new product introductions, some of the revenue synergies and a very successful quarter from that perspective for those units. Hand Tools and Fastening, it doesn't have quite -- to the same extent of new product activity and you can see, although it does have the DeWalt Hand Tools, which we began shipping in the quarter, was slightly negative. And then the Outdoor and Home Products part of the company or part of the segment was down 17%. So I'd say in light of the weak market, it was still a very strong performance. ", "So in the face of this weaker than already weak market that we predicted, as well as a hefty dose of inflation, as we also predicted, CDIY held its own and now looks forward to a stronger second half with little-to-no help expected from the markets, although there was some encouraging news this morning on housing starts, which I'm sure everyone has seen, it would emphasize that we haven't really built any of that into our forecasts. We think that we'll have this better performance in the second half from an organic growth perspective because the revenue synergies will continue, our pricing actions will kick in, the 18 volt, 20 volt cordless launch and the DeWalt Hand Tools launch will also gain momentum in the second half and it should be a pretty good story, and who knows, with a little help possibly from the market that we haven't built in. So that's CDIY.", "Moving now to Security. In Security, second quarter revenue was $622 million, up 9%, 5 points from acquisitions, 3 points from currency, 1 point organic. Operating profit was $103 million, which was up 16%. The profit rate was 16.8%, up 120 basis points versus a year ago and 290 basis points sequentially, and without the acquisitions, the profit rate was actually 17.6% due to the dilutive impact of the GMT and InfoLogix acquisitions in their early stages. The profit growth derived from synergies associated with the merger, productivity projects, very strong performance there and tight SG&A control, which more than offset the inflation.", "Moving to organic growth, the Convergent business was up 4% and that was a very encouraging performance given that installs outpaced RMR growth and national accounts showed very strong signs of life. So we continue to see progress in the CSS area, and I would expect to see that continue as we go forward. The Mechanical business or MAS as it's called here, residential is flattish to down 1 point, access technologies, the automatic door business, was off 4 points organic growth. And that was driven, actually, by their largest customer who has cut back on some remodeling scope as the year has progressed. And then the commercial locking business, I thought was quite encouraging with organic growth of 3 points. And you can start to see the benefit of a little life in the commercial markets in the U.S. affecting that. So the Electronic business is showing signs of better growth, momentum is growing there, Mechanical, still dealing with weak markets, although Commercial looks more promising, both businesses are managing margins and profit growth effectively. ", "And then just going to the geographic mix for a minute, it's one of our issues with this business, for a long time, has been the fact that it is so North-American-centric. And that's not surprising since we basically created this business almost from nothing, about 7 or 8 years ago. And today, it's a $2.4 billion business, roughly. But at 77%, North American right now and with the recently announced Niscayah acquisition, this issue is going to be addressed. This will add about $250 million of revenue per quarter to our Security segment, of which, 85% is outside the U.S. and it will take the non-North American content of this segment to over 50% of the revenue. So that's some very encouraging news.", "And speaking of Niscayah, just a couple of brief comments on that. On June 27, we announced the offer. This week, we were notified or we -- the mandatory waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino expired, so the U.S. has given us the greenlight for the transaction as it relates to antitrust. EU approval is still pending. The process with the Swedish company is -- the Swedish regulators and the EU work in tandem. We have filed -- we have been in contact with the authorities. We filed the paperwork that's necessary. We expect to hear some news in the next few days and we're hoping that the EU commission will confirm that it has no further questions and that we will be able to take the next step if all goes well there, with short form clearance. And then, we will begin a 30-day offer period, which will enable the shareholders to tender their shares and we will, at the end of that 30 days, determine if 90% of the shares have been tendered. If so, the offer will go unconditional, and we'll close shortly thereafter. I will remind everybody that the acquisition, if successful which we hope it will be, is highly accretive, with $0.20 of accretion in year 1 and $0.45 in year 3, most of which, we'll begin to see the impact of in 2012 as -- if the transaction closes as expected.", "Moving on to Industrial. Industrial is once again a strong sales and profit growth driver for the company. Second quarter revenue was $636 million, up 29%. Acquisitions provided 13 points of growth, FX accounted for 7 points, organic growth was 9 points or 9%, including 2 points of price. Operating profit was $98 million, up $27 million or 38% and it came in at 15.4%, up 110 basis points versus 2Q '10 and down 210 basis points sequentially. If we go to the organic growth chart there, we can see the Industrial & Automotive Repair business had an exceptional performance, with 13% organic growth and a terrific performance in North America, with both Mac and Proto up almost 20% each organically, with very strong operating margins, and storage sales were also strong. ", "And just as a sidenote, we've just opened up a new Vidmar plant in China, which can make the high-end Vidmar cabinets of the same quality and performance in China as we make in Allentown, Pennsylvania. They will be for the Asian market and not for import into the U.S. for the most part. ", "Engineered Fastening was up 6%, which was a heroic effort, I think, given the tremendous difficulties that we had in Japan, with production down in Japan, automotive production down 40%. And in the quarter, Japanese auto production was reduced to 8% of global production, down from 13% a year ago. So for -- in total, global auto production was down 2% for the quarter. So for these folks to be up 6%, that truly is a great story involving increased penetration of fasteners, new products and good nameplate mix. So great story there. ", "CRC-Evans performed well, with revenue up mid-single digits, and despite a slow natural gas pipeline market in the U.S., in North America. And hydraulics, some -- a business we don't often talk about when we talk about the quarter here because they're only 10% of the segment, was up 40%. So a huge growth driver in the segment, with really strong markets and really great performance in handheld, railroad and their mounted product lines. ", "So the entire segment was a terrific story. It looks like it will continue to perform well in the second half, although we think the growth rates may moderate somewhat, but the profit rate and the momentum will continue. ", "Now, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about working capital on Page 12. We're very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter, where working capital turns increased 14% and revenue increased 11%. It grew 11% as you heard from John earlier. So that means our turns went from 5.1 to 5.8 turns year-over-year, which is an excellent performance. And sequentially, they went from 5.3 turns up to that 5.8 number, which was about a 9% improvement. ", "What I find really encouraging about this particular chart is when you look at the aspects of rolling out the Stanley Fulfillment System into any new aspect of our company, in particular Legacy Black & Decker, what we tend do is attack the receivables and payables first. And you're starting to see the effects of that, where receivable days are 56 and payable days are 70, and you had a nice improvement in both those categories year-over-year. As we focus on credit and collections and the efficiency of collecting our cash on our receivables, as well as improving the turns and the relationships with our vendors, so they're more in line with how we like to do business for those particular companies and entities as we go forward. So it's great to see that progress and really beginning to see the traction as the global enterprise continue to embrace the different tenets of the Stanley Fulfillment System. ", "How does that translate into cash flow? On the next page, first of all, I just want to remind everybody that the cash flow, the free cash flow that we're showing here is -- exclude M&A or merger and acquisition payments. So it gives you a good sense of the operational cash flow performance is. If we start with working capital, you can see there wasn't a large benefit because we did have a large growth in revenue. But we were able to maintain the cash flow performance in the second quarter. We do expect that to turn positive as the year progresses. As many of you know, we tend to have a seasonality of our working capital performance in the fourth quarter in particular, as well as combining that with the different projects and initiatives around the Stanley Fulfillment System will allow that to become a positive number by the end of 2011. ", "One thing of note on this page, as you see in Other, there's a large negative, $131 million in the second quarter and about $218 million year-to-date. What you have going on there is a couple of things, the primary drivers of that is the tax settlement that we achieved in both the first and the second quarter, which totaled about $70 million, the large part of that was noncash. And so you have the benefit in net income and you have the negative effect being backed out in Other, which is really what's driving a lot of what's in that line. The other thing in there is we do have pension contributions, as many of you know, from the Legacy Black & Decker pension plan, slightly underfunded. So we continue to make some pension contributions, which are about $40 million, $45 million year-to-date. Those 2 things are the large driver of why that's negative. And we do have a few timing items in there through the first half of the year that we expect to reverse in terms -- and those results in a slightly lower negative by the end of the year. ", "The other item here is CapEx. CapEx is trending very nicely. It's at -- through 6 months, 2.1% of revenue, which is at the lower end of our guidance range, and we would expect that trend to continue throughout the year. Now one thing you might look at when you look at this page is that $235 million of free cash flow through 6 months, and we are reiterating our guidance of $1.1 billion. If you look back historically at both legacy companies, Black & Decker and Stanley, the vast majority of the cash flow that's generated by both companies happens in the back half of the year and a large part of it in the fourth quarter. And the 5-year history of both companies indicates that the first half, as a percentage of the full year, tends to represent somewhere between 22% and 25% of the full year free cash flow performance. If you take those percentages, there's [ph] the $235 million, you get very close to that $1.1 billion, which is why we feel comfortable reiterating that cash flow guidance for all of 2011.", "So a little more information on P&L guidance on Page 14. As our press release indicated, we have raised our EPS guidance range, excluding M&A charges to $5.15, up to $5.40. That's an increase of a $0.15 from the previous guidance range we provided back in April, and that is solely due to the $0.15 of additional settlement of tax contingencies that occurred in the second quarter. If we look at the year for our tax rate related to our guidance range, we're now expecting the tax rate to be 19% to 20%, which is down 1 point from the previous range that we provided in April, which was 20% to 21%. ", "Looking at operational aspects of our guidance, as indicated by John as well as in our press release, we have lowered our guidance for the year on net organic sales by 1 point down to 4% to 5%, based off the pro forma level of $9.3 billion of sales for 2010. That's down from the 5.5% to 6% that we provided back in April. And as many of you know, the guidance that we provided did not have any market growth in the mature markets, in particular, in Continental Europe and the United States and Canada. That continues to be the case in the guidance that we're provided. But it certainly creates an ability to offset some of the headwinds that we're seeing in both the weather-related, outdoor performance that John and Jim discussed, as well as the weaker European market that we've experienced in the second quarter in the CDIY segment, which was down modestly in that period. ", "So we do have a slight negative as a result of that and as of now, we do not have any market improvement in the mature countries that I mentioned. But we'll see as housing starts was positive, as Jim indicated earlier, up 14% in the month of June. We'll see if that is something that allows for improvement in the back half of the year, but we're not including that in our guidance at this point in time.", "Cost synergies, as John mentioned, we believe will now be $200 million in 2011, which is up from $165 million estimate that we provided 3 months ago, and how that translates to 2012, we believe will be at $450 million in that timeframe, which is an annualized number of $485 million as we go into 2013, which means the implied 2012 number is approximately $115 million. Another item of note is that due to the situation with Niscayah and the potential acquisition, we did suspend our repurchase program in the second quarter of stock of 250 million, but we will commence that program again, either later this week or early next week, and we expect our shares outstanding to approximate 172.5 million for the year. ", "We are reiterating certain aspects of our guidance on the right side of the page. As you can see, revenue synergies, we expect to still be approximately 50 basis points of growth in 2011 with a modest EPS impact. The acquisition revenue for the acquisitions listed here on the page, approximately 3%. And we continue to believe that our operating margin rate expansion will be 150 basis points from the 2010 levels, which is just slightly over 14% for the year, and embedded in that is that negative 100 basis points from the price inflation arbitrage that we've primarily experienced in the first half of the year, as we start to see the positive impact to price the second half of 2011. In the non-merger and acquisition-related restructuring, we still expect it to approximate to $25 million or consistent with 2010 levels. ", "So with that, I'd like to provide a little more insight on each segment on Page 15. Consistent with the company, we're tightening our guidance range or our thoughts around performance of CDIY for the year, for revenue, organic revenue to be approximately 4% to 5%. And it's really due to the weaknesses that we mentioned in Outdoor products, as well as in Europe that's driving the vast majority of that. The first half performance for organic growth was approximately 2%, but when you adjust it for certain things such as the outdoor product performance, as well as the expected price benefit in the back half of the year and comps as they become easier in the second half because we saw significant stock or restocking in the first half of 2010. And then, we saw a slower performance in the back half of 2010, which makes the comps easier as we go out through the remainder of this year. ", "We expect operating margin accretion to continue in the second half of 2011 because of incremental cost synergies, positive impact from new products, the pricing actions that I just referred to are really helping to mitigate the inflation, that's now in our run rate. Jim touched on the share gains that we're getting in the various new products that are continuing to be rolled out. Many of them started in the first half, but we'll see the full effect of that in the back half of the year with the cordless power tools, as well as the DeWalt hand tools that started to launch in late June and will continue to roll out through the summer.", "Moving to Security, we're very pleased with the Security performance in the second quarter as Jim mentioned. And from a top line perspective, through 6 months, the organic growth is slightly positive. We expect that to continue to get slightly better as the second half progresses, and we believe we'll have a low single-digit organic growth performance for the entire year, that's being driven by the Convergent or Electronic Security growth as it continues at a healthy pace. It continues to get better as the second half progress. ", "Also, we will see more favorable performance in the back half in our residential hardware business, as we did have some inventory corrections, if you remember, in the third quarter of 2010, and that will provide a slightly easier comp as a result of that. And we do expect the strength that we saw in the commercial hardware business in the second quarter to continue at that modest pace into the back half of the year. Margins will continue to slightly improve across the entire Security segment as we continue the integration of the SSDS business. And we continue to drive the integration across mechanical security and residential hardware.", "Moving to Industrial. Industrial, as Jim mentioned, very strong performance through the first half of the year. Organic growth is 11%. We are indicating that for the year, we expect mid single-digit growth. And let me make sure that people understand what that means. We define mid single-digit growth as somewhere between 3% to 8%. And clearly, we expect this to trend to the high end of that range, which is at 8% based on the performance they've had in the first half of the year and expected performance in the back half. There will be a lower growth rate in the back half versus the 11% due to the comps, as well as other items that I'll touch on in a few minutes.", "Industrial & Automotive Repair continues to be strong. They continue to gain share and exceed market growth that's occurring in the industries that they serve. We're very pleased with that performance and they're really starting to get some traction with revenue synergies as well. The Emhart business or Engineered Fastening business is seeing nice growth even though the light vehicle production was slow in the second quarter. We expect that to be better in the third quarter and the fourth quarter as we see improvement in Japan. And we expect that our business will continue to outperform the production levels as we've seen in the first half of the year. ", "And in the offshore channel business, we're starting to see more activity and more life there in our infrastructure business. So we expect that to drive some growth as well in the back half, which is why we believe we'll see that performance in the -- around that 8% level for the year for this particular segment.", "So to summarize the call this morning, we feel excellent about where we are with the integration. It continues to proceed very well. We've accelerated synergies into 2011, as you saw, by increasing our estimates to $200 million. And we've raised the overall estimates for the whole program to $450 million by the end of 2012, which again it creates the $485 million annualized into 2013. The volume and margin growth expected in the second half due to new products, the pricing actions, emerging markets really allows us to feel like we're on track, so that 150 basis points year-over-year OM expansion that I discussed earlier. John touched on the revenue synergies and the progress we're making. It's very smooth in the implementation and the results have been compelling so far. So we continue to invest in that in both people and other assets to really drive that growth throughout the remainder of the year. I touched on the Stanley Fulfillment System and the impact on working capital, and working capital turns improving by 14% year-over-year, which is really nice to see the tenets of SFS really getting embedded in our company globally. And then of course, we are reiterating our $1.1 billion in free cash flow forecast for the year. ", "With that, that completes the presentation portion of the call, I want to turn it to Q&A.", "Kate White Vanek", "Time for Q&A, all. John, our operator will be kicking it off and as always, we'll follow the one question and one follow-up routine.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Can you give a little more color on the 80% cost recovery in the back half a little bit, just across the portfolio, where the expectations are? And then also, provide perhaps a bit of input on what you've learned as you started to have these discussions and how things have fared to this point?", "John Lundgren", "Yes, Eric, this is John. I'll kick it off and Don will give you a little more granularity. From 36,000 feet, we're absolutely holding to that recovery. We're getting a little less price than we'd anticipated, and one of the reasons we're getting a little less in CDIY is inflation is abating or the -- if you will, the escalation has slowed down, so we're getting a little less second-half inflation compared to where we left off. So all in, the 80% is still good. But I'll let Don give you a little more granularity.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Eric. I mean, we are comfortable that we will see an 80% recovery as indicated in the back half of the year. There's been a lot of moving parts and dynamics associated with inflation and price. The vast majority of our price increases are in place, although we still have a few smaller ones that we're negotiating over this month. But by the end of July, we feel comfortable that all price increases will be in place. And on the inflation side, we've seen some pluses and minuses. As John alluded to, we've seen some trends that have caused production inflation and we've also seen some trends that are increasing inflation. So we're managing. We're continuing to manage that dynamic but at this point, we still feel comfortable that we'll have 80% price recovery in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank", "So obviously, there's a lot of focus on the Black & Decker related cost synergies. I find it interesting though that at IAR, your margin expansion was very substantial. So legacy business without the acquisition-related synergies, and I think it was actually second quarter of last year it started doing much better. Are there other areas in the legacy business, not included kind of in that $450 million synergy target, where you see material opportunities for operational improvement?", "James Loree", "Well, this is Jim. I mean, IAR is predominantly a nonrevenue, noncost synergy story. It's really an execution story. And I'd say they've done a great job over the last year pulling that business together on a global platform basis and treating it as if it were one company instead of a series of popcorn stands. So I think that's a terrific story. Engineered Fastening, which is another part of the Industrial segment, when they went through the downturn, they dealt with severe contraction in the automotive market. And they really did a phenomenal job bringing their cost structure down even before the merger. And as the automotive market came back last year and into this year, prior to the second quarter with the Japan issues, they have kept their cost structure intact and they have a tremendous operating leverage story. So I think that is another one that we're particularly proud of. But I think you're still seeing across the portfolio, for instance, in Security, their margin growth is not driven solely by revenue -- or cost synergies. It's driven almost equally as much by a terrific story, managing productivity projects and controlling SG&A levels. So you've got those stories, I think, across the portfolio and the CDIY folks have -- are battling a lot of headwinds. But I think they, too, have managed the productivity element of the equation extremely effectively.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And a quick clarification on the guidance. I'm just, I guess, a little bit confused, and I'm sorry if I'm missing something. On the 150 basis points of margin expansion that was reiterated for the year, the revised guidance has basically lower revenue and more cost savings, so wouldn't that suggest that the operating margin expansion would be higher than in the prior version of guidance?", "Donald Allan", "No. Jason, this is Don. I get the question but I would say no. When you look at the components of revenue and then the profitability of those revenues and -- as well as the increased synergies and other dynamics that are changing that are pluses and minuses, it puts you roughly to the same place year-over-year expansion in operating margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the launches of DeWalt in August, what you're thinking about doing in terms of just the spending behind the marketing of that to make sure it's getting traction there in this tough climate?", "James Loree", "I'll take it, Dan. We're not going to reveal our spending plans for competitors to jump all over or counterpunch. But simply said, if you look at SG&A, it's totally in line with expectations and with former guidance. We have very robust plans in support of those launches and one of the reasons we talked about CDIY in the second quarter margins, we really had a semi-hiatus same period a year ago, so we are comparing against a low spending base. Essentially, I'll call it brand support and product introduction support. In fact, the historical level in line with where it should be as a percentage of SG&A. And I'll go so far as to say thus far, customer acceptance and future plans we're quite -- we're very encouraged by it and we would not have gotten that level of acceptance without meaningful levels of support. But it's just not appropriate to give you any more granularity than that. And I hope you understand.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Sure, I understand that. And I guess secondly, just wondering in terms of as you look at growth opportunities as you're pursuing Niscayah right now, would you be content to -- finishing with the integration of Black & Decker and looking at Niscayah or are you still looking at other opportunities here at this time?", "John Lundgren", "I guess any of us could take that. The pipeline is really full but the playbook will be the same. We will look at both financial capacity and organizational capacity. The beauty of Niscayah, as we pointed out, it's primarily a foreign acquisition made with foreign cash, extraordinarily good use of a somewhat dormant resource. That, in and of itself, would make it a good deal. The fact that it's highly strategic, it's been a coveted asset and it's quite accretive makes it an even better deal. We'll still have plenty of cash. If it's a business and a geography that will not interfere with the integration of either of those businesses, we could still opt -- unlikely, this year's 2/3 is over from an M&A perspective, unlikely, we could execute -- would execute anything else this year. But we'll start the meter running again as we look forward to next year. The pipeline is quite full. The only change in environment that I know you're well aware of is with financing being relatively inexpensive. Private equity or financial sponsors are far more meaningful part of any competition for good assets than perhaps they were 2 or 3 years ago when we did the Black & Decker deal. But it's a robust environment with a lot of opportunity. Jim, may want to add something.", "James Loree", "Yes. I think just in -- to take it from a complementary but slightly different perspective, what we're basically doing here from a capital allocation perspective is taking about 1/3 of our excess capital and returning it to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases and taking the other 2/3 and investing it in acquisitions that are strategically linked to our key franchises and our growth platforms, but are also able to produce cash flow return on investment returns in the 13% to 15% range over time. And we think that is a great way to create shareholder value. However, if we don't execute on the acquisitions and deliver those returns, then we could destroy value. So we're very conscious of making sure that we only invest when we are confident that we can do that, which means we have the organizational capacity to do so. And so, financial capacity, organizational capacity, getting back to what John said, is critical both from a tactical and a strategic perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "This is actually Will Wong on for Mike. Just a quick question. When you talk about your outlook, not including any rebound in residential construction, first can you just remind us how much residential construction exposure you have across the 3 segments? And then secondly, when do you expect sort of residential market to rebound and when that will be built into your forecast?", "Kate White Vanek", "Hi, Will. This is Kate. First, I'm going to point you to the appendix of our investor overview, which is always on our website. That has the breakdown by segment and by business of our exposures to residential construction. So as of 2010 pro forma, about 20% of total Stanley was residential, 28% was other residential, meaning sort of outdoor, repair, remodel. Second, we're not going to be in the business of predicting the housing rebound, and I think you understand. And I think if we were, we would be embedding it in our guidance and having a lot more conviction behind it. But that's not the stance that we're going to take today.", "William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Great. And then just my follow-up question, in terms of the weather-related weakness in outdoors, how are you guys able to discern what was sort of weather-related weakness versus maybe an overall demand coming in weaker?", "James Loree", "Yes, I'll take it, Will, the one -- essentially, overwhelmingly, it was weather-related. We can take it off-line but the one reliable source I've seen that measures, essentially, hours available for outdoor activities through May, not through June, because the data isn't available yet, that would mean using our outdoor products, participating in various sports, et cetera, it's syndicated resource. Through May, those hours were down 26%. So if you think about -- we were down about 19% with our outdoor, that would tell us that we may even have gained a little bit of share. But the overwhelming majority, if not more than 100% of the softness, was weather-related. You don't hear us talk about weather very often. Legacy Stanley, I think the only businesses that would have -- are impacted by that are Access Technologies and to a small extent, Gate Hardware in our legacy hardware business. So this is new for the Stanley side of the merger, not new for the folks who've lived with this business for a long time. But the simple answer is I would say 100-plus percent of the shortfall was weather-related. Thus, we don't anticipate that it's going to repeat itself. That's the good news. The bad news is second quarter is always your biggest quarter, and when you get past June or July, and you haven't sold it, it's generally gone for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "A couple of questions. First off, the change -- the 1% change in the organic growth, it seems like the vast majority of that is already spoken for with Q2. I'm looking on a go-forward basis, how much have you revised your European demand expectations and what are those European growth expectations given as 1/4 of your business?", "Donald Allan", "Sam, it's Don. I would say on the outdoor component, I would say the vast majority of that is behind us. As far as the European component, we do expect slightly negative performance in the back half of the year, which is what we experienced in the second quarter. So that trend will continue and contribute to the whole 1% decline that we talked about for the year.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then John, hopefully I'm going to be phrasing this question right. Based on a bunch of recent security industry transactions and multiples, it would seem that the overall stock market might be materially undervaluing either your Security business or your Tools business. And I was just curious as to what your view on the subject might be and maybe what options you and the board consider in terms of unlocking latent value?", "John Lundgren", "I guess, I'll say 2 things. It should be obvious that the markets grossly undervaluing both our Tools and Security business, but I would argue that those of us on this side of the call are biased. Look, Security at legacy Stanley grew from nothing to almost 40% of our revenues. And Jim, Don and I spend a lot of time talking about that and with the board. And we always felt that if it got to 50% of our revenues, and wasn't being valued properly, we'd think about some alternatives for it. With the acquisition or merger of Black & Decker, Security has slipped back to less than 25% of the business. With Niscayah, it will be about 30%. So you can argue just based on market multiples, we have an 11x or 12x EBITDA business trapped inside a 7x or 8x company. We would all argue that's a very, very high-class problem, because we're -- were it to be -- come to a point where it's a stand-alone company that would be valued higher. We'd create a tremendous value for our shareholders and it's something we'd have to talk about. It's the furthest thing from our minds as we speak right now. We love our business. It's a very important part of a diversified portfolio that served us so well through the last economic downturn, while our Tools business was down 15% to 20% on an organic volume basis, and not quite as much in terms of earnings because we took out some cost. The Security business stayed flat in terms of volume, increased in terms of earnings and it's what makes us, we think, a reliable and a valuable diversified industrial company. That's the place we want to be and our board wants us to be. But every year, we go through a strategic planning exercise with our board. It's one of the things we talk about. Right now, Security is as I'd say, 25% going to about 32% of our revenue with Niscayah. We love the business. We love having it as part of our portfolio, and we're always open to considering various alternatives. Securitas, I might add, and they've been public with this, had the same thought 5 years ago, a guarding business, a monitoring business and a residential security business, based upon 2 of the model but it didn't work very well for them. So it's not magic but if you take essentially high EBITDA multiple business and spit it out and put it on its own, that you've created wealth overnight due to financial engineering. If it was that simple and straightforward, we have an incredibly capable and savvy Board of Directors, and I think a pretty good business development team and a lot of good financial advice, we would have done it 5 years ago. It didn't make sense then, doesn't make sense now, but it's certainly something, Sam, that we will always look at, always consider at the present time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC", "Specific to Convergent, you talked a little bit about installs being greater than RMR. Can you quantify how much stronger install was over RMR? And then with RMR specifically, was that primarily account growth or ARPU growth or is it split pretty evenly between those?", "James Loree", "Well, that's an incredible amount of granularity that you're asking for. What I will say is that the RMR or the install growth was a couple of points higher than the overall line average organic growth for CSS. So we're talking kind of in the 5% to 7% range. And it was largely derived from new account acquisition. And also, I think the RMR growth was also aided by the fact that our attrition rates are coming down as well and they're in a very good place as it relates to historical performance.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC", "Okay. Great. And then you guys also called out some order strength from national accounts and a rebound in commercial. Can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the vertical strength or are there any particular segments in the market that you're seeing some good activity?", "James Loree", "I think the state and municipal markets continue to be horrendous. I think we're seeing good in the multifamily, we're clearly seeing some positives. Education is stronger than it has been. Healthcare, slightly stronger. So we're -- that's kind of where we're seeing from a vertical perspective, the better performance. And the order rates are in excess of the install growth. So I mean, they're doing well from an order perspective and our job now is to convert that in the back half of the year.", "John Lundgren", "And Michael, I'll just add to that, because you'll get cut off, because it was your follow-up that's up. As you know -- you know our Security business so well. We're heavily skewed towards retail but working very hard to diversify into 6 other verticals that we're actively pursuing. Retail simply isn't getting much worse. It's been bad. It's hit bottom. And I'm not suggesting a rebound there, but to Jim's point, all the positives that Jim has talked about, which are modest but in the right direction, are not being offset to the extent by retail declines as they have been in the prior 4 or 5 quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zener from Keybanc.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "I wonder if you could, I thought it was interesting on in CDIY, obviously the difference between the Power Tools and the Hand Tools. So I'm wondering if you could maybe just expand on your comments about the relative difference. I know you mentioned the product launches were very impactful on the Power Tools side. But does that imply on the Hand Tool side, you were are gaining share or were you holding share in a market that was down that much? And if you wouldn't mind refreshing us, I know you addressed this at the capital markets day, but the introduction of the DeWalt hand tools, if you could kind of refresh us on why you don't think that will be a high rate of cannibalization towards the high-end Stanley hand tools that you might or might not have in the same channel?", "James Loree", "Sure. I'll take the first part of your question, for sure. It's Jim. I clearly believe that the overall market was negative, modestly negative for both Power Tools and Hand Tools in the quarter. And the reason I think that we had strong double-digit performance in Professional Power Tools and solid single-digit performance in Consumer Power Tools is primarily a result of the new product introductions and share gains in cordless that are derived from the 12-volt that we did last year and the 18-volt that we are just beginning to introduce now. So this is not surprising to us that we're performing well in this regard. We expect to continue to perform well. And so really, the market which was exacerbated by the weak European performance down, I'd say, a couple of points. And then with the hand tools and fastening number of minus 1%, probably would've been minus 2% to 3% had it not been for the revenue synergies that are being pursued, selling hand tools through power tool channels that existed with legacy Black & Decker, especially in Latin America but also in Europe now. So I think that's certainly a driver. And then of course, the DeWalt power -- hand tool line, which really didn't have a huge impact in the quarter, but I think we'll continue to see progress in -- as the year develops, and we take that across the U.S.", "John Lundgren", "And I'll take -- I'll just take the second part, on the cannibalization, which I think is a very logical question. Jim touched on it. Remember, DeWalt hand tools are available in one large big-bucks customer, primarily the staff [ph] channel. Stanley hand tools were significantly underdeveloped in the staff [ph] channel. That's why this was a tremendous revenue synergy opportunity to Jim's point and there's not much to cannibalize to be very candid, which is why that was the -- a; the product line, and b; the channel of focus on where we wanted to introduce this high-quality product with obviously a terrific brand name to support it.", "Kenneth Zener - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I appreciate that. And for my follow-up, I'm not sure if you don't mind commenting on Niscayah. It's kind of Security in the U.S., which we are seeing more of a nascent recovery obviously on the Convergent side, less on the Mechanical side. But if one looks at the Niscayah business, which is a bit more on the install side than your existing business, I believe, it's seen pretty negative growth. I mean could you kind of, without getting into detail, but kind of describe your thoughts around how that installation versus the kind of the recurring market is occurring? And given recent changes that we've -- where pressure that we've seen on the European economy relative to the U.S. is more nascent commercial recovery?", "James Loree", "Ken, this is Jim again. The big difference between Niscayah and our business is they both have pretty strong recurring revenue. I think we're about 50%, they're about 40%, but only 10% of their revenue derives from monitoring and we're substantially higher than that, at least double that. And the monitoring business is by far and away the most profitable part of the recurring monitoring business. But the other recurring revenue is service revenue. And I would offer that, I think, Niscayah does a fantastic job signing up their customers for service. And I think we could learn from them actually in the U.S. and take some of what they're doing with respect to their contract service and leverage our service base even more effectively. I think that one of the problems that they have is that, given some of their historical constraints, they haven't been able to really size their service fleet in accordance with their level of demand. So there's opportunity all over the place for both Niscayah and for us to learn from each other and to make our entire enterprise even more profitable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "Just wondering if -- I'm sorry if I missed this, if you touched on this already, but can you just talk about how inventory management in some of your bigger customers have impacted results during the quarter or the outlook for the third quarter?", "John Lundgren", "Yes. Dennis, this is John. I think we've been pretty public and granular. Inventory is not at dramatically low levels, although our data tells us that at the larger customers, we won't name any by name, we're down about 1.5 weeks from historical level and that's arithmetic. That did have an adverse impact, particularly in our HHI channel, and to a modest extent, in hand tools. We're not going to go through inventory by SKU or by product line, but in general, as you know, we get good TOS data from our 7 largest customers, and we get it almost realtime. And we're down about 1.5 weeks from what I think we would agree with our customers are historically optimal levels. To the extent, they keep it there. That won't come back, to the extent, they rebuild. There'll be a little bit of a lift in the second half. We've built no lift based on inventory rebuild into our forecast because we think our customers, just as we do, are getting better managing their supply chains with a little less inventory. We know, historically, when it went from about 12 to 8 weeks, they were out of stocks all over the place. That was neither good for vendors or customers. But to think over time, retail inventories could come down a week or so, which is 8%. Of course, it varies a lot by category. And turns would increase and out-of-stocks wouldn't. That's quite feasible. And so we've built no lift into the numbers going forward. But it clearly did have an impact in the first half of the year, in general, and the second quarter in particular.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And then just -- that's is very helpful, John. Just to be clear then though, the 1.5 weeks, roughly, would also be down versus the year-ago period?", "John Lundgren", "That's -- yes. Our best estimate is yes. 1 to 1.5 weeks across the big bucks is going to [indiscernible] . That's right.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And then just one follow-up on a comment you made earlier about Outdoor. I think you said it's $500 million to $600 million business. Does that include the legacy BDK, cleaning and lighting and some of the household products or was that strictly the Outdoor category?", "John Lundgren", "Yes. It's all of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "I just wanted to clarify the comments that you made on pricing. I think it was probably the first question on the call. You said that -- it sounds like your getting a little bit of pushback from your CDIY customers, and I'm a little bit confused because I thought that, that was all unrecovered inflation. And so, I'm not sure why they'd be pushing back? So just -- if you could clarify that comment.", "Donald Allan", "It's not like we're getting pushback, Nicole, what it is is that -- there was the profits just continual discussion on data and information sharing, trends that happen in inflation on a daily basis gets discussed. So we're at the later stages of these discussions, but it's relatively small amounts we're referring to that haven't been finalized at this point.", "James Loree", "And frankly, we have no choice but to finalize them. So we've implemented the price increases across the rest of the channels so that they will come at the home centers and we will work through that.", "John Lundgren", "And I think, Nicole, just another point, we talked about inflation abating. It's true. To Don's point, as they ask for more data and we provide it, most folks are focusing on steel which is, without question, the biggest single commodity with which we deal, resins' import, et cetera. But if anybody has looked at rare earth metals lately, they're up 600%, 700%. Now, that being said, they're a tiny piece of costs, but it's important as it relates to power tools. And our customers understand that because they source those products directly themselves. So to Don's point, the data's there to support the increases. What Jim said is absolutely right, we can't have 3 sets of prices in the marketplace, so we either raise the prices or don't ship. And we've been here before and we don't expect much of a fallout from where we are.", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. That's really helpful. For my follow-up, Industrial margins, on an incremental basis, came in at about 20%. It's a little bit lower than we've seen recently. Is there anything to call out there?", "James Loree", "Are you saying on a contribution margin basis?", "Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes.", "James Loree", "Yes. Well, we are investing in the business, so contribution margin is one way to look at it, but that assumes that SG&A is steady-state and that's just not the case. We're -- in the Industrial business, we're investing in new products. You're going to see an absolutely stunning new air tool introduction, the first industrial power tool -- air tool that will be introduced here in the next few weeks, in about 15 years in the industry. So just -- those types of things are going on. And we're spending money on advertising and sales promotion and working the emerging markets aggressively. So you can't just take the contribution margin of that. Some of that has to fuel growth.", "John Lundgren", "This is a dynamic business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I guess the first question on Security, I just want to make sure I understand the profitability here. Up 250 bps x acquisitions, which I consider to be pretty strong especially on the Mechanical side where organic growth was down one point, I think you pointed out. So I'm just wondering what the levers are in that Mechanical business. My guess is that profitability there actually improved even though organic was down. Am I kind of on the right track there? And then, just kind of what led to that?", "John Lundgren", "Yes. I guess I'll start, Todd -- Pete. It did improve but I'd like to feel better about it. We predicted it. It improved from an extraordinarily low base in the first quarter, which Don -- I don't think could have been more clear to say we considered it an aberration. We said what we thought contributed to it, specifically, a lot of softness in MAS and the mechanical locking subsegments of the business. And it isn't so much that second quarter was terrific. Second quarter was a terrific improvement off a low base and quite frankly, we felt sanity was restored to our margins rather than we did something special.", "Donald Allan", "And you are seeing the impact of the Black & Decker Stanley integration in the mechanical business as we integrate HHI into our commercial locking business. You're starting to see the synergy effect really this year and it'll continue into next year. We didn't have a lot of that last year.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. And so the implication is the second half should -- we should continue to see the improvement in mechanical if you're not kind of putting for par in that business, to use an analogy I guess?", "John Lundgren", "That's a perfect analogy. Pros putting for pars and dogs chasing cars, don't last very long in...", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "On the CDIY business, I just want to make sure I understand the organic growth forecast for the second half. 4% to 5%, can you give us a breakdown of price versus volume?", "James Loree", "Well, we're not going to give that level of detail, but there definitely will be 1 point or 2 of price in the mix. And then beyond that, it's going to be volume driven.", "Donald Allan", "The whole company will add about a point of price in the back half of the year. That's going to be the best way to look at it. Yes.", "John Lundgren", "And CDIY is about 80% of the inflation. So you can figure out where the pricing action is most aggressive.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets.", "Michael Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "This is Mike Wherley, standing in for Jim Lucas. I just had a follow-up on the Security business. You said that -- I was just wondering about the productivity gains. Are they more from SSDS or spread more evenly across the segment and part of that BDK integration you were talking about?", "James Loree", "They're across both CSS and MAS. And as I said, when I gave my comments, there were 3 principal factors that drove the earnings growth in security. One of them was synergies, one of them was productivity projects and the last one was SG&A control. Those are the 3 things that drove the profit growth.", "Michael Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Okay. And then was there any change to your full year material inflation recovery forecast of 33% to 50% that you gave us last quarter?", "Donald Allan", "No. We're still on track for the 80% in the second half and the 33% to 50% for the full year.", "Kathryn White", "Thanks all. This concludes our call today. Again, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about any sort of matter, and thank you so much for coming in today.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Ms. White Vanek, you may begin.", "Kate White Vanek", "Thanks so much, Kim. Good morning, everybody, and thank you, all, for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. I'd like to point out that our earnings release, which was issued yesterday after the close and a supplemental presentation, which we will certainly refer to during the call are on the Investor Relations portion of our website, stanleyblackanddecker.com. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's third quarter results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. There is some helpful information in the appendix of the slide deck as it relates to your models. If you have questions, please contact me directly after the call. ", "In addition, you'll note on the cover of our PowerPoint presentation for this quarter, you'll see a barcode on the cover. You can access our DEWALT Hand Tools mobile site by downloading the free scan app available on your App Store, and you'll be able to access the site by clicking on the code from there. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 today. Replay number and access code are on the release.  And as always, you can download the earnings replay as a podcast from iTunes as well, should you be interested. ", "We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K, which we filed with the press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everyone. If we could focus on the first slide, I think the greatest highlight of the third quarter '11 is in the earnings number itself, which excluding merger-related charges, increased almost 40% versus the prior year. Revenues were up 11%, $2.6 billion, organically up 4% in what you'll hear is a relatively soft market. By segment, CDIY grew 5% organically, excluding Pfister and previously announced divestitures such as the Delta business. Within CDIY, our Professional Power Tools sales rose over 20% on the strengths of some very exciting and very well-received new product introductions that Jim is going to talk to you a little bit about in the segment analysis. 10% organic growth in our Industrial segment. We're seeing great strength there, both in IAR, as well as some of our Infrastructure segments. Security was flat versus prior year. There are a lot of puts and calls within Security in general and within the Mechanical Access portion of Security in particular. But despite the flat volume, our margins as you'll see in a second, were very strong in Security. ", "Dilutive GAAP earnings were $0.92 a share, $1.34 excluding the M&A-related charges, and repeat that, that is plus 38% versus third quarter 2010. 13.9% operating margin. That excludes Niscayah, which is included for about 3.5 weeks in our results. That's up 130 basis points from the same period a year ago. Strong margins in Security as I have suggested earlier, 20.2%. And that was within Security, our Convergent Security Solutions business posted record profitability. ", "SFS continues to be embraced. And as a consequence, working capital turns increased 24% to 5.7. Again, excluding Niscayah, which was only part of the company for 3 weeks in September. As Don will point out in our outlook and as he looks at our balance sheet and cash flow, working capital turns and the improvement in turns and many other things as a result of the embedding of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the larger company, is a tremendous ongoing source of cash. ", "Niscayah closed on September 9. We've made really good progress in the first 5 weeks. And per our announcement, and I'll talk about it a little bit later, we're expecting $0.20 of accretion next year, $80 million in synergies by 2013, resulting in even further accretion. $350 million share repurchase took place during the third quarter, and that's about $100 million more than we previously communicated. We bought in a total of 5.6 million shares. So the earnings was driven by a lot of things: healthy organic growth relative to the market and cost synergies from the ongoing success of the Black & Decker integration. ", "We've had a lot of conversation on various geographies, and it is a mixed bag around the world, but generally positive as this chart will show. Organic revenues, as I mentioned, were up 4%. But if we start on the middle left in our largest market, plus 3% in the U.S. That represents more than 55% of Stanley Black & Decker's total revenue. Canada was flat, represents 7% of our total revenue. And Europe, our second largest market, was plus 3%, again with very strong performance in the Industrial segment, relative softness in CDIY, but healthy performance nonetheless relative to the market and some good, relatively good early results in Security from a margin perspective and relatively flat from a volume perspective. ", "Looking at Latin America. Our revenue synergies are really beginning to gain traction in Latin America. It represents 9% of our combined revenues and we had 23% organic growth in Latin America during the third quarter. Asia grew 9% organically and is becoming an increasingly large part of our portfolio. But if you see the bubble that we've highlighted, if you exclude Engineered Fastening, our Emhart business, organic sales growth in Asia was 19%, a tremendous achievement, not dissimilar to Latin America. ", "Engineered Fastening grew sequentially. It had a very good quarter, but it's still feeling the aftereffect of the second quarter tragedies in Japan that had a tremendous effect on the automotive industry, coming back nicely but still not back to pre-tsunami and earthquake levels. And last and arguably least, representing 1% of our volume, organic sales were down 8% in Australia. We think that's a quarterly aberration rather than an ongoing trend. Australia remains a very important market for us despite its small size. So Europe is steady and emerging markets, Asia, Latin America, continuing to expand at a tremendous rate. ", "Looking at the sources of growth. As I suggested earlier, Professional Power Tools and the Industrial business posted really, really strong organic growth, despite relatively subdued end markets. Volume, 4%, as I've said. Price was flat. Jim and Don will come onto that a little bit. We had some positive list price increases and some greater-than-expected promotional activity on some of our older-generation products to enhance and help the sell-through. But all-in, flat price during the quarter, with organic volume up 4%. Currency helped us, 3%, and the impact of acquisitions, 4%, for your total top line growth of 11%. ", "If you're looking within the businesses, Professional Power Tools & Accessories, 17%; industrial, 10%; Security, excluding the automatic door business, or Stanley Access Technologies, was plus 2%; Consumer Power Tools were flat; Hand Tools and Fasteners, most of which is the legacy Stanley Hand Tool business, was down 6% with relative softness in the U.S. and Europe and strong strength everywhere else. Access Technologies, as Jim will talk about in the segments, our automatic door business down 9%. It's rare for them to have a down quarter. Some retrofit business with large customers was delayed. The business remains very strong. And Pfister down 22%, not dissimilar to last quarter as that reflects the impact of lost SKUs at a major customer that's been in place since the first of the year. And we'll have one more quarter of that type of comparison before we've reach, if you will, steady state on the Pfister business. So it gives you a little more granularity inside the segment. And Jim will give you some of the cause and effects in just a minute. ", "Finally, integration, first and foremost on many of our minds, certainly mine, in the senior management team. I'll talk about 2 different programs running in parallel. First, the Black & Decker integration within Stanley to become one company remains on track. We're projected to achieve $450 million in cost synergies by 2013 and enter 2014 at a $485 million annualized basis. We're getting into the major project implementation phase. We've consolidated 2 major distribution centers, 3 plants, they are progress on time and on budget. We're tracking these very, very closely because the interdependency of these projects and the resulting increased complexity is very, very important and it's as important as ever that we stay on top of these. We are as part of our, I'd say, rigorous and, I think, well understood integration process. Senior management and the relevant project managers meet regularly with our normal dashboard format to ensure that these programs stay on track. ", "We have $115 million in incremental cost synergies this year. That's going to drive about $0.50 in earnings accretion. And something that we're very excited about is our revenue synergy projects. They're beginning to yield strong results. They're still on track for $300 million to $400 million in incremental revenue and $0.35 to $0.50 EPS accretion by the end of 2013. The biggest opportunities, it's already showing up in the numbers, are in CDIY and IAR in Latin America, both Argentina and Brazil, and it's really encouraging to see these results. Niscayah, as I mentioned, closed on September 9. It was a publicly traded company. The first 4, now 5 weeks of the integration, confirmed our ability to achieve the stated cost synergies of $80 million. It's more than just a European business. I think it's important to understand there is overlap in the U.S., about 15% of Niscayah's business is in the U.S. and about 15% of the legacy Stanley Convergent Security business was in the U.K. and France. So there's really good opportunity in those 3 geographies, as well as an opportunity to drive some synergies through improved practices across the rest of the system. ", "The management team is in place. Massimo Grassi, one of our most senior executives in Europe, has been named to head Security Europe. He brings global experience and a lot of experience managing cross cultures, cross integrations. We very much like what we found with Niscayah. Tremendous field organization, quite decentralized relative to the Stanley model. We will get everything that can be done in one place done in one place, and Massimo has been overseeing that for about 4 years with our company. And anything that touches a customer and end user will continue to be done locally because that's the way we do it in Europe. That's our model for success and we're quite encouraged by the prospects for Niscayah 5 to 6 weeks into it. The pro forma financial impact is, per our information release, we're expecting $45 million of cost synergies and $0.20 accretion next year, another $35 million in the following year, which will ultimately result in $0.45 of accretion. Both the incremental accretion from Black & Decker and next year's accretion from Niscayah are included in the 2012 preliminary outlook that Don provided. But let me turn it over to Jim to give you some more granularity on our 3 reporting segments for the third quarter and going forward.", "James M. Loree", "Okay, thank you, John. In light of the continued difficult global construction market, CDIY delivered a very solid performance. Total sales were $1.338 billion, up 6% from the third quarter '10. Segment profit of $170 million was also up 6% and the profit rate held nicely in the 13% range. ", "Organic sales were plus 3% but up 5%, as John said, excluding Pfister and the divestitures. And the Professional Power Tools & Accessories business was overwhelmingly positive with 17% organic growth on the strength of its lithium-ion share gains, as well as increased promotional activity on older-generation power tool products. Consumer Power Tools was flat organically with a weak backdrop in the U.S. and Europe, offsetting double-digit gains in Asia and Latin America, and Hand Tools and Fastening was down 6%, of which 2 points of that erosion was due to a business model change with the Bostitch industrial business, which shifted over from a direct to a distributor model. But broad POS pressure in the U.S. and Europe was really at the core here. And it more than offset DEWALT Hand Tools share gains, listing gains and strong emerging market -- and a strong emerging market performance. ", "As you can see, CDIY revenues in Latin America grew 19%, with above-average operating margin rates. But the highlight really was in Professional Power Tools, which grew over 20% due to the success of the 18- and 20-volt Max lithium-ion line and continued strength from the 12v lithium-ion line that was introduced a year ago. And Power Tool Accessories were strong as well, up 6%, which is a continued focus for us to grow that highly profitable recurring abrasives and accessories line. ", "Let's talk about pricing. And I know that's on a lot of people's minds. But pricing actions were successful in CDIY during the quarter. We locked in the final increases that were out there hanging, and we now have successfully achieved our goals in terms of list price increases to offset inflation. But during the quarter, we chose to offset the benefit from that with higher promotional discounts on NiCad and other older-generation products. And you can understand with limited store traffic and increasing dichotomy between the pros who simply want the best power tool out there, i.e. our new lithium-ion, and those who are more interested in good performance at a lower price point, we felt that this was the best gambit available to us to affect the phase in, phase out and maximize revenue and profit. And we think it did. ", "So all in all, a decent showing for CDIY. Revenue growth, profit growth and share gain all against a tough market backdrop. Security also had strong profit growth in a weak environment. Total sales were $656 million, up 17%, with acquisitions contributing 15 of the 17 points. Organic sales growth was flat. Segment profit was $110 million, up a very strong 26%, a nice operating leverage. And synergies from the Black & Decker and other acquisitions, price and productivity more than offsetting inflation, and ex acquisition charges, the segment profit rate was 18.4% and ex the temporary margin dilution from the new acquisitions, Security OM percent was actually 20.2%, certainly a very good place for that to be and we haven't seen that in a long, long time. ", "As the businesses went, CSS or Convergent Security, was up 1%, with 4% growth in RMR, recurring revenue, monthly revenue, and install volume was down 2%. But healthy order flow from both national accounts and core commercial accounts left us with an increasing backlog and orders were up 10% in the U.S., U.K. during the quarter and up 4% overall in this subsegment. Also notable, CSS France, the home of the ADT France acquisition, which we made a year ago, really progressed quite smoothly and now we've gotten that operating margin rate into the mid-teens as we promised and are now ready to digest the Niscayah activities as well in France. So that's definitely another highlight. And then in addition, a business that we will be featuring in the future as a growth engine in the coming years, Healthcare Solutions was up 12% organically, indicating some of the power and potential of that unit due to strong sales in both patient security and RFID-enabled storage systems. ", "Turning to Mechanical. Excluding the Access business, organic growth was up 2%, which we think was an excellent performance, given the very difficult market conditions, especially in residential that we and our competitors have been encountering. The story there was clearly share gain, specifically Kwikset, which comported itself quite well at retail during the quarter. Now turning to Access. John mentioned down 9%, continued to fight market headwinds. In this case, Access does have some significant customer concentration and its largest customer elected to delay remodels during the quarter. The rest of the business was quite healthy. But that delay with that large customer resulted in a 9% overall decrease, so we expect that to be a temporary phenomenon. They also maintained their strong profitability, right around 20% operating margin in Access despite that setback. ", "And overall, Mechanical Access operating margin percent was greater than 19%, with 300 basis points of year-over-year expansion, reflecting synergy realization, strong productivity and successful pricing actions. So for 4Q, you can expect another solid quarter for Security, with 3% to 4% organic growth, we think, characterized by very strong Electronic Security and continued market headwinds for MAS and Access. Niscayah will also be accretive to OM dollars but certainly not to the rate. ", "Turning to Industrial. Once again, Industrial had a great quarter. Revenues were up $642 million, up 19% over the third quarter. Segment profit was $106 million, up 31% and the operating margin rate expanded to 16.5%. All 3 of the subsegments had healthy organic growth during the quarter, leading to a 10% organic growth performance for Industrial overall. IAR was up 6% organically as industrial and mobile distribution, as well as Engineered Storage benefited from strong customer demand and market share gains. And for the old-time Mac aficionados, Mac had its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and is operating at record operating margin rate levels as we go. Solid revenue growth for the entire North American segment of Industrial & Automotive Repair, it was up 12% organically. And in emerging market, volume was up 20%, more than offsetting a modestly softer Europe. ", "New products, particularly in the mid-price point range, as the market has shifted slightly, gained traction globally with strong results in emerging markets and the operating margin rate expanded 350 basis points, driven by operating leverage cost synergies and successful price inflation recovery. Engineered Fastening had a terrific showing, with organic revenues up 14%, 3x the growth in global light vehicle production, as new products such as the T-Series Stud Welding, which debuted at Volkswagen during the quarter, and increased platform and penetration market share gains, and as John mentioned, production in Japan rebounded sequentially as we expected. And that is now on the road to recovery, well on the road to recovery. ", "Infrastructure was the star of the quarter in terms of organic growth, up 19% in the segment and pro forma revenues for CRC were up in the mid-single-digits on stronger international product sales. And operating margin rate for that acquisition topped 18%. Hydraulic sales were up 30% on continued market strength in that small but very, very successful business. On balance, another strong quarter for Industrial, really complementing the other units and helping us drive a pretty good performance for the total company. ", "Now as we move to working capital. On working capital, we made excellent progress during the quarter and we have started the multiyear trek to drive legacy Black & Decker to 8 to 9 turns, thus enabling us to extract, over time, a $0.5 billion of cash from unproductive assets. This quarter, the highlights were accounts receivable and accounts payable. And as you can see, accounts receivable drove $96 million of cash vis-\u00e0-vis the prior year. That was in the face of 11% sales growth. So very difficult to do, but that obviously was a very nice improvement in days. Payables drove $118 million of cash flow versus the prior year and took its days from 60 to 74, a 14-day increase. ", "Inventories, on the other hand, I would look for a significant inventory turns increase in the fourth quarter. Inventory takes a little bit longer when you make the process improvements to get the results. But from where I sit, I can see excellent progress in the business units across the company. We have solid plans in place to affect this improvement in the fourth quarter. I think that's going to go a long ways towards contributing to the $1.1 billion of cash flow that we expect to drive this year. Working capital through SFS is a momentum gain and we are gaining momentum. So more to come and stay tuned. Now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who'll take you through the financial aspects.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. So we start on Page 12. I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about our free cash flow performance. As a reminder, this does exclude M&A charges, the numbers on the page. Specifically, if we start with working capital, as Jim mentioned on the previous page, we had a very nice performance year-over-year. But sequentially, we had a little bit of a retraction of working capital, which is why you see a $45 million negative. Very much a seasonality phenomena, where we tend to see a great deal of our working capital benefit occur in the fourth quarter, of both legacy companies for Stanley and Black & Decker. And so throughout the year, we've had a slight negative performance in working capital, as you see $121 million. We would expect that to turn positive in the fourth quarter, closer to $100 million and $150 million of a positive. That will drive a lot of the strong cash flow performance that we'll see next quarter and will allow us to feel that we've achieved our $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year. ", "A couple of other items of note on the page. If you look at other large negative in there, and we talked about this throughout the year, as I mentioned in the July earnings call, we had a significant tax settlement in the first and the second quarter that was noncash of about $70 million. We also have a large pension payment that's occurring throughout the year, which will be about $80 million by the end of the year, $60 million through 3 quarters. And then a few other items that make up that $233 million of a negative. Even with that though, we feel that we'll be able to achieve our $1.1 billion free cash flow by the end of the year. ", "Another item of note is CapEx. In line with our projections, it's about 2.1% of revenue. And this will be CapEx excluding any M&A-related capital activities. But it's on track for our expectations. So why would we feel comfortable that we can achieve $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the year? Well, one of the big items is what I've mentioned, working capital will swing to a positive of about $100 million to $150 million for the full year after the fourth quarter has been completed. And that's really due to the phenomena of seasonality, as well as the SFS activities that Jim was describing on the previous page. Additionally, if you look at history of the 2 legacy companies over the past 2 years, anywhere from 50% to 60% of the free cash flow is achieved in the fourth quarter. If you utilize both types of analytical statistics it gets you to $1 billion, $1.1 billion of a projection for the year, hence why we feel comfortable that we can achieve the free cash flow performance by the end of 2011. ", "Moving to the next page, spending a little bit of time on 2011 outlook. The first item I want to talk about is net organic sales. Our current projection for the year is 3.5% organic sales, which is down from the 4% to 5% we provided in July. I'll remind everyone that our guidance throughout the year has really been predicated on very little market growth in the mature markets in Europe and in the United States. But what we have seen in the third quarter, and we expect to continue in the fourth quarter, is a bit of a retraction in the U.S. hand tool volumes, as Jim discussed, on the segment slides earlier. We would imagine that likely will continue in the fourth quarter. We're also seeing modest softness in Europe. We discussed softness in CDIY back in July. We're also seeing a little bit of softness in our Industrial & Automotive Repair tool business and a flat performance in our Security business in Europe. Offsetting that is a great performance in our Engineered Fastening business, as both John and Jim had discussed earlier this morning. But we'd expect those trends to continue. Hence, why we believe we'll have a lower organic growth performance in revenue this year. What that means to EPS is that we still believe we'll be able to achieve our EPS range, where we communicated in July a range of $5.15 to $5.40, although we would be at the lower end of the range and the Q4 EPS will be $1.30. ", "A few items embedded in our forecast for the year. They're more nonoperational in nature, as you can see on the last bullet on the left-hand side of this page. We certainly did a buyback of $350 million or 5.6 million shares, which drove our share count down and our average for the year will now be approximately $167 million versus $170 million we communicated in July. The tax benefits that we had in the third quarter, where our tax rate was around 20%, in the third quarter, we would expect this for the year, the tax rate will be between 17% and 18%. So lower than we communicated in July. So those 2 items together, about an $0.18 EPS positive for the entire year. Offsetting that, though, is what's been happening with foreign currency, and we see a significant decline in the euro versus the dollar. Primarily that's the main driver. And that's having a negative impact of $0.13 cents on our forecast as well. So the net impact of that is about a $0.05 positive on the outlook for 2011. ", "Moving to the right side of the page, we believe the total revenue growth performance will be about 12.5%. I mentioned the organic piece of 3.5% and then we believe acquisitions, which a large part of that will be Niscayah as well as currency, will add an additional 9% for the year. And then a little bit of housekeeping related to interest, other net and restructuring. We still expect that to be approximately $330 million as we're definitely having lower non-M&A restructuring this year. However, we have higher amortization that's coming from Niscayah that pretty much offsets that, so a net mutual versus what we were seeing in July. ", "We're reiterating a few items. We expect $200 million in cost synergies in 2011. We believe that even with the promotional discounting that Jim described around pricing, we still will achieve price inflation recovery of between 33% and 50%, closer to the bottom end of that range. And then our free cash flow, I mentioned earlier, of $1.1 billion being achieved. So we're still achieving our lower end of our guidance range that we started with earlier in the year, despite very turbulent market conditions and a few unforeseen headwinds. ", "So looking ahead to 2012. We thought it was important to give various folks some insight into what are thoughts were related to 2012. If we assume economic conditions remain as is, so we have a little bit of softness in parts of Europe and in some of the U.S. hand tool markets, we have strength in some of our Industrial businesses, expecting modest growth in Security, et cetera, we believe $6 EPS for 2012 appears achievable, and here's why. If you start with 2011 as a base, if you're utilizing the $1.30 guidance I just provided for the fourth quarter and adding that to our year-to-date EPS performance of $3.89, gets you to a $5.19 EPS for 2011. John mentioned that we have $115 million of cost synergies related to Black & Decker in 2012, which is about $0.50 EPS earnings accretion. We also have the Niscayah transaction that John discussed. That will be $0.20 accretion in 2012. So those are 2 items that we can execute upon and perform, which will drive accretion of a significant nature. Additionally, if we just take an assumption around volume and revenue synergies that will have a consistent performance to what we've seen this year, which is in essence driving growth in emerging markets, both market growth and revenue synergy base, gaining market share, as well as a relatively flat performance in the mature markets of Europe and the United States, you could see that we would have a relatively consistent performance with 2011. ", "Offsetting those 3 positives will be a tax kind of clawback, where we had a 17.5% tax rate in 2011. I would imagine that would return back into the 20s for 2012. That will be a bit of a negative as we walk to 2012 $6 EPS. A few items that are not shown here that offset each other would be general productivity as we drive productivity through our supply chain. That will be a positive. But we will have a bit of an overhang, especially in the first and part of the second quarter of inflation versus price that will carry over into next year. And then if currency rates stay where they are today, we will have a bit of a negative drag from FX. Those 3 items will offset each other at this point in time, which is why we feel comfortable that the $6 is achievable. ", "So to summarize the call this morning, the integrations of both Black & Decker and Niscayah are progressing very well. We're comfortable with the Niscayah leadership and the integration teams are in place. As Jim and John touched on the market share gains, they're very evident across all 3 of our segments. Professional Power Tools are up 20% despite no increase in housing starts. The Engineered Fastening business, up 14%, which is approximately 3x global light vehicle production around the world. Our Security hardware business, up 10%, in a declining market. The ongoing global company-wide SFS implementation is definitely gaining traction. You saw the numbers that Jim presented. Working capital turns have increased 24% versus the prior year. It's really demonstrating the organizational agility and the effectiveness of integrating Black & Decker and assimilating them into the Stanley Fulfillment System. This powerful accretion from both cost and revenue synergies that have existed in 2011, that will carry over into 2012, which is why we believe we can drive an EPS performance of $6. With that, we'll open it up to Q&A.", "Kate White Vanek", "Great. Kim, we'd like to open up and begin our Q&A. As always, we're going to follow the one question, one follow-up model going forward.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just wondering if you -- you talked a lot about the thoughts going to the $6 earnings for 2012. Can you give any sort of quick thoughts in terms of your cash flow and thought on what you can do to SFS next year for cash flow generation but also thinking about any potential contributions to the pension?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Dan, it's Don. I would say that the pension -- just to deal with that last part, the pension contribution will be consistent with 2011, so there wouldn't be any significant increase there. As far as the free cash flow performance, we do believe we will exceed $1.1 billion next year as well, and we will have a nice working capital performance embedded in that. And I would imagine you'd see working capital turns improve about 0.5 turn in 2012 versus 2011.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then also, I guess, the follow-up would be just really into hand tools in terms of the promotional activity, in terms of pricing there. As you look forward to the coming year, assuming sort of a challenging environment here, are you assuming that there is continued pressure in terms of pricing and margins in that area?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, this is Jim. The way we constructed the promotional activity, it was essentially a one-quarter phenomenon. Now we also have some promotional activity in the fourth quarter. This time, it will be in the Consumer Power Tools business and much more so than the Professional as you get into the seasonal aspects of Consumer Power Tools and the gifts and so forth, that tends to be more in their fairway. Beyond that, it really remains to be seen what happens with the competitive backdrop in terms of pricing. All our competitors have, like we have, faced significant price inflation. We raised our prices, they didn't for the most part. So we're going to be just kind of stepping back and observing, and we'll see what happens with respect to that and we will do what we have to do to maximize our share and our profitability.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jim Lucas from Janney Capital Markets.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "First question, regarding the M&A pipeline. With Niscayah now closed and the share repurchase largely completed this year, could you talk a little bit about the appetite for deals as well as what you're seeing in the pipeline these days?", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure, Jim, this is John. We always have an appetite, as those who follow the company know, because historically, between 50% and 2/3 of our free cash has gone to acquisitions. That being said, those who follow us will also know we're very disciplined in terms of our credit rating, financial hurdles for acquisitions and our organizational capacity, all of which will come into play. Our 5 strategic growth platforms remain the same. We've been pretty public with what they are: Convergent, Mechanical, Security, Engineered Fastening, Healthcare and Infrastructure. There is a good pipeline. I think the important thing to know is the majority of that pipeline is outside the U.S., number one, and in very high-growth emerging markets, number two. But 2 things importantly there, those do take longer to incubate, many are private companies and we need to be quite comfortable that we have both the financial and organizational capacity with the cash we generate, as well as with the people we can put on the field before we pursue one. So our strategy remains the same. Our financial discipline remains the same. Organizational capacity remains a discipline. The focus is on those 5 areas. And from a geographic perspective, it's in very high-growth markets. And I guess, I'd go so far to say it won't be in the first half of the year where you see something game-changing and that we don't feel that we have either the organizational or financial capacity to do that.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. And I would just like to follow up, and this is Jim, to say that as we look at an acquisition at this point in time, we're looking at trading that up against a share repurchase. And as you saw in the quarter, we bought $100 million more than we had previously planned because of the opportunistic price that we felt was on the table. And we will continue to make that evaluation on an ongoing basis. When you're trading for 6x EBITDA, it's hard to get your head around paying 11x or 12x or 10x or 9x even for something, unless the synergies are so rich that after the implementation, you get to a point where you're at or near the market multiple of the company. So it's a tougher decision. It's a more thoughtful decision right now as it relates to whether we buy our own stock or whether we buy another company. Now in this case of international acquisitions, as John mentioned, that will probably be our focus. The pipeline is certainly strong there and the obvious benefit from that strategically is there. But you also have the opportunity to use international cash that otherwise could not be deployed in favor of share repurchase. So it's the U.S. acquisitions that really get the tough scrutiny as to whether we should do them or not in the face of what I just described.", "James C. Lucas - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And as a follow-up, you gave us some color on the initial revenue synergies that you've captured using Latin America as an example. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the early successes of any standout, as well as you're looking at it, are others beginning to emerge that you didn't identify initially?", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure. I'll take it, and Jim should feel free to follow up. Couple 3 that are in the marketplace, so we're quite comfortable talking about it. I'll start with Latin America first. The fact that we're producing and selling Stanley-branded Hand Tools in Uberaba. That's our plant in Brazil, our legacy BDK plant, with a tremendous adjacent distribution center, where historically Stanley ran a very high-priced import model. It was subject to 18% plus tariff. So Stanley Hand Tools produced in Latin America, sold in Latin America through a well-established Black & Decker distribution channel, jumps right out as probably the biggest one, Jim. The second one bring to mind is things like DEWALT Hand Tools at a large domestic customer, which of course could not have been done under the previous regime. DEWALT is an incredibly powerful brand name, but Black & Decker didn't have the capability to produce or source hand tools that would merit the quality and performance that would merit the DEWALT name or they would've done that on their own a long time ago. That's the second example. Third, just in distribution. Jim mentioned the Mac aficionados. I think most people on the phone understand how the Mac model works. They're essentially franchisees. And while they drive Mac trucks, everything on their truck isn't Mac. The fact that a Mac distributor has DEWALT power tools on his truck, you can only imagine the competitive advantage that gives them and the opportunity that is for the Mac sales folks, which has really helped improve their top line as well as their bottom line. So those are 3 that are in the marketplace, more to come. But we're really pleased with the traction it's gaining and the results that those synergies are generating.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question, if I could just go back to 2012 guidance and the positive impact that you expect from volume and revenue synergies. Obviously, we're still a couple of quarters away, but -- or at least a quarter away rather, but I was wondering if you could parse out kind of, of the positive impact, how much incremental -- you've been talking about a 50 bps of positive top line growth from revenue this year, what that might be next year? And of the core volume, let's say, how much from developed markets versus emerging markets?", "Donald Allan", "Michael, it's Don. I would -- we're certainly not giving specific guidance yet, but to give you a little bit of an indication of our thought process. Certainly, we've seen about 3.5% organic growth in 2011 and about 50 basis points of that is coming from revenue synergies. As we go into 2012, we would expect that the revenue synergy number to increase a little bit from a percentage point as we go into the year, so somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points coming from revenue synergies. Combining that, we do expect emerging markets around the world to grow from a market growth perspective and gaining share, not really duplicating what I'm describing around revenue synergies. So that's going to give us some growth. And then our belief right now is we're going to continue to see some of the softness that we've seen in Europe continue next year. So maybe a little bit of a retraction for the first part of the year and a stabilization and flat performance in the back half. And then the U.S. will be similar, I think, in that regard. What we've seen this year will continue or what we've seen in the back half will continue into next year. So the mature markets, we wouldn't expect much growth, in some cases, a little bit of a retraction. And then a lot of our growth is going to come from emerging markets and revenue synergies. And that's our current thought process.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's really helpful. I appreciate it. Second question, if we could just go back to the promotions in the power tools, if you could just kind of give us a sense. You said Professional grew over 20%. How much you might think came from the promotions themselves? And I guess, conceptually speaking, you put through the price increase, yet you also had these promotions. What's your view in terms of the stability of that price increase? And is it just something that, I guess, like you said before, you're going to have to take on a quarter-by-quarter basis?", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure, Mike, a fair question. I think I fear you misinterpreted Jim's comments. And I'm really glad you asked the question to give us a chance to clarify. Essentially, none of that growth came from promotion. Let me break the power tools. The overwhelming majority of that increase came because we had tremendous sell-through on the 12-volt lithium-ion Max product and tremendous pipeline and sell-in on the really, really well-accepted 18- and 20-volt. That's where the overwhelming majority of the lift came. It's where we got the pricing. And of course, we have to announce pricing -- not have to, but we chose to announce pricing across the entire Professional Power Tool line and sell-in and sell-through of those at higher prices was terrific. The promotion that we talked about, recall that's still a very large part of our franchises in the older nickel cadmium technology. And the point Jim made is a very important one. It's a high-performing product, but the reason lithium-ion is growing so much is the charge lasts longer and it is greener. It's also a lot more expensive. So there are folks who are looking at good performance for a good price, who want the NiCad but we're required to promote it more heavily than the lithium-ion product. And then the last point that Jim raised, remember the Black & Decker brand, which is very powerful, is less focused at the professional user as opposed to the DIYer, and it's also a very, very important gift item. It's one of the few brands and products in our line that has any seasonality at all. They are very popular Christmas gifts for dad, for granddad, for the child with a new apartment or a new home. And so there is some fourth quarter seasonality historically promoting of the Black & Decker Consumer Power Tool brand. Having said all that, we will maintain or continue to grow share. We will not be at a price disadvantage or premium to our competitors. We are the market leader and as a consequence, behave like the price leader. And if we're out there alone, we'll promote to get back to competitive market prices. And if we're not, we will continue to gain share at higher prices. And I think that's the best guidance we can provide you. We look at this daily, not quarter-to-quarter or in the rearview mirror. I think, so you don't get cut off, another very important point to make, we've talked about this on previous calls, our pricing center of excellence works very closely with our global sourcing organization to see inflationary increases long before they show up in product costs, so our SBU managers know they're coming, can either reengineer or condition the sales force for the need to take a price increase, so we get out ahead of it. The result, at the end of the day, we're in an industry where historically, real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years. Gross margins are about 35%. If you didn't somehow, between productivity and price, get 3% a year, your margins would decline. Our margins are not declining. In fact, they're growing. So it suggests a combination of price and productivity has historically and will continue to deliver well above industry average margins. And we think we have the programs and processes in place and look at it closely enough to carry that forward for the next 12 months.", "James M. Loree", "And If I could just take it to a very tactical level, the impact from the promotions from a revenue perspective in CDIY might have been somewhere between 1% and 2% of sales in the quarter. And our estimation is that the market was probably slightly negative. And so that probably just got us right up to about flat. And anything beyond that was driven by new product introductions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Guys, I was wondering if you could address the issue of inventory destocking. Obviously, as we're looking across the Industrial group, it's something that people -- as we look ahead into the fourth quarter and year end, people are a little concerned that we may see a wave of inventory destocking. Typically, I would think that your product mix isn't going to be particularly susceptible to that. However, we have in the past seen Black & Decker talk about that probably a little bit more than Stanley. So I was curious if you could talk about what you see from your customers in terms of vulnerability to an inventory destocking wave if one were to come.", "Donald Allan", "Sure, Stephen, it's Don. I'd be happy to talk about that. Obviously, I think as you're aware and many folks are, we are monitoring POS and weeks on stocks on hand on a regular basis. So we get that information for our major customers, and we're always monitoring to make sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves from an inventory perspective. Right now, where we are, we feel comfortable where inventory levels are. We tend to want them to be somewhere between on average, 10 to 12 weeks of inventory on hand in our major customers. And you may have small pieces that deviate from that range. But overall, if we're in that range, we feel reasonably comfortable with the levels of inventory. Additionally, we're always listening to any signals from our customers as to whether there's change in thought process of levels of inventory that they may want to maintain. At this stage, we're not aware of anything that would cause a concern in that light. Our inventories are at the right level based on the range I provided, as well as we're not hearing any signals from our customers that, that's a particular initiative or set of actions they may be considering or evaluating.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That's comforting to hear. Thanks a lot for that. Second question relates to the geographic breakdown that you provided on Page 5, where Latin America was up organic 23%. I was curious as to whether or not you could talk about what the margin profile looks like for your Latin American offering, whether it's generally higher margin or lower margin to your company average.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, we actually put that in the presentation. And we'll say this much, it's a very fair question, and it's an important answer. It is above line average margin. We are not going to get more granular than that on this call for obvious reasons. But when it's growing that fast, a very logical and fair question is: Are you growing volume up at the expense of share and margin? We are really pleased due to a combination of premium products and a very competitive cost position due to a world-class manufacturing facility and a good local management team that the entire business in Latin America is above our line average for each specific segment.", "James M. Loree", "And we can say the same thing for Asia as well. You grow into Asia, you grow into Latin America, you grow into mix and the higher margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered. One small one, I guess, that's left for me, CRC-Evans, the margins look terrific, the sales being up only mid-single-digit. I would've thought that, that end market would have been a little bit more robust with pipeline CapEx where it is. I know it's a niche business for you. But what do you ascertain that the market share trends there for CRC? And is the integration perhaps affecting top line execution?", "James M. Loree", "This is Jim. Certainly, we're very encouraged by what we have purchased. And what I will tell you is that if there's any governor on sales right now with CRC-Evans, it is the onshore business in North America. And the onshore business in North America has been characterized by -- especially at 48-inch pipeline in that segment, which is our sweet spot, has been characterized by bureaucratic, unnecessary delays that are related to environmentalists, government, et cetera. And it's incredibly frustrating. There are all sorts of opportunities, the Keystone Pipeline being the biggest that could really drive tens of millions of dollars of revenue and many jobs for this country. And unfortunately, it's delayed. Now it looks like it might be breaking loose. And if it does, it will be a great market for us. In the meantime, we're not sitting still. We have -- actually, I'd say the integration has helped these folks in terms of their product development strategy because where the action is today is in the less than 48-inch pipeline. We are completely redeveloping products that are suited for that particular market, but that's unfortunately a couple of quarters out before we really get the benefit of that. So the shale and those types of things, it's all going to be a narrow pipeline. So when we get prepared to serve that market, it's also going to be very strong for us. And then finally, the offshore business, which is really the outstanding part of this business that we have made so much progress in over the last year, winning accounts with the 2 major pipeline suppliers in the world on the offshore basis. We have a terrific value proposition with welding, coating, pipe laying, inspection and so forth. We've gained market share. We've had many, many wins around the world, and that will be coming next year in force. It's a $30 million business today. We expect it to be $100 million to $200 million within a couple of years, and next year will be a very significant growth from offshore. So no matter what happens in the onshore business, we're going to get great growth from the offshore. If we can get the products configured to the smaller diameter pipelines and if the government can get off dead center here and get going with the Keystone project and some other major projects, I think we'll be in great shape.", "John F. Lundgren", "Sam, this is John. So you don't get cut off and you're able to ask a second question, I'll add 2 things. First of all, Jim Loree is not running for public office. He's too valuable as a senior executive at Stanley Black & Decker as much as we think he'd make a wonderful government official. Second, probably equally important point, simply for us, this is a very lumpy business that we're getting used to. You know our business well and in our Industrial platform, about 80% of what we do is made to stock. It comes out of a customer's maintenance budget. It's no less predictable than our CDIY business. Infrastructure, in general, but Hydraulics and CRC in particular, these are generally big numbers, big projects, and quite frankly, depending on when they're executed, when they're completed and when they hit the P&L, if we have $400 million business, it isn't $100 million a quarter. It's $70 million, one quarter and $130 million, the next. And I think it's important that as we look at it, that we understand that. And we're looking at longer-term trends because the orders, they tend to come in much bigger numbers and bigger chunks. And as a consequence, it's just a lumpier business than 80% of what we do.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "The other question is what's the latest plan and update for Pfister at this point?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Well, it's a business that needs to, like any and all of our businesses, needs to earn its cost of capital to remain a valuable part of our portfolio. And what I'm able to say at this stage, Sam, is it took a tremendous bowshot in the first quarter, lost 20-plus percent of its business. Since then, it's recovered very, very nicely. They've got a very sound strategy in place. We're looking at the business hard to can it, in fact, recover to the levels of profitability and ongoing strategic position that it can remain part of our portfolio. And if not, as you know, we're fairly dispassionate about these things. And if it can't and we make the decision long term that it won't, it will no longer be part of our portfolio. Jury's still out at this stage, but stay tuned and we'll keep you updated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "I just wanted to talk about the CDIY margin as a whole segment. We talked a lot about power tools within that. But as we think about the fourth quarter and beyond, I think year-to-date, margins in that business are at 13.5% and you still have somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 million to $100 million of cost synergies to come. Is this a business that can do 15% to 16% type operating margins? Or because of the competitive nature of the peers and the end channel, do you have to start reinvesting that back into the business? I guess, just some help thinking about the fourth quarter rate as well as just longer-term.", "Donald Allan", "Dennis, it's Don. As far as the fourth quarter rate goes, I mean, I think if you look at the third quarter, it's indicative of what you're going to probably see in the fourth quarter roughly. As far as long term, I believe that this can be a 15% segment from an operating margin perspective. It will require continued execution on the cost synergies. It will require price discipline around inflationary environments et cetera. And of course, the most important thing, it will definitely need to be able to provide continual new products into the marketplace like it's done over the last 12 to 18 months than frankly both companies have done over the last several decades. So those are the keys to being successful and being a market leader with the powerful brands that we have in that particular sector. And when economic market growth comes, and it will some day, I just don't know when, there's no doubt in my mind it will be above 15% operating margin.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. The second question relates to just the overall business mix in Europe. I think most of the comments you made seems as though business held in pretty well during the third quarter and you noted maybe some modest softening into the early part of next year. How do you sort of think about the risk of what's going on over there, the risk of the recession, parts of your business that would maybe be most impacted or any red flags that you guys are on the lookout for that we also could be thinking about as it relates to the international exposure?", "James M. Loree", "It's interesting when you look at what are the risks to our revenue line from a double dip, for example. Let's say that Europe were to drive a double dip in a global sense. The construction market today accounts for about 2/3 of our revenues when you take into account both resi, non-resi and I include DIY in that and commercial. I don't know how much less construction could go on. We're approaching very close to 0. So now could you have inventory corrections? Yes, but they tend to be temporary. So there could be some volatility in some quarters. On the Industrial side, if I go back to 2009 and think back to the implosion that we had in Industrial, driven primarily by inventories, our Industrial production globally was down 2 or 3, 4 points and volume in Industrial was down 20 to 30 points. And that was characteristic across the industrial universe. That could happen again. So as we look at it, we have a reasonable amount of confidence that they will get their act together in the EU, over time. I think most people have a reasonable level of confidence that they will. Nothing happens quickly because there's so much consensus that needs to be built. But if, for some reason, the wheels come off, this is a management team that took this company through the 2008, 2009 downturn, which was gut-wrenching successfully, and we will do it again. And we will use exactly the same approach, which is we will resize the cost structure to line up with the revenues that we will be looking at, at the time. And we will go on the offense during that timeframe and we will take actions to position the company for success, both within the downturn and as we come out of the downturn. Do we think that's going to happen? Absolutely not. Are we cognizant that it could happen and it's more than the de minimis probability? Absolutely, and we're ready for it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So if we look at the 2012 guidance, the earnings guidance is up about 15%. Free cash guidance looks like its flat to up slightly. It's still pretty good free cash conversion. I think it's about 110%. But when I think about the discrepancy between the growth rates and earnings versus free cash flow for next year, is that primarily because the incremental working capital opportunities are lesser next year or that a big chunk of that work was already done this year? Or is there something else there?", "Donald Allan", "Jason, it's Don. What I said was we expect to achieve $1.1 billion next year. So we didn't actually give a specific number. We just expect it to be higher. As we finalize our guidance in January and provide more detailed insight, we'll give more specifics about what we think that number is. But to your point about working capital, I think there -- and Jim mentioned it in his presentation, there's a great deal of opportunity to continue to drive working capital benefit. And Jim indicated $0.5 billion of assets that can be freed up from legacy Black & Decker over the next 2 to 3 years. We would expect a portion of that number to be achieved in 2012, and then the vast majority, the remainder of it in 2013 and maybe part of '14.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, Jason, it's John. I mean, it's early days, I think, in fairness to be projecting cash flow. We had a lot of discussion as to what we wanted to say about 2012, but we thought it would help you and everybody on the phone. But I'm quite comfortable saying that remember, a meaningful percentage of the entire management team of Stanley Black & Decker's incentives in measurement is based on cash conversion. So you know it's a focal point for the company. But I think on the same token, taking $100 million or $200 million out of working capital, out of inventory specifically, year in, year out, is not a 2-foot putt straight uphill. There are a lot of moving pieces. And I'm very comfortable with SFS, the traction it's gaining. But the last thing anybody should do, including this management team or anybody on the phone is take it for granted that, that goes on in perpetuity. So there's arguably some thoughtful conservatism in the guidance that Don's giving. And we'll get more granular on that on our first quarter call, and obviously, on the fourth quarter results in January. But your question's a fair one. But I think we're where we need to be for the time being.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "That's helpful. Also if we're thinking about 2012, I understand that none of us has a crystal ball. But if we assume the macro environment remains the same, which seems to be kind of the underlying premise behind the framework that you created for 2012, how should we think about some of the company-specific business situations that you had this year? And what the impact could be on growth rates? And specifically, you have the access business where you had some remodeling delays, so maybe there could be some catch-up there. Presumably next year, we won't have a headwind in fastening in Japan. The Pfister issues anniversary, I believe, next quarter, and kind of the alleviation of those headwinds. Does that wind up potentially having a material impact on the growth rate next year even if the macro environment is unchanged?", "John F. Lundgren", "Jason, everything you mentioned and approximately 15 things you haven't, some of which are far greater impact, some of which are less, are what went into our thinking as we put our preliminary numbers together. It is really too early to talk about each and every one, not because we won't, it's because we don't think we have a better view than you do. Everything you said and everything we've thought about is baked into the 3.5% global organic growth that in mid-October 2011 is our best guess off a base from where we think we will depart 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if you could talk about the strength in North America IAR, which is if Europe was down kind of -- soft, it would appear that you had a high single, low double-digit success in America. I know you're talking about the trucks channel penetration. Do you see that as really structural? And how much of that structural component is related to kind of key competitors, Apex Tools, not being as focused? Or could you kind of describe what's going on there because it contributed so much to the margin expansion?", "John F. Lundgren", "Ken, we're not going to talk about specific competitors on our call. We never have and never will. But Jim can give you a very granular perspective on what's going on, and it's all good.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. And I think we clearly are getting some help from the market, no question, a couple of points of help from the market. It's been in auto repair with the aging fleet in this country has been a good market, not spectacular but solid. And so that's helped. But I think underlying that, the industrial markets have been healthy as well. In certain segments, such as automotive OEM, for example, in aerospace and some other key segments for that business. So we've had some market tailwinds. But I think the biggest positive thing going on in IAR North America and around the globe is the emergence of that business as a global platform, being run as a global platform as opposed to a series of smaller business units that were not coordinated. And the single biggest benefit from that has been leveraging the product development from the FACOM group based in Europe and driving new products into Mac Tools. And then from a Proto perspective, I think we benefited greatly from its strength in some of the verticals such as petrochem and aerospace and some other verticals that have been strong around the globe. And taking the Black & Decker and Stanley-merged global distribution structure and leveraging Proto across the globe into the emerging markets in other areas around the world, that shows up in North America because it's Proto. And Proto shows up in North America today. I think that's helped as well. So it's been a combination of market strength, and at the same time, I think, improved execution in this business, deriving primarily from changing the business model to be a globally coordinated business with product development centered in Europe and driven into various markets around the world.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And this next question, just because we're going to be approaching the 3-year anniversary of Black & Decker, I wonder if you could just kind of have kind of a broader look back. Obviously, the $6 number which you guys came out early on in 2012, kind of coincides with that 3-year outlook. Could you kind of talk about how obviously there's different -- I think the top line has been pretty similar to what you guys expected at 2%. You guys obviously got more upside on the cost synergies, sales and you have Niscayah and some other things. Can you just kind of talk about the prospect of how that $6 that you came out with do appreciate early compares to kind of what you thought the business would be like 3 years ago? If that's a fair question.", "Donald Allan", "Ken, it's Don. If you think about going back to November of 2009 when we announced the transaction, we had a view of the top line that was very little growth, about 2% or so, 2% or 3% and we had $350 million of cost synergies and we haven't provided any estimates of revenue synergies at that point. Subsequent to what's happened, since then and the last almost coming up on 2 years, I guess, of the announcement in the next month, we've increased our cost synergies to $485 million on an annualized basis for 2013. We've got revenue synergies of $300 million to $400 million. And frankly, the top line growth has been a little bit stronger than that 2% number that you were talking, not a lot. So you have a little bit of that going on as well. Offsetting some of those positive things, as we certainly didn't expect the commodity inflationary environment we had in 2011. We've been able to mitigate that partially with the price increases we talked about throughout the year and today. But we had a vision of being $5 EPS and $1 billion free cash flow in year 3. We're achieving over $1 billion free cash flow this year and we're over $5 EPS this year. So we're certainly well ahead of schedule based on the items that I kind of laid out and feel very pleased with where we are in the current state of the integration.", "John F. Lundgren", "And Ken, I'll add because you'll get cut off. From a qualitative perspective, we're very pleased. It's as simple as that. Starting at the board level, the way the expertise from the 2 boards have come together. We just finished the board meeting and you have to stop and think who was the legacy Stanley director, who was the Black & Decker director. Corporate headquarters is in New Britain, Connecticut. Stanley was the prevailing company. That makes sense. We're running our CDIY business from Towson, Maryland, the entire CDIY-wide business, that's where Black & Decker Power Tools is headquartered. We run the entire Security business from Indianapolis. We run our IAR business, as Jim said, as a global platform from Brussels, Belgium in a neutral site. And if you sit in a meeting, whether it be a strategy review, a budget review or a quarterly review, we're at the stage where you have stop and think that the person presenting was legacy Stanley or legacy Black & Decker. I would tell you and Mark Mathieu, our Senior Vice President of Human Resources, would tell you that's the acid test beyond the numbers, how it's coming together. And less than 2 full years into it or exactly 2 years post-announcement, I feel very good as the CEO of this company where we are. That being said, I feel equally passionate that we need to continue at the same pace to truly differentiate this company from its competitors. And that's what we intend to do.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "With respect to Europe, I know there's a lot of concern about Europe these days. Don, in your remarks, I think you mentioned that you expected Europe to be soft in the first half and stable in the second half. Can you help us calibrate the risk in the 2012 European story by giving us some kind of EPS sensitivity to a percentage change in your revenue or maybe an incremental margin?", "John F. Lundgren", "David, this is John. In the interest of everybody, Don has done that and so maybe we could check the transcript that simply said, \"We don't think it's going to get any worse.\" And when the global CDIY and construction market was down 75%, our unit volume was down 15%. So we just don't see step function changes due to a 2% or 3% softening in European GDP. It's 23% of our business. We've got meaningful platforms with all 3 businesses. I mean, round numbers. We've got $800 billion Security business, CDIY business and Industrial business. So it's a 3-legged stool. So I don't want to be cavalier and hopefully, I don't sound that way about the macroeconomic conditions in Europe. There's nothing we can do to control it. We spend our time worrying about the things and focusing on the things over which we do have some control and making sure we have contingency plans, as Jim described in great detail. Were it to get really bad, what we would do about it? So as a consequence that macroeconomic conditions in Europe had a more than 100 or 200 basis point negative impact on our top line, we would adjust our cost structure accordingly to deliver our earnings commitment.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. I guess, just as a follow-up question. You're active on the share repurchase program this quarter. You've indicated in the past that you devote about 1/3 of your free cash flow back to the shareholders. On the $1.1 billion free cash flow look, it's, what, $350 million, $370 million of free cash, your dividend consumes about $280 million of that. I guess, the question is just how much more active you can be on the share repurchase front going forward?", "Donald Allan", "I think Jim touched on this, and I believe he was answering a question earlier on. We will continue to evaluate if we're looking at a U.S. acquisition, the alternative of doing a share repurchase. That being said, our cash is all overseas. And so for us to do that, we have to pay a tax and that really makes it very difficult hurdle when you're measuring against the potential acquisition. I don't foresee a great deal of share repurchase in the short and medium-term, but that's something we continue to evaluate as market conditions, in particular the equity markets, seem to fluctuate and have volatility.", "Kate White Vanek", "Kim, I believe that concludes our call today. I want to thank everybody for chiming in and joining us. As always, please contact me afterwards with questions. And thank you, all.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Monica, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Kate Vanek, you may begin.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thanks so much Monica, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker fourth quarter and full-year 2011 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. ", "I'd like to point out that our earnings release, which was issued after yesterday's close and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website, as well as our newly launched iPad app, which you can access through the App Store. ", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's fourth quarter and full-year results and various other topical matters followed by Q&A. There is some helpful information in the appendix of the slide deck as it relates to your model. If you have any questions, as always, feel free to contact me. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. Replay number and access code are in our press release. ", "And we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K, which we filed with the press release and in our most recent 34 act. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Just in terms of fourth quarter highlights and basically a summary of what we will talk about this morning, some points on the fourth quarter, some points on the year and a couple of points on 2012.  All of which we'll get into in more detail. ", "Fourth quarter revenues per the press release, up 17% to $2.8 billion, organically up 6%. CDIY was up 8% organically, excluding Pfister. Good solid 7% organic growth in industrial. Security as a total segment up 1% with 4% organic growth in Convergent Security. And I'm going to give you some more granularity in that on the very next slide. ", "Fourth quarter diluted EPS of $1.36. That, of course, excludes the merger and acquisition-related charges. Fourth quarter diluted GAAP EPS of $1.05, also a significant increase. ", "Looking at the year in total, we saw revenues grow 12%, 4% organically from a $9.3 billion pro forma 2010 base. You'll recall the Black & Decker transaction officially closed in mid-March, 2010. So up 4% from the pro forma base. ", "Emerging markets now represent 14% of the company, that's a nice growth from the 11% of the company they represented at the time of closing and it continues to be an area of focus for us. ", "Diluted EPS for the year, $5.24, a 26% improvement. GAAP EPS of $4.06, free cash flow was slightly in excess of $1 billion and working capital turns reached 7.0, a 23% increase versus prior year and a 52% increase since the merger closed. That's clear evidence that the Stanley Fulfillment System's gaining traction and I think of significance. Those increases were across all businesses and across all regions, and Jim is going to give you some more detail on that a little bit later on this morning. Don's going go through guidance in detail. There was quite a bit in our press release, but we're guiding for 2012 of fully diluted EPS of $5.75 to $6. In order to get there and ensure we achieve it, we're also announcing a cost containment action with about $150 million of benefit in 2012. That benefit is separate from previously communicated and quantified integration-driven cost synergies, both from Black & Decker and Niscayah. ", "Simply said, since the last time we gave a preliminary look at 2012, the external environment is we've -- we've experienced a lot of headwinds with very little tailwind. Don will give you some of granularity but the euros and the reals have weakened significantly. The European economy is certainly weaker than it was 3 to 6 months ago. And there's some carryover inflation that thus far is unrecovered. We've -- that's what we've learned in the last 3 months, and we have 2 options, or had 2 options of accepting that and accepting higher risk and lower earnings or moving proactively as we did in 2008 to get ahead of what we feel get ahead of the curve where we're going to have more headwind than tailwind. ", "Given the choice, Stanley Black & Decker is always going to choose to move proactively to get ahead of the curve, and that's exactly what we're doing, and Don will give you some more detail on that as he outlines the guidance. ", "2012 cash flow, we think we'll approach or slightly exceed $1.2 billion. A lot of that is going to come from working capital, and you'll see the sources of that when Don and Jim walk you through a little more detail. ", "Moving on to the next slide, just in terms of where did the growth come from and how did it look by business. Primarily in the fourth quarter, as well as the year, continues to be driven by new products and emerging markets. More detail on geography in just a minute. But very encouraging organic growth. ", "Looking at the fourth quarter, 6% in total, most of which came from volume, 1% came from price, acquisitions out at 11%, adding to a total of 17% growth in the fourth quarter, 6% of which was organic. ", "For the year, volume was up 4%, pricing was flat, a little less than historical recovery of inflation for a total of 4% organic growth, acquisitions added 6%, you will recall Niscayah being the largest acquisition closed in the fall of 2011. And currency was favorable in 2011 of 2%, so for a total revenue growth of 12%. ", "I think that the box on the right will be helpful. It's a lot of granularity, but we've elected to provide it because I think it will help you business-by-business, think through where we were and as a consequence, where we're going. ", "In the fourth quarter, Professional Power Tools and Accessories grew 9%, nice strong finish to a very, very good year in which that product line grew 13% on the strength of 20 volt lithium-ion and some promotional activities supporting the nickel cadmium platform. More from Jim in a minute on that. ", "Industrial remains a bright spot across the company, 7% in the fourth quarter, 10% for the year. It's across all of our global platforms and just gaining tremendous traction since we've done a better job at managing some of those businesses as global platforms with regional focus as opposed to managing those businesses in silos as we'd -- as quite [indiscernible] we had done in the past. ", "Convergent Security grew 4% in the quarter and 4% for the year, while the Commercial MAS business had a good fourth quarter, flat for the year. Consumer Power Tools, including outdoor, had a very strong seasonal finish. That business is a little more seasonal than any of our others, that's some of the Black & Decker branded power tool items as well as Outdoor. But the Black & Decker branded power tool business did very well in the fourth quarter, around the season. It's flat for the year. You will recall a very, very weak spring in terms of the outdoor products, some of which was weather-driven but a strong finish resulting in flat year-on-year performance for that business. ", "Handtools and Fastening up 6% in the quarter, 1% for the year. As we talked about, MAS residential was down 5% in the quarter, 3% for the year and Pfister is stabilizing, it was 5% in the quarter, 20% for the year, and the loss of a large piece of business at a large customer in the late first quarter, early second quarter of 2011 will anniversary at that same time next year. So more detail on that within the segments. ", "So total fourth quarter growth, 6% organically, 4% for the year, solid performance, clearly above market growth in both areas, which obviously implies some share gain. ", "Moving to the slide on geographies, we'll take it, I guess, in order of size and priority. The emerging markets continue to be the primary source of our growth. But if we look in the middle of left-hand side, U.S. remains our largest market for the year. It's 52% of our volume and it was flat. Second largest market to the right, of course, being Europe. Good solid performance in Europe, driven primarily by our strong Industrial business in Europe, up 4% for the quarter and 5% for the year. Europe, as the emerging markets grew, Europe as a percentage of our total business is now 20 -- is -- was 31% in the fourth quarter, but up to the year, it's 27%. ", "Probably the next most important market to focus on might be Canada, just quickly, a strong finish, resulting in a flat year, at 6% of our revenue. Latin America, bottom left, strength-to-strength. We grew 26% in the fourth quarter, 25% for the year and fourth quarter being about equal to the year, reflects the fact that our revenue synergies are more than offsetting or completely offsetting the fact that, that market while still growing at nice rates, the growth in Latin America has slowed down. Our growth has remained at the same pace due to the unique advantage or situation of some tremendous revenue synergies between the 2 businesses in Latin America. ", "Asia grew 12% in the fourth quarter, 18% for the year. Fourth quarter growth being slower than the year is consistent with the market slowing down, still achieved share gains for the year in Asia and we're pleased with that. ", "And Australia, down about 4%, it's primarily CDIY, it's stable. Consistent with market performance. And Australia, we have a very strong franchise there, but obviously it's far away and it's relatively small country, represents only 2% of our total revenue. So revenue synergies, new products and some good marketing support are helping increase brand awareness, expanding our global customer base and that thrust towards continuing to develop our franchises in emerging markets will carry forward into 2012. ", "Last but not least for me, before I turn it over to Jim to give you some more granularity on the segment, I think we'd be remiss not to provide an update on 2 major integrations that are in process, and simply said, they're still in really good shape. The Black & Decker integration is anticipated to achieve another $115 million incremental synergies in 2012. That's helping offset a lot of the headwinds that Don will walk you through. It's -- that's driving $0.50 of EPS accretion. ", "We anticipate achieving $450 million in cost synergies by the end of the year, so we'll be at a run rate of $485 million as we leave the year. Revenue synergies remain on track, $300 million to $400 million,  that'll add $0.35 to $0.50 of accretion by the end of 2013. We're just gaining traction there as the next bullet points out, a lot of that Latin American growth as I previously indicated, came from -- was -- contributed to $100 million total CDIY revenue synergies, which we're very, very pleased with. ", "Qualitatively, our best judgment is the cultures of the 2 companies are melding well together. The best data point we have is that -- is something we take very seriously. A global employee opinion survey, obviously completely objective, not traceable to individual employees as any objective survey would be. And 90% of the responses were favorable or highly favorable. We have never had results like that in our history. So it gave us a very, very good feeling that 2 terrific companies have come together with some similarities and some differences in culture, everybody's getting on the same page and we're focusing on the opportunities rather than the issues. ", "Last, but certainly not least with that integration, Stanley Fulfillment System's been fully embraced. You don't get CDIY working capital turns, which is where the majority of the integration takes place from where it was to 7.1 without everybody being on board and the same page. Jeff Ansell's team and Steve Stafstrom and the operating folks within that business are just doing a great job embedding that within our culture. ", "And as I think you all know, certainly we believe the road to improved margins and another source of cash that we can reinvest in growth, or return to shareholders is coming -- is the fleet of SFS being embedded across the system. ", "Quickly on Niscayah, we're still forecasting $45 million in cost synergies in 2012. It's going to drive about $0.20 of accretion and about $35 million more in synergies in 2013. That's the $80 million that we projected upon announcement of the acquisition. We haven't backed off from that at all. Most -- much of it is in Europe and it takes a little longer, but we have every bit as high a degree of confidence that we will achieve it. ", "The integration is progressing as planned. As I think some of you know, Brett Bontrager runs this business for us. Brett is probably our process expert on integration. He led the Black & Decker integration. So we have one of our most seasoned and experienced executives in the quarterback position. ", "Major upgrades to leadership are complete.  With Niscayah, not surprisingly, it was a relatively small publicly-traded company in a spin-off, so there were a lot of folks, good people in corporate positions, not necessarily industry or subject matter experts, and as often happens in these situations, they have moved on to other opportunities. But the counter of that is terrific strength in field tech and field sales and installation, both in Europe and the U.S. So we've had -- again have the opportunity to combine the best of the best, the very, very capable Niscayah field leaders, sales marketing, operations, technology have joined the team both in the U.S. and Europe. So it's a nice upgrade with the combined team. ", "As you would expect, we have reporting rhythms and weekly project tracking. This has been our DNA, it's what we do, it's how we operate, and it is a very large acquisition and the processes are essentially identical to what we did with Black & Decker. ", "A lot of questions on the European market. We didn't anticipate the European market being very strong when we acquired Niscayah. The -- a relatively soft forecast for the global European market was anticipated in our -- when we made our commitment, and we haven't backed off from the synergies or the accretion despite probably more headwind in Europe than many would have expected or anticipated. We remain focused on execution. So all in, we've got about $0.70 of accretion from the 2 integrations next year, which we have a very high degree of confidence. We will achieve, irrespective of the macroeconomic environment in general, and that in Europe in particular. ", "Let me turn it over to Jim Loree, who's going to give you, I think, I know, more granularity on the segments and some of the drivers going forward.", "James M. Loree", "Okay, well thanks, John. And maybe one of the untold and really elegant aspects of Niscayah is the fact that it was a $1.2 billion acquisition that was paid for with no incremental debt or equity, i.e., a redeployment of idle cash. So not only is it accretive to EPS, but also to the return on capital employed rate and cash flow return on investment. ", "Well moving to CDIY. CDIY had a solid quarter and is well-positioned for 2012. Revenues totaled $1.324 billion, up 6%, operating margin was $171 million, up 22%. They delivered 8% organic growth, that was their strongest quarter this year despite flat volume in Europe. And they achieved a 170 basis point increase in segment profit rate -- in the segment profit rate, driven by solid execution of the Black & Decker merger synergies, as well as volume leverage. ", "Along the geographic axises, once again, high teens organic growth was achieved in emerging markets. Europe was flattish, driven by the market conditions there, and new this quarter is the fact that the all-important North American region picked it up a notch and delivered mid-single-digits organic growth. ", "From a product perspective, both Consumer Power Tools and Professional Power Tools and Accessories posted strong growth numbers, with 10% and 9% growth organically, respectively. These healthy increases were fueled by strong new product sales, especially with respect to the lithium-ion spectrum of products across the brands, and we received little help from the market in the fourth quarter. Most of these increases were driven by share gains. ", "The revenue synergies also had a positive impact, and then Handtools and Fastening was strong, but lagged slightly, the power tools units, add up 6% organically. This was also propelled by new products and revenue synergies, especially as it relates to the DEWALT Hand Tools. ", "Looking forward, we remain positive on 2012 CDIY growth prospects for both revenue and margin, despite concerns surrounding the European markets and to some -- and a lesser extent, the emerging markets. Europe will be a headwind, but it will be offset, we think, by strong new product carryover plus a strong new product pipeline, as well as revenue synergies, which are now gaining momentum in the third year of the Black & Decker integration. ", "We have assumed continued sluggishness in the U.S. but the market does appear to be firming for housing and home improvement but we really haven't seen a big rebound yet. But that could happen. ", "Lithium-ion lines will be broadened as we look forward and as we speak, and the line up of new Black & Decker branded products and power tools, outdoor and home products is the most impressive that we've seen in several years. So look for an exciting NPI year and a good act to follow what have been 2 really good NPI years already. ", "Any concerns on the margin front for CDIY should be unfounded as we enter 2012, with our ongoing productivity initiatives set to deliver 2% to 3% annual productivity, much more limited unrecovered inflation for this year, although the tailwind will still be an issue or the headwind will still be an issue in the first quarter. And we're mixing in to both new products and emerging markets, both of which have higher than line average gross margin. And that -- in addition to that, we have the big slug of incremental cost synergies and CDIY share of the company's $150 million cost reduction. ", "So in short, the table is set for CDIY to perform well, even if the European economy retrenches. It is also set to outperform and ride the volume leverage if and when the U.S. housing and home improvement markets take off. ", "And moving on to Security. Security forged ahead in the fourth quarter and put some excellent numbers on the board, while assimilating the game-changing Niscayah acquisition. Their revenues totaled $827 million, up 49%. They were powered by the Niscayah acquisition, which closed in September, and put $1.2 billion of idle cash to work as I mentioned. It adds $0.20 of accretion this year and $0.45 over 3 years. It is a high-quality franchise that needed some management attention and some TLC, but we're very happy with what we have and where we are in the integration process. ", "Security is now 30% of company revenues, up 23% from a year ago, and the Security revenues are now at a $3.3 billion annualized run rate. Security segment profit was $129 million, up 37% and their profit rate increased to 18.5%, excluding acquisitions. The increase was driven by strong price inflation recovery, acquisition synergies and ongoing productivity initiatives. ", "And now with the Niscayah acquisition, Europe represents about 40% of Security revenues. For the long-term, this certainly provides a better balanced geographic footprint than the prior configuration, and clearly enhances the overall value of the franchise. But given European market conditions, there may be some short-term revenue pressures on Niscayah. And as John mentioned, our announced EPS commitments assume significant downward pressure. We can handle up to a 10% negative growth -- organic growth downdraft, and it can absorb that with no negative impact on our committed EPS accretion. And notably, Niscayah pro forma organic growth was minus 4% in the fourth quarter, so pretty far off from minus 10%. ", "It was an encouraging quarter for CSS with overall organic growth of 4%, with relatively slack geographic markets performing well, for example, the U.K. was also up 5%, and France was up 6%. We had healthy order flow and installation sales were up 12% globally, with monitoring RMR of 3% with a positive outlook. ", "On the other hand, Resi hardware was down 5% organically. We don't think this is an ongoing issue. We had an inventory adjustment at our largest customer due to the implementation of an automated replenishment system. The PLS turned positive in the fourth quarter, first quarter all year, and Kwikset, we believe, is continuing to gain share. ", "We had solid organic growth at both MAS Commercial and in automatic doors, both were up 5% organically. And finally, the integration of GMT is going very well. This is a small but important toehold in China and the Southeast Asian markets. ", "So all in all, a very busy but productive quarter for Security, which is set to be a stable and profitable growth engine for 2012. ", "Now let's turn to Industrial. Once again, Industrial delivered an outstanding performance. The revenues were $641 million, up 9%, 7% organically. The operating margin was $106 million, up 19%. The profit rate was a very attractive 16.6%, up 130 basis points from a year ago. The drivers were volume leverage productivity and strong price inflation recovery. ", "At IAR or Industrial & Automotive Repair, organic growth was 9%, which included 2 points of price. All geographies were strong except for Europe where volume was up only 1%. ", "Organically, Mac was up 7%, Proto was up 8% and the storage, engineered storage business was up 18%. Asia was also up in the high double digits. ", "Engineered Fastening continued its strong performance with an 18% organic growth performance. Outpacing the global auto production, which was up only 4%. They achieved high double-digit growth in the Americas, Asia and even Europe, the latter in the face of modestly negative auto production. The -- their overall growth in Engineered Fastening was driven by new products, new applications and the resurgence of Japan. ", "Infrastructure was off 7% as CRC-Evans was impacted by regulatory-driven project delays in the U.S. onshore business. I -- need I say anymore about that. John says \"no\".", "The fourth quarter was -- capped off 2 years of exceptionally strong performance for industrial. So the question becomes, \"What's ahead for this segment?\" There are several inherent growth drivers in place for 2012, and thus we are confident of continued success. ", "Earlier this month, we completed the Lista acquisition, which will add about 3 points of growth and broaden out Vidmar's product lines and distribution channels. Last year, we completed a small, but very important acquisition called Crib Master, which as we speak, is unveiling a revolutionary new line of RFID-enabled tools and storage systems, which will play very well in the aerospace industry and will contribute to growth in 2012. ", "We're also putting an intense focus on the emerging markets, now about 15% of industrial revenues, and that will power strong double-digit growth in these markets, which will also benefit from the Black & Decker revenue synergies. ", "Engineered Fastening has a new successful stud welding system, and also a self-piercing riveting system, which benefits from the penetration of aluminum vehicles and should be generating a fair amount of growth. And CRC has secured a very, very strong position in offshore services. We'll see substantial growth in 2012 from that. And in addition, has won some significant business in joint coating in Australia, which should provide another $30 million of growth over the next 2 years. So despite the slow North America pipeline onshore market, we think CRC should flourish in 2012. ", "So there are several exciting new growth drivers that should enable a strong and successful year for industrial as we go. ", "And now we'll move over to working capital. This working capital story is exactly where we want it to be. We made tremendous strides with integrating the Stanley Fulfillment System into Legacy Black & Decker as John mentioned last year, and we achieved a 1.3 turn improvement from 5.7 to a very respectable 7.0 turns. That was a $234 million reduction in working capital. Excellent progress was made in accounts receivable and in payables. In receivables, we took out 5 days. In payables, we added 11 days. Those are both very good. The payables in particular came from terms changes and process improvements and nothing else. We benefited from our centralized sourcing and our scale, making that happen. And a lot of heavy lifting was done in inventories as well. And we should really begin to see commensurate improvement in inventories as 2012 unfolds. And we are on a journey to 10 working capital turns by mid-decade. We have the knowledge, the expertise and the momentum to get there. So you could expect more progress along that trajectory in 2012. ", "And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. I'd like to start on Page 12, and quickly touch upon the free cash flow performance for the company in 2011 and the fourth quarter before I move into 2012 guidance. ", "As you can see, we're very pleased with our achievement of a greater than $1 billion free cash flow for the first full year of our combined company, which really significantly outpaced our original goal, which was by year 3 post-merger, we would achieve this level. ", "You heard from Jim that the significant progress in working capital, and you can definitely see that in the cash flow statement as we had $255 million of cash flow in the fourth quarter from working capital, and for the year, a positive amount of $134 million, which is pretty close to what we were estimating back in our October earnings release as we do see significant seasonality improvement in working capital in the fourth quarter. So very pleased with the result. ", "As I also mentioned back in October, we do have a few unusual items in other that drive negative cash flow performance. And those items are: Pension contribution of about $80 million; and then noncash benefits from some of the tax items we had in our P&L as we settled audits of about $70 million. Those are the main drivers of the $200 million in negative that you see here for the year. ", "Another item of note is our CapEx. We've done an excellent job as a company of managing that to within our objectives of somewhere between 2% and 2.5% of revenue, and it came in at about 2.1% of revenue for the year. With the end result of that just over $1 billion in free cash flow. ", "So let's move to 2012 outlook on Page 13. As John mentioned earlier on, and also in our press release last night, we're guiding EPS to a range of $5.75 to $6. Let's walk through some of the assumptions associated with that, and then on this particular page and then I'll walk through a little more detail on the next page on a couple of the items. ", "The first item is organic net sales assumption for 2012. We believe our organic net sales growth will be approximately 1% to 2% in 2012 on a pro-forma basis. That includes the effect of Niscayah for a full year in 2011. This does include the impact of BDK revenue synergies in that estimate. ", "Several of you have -- are probably wondering why does that make sense based on the performance that you saw in the fourth quarter, was organic growth more around a 6% number and for the year, 4%. We're definitely seeing some signs and signals in certain parts of our company and particularly in Europe and emerging markets that things are slowing down. There is a possibility of a recession occurring in Europe, and no one knows for sure whether that's going to occur. But we believe it's prudent to put fourth an estimate that is more conservative in the sense of what could happen and how we might respond as a company, and specifically taking out cost to respond to that. ", "Additionally in emerging markets, we do see a little bit of a slowing in Brazil and China, although they're continuing to grow. They're just not growing at the pace that we saw in 2011, which in some cases, was greater than 20%, in particular Brazil. ", "Moving on to the cost synergies that John touched on for BDK and Niscayah. That contributes approximately $0.70 in total, year-over-year, $115 million for BDK and $45 million for Niscayah. The cost reductions that we're putting forth are approximately $150 million or $0.70 benefit year-over-year. And a little bit of color on that, about 50% of that $150 million will come out of our CDIY business, and the remaining 50% will be spread across Security segment, Industrial segment, and as well as some corporate overhead. And approximately 2/3 of that will be U.S.-based and the remaining third will be European based. ", "Positive impact year-over-year of $0.08, associated with our lower share count as we implemented the share repurchase program in 2011 of $350 million. And then we do have a $0.07 negative impact year-over-year associated with 2 items: Carryover inflation, net of price impacts, as well as FX or currency headwinds. I'm going to walk a little more detail on that in the next page. ", "Our tax rate, we believe, will be somewhere between 22% and 23% versus the 14% that we achieved in 2011 as there were a few one time items that we do not expect to repeat, and that's about a $0.55 headwind. And then interest and other should approximate $380 million in 2012. ", "We do believe our free cash flow will continue to increase as we -- we'll see another improvement in working capital year-over-year, and we approximate free cash flow to be $1.2 billion, based on these earnings assumptions and a modest growth in working capital. ", "A little bit of flavor of a geographic split for revenue. If you look at North America, we believe we're probably going to see a modest 1% growth, and it really reflects our ability to continue to gain some market share with the various new product introductions. It does not assume a residential construction rebound, however. As Jim articulated, as he was talking about CDIY. ", "Europe, we do believe will be down approximately 3%. That's currently what we've kind of forecasted within our company, and the cost actions are really in response to that. This does exclude the effect of Niscayah, and I'll walk through a little more detail on that in a few pages. Because we have baked the effect, as Jim mentioned on Niscayah, within that $0.20 accretion number for 2012. ", "I mentioned emerging markets slowing down, although we do expect them to grow somewhere between 10% and 15%. So it reflects a continued strong growth, as well as the continued impact of revenue synergies in that part of our company. ", "And the last thing to mention, it's just a reminder on seasonality. When you look at the different quarters, the first quarter does represent a much smaller percentage of our total year. And if you look at history, it's approximately 18% to 19% of the full year EPS. So just keep that in mind as you look at the quarterly split. ", "So on the next page is a detailed walk of the guidance, and many of the things I've walked through already, specifically lower share count, the volume revenue impact, the BDK and Niscayah impact and then the cost actions, as well as the higher tax. But I would like to spend a few minutes walking through the net inflation and FX number of $0.70. ", "When you look at that, approximately 2/3 of that $0.70 was associated with foreign currency, and the remaining 1/3 is associated with inflation versus price. Looking at inflation versus price, when we look at inflation, we look at all inflation, not just commodity-based inflation. So this has SG&A wage inflation in it, it has utility inflation, et cetera. When you break down the different components of that, we are fully recovering the commodity-based inflation in our price actions. So we're very pleased to see that in our estimates for 2012. But the other inflation is something that is a carryover negative impact or a new impact in 2012 associated with other types of inflation and it's approximately, as I mentioned, 1/3 of that $0.70. ", "The FX component is really driven by 3 currencies. If you look at the operating margin for our international businesses, approximately 3 quarters of the international operating margin is impacted by 3 currencies: The euro, the Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar.", "The average rate for some of those, as an example the euro was a $1.39 in 2011 and the spot rate has been anywhere from $1.27 to $1.30 over the last month. That's about a 7% to 10% decline from the average in 2011. The Brazilian real, very similar, about a 10% to 11% decline when you look at it from that perspective and the Canadian dollar, although not as significant, has been somewhere between 3% to 4% of a decline. So clearly, that has a significant impact on our company. ", "A little rule of thumb that we've used in the past is when you look at the euro and the euro movement, if it moves $0.01, it tends to be, what we've said in the past is about $0.01 of EPS. Based on our current makeup, we think it's actually closer to $0.015 EPS now versus $0.01. So just a little guideline for those interested in that information. ", "On the next page, I'd like to spend a little time on Europe, because there's been a lot of questions about the makeup of our company in Europe and potential for recession or concerns for a slowdown in that part of the world. So if we start with the 3 segments and look at -- first of all, look at the Security segment on a pro forma basis, which is -- will be about 35% of our European business at $1.1 billion. As we've mentioned a few times on the call this morning, this revenue weakness that we're anticipating is built into the Niscayah EPS commitments. And we do believe about 2/3 of the revenue associated with this business, is in relatively stable countries in Europe. The business looking back, is about 20% off the 2008 peak, and it's at trough levels. So we have not really seen a recovery at this stage in our Security business. ", "Moving to industrial, approximately $700 million in revenue.  Two main businesses there: Engineered Fastening and Industrial & Automotive Repair. Engineered Fastening has actually seen a significant rebound from the 2009 low they experienced. And are approximately 100% back to peak levels in response to that low. ", "So it's about $85 million of revenue rebound from the low in that particular business. One thing to note about this business though is that it's heavily concentrated in German automotive manufacturing or production. And we've seen a lot of strength in that part of the business in 2011, although we don't expect it to be quite as strong as from a growth perspective in 2012. We think it's remote that we'll actually see a retraction in that revenue in 2012. ", "Moving to Industrial & Automotive Repair, they recovered about half from their low performance in 2009. So a peak performance that brought them down about 20% in revenue, they've recovered about half of that since 2009. And that's approximately $50 million in revenue. ", "On the CDIY side, 30% decline from the peak, down to the low period and now they've recovered about 10%, or about $100 million in revenue since that low. So when you look at this, you have 2 businesses that if you're concerned about a recession, you're concerned about retraction in IAR and CDIY, which if they did retract back to the low, that would be about $150 million in revenue loss. Our 3% assumption related to Europe, assumes about half of that possibly happening, possibly occurring. So it's just something to give you a bit of an impact, although it may appear dramatic or significant, it really is not, as it's only about 1.5% of our total company revenue. ", "So lastly on outlook, just a quick flavor on segments, we've touched on a few of these items already, so we'll not be repetitive, but clearly, we're looking at low single-digit organic growth for all 3 segments, with a possibility of mid-single digit growth for Industrial. And CDIY will continue to have the rollout of the 18-volt lithium-ion tools in the first half of 2012, which will be a nice driver for the activity and growth and help gain market share. And in the back half of the year, we'll have some new product introductions as well that will be launched to drive that activity. We do expect weakness in Europe as I mentioned, and that will be mostly offset by some -- little bit of the growth in North America and continued strength in Latin America and Asia as I touched on emerging markets. ", "In Security, couple of items of note. The Niscayah operating margin rate will continue to improve as we execute on the synergies and the integration, but it will continue to be a drag on the entire segment in 2012. But as the year progresses, that operating margin rate will continue to improve. And then in industrial, Jim touched on these items around Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening. One item of note on Engineered Fastening  is we do expect the Japan market to continue to recover from the tsunami disaster they had in early 2011. We've seen that in the fourth quarter and we expect that likely to continue in the first part of 2012. ", "So to summarize, the presentation portion of the call this morning, we're very much focused on margin accretion, really trying to maximize top line growth even though our outlook is somewhat prudent or conservative, we are focused on trying to drive as much market share activity as possible, as well as driving emerging market growth and revenue synergies. And we are, at the same time, focused on our acquisitions and integrating them in an effective manner as we've done over the last several years. ", "Our long-term capital allocation strategy remains intact, the same, and we will be reviewing the potential for a meaningful dividend increase in 2012 as the year progresses. The Stanley Fulfillment System continues to drive significant benefits and continuous improvement in our working capital performance, and 2011 was a great indicator of that as we achieved 7 turns excluding Niscayah, and expect more progress in 2012. Our free cash flow continues to grow, as it will be $1.2 billion in 2012. And additionally, we'll be able to achieve -- approach $6 in EPS in 2012. ", "So with that, we'll move to the Q&A.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Monica, [indiscernible] the questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Feldman of UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm looking at the cost savings, newly identified $150 million benefit you're talking about this year. I'm trying to get a sense of 2 things: First, what sorts of projects does that include; and what the cash costs are associated with it, whether that's part of the $242 million of M&A charges or whether they're separate cash costs or aren't any?", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure. Don can give you a lot of granulary on that, Jason, because we've given it a lot of that.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Jason, first of all, the point of -- what type of actions or this associated with, really what it is, is it's a continued evaluation of our organization structures and looking at combining different pieces of the organization, flattening out pieces of the organization, looking at our supply chain, as well in the indirect and direct ratios of their manufacturing plants. In essence really tightening the belt a little further into our organization to drive out more cost and be more efficient. Anytime you take on a merger of this magnitude, you're going to have inefficiencies as you put 2 companies together. We've done a lot of great things with the integration and had significant cost synergies associated with it. But this is an opportunity for us to really, as I said, tighten the belt a little further. As far as the actual cost associated, is included in the $240 million estimate and it's approximately $55 million associated with $150 million of cost actions.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then last thing is, is $150 million benefit in 2012, what do you think the kind of annualized run rate will be as we exit the year?", "Donald Allan", "It's not going to be much higher than that, it might be $125 million to $130 million, because we're -- we've either taken some of these actions already, or they will be implemented by early to mid-next week. So the vast majority of them will be completed within the first 30 days of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Morgan Stanley.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just want to dig a little bit more into the cost actions that Jason just asked about. Can you guys just talk about how you view the tradeoff between cost-cuttings and investment. And the reason I'm just a little bit concerned here is because we've been cutting costs here for the past 2 years. And just give us some comfort that there's no cuts in the new product innovation area.", "James M. Loree", "Nicole, this is Jim. Yes, there are absolutely no cuts in the new product and innovation area. This company thrives on its new products and its innovation, and that is definitely something that is absolutely excluded from these cost cuts. You said we've been cutting cost for 2 years, we've been cutting cost for 12 years. And I think we're fairly experienced at it at this point in time. And as Don mentioned, when you take on, you put 2 organizations together, 2 $4 billion companies, and you plan an integration in the first 90 days of your time together and you come up with the synergies that we came up with and then outperformed even beyond that. You learn a lot after 2 years, of being together, almost 2 years of being together. And I think we're taking that knowledge that we've gained and we're really focusing the cost cuts on efficiency and effectiveness of organization. If you look at our track record over the years, when we make cuts like this, normally it's improved the effectiveness of the organization, and that's what we expect in this case as well. This has nothing to do with new product innovation. Has very little to do with go-to-market strategies or resource levels, and it has everything to do with efficiency and effectiveness.", "John F. Lundgren", "Nicole, this is John. I'll just add a little, maybe a little more light, because I couldn't agree more strongly with Jim that there should be anything but concern. An analogy that my colleagues and teammates are tired of hearing, but I think it'll really help, SG&A, we describe within Stanley Black & Decker internal speak as cholesterol, and there's good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. And my colleagues are laughing as I say this, but I think it's a really good analogy. If it involves new product development and supporting our brands, that's good cholesterol, not only are we not cutting it, we're improving it. If it involves back room operations, paperwork, processing, nonvalue-added activities or a duplication of effort, that's bad cholesterol, and we're eliminating it. That's exactly what Jim's describing. So I apologize for the simplicity of the analogy, but I think it'll help. SG&A in total will come down a lot. I think Don said that about 60% of the reduction is in SG&A and about 40% is actually cost of goods affecting plants and things of that nature. But of the SG&A reduction, it is all on the side of money that is required to spend -- that are required to spend to do business, but doesn't necessarily strengthen our brand or improve our product portfolio. And every P&L owner within Stanley Black & Decker looks at it just that way, approaches it just that way and it's a very serious trade off that we think about before we make any of the cuts.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, thanks, John, that's really helpful. One more, if I may. Can you guys talk about some of the moving pieces in the q-on-q, CDIY margin decline this quarter, it was down about 30 basis points or so? I understand the year-on-year dynamics, but it seems like price costs should really be improving and the promotional spend should've been consistent with what you guys sell in the third quarter. So can you just explain that a little bit?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, you're absolutely right. It was modest, and as Jim said in his segment review, we don't anticipate it going on. We grew the business 6% in the fourth quarter when the market was flat-to-down. There was promotional activity on NiCad, and there was less than historical inflationary price recovery. We can make that comment with a 100% benefit of 20/20 hindsight. And so what you said is exactly right. There was very modest margin decline. That being said, we grew the business at 5x to 6x the rate of the market. The balance between margin and volume and share growth should be or will be a little bit different going forward. So I think your statement is absolutely correct. Jeff Ansell and his team understand it, again you don't have the -- you don't always have the value of all that information until you've closed the books. We were driving for volume, we got it, we got it at slightly less margin than historically we have. We've got a very, very good team that understands that, and we're highly confident they'll get the balance even better.", "James M. Loree", "And also, it would be remiss if we didn't mention that if you look at historical gross margin and operating margin percents for Construction and DIY, and if you disaggregate them and look even before these 2 companies came together, you would find the same exact pattern in both company -- in both companies, which is the first quarter generally is right about the same as the fourth quarter or slightly higher. The second quarter goes up, and it's the peak gross margin for the year, generally speaking. Third margin, quarter margin steps down a little bit, and then the fourth quarter margin tends to step down a little bit sequentially. So you can't really just look at these margins, there's a seasonality to them. On a pure -- everything is the same, so there must be something wrong if it's going down or something right if it's going up. I mean, there's all sorts of seasonal aspects to this. For instance, in the Consumer Power Tools business, if you mix in the Consumer Power Tools in the fourth quarter, it tends to have a slightly lower gross margin and operating margin than the Professional Power Tools, as an example. There's also Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which tend to be days that people are paid for, but they don't do any work, and so there's a more of concentration of holidays, less productivity, less margins. And these types of things that just drive you crazy if you try to just track the margin sequentially at any 1 point or 2 points in time.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Next question...", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question just to go back and make sure I'm fully understanding, and great detail so far, I'm referring to the restructuring or further cost saving activities. I guess, you're saying that within a couple of weeks it'll all be implemented. Is that mostly headcount reduction or are there other buckets? And I guess, how much of it would you consider perhaps even further upside to your original cost synergy estimates when we started with Black & Decker a couple of years ago?", "Donald Allan", "Michael, this is Don. It's approximately 75% associated with headcount. So it's people-related costs, and then the other 25% is what we call discretionary cost and just hunkering down on T&E and other types of cost, consulting fees, et cetera and those particular, that's really the split. As far as how much is associated with synergies, probably not a lot. I mean, it might be maybe 10% of it or something like that when we look at it, but it's not significant.", "James M. Loree", "And to be clear, it's all incremental to the synergy. I think, I'm sure that came across when Don made the point, but this is not -- this is all in addition to the synergies that have already been announced.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Also on the $0.70 of net inflation and FX, this might be hard to do, but -- is, you kind of broke out the cost savings in terms of the different operating lines or operating segment lines. Can you give us any sense of how the $0.70 of negative impact from inflation and FX, is it -- can we think of it as a similar type of distribution?", "Donald Allan", "I would say that if you look at the 2 pieces, FX and inflation. If you start with FX, clearly, there's you have the CDIY business and Industrial business they're both very global, and so if you just look at the makeup of revenue, you're going to get a sense of the FX impact for those different businesses. So roughly 30% or so of the business is international. On the Security side, it's probably not a dramatically different ratio at this stage, given the inclusion of Niscayah. So I think if you look at that revenue mix, it will give you a sense of where -- of how things will go. And so, if each one of them is roughly 30% of the makeup then it's probably 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 impact roughly. Then you've got to look at the magnitude as well.", "John F. Lundgren", "I think we can use a little bit [ph] of the FX versus inflation of the $0.70 that you've already said, by the way.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, and so if your question was more around the split between FX and inflation, as I mentioned, 2/3 of that $0.70 is FX, and 1/3 is inflation. I thought you were going more down the path of give me a little sense by segment of those pieces. On the inflation side, the vast majority of our inflation frankly is in our CDIY and Industrial businesses, and the remainder of it would be in our Security businesses.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering in terms of the European business, I guess, you talked about that in terms of the risk and expect it to be potentially down 3% for the year. But then broadly speaking for the plans for the year in terms of -- talked about margin accretion, top line growth. When you think about Europe and then expectation for potentially if there's any decline in revenue, how are you thinking about margins there and running the business with a focus on so that preserving margin versus the revenue?", "Donald Allan", "Dan, it's Don. I think if you think about the cost actions that we're executing on, and roughly a third or so of those are associated with Europe. Those cost actions are in response to clearly volume and FX pressures. I don't think that you're going to see a dramatic decline in rate. I think we'll be able to maintain our margin rates in Europe as a result of the cost actions. That's one of the main reasons we're taking the actions, to ensure that we maintain them. And then when you look at the cost synergies associated with Black & Decker and the synergies associated with Niscayah, obviously those are accretive to the rate. So when you factor in all these different things, you're likely to see actually margin rates in Europe improving in 2012 even though you have a little bit of volume pressure.", "John F. Lundgren", "And as is always the case, Dan, I know you're well aware on -- the magnitude is proportional, Europe and U.S. as Don had said, we've done everything in our power to not slow down the growth of emerging markets. But geographically, those cuts are shared equally among the -- pro rationally among the businesses as well as among the very various functions. But it always takes longer to get it in Europe, which I know you understand well, 3 to 6 months longer just due to some -- anything that's subcomp-related procedures go with it, and it takes a little longer to realize. But that being said, that's built in to our guidance and our anticipated timing.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Great, and just related to that in terms of the proactive cost cuts here, you talked about that given the expectation that there could be more weakness. If you don't see more weakness, how -- is that just locked in so you'll end up having greater leverage in terms of the overhead and such there? How do you look at those costs -- the cuts overall if you were to see any improvement?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, one of the, I guess, if there's a significant positive associated with cutting costs, one of the positives if the top line performance is not what we anticipated, and it's better. The reality is, is we're taking cost out of developed countries that are more infrastructure and organizational related. That, frankly, you're not likely having a need to add that back, if you grow 5% in Europe versus being down 3%, you're not going to need to add back this cost that we're taking out because it's more structural in nature and organization based.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, and let me just also comment that the way that we are thinking about this too is that back in October, we indicated that we had a roadmap to get to a number approaching $6 when we, as Don mentioned earlier, found out that we had significant euro-related and market-related pressure in Europe, we decided to do everything we could from a cost perspective that made sense to protect that cash flow and earnings range that we were discussing in October. Because we really felt -- we really feel like we've set the company up very well to be a -- to outperform, when and if the U.S. home improvement and housing market returns, and we wanted to preserve that optionality if you will, for the investors, so that folks that were thinking that this could be a good proxy for playing the home improvement and housing rebound, but felt concerned about the European negative exposure could feel more comfortable continuing to invest in the stock because it still has the upside associated with the U.S. home improvement and housing rebound if and when that happens.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays Capital.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I appreciate the detail. But as usual, we could always ask for more, I suppose. If you could talk a little bit about the working capital improvement and I guess maybe in terms of free cash flow generation, you've given a target of $1.2 billion. I'm curious if you could give us some sense for how that will be generated either by region or by segment if you were to take the regions -- I'm particularly interested in what you think the European operations are going to contribute roughly of that $1.2 billion. And of the segments, I'm particularly curious as to what the working capital dynamics and free cash flow dynamics of the Security business are in your guidance.", "John F. Lundgren", "Let me, Steve, let me start by saying we're just never going to provide that level of granularity on this call, and you know that. We can't hate you for asking. Cash flow by region, by business isn't something that we tend to, A, we tend to track ourselves, B, that we're going to put out there. What I can say, and I think Jim touched on it, but perhaps, didn't quite finish the thought, that's clear with us. When we implement SFS, the immediate benefit comes from receivables and payables because our very powerful global sourcing operation is involved and our field sales force and business controllers and business CFOs are closely involved. Normally, the dramatic improvement in inventory, inventory reduction and ultimately, in absolute terms and days and the result on turns, comes 6 months later because it requires more forecasting accuracy and better process changes. We have the experience of trying to reduce inventory for the sake of doing it, and with a negative impact on fill rates before the process changes have been put in place, that happened to us 2 years ago in Europe with our industrial tools business and we learned from that lesson. So more of the increment, to try to simplify it, will come from inventory improvement or we anticipate it will in 2012 because we've gotten the lion's share of what we will get from receivables and terms. Geographically, assume it's going to split about commensurate with our businesses and with our revenues, but there is no business or region that's particularly far behind or ahead. We run global platforms with local P&L leaders. Everyone is incented the same way. Everyone is equally focused on it. And while emerging markets are a relatively small percentage of our total, 14%, they're in pretty good shape in terms of working capital turns. And while you might think credit terms are loose or things of that nature, they're not because in many of the markets, the -- a lot of the business is done through letters of credit or cash. So in fact, the turns among our Asian business in particular are very near the top of the heap. That's about all the direction our business -- direction or detail that we're in a position to provide.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My second question relates to something Don mentioned. I apologize, I didn't quite grab it all. But he -- you mentioned, Don, something about the -- that the Security business and I think you meant Niscayah's specifically, could absorb business being down 10% and still hit your 12 EPS guidance contribution from that segment, and in fact it is was only down 4% in 4Q. One, I just want to make sure that I heard that right. And then secondly, can you give us an idea of what you're anticipating in your 1Q outlook?", "Donald Allan", "Sure. Jim did mention in his presentation that Niscayah, the assumptions of $0.20 EPS accretion does have a 7.5% volume decline built into those.   That was part of the model that we created initially related to this transaction. And he indicated that, we could absorb as much as a 10% volume decline and still achieve that $0.20 EPS. So that's just to clear about that point. And also indicated that we saw about a 4% decline in the fourth quarter. So we're not really trending to that number, but we do have it built into our assumptions, that it could get worse as we do make business model changes, in particular associated with profitability, a third installation revenue project and making sure that it's more aligned with the Stanley Legacy Security business. As far as the first quarter, we don't tend to give a lot of information about first quarter, Steve. So I'll just kind of leave it at that.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just want to explore Niscayah. Obviously, it's a big acquisition for you guys. It happens to be in a market that's slowing down. So you said Niscayah was down 4% in fourth quarter. Was that a similar rate for the year, given it's 8% decline in 2010?", "Donald Allan", "Yes.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then, I think the $45 million that you talked about in Niscayah to me appears, from an execution perspective, very easy given that it is consolidating supply bases and kind of more back-office. But if I think about the HSM model and the integration that was very successful in the United States, I wonder if you could give us a little more color there, given that Niscayah margins were 6% in '10, looking to go to 10% in '12, just on your consolidation. But how are you going to balance the shift of going, trying to get higher installation revenue tied to recurring revenue amid a slowdown in demand in those end markets? Could you just discuss that, how much that hurts, if it matters?", "James M. Loree", "Ken, this is Jim. First of all, the integration, I would not characterize as easy, because there are multiple countries involved, with multiple P&Ls and very -- some very small, some very large and many different cultures, and Niscayah has -- some embedded -- a very localized embedded management practices that have to be -- more operated in a more central manner, while remaining, keeping their local flavor. So this is not a slam dunk. That said, we feel great about the $45 million. We have a very clear roadmap. We have very talented, experienced people in charge working on it, and so we feel good about it. And what we will do is essentially the same thing that we did with ADT France and the same thing we did with GDP in Europe and Blick as well, which is we will take the HSM model. We are taking the HSM model and we are implementing that so that you have a nice blend of central oversight with local regional management. And that's going to take about 3 years to fully implement. But this year, I would call it the low hanging fruit will be absolutely executed to get to the $0.20. And that's kind of the play here is that we are going to -- we are doing the things that are going to generate immediate results, have priority to do that and then there's kind of a medium to long-term organizational transformation that's taking place, which is why we put a very strong leader, Massimo Grassi, in charge of this who's multicultural, speaks 5 different languages and has been with us a long time, we know him very well and he's bolstered the organization already. He's mustered the resources from the Security business and they're working in earnest to effect this transformation, and we feel very good about what we bought --", "John F. Lundgren", "Ken, one other thing --", "James M. Loree", "It's going [ph] be a long haul.", "John F. Lundgren", "Excuse me Jim, I'm sorry. Ken, one other point you mentioned, mix and the need to do install to get recurring revenue, which we've been talking about for years. We've mentioned this on the acquisition call. But to remind you and everyone, the Niscayah business was heavily skewed towards install with a far lower than line average and certainly Stanley Convergent Security with recurring as a far lower percentage of the total revenue base. So part of Brett and Massimo's charge is obviously maintain the flow of profitable installation to keep the pipeline full, but to dramatically improve the mix toward recurring. And if you think about that, for those who have followed this company a long time, that was the HS -- the Legacy Stanley model, was much closer to the Niscayah model where we were way too skewed towards installation without enough recurring revenue and service coming with it. A very successfully HSM model, was very much focused and directed and incented toward recurring revenue, which is why we described it as a reverse integration of Stanley Convergent Security into HSM. What we -- so simply said, we've seen the Niscayah model before, good business, too much installation, not enough recurring. We know what to do with that. And, oh, by the way, we have a history with security acquisitions of improving margins up 400 to 1,000 basis points within 2 to 3 years. That's what's in our model for Niscayah. And to Jim's point, we've seen absolutely nothing having worked with this business now for about 6 months and owned it for 4, that would let us -- that would want us -- lead us to back off from that...", "James M. Loree", "And there's some hidden benefits as well because -- and I mentioned this before, that the Niscayah people happen to be very good at recurring service revenue, in other words maintenance, scheduled maintenance, prepaid maintenance, those types of things, service contracts for equipment that we frankly in HSM had not really pursued too aggressively. And so we're really learning from that and that's going to be something that's implemented in the U.S. and in the non-HSM or non -- excuse me, Niscayah parts of the Legacy Stanley Security, and I think we'll benefit from that. That's not included in any synergies or anything like that. And then the other thing is the vertical marketing prowess. And Niscayah clearly is -- was better and is better than we were at that, and we've been trying for years to figure that out, and I think they bring excellent talent in that area and experience. And that's something that we will also leverage into our legacy Stanley Electronic Security markets.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, particularly in the financial services vertical as Jim's referring, as you know, Stanley has done -- historically done very well in retail and some other verticals. Niscayah is equally strong in the financial services sector and brings to Jim's point, and we'll leave it at that, really strong vertical marketing capabilities, strategy execution. It was a real plus of the folks that we've inherited both in the U.S. and in Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two quick questions. First off, you mentioned in the summary that the long-term capital allocation strategy remains the same. That said, which would suggest that more than half of your free cash flow would go to acquisitions. You have a low valuation, you're asking for more productivity with your organization now with the restructuring. Your cash is tied up in Europe, but Europe is going into a recession and things are slowing down. All of that would argue that you would be a little more reticent perhaps, with making acquisitions on a go-forward basis. Is that the case or is it still full steam ahead?", "John F. Lundgren", "We're -- we look at each and every acquisition, first, on its strategic value and benefit, and second, on its ability to meet or exceed our financial hurdles. And we very, very carefully internally and if it's a large acquisition with our board, evaluate that relative to returning cash to shareholders. So in that regard, our process hasn't changed. If what you predict is correct, it will make it harder to achieve our hurdles, and it would mean there's a greater opportunity to return cash to shareholders, if valuation's low or we think unfairly low via repurchase, as we did $350 million worth in 2011. If we think valuation's somewhat fair, but in a 1% return environment for the next year or 2, which based on what the Federal Reserve announced this morning seems to be the case, then there's probably more potential for an increased dividend in terms of improving the total shareholder return for our investors. So the strategy's the same, Sam, and we will obviously respond to conditions in the marketplace and allocate our capital. And as you know well, it's not year-in, year-out, it is over time. And if you look back in history, it's been roughly 50-50, even though we have a stated objective, 2/3 of our capital allocation going to acquisitions. It's been about 50-50 and it's because we, as I say, evaluate every acquisition relative to share repurchase or relative to a meaningful change in the dividend.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And my last question. Obviously, restructuring's going to occur all over building, products, land. But after having covered you guys for a long time, that you've got a consistent history of what we'll call proactive restructuring. John, does this make it ultimately more difficult to attract incremental top talent at the middle-management levels if the company has a reputation of being hypersensitive with employment levels related to business conditions?", "John F. Lundgren", "Would it -- I guess, I couldn't be more on the other side of that spectrum. It -- this is -- you've followed Stanley longer than I've been here, which is 8 years. This is -- it is so much easier for our senior HR staff and our business leaders to do their job because we are now a $10 billion company that 6 years ago or 7 years -- 6 years ago was a $2.5 billion company. There is tremendous growth opportunity. Jeff Ansell would cite the statistics and he has publicly at the last investor meeting, he's promoted 200 people internally. So simply said, the talent -- we've been a magnet for talent of late, what it's not a good place to be is if you'd like to just punch the clock, maintain the status quo and have your secretary water you everyday and collect the large paycheck, this probably isn't where you want to come to work, but that's not the kind of talent you're referring to, or that we want to retain. So I just couldn't be in a more different place. We're -- we really have -- the success and the size of the Black & Decker merger combined with the growth rate, Sam, has actually made it a lot easier to attract talent. And I'm not saying it's easy because there's tremendous competition for talent all over the world, particularly in emerging markets. But we have people seeking us out, as opposed to us having to pound the streets for talent. So it's actually gone in the other direction. Fair question, but the impact has been exactly the opposite of what you might be concerned about.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Jim, thanks for the color a few months ago on the CDIY category, but you'd referenced the promotional activity there. And I was just wondering if it was seasonal and it's now over, or whether it's carrying into the first quarter?", "James M. Loree", "Well there's always going to promotional activity in CDIY. It tends to be -- peak around Father's Day and then, peak once again around the holidays, at the latter part of the year. So and then, it typically hits the tailwind of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. I would expect a very similar promotional calendar for this year. I think it's quite possible that I think we'll be looking for better, even better returns on the promotions this year and maybe a little tighter, but probably the same amount of activity.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, and then you mentioned you were driving for volume, is that just part of your ongoing pursuit of growth this year? Or was there something specific going on there that would...", "James M. Loree", "Well, the company before we -- before it became part of Stanley, it lost a fair amount of market share in the lithium-ion area in particular. And so we are definitely regaining share in lithium-ion and while we're not aggressively promoting because the product's really -- the price value proposition speaks for itself, that's where we really look to be gaining share, and as we look at the NiCad business, while we're in the NiCad business and will continue to be in it, that will become a smaller part of the power tool business as time goes on, and so when there's promotional activity, it typically revolves around that. And then the other area where we're regaining share in, I'm speaking principally about CDIY right now, and the other area would be in the emerging markets, especially related to revenue synergies where Black & Decker had some really strong infrastructure in the emerging markets in Latin America, the Middle East and we both have kind of subscale infrastructure in Asia. And when you put that together, it's pretty strong. So we now have excellent infrastructure. We have great brands that we can leverage across into these markets across what the legacy business is, and I'd say we're really making some great progress in that respect, gaining share.", "John F. Lundgren", "And David, just one more point on promotion, because -- so you don't get cut off. We pride ourselves on being a learning organization. And again, I referenced that our CDIY team, as you would expect, analyzes every promotion that they conduct, whether it's in Consumer Power Tools or to a lesser extent, they do the same amount of analysis, less promotion, in Professional Power Tools. And we did -- you got a lot of learning late in the year as the team drove to recapture some lost share on which promotions were effective and which weren't, both in terms of which generated enough incremental volume to make it, if it was a price discount or something else that was offered to make it a good business decision versus bad. With every promotion we run, we learn. And I think it's continuous improvement. We'll do a better job every year, while to Jim's point, the level of promotion will be above -- will be about the same, the effectiveness of that promotion, if we can continue to perform the way we have in the past will be improved every year.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Peter Lisnic of Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I guess, the -- to continue on the CDIY margin question, I understand that clearing out some of the old products and the promotional environment, just wondering if you're seeing any sort of structural change when you look at new product introductions and the margins that you're getting there, has the competitive landscape changed? Does it alter how you think about CDIY going forward from a margin potential perspective?", "James M. Loree", "No, not at all. I think the new products -- I think they've done such a phenomenal job with the design, particularly of the lithium-ion, I think you're going to see -- if you look at those margins, they're at -- they're at very acceptable levels and will continue to be so for a long time. It's in Power tools is different than Hand Tools, so we can -- we all understand that, but I think we're managing it pretty effectively and to be able to achieve overall margins in the 13% range for the year, for CDIY, and to have more rapid -- more cost synergies coming in next year and the expectation that we will get some accretion in the rate next year, meaning this year is a -- I think it's reasonable. I mean, there is a certain limitation to that over time, and we've not reached that yet, but I think there is a point where in the power tool market in particular, it just becomes difficult to -- there's a feeling to surpass that ceiling. But I don't think that ceiling is at 12% or 13%.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "That's actually a good lead-in to my final question, which is, if I'm doing the math right, your op margin guidance basically is about 15% for 2012, which is sort of been a longer-term target, so not to put the proverbial cart before the horse, but how much upside do we have if we actually get better volume and not necessarily just for 2012, but as you kind of look out 3 to 5 years with a better construction environment?", "Donald Allan", "Peter, you're right about the 15%. I mean, clearly the cost actions above and beyond the synergies adds almost 1.5 to our operating margin rates from 2011 levels. There are negatives against that as I walk-through, but for us to achieve that range at these volume numbers, you are looking at that level of operating margin rate. To your second part of your question around if we performed higher volume levels, I mean we typically indicated that our leverage affect or contribution margin is somewhere, for Legacy Stanley, around 40%, for Black & Decker it was in the low 30s. I think for the new company, it's probably somewhere between 36% and 38%, and that's probably the best way for you to look at it.", "Operator", "We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call over to Kate Vanek for closing remarks.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thank you so much for tuning in today.

I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thank you so much Sandra, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all so much for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker first quarter 2012 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued after yesterday's close and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2012 first quarter results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. We encourage you to make one question. You can have one follow up after that. As always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after today's call.

Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for being with us. An excellent turn out on the call. And with the first quarter in the rear view mirror, we remain well positioned, we think, for whatever faces us in terms of the macroeconomic environment. Solid results across the majority of our businesses, and we'll get into each and every one in a little -- in more specifics in just a second.", "Revenues per the release were up 12% year-on-year to $2.7 billion, organically up 3%. Our largest segment, CDIY shipments, grew 3% organically. POS is currently outpacing shipments, up significantly and Jim will talk about that a little bit more when we get into the segment detail.", "Industrial, the bright spot clearly in the quarter, grew 7% organically with strength in all geographies. Security grew 39% due primarily to the Niscayah acquisition, minus 1% organically with a series of low single-digit puts and calls. Again, Jim will provide more detail on that in our segment breakdown.", "So from an earnings perspective, x charges, $1.09. EBITDA was up 11% on a GAAP basis, $0.72 on a fully diluted GAAP basis; that, of course, includes all the restructuring charges.", "About a month ago, March 12 marked the 2-year anniversary of closing the Stanley Black & Decker combination. All aspects remain on track. We're significantly exceeding our initial targets and reaching our revised targets, providing further validation, as is the Niscayah integration, of a successful, scalable, global integration process. I'll touch a bit on Niscayah and a bit more detail. It's progressing well. We're slightly beyond the 6-month mark, all systems go. And as Don will discuss in more detail at the end of our short presentation, we are reiterating our guidance for 10% to 15% earnings growth and 20% cash flow growth for 2012.", "Looking at the sources of growth. Steady organic growth trajectory was established during the quarter. As you can see, volume was up 2%. We did get a percent of price, which was primarily carryover of previously implemented price increases later in the year, so 3% organically. Acquisitions, overwhelmingly Niscayah, contributed another 10% and currency was minus 1% unfavorable for a total of 12% growth.", "Looking at some of the specific businesses as mentioned. Industrial, strong plus 7% globally, organically. Our Professional Power Tools and Accessories business, new product-driven grew 6%. Our Residential and Mechanical Access business grew -- Mechanical Security business grew 6%. Consumer Power Tools, which does include outdoor, shipments were up 2%. Hand Tools and Fasteners up 1%. Convergent Security, down 3%, that's pro forma. With Niscayah and MAS Commercial down 4%, with the declines focused on our Access business and commercial locks and national accounts with some strong competitive activity, and Jim will talk a little bit about that and our feelings towards those businesses going forward, we still feel they're in -- they're high-margin businesses in very good shape.", "Let's look geographically at the first quarter versus prior year. Middle left if we start with the U.S., which represents 40% of our revenue. It grew 1% in total organically. Moving to the right, EMEA, Europe, Middle East and Africa, our second-largest geography, was flat organically. It was really a tale of 2 geographies with strong growth in the North, where the majority of our business sits offset by some significant declines, primarily macroeconomic driven in Southern Europe. But all in, Europe was flat, which was slightly ahead of our expectations for the first quarter on a global basis.", "Looking at our emerging markets. Latin America, up 19%, continuing to show strong growth across all businesses; Asia, up 10%, representing 5% of our revenue, 13% if we exclude Engineered Fastening in the quarter; and finally, 2 small but well-established geographies were down low-single digits, Canada and Australia. Lots of competition in CDIY and IAR in both those markets and some conscious business withdrawal of security in Australia.", "Just a brief update on Niscayah, as we've just passed the 6-month mark since closing that acquisition. So far, so good. I think is the best way to summarize Niscayah. But just a little more insight than we've provided in the past that we think will be helpful. No change in our target for $45 million in cost synergies and about $0.20 of accretion this year, $0.45 of accretion on a cumulative basis by 2014. We are managing this process the exact same way we manage all significant acquisitions, with a fully dedicated integration team and regular rhythms reporting to [ph] senior management, that includes Don Allan, Jim, myself and several of our key staff officers.", "All regions and functions are on track to meet or exceed their synergies. We do have a leadership team that's now focused on embedding disciplined operating rigor, as well as driving growth initiatives for this business. And importantly, 85% of Niscayah is in Europe. We recognized and included a weak European market environment in our original projections and commitments on EPS. And to date, our volumes in Europe are actually down slightly less than we anticipated when we put the deal together. Jim will talk a little bit about that as he discusses Convergent Security.", "Just one last point on Niscayah. 15% or only 15% of the businesses in the U.S., but a disproportionately larger percentage of our synergies are coming in the U.S. due to overlap. Those are 90% complete in terms of field office location consolidations, management consolidations. We have -- very capable commercial and vertical market expertise has been added to Stanley's Convergent Security team via Niscayah. And Europe remains on track as well, but as you all know, it's at a slightly slower pace due to the regulatory environment in Europe. So at this stage, at the 6-month juncture, good feelings about Niscayah, both strategically and from an integration perspective.", "Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to take you with some more granularity through our 3 segments.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. CDIY had an in-line quarter and continues to build momentum. Revenues totaled $1.228 billion, up 1%. Operating margin was $171 million, also up a point. Organic growth was up 3%, all attributable to volume growth, and price was neutral. The OM rate held flat despite a severe 230-basis-point inflation headwind, as productivity projects and synergies offset that issue.", "Along geographic axes the midteens organic growth in Latin America offset EMEA, which was down 2% organically, driven by weak market conditions, especially in Southern Europe. The all-important North American region was up 3%, but the encouraging developing story is POS performance.", "In North America, aggregate POS at our 9 largest customers was up 12%, with 6 of the 9 in high double-digit territory and 1 of the remaining 3 around 10%. POS for Professional Power Tools and consumer products were each up approximately 20%, while Hand Tools and Fastening was up in the low-single digits.", "Now conversely, organic sales by product line were mixed, as Professional Power Tools and Accessories were up 6%; consumer, up 2%; and Tools and Fastening was up 1%. Clearly, inventories of retail are lean and below normal levels going into the Fathers' Day and spring season.", "Looking forward, we remain positive on 2012 CDIY growth prospects for both revenue and operating margin, despite the European weakness and the timing of U.S. home improvement-related sales. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that sell in to the channel lags sell-through at POS by a quarter or so when the first quarter POS gains occurred to abruptly and the market seemed to firm up so abruptly at POS.", "In our guidance, we've assumed continued sluggishness in the U.S., but based on first quarter point-of-sale the market now clearly appears to be firming for housing and home improvement. If that continues, it bodes very well for performance versus expectations as we go forward.", "Europe will continue to be a headwind, but it will be offset by strong new product initiatives, as well as revenue, synergies, gaining momentum in the third year of the BDK merger, and we're bullish on CDIY margin rates for the remainder of 2012 as ongoing productivity initiatives will deliver 2% to 3% productivity. We'll have very limited unrecovered inflation for the year. All the detail was in issue in the first quarter, this is behind us now.", "Thirdly, a boost from incremental cost synergies related to the merger, plus CDIY share of the company's previously announced $150 million cost reduction will impact the next several quarters. And finally, we are mixing into both emerging markets and new products, both of which have higher-than-line average margins.", "Our new Brushless DC and 20v cordless product introductions are now underway in a lineup of new Black & Decker branded products, and outdoor and home products is the most impressive in several years.", "So let's move to Security. Security achieved excellent revenue on margin growth, as the Niscayah integration proceeded in accordance with our expectations. Security revenues totaled $763 million, up 39%. They were powered by Niscayah, which closed last September and put $1.2 billion of idle cash to work. Operating margin was $92 million, up 25%. The profit rate was 13.4%, as Niscayah mixed it down from 14.2% last year. Excluding acquisitions, the profit rate was 15.5%, a healthy 130-basis-point increase over the first quarter '11. The increase was driven by strong price inflation recovery, as well as ongoing productivity initiatives. We saw some early analyst notes lamenting low security margins, however, those of you covering us for some time know that first quarter security margins are seasonally low. So it's important to focus on the year-over-year performance and not the sequential change in rate.", "Moving to Niscayah. Europe now represents about 40% of Security revenues, and given the European market conditions, this causes some short-term revenue pressures. However, our announced EPS commitment already assumes significant downward pressure, as I mentioned last quarter, up to a 10% pro forma organic growth downdraft can be absorbed with no negative impact to committed EPS accretion. And notably, the Niscayah pro forma organic growth was minus 4% in the fourth quarter and slightly more favorable in the first quarter.", "It was a mixed quarter for organic growth in the overall Security segment, which was down 1% in total. Resi mechanical was a standout for the quarter at plus 6%, benefiting from strong market conditions and share gains. Total CSS, including Niscayah, was minus 3% with legacy CSS down 5%. The latter was driven primarily by legacy international activities, the U.K., France and Canada specifically, as well as the wind down of a leasing program implemented in the U.S. during the capital crunch a couple of years ago. RMR was slightly up in the first quarter and new installs were flat. CSS backlog increased significantly in the quarter as orders were up 6%.", "Commercial and mechanical revenues were down 5% due to weakness in the contract construction channel, which was exacerbated by a shift or continuing shift to midprice point products.", "In summary, a big sales and profit growth quarter for Security, with most of the benefit coming from the Niscayah acquisition and Resi mechanical organic growth performance. The overall security organic growth picture is more promising for 2Q, with a growing CSS backlog in the U.S. and strong first quarter order activity. Europe will remain tepid, but Niscayah will continue to perform in-line with our commitment.", "And now onto Industrial. Once again, Industrial delivered a strong performance. Revenues were $662 million, up 7% organically. Operating margin was $124 million, up 19%. Profit rate was a record 19%, up 150 basis points from a year ago. Volume leverage, productivity and solid price inflation recovery all contribute to the expansion. Performance was strong across the businesses with IAR, Engineered Fastening, and Infrastructure all hitting their stride. The Industrial businesses continue to be on a great run, with 10 consecutive quarters of margin expansion, cooperative markets in most regions of the world, good organic growth momentum and above-line average profitability levels across the segment.", "And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. We start on Page 11 and walk through the working capital performance for the first quarter. You can see that the Stanley Fulfillment System continues to drive progress in working capital, where our turns went from 5.6 in the first quarter of 2011 to 6.0 in the first quarter of this year. Obviously, I'll remind everybody of the seasonality effect that we experienced with working capital from the fourth quarter through the first quarter every year, primarily due to our CDIY business, as we see a significant shift in the timing around receivables and inventories in the fourth quarter as they wind down in the later stages of December. And then in the first quarter with a slow first 2 months and then March volume accelerating in manufacturing activity for the spring season. Really drives that dynamic. So we saw a retraction of our working capital turns from 7 turns in the fourth quarter to 6 in the first quarter, but I would expect by Q2 that we'd be bouncing back very close to where we were in Q4 and then we'll continue to make progress throughout the remainder of the year. And I'll touch on that in a little more detail when I get into guidance later on.", "Looking at the different pieces of working capital, you can see that we continue to make improvements in the area of accounts payable with term changes, process improvements, centralizing sourcing, et cetera have really driven significant benefit in that particular area. It's an area of focus, as many of you know, in the early stages of implementing the Stanley Fulfillment System. We've made great progress in receivables due to the timing issue. You don't see it necessarily in the first quarter, but you definitely will see that continue as the year progresses.", "And then inventory continues to be our big opportunity. We've made nice progress in that in 2011, but 2012 is another opportunity for us to reduce days in inventory levels and continue to make progression around process improvements. We definitely feel like we're on our journey to 10 working capital turns by the middle of this decade.", "So with that, we'll move to Page 12. I would just like to remind various folks about how our performance has been versus our peer group over the last 3 years. The Stanley Fulfillment System really is a proven competitive advantage for us. As you can see on Page 12, for 2009, 2010 and '11, our working capital turns significantly outpaced our peers in many ways. In 2009, we were close to 8 turns, well above the peer averages. If we look at -- in 2 different peer groups: Industrial and Tool peers and then our Security peers. And you can see that we significantly outpace their performance in that time frame.", "Same thing in 2010, when you look at Legacy Stanley at 8.6 turns. And then as we integrated Black & Decker, we were at 5.7, so we kind of had a bit of a restart around the Stanley Fulfillment System and we made a lot of significant progress. As you know, in 2011, we got the total combined company up to 7 working capital turns. Again, significantly outpacing our peer groups, which were approximately at 6 turns at the end of 2011.", "But even more importantly, if you look at the free cash flow conversion, and again, free cash flow for us is before dividends but includes capital expenditures, our free cash flow conversion has significantly outpaced our peer group as well. And you can see 187% in 2009, 150% in 2010, and then 102% in 2011. These are GAAP numbers, and they do include restructuring charges associated with M&A activity.", "For 2011, if you exclude that, we were actually at 115% free cash flow conversion in that time frame. Again, significantly outpacing our peer group. So we really feel like we've illustrated our continued ability to outperform in this particular area. And many of you are aware how significant the Stanley Fulfillment System is in our culture, and our processes within our company.", "So with that, I'd like to turn to 2012 outlook. We are reiterating our outlook for 2012. We believe our earnings per share will grow 10% to 15%, and that's $5.75 to $6 as John mentioned earlier on. And just a few key operating assumptions embedded in there.", "As we indicated back in January, we believe our organic net sales will increase 1% to 2% on a pro-forma basis, so when you include Niscayah in our revenue base for 2011, it should be approximately $11 billion. This also includes the impact of the BDK revenue synergies, as we continue to make progress in that area. We have cost synergies related to the BDK and Stanley merger of $115 million or $0.50. This year, that's incremental year-over-year, and then $45 million due to the Niscayah acquisition that John touched on, which is $0.20 in EPS.", "The cost reductions we embarked on that we completed in the first quarter, that are behind us now, of $150 million of an impact in 2012. Results in $0.70 earnings accretion for 2012. As a reminder, we also gave an indication of geographic organic revenue performance for this year back in January, and we are reiterating those items as well in this particular outlook. North America, we believe, will still be up by 1%, so it's reflecting modest market share gains and no U.S. residential construction rebounds. Performance is consistent with what we saw in Q1. But as Jim indicated as he reviewed CDIY, there's clearly indicators that POS is getting stronger and may be the potential for stronger performance, but we'll continue to monitor that as we move forward.", "Europe, we have down 3% in the first quarter. They were relatively flat as John touched on. But we still have concerns about certain areas of Europe, in particular, Southern Europe, where they're showing significant declines. And we believe that Europe, for the year, will be down 3% given those conditions.", "Emerging markets, up 10% to 15%, so that would be a slightly slower growth than what we experienced in 2011. And Q1 was slightly better than 15%, closer to 16% to 17%. So we continue to monitor that to see what types of activities are occurring within the different emerging markets.", "The end result from a free cash flow perspective is that we do believe we'll be at $1.2 billion free cash flow before various M&A charges and payments, and that does assume a modest working capital benefit within there, as we continue to make progress with the implementation of Stanley Fulfillment System versus our achieving 7 working capital turns in 2011.", "On Page 14, a little more color on our thoughts around outlook associated with the different segments. CDIY, for revenue, we believe, we're still looking at a low single-digit organic revenue growth performance. At this stage, we continue to monitor POS to see if that will change in the second quarter. We feel very good about the successful launch of our 18 to 20v cordless products that occurred last year that continue carry over into the first half of 2012. And there'll be various new products launched later in the year for the back-half performance that allow us to continue to gain share in different channels.", "We do believe weakness in Europe will continue, but it will be more than offset by a modest growth in North America and then continued strength in both Latin America and Asia.", "In Security, we're looking at low single-digit organic revenue growth performance, so even though we had a slight revenue decline Q1, we expect that to change in Q2, as Jim indicated, and continue through the remainder of the year. We have embedded a negative retraction for Niscayah revenue within our earnings, or EPS accretion, estimate of $0.20 up to a 10% decline, as Jim also stated.", "Despite the drag on the segment margin due to Niscayah, due to the various cost synergies and cost containment actions, we do expect the operating margin rate to improve significantly in Q2 and continue to perform better throughout the second half of this year.", "The Industrial segment, really strong performance in Q1 from a revenue perspective. We do expect that to slow down slightly as the year continues, as the comps get more difficult as the year progresses. Our IAR business continues to be strong in emerging markets, so we expect that strength to continue. Although it will begin to slow down a little bit from a growth perspective in North America, although we will continue to see growth. But we do expect to see some weakness and slight retraction in Europe in that particular business.", "Our Engineered Fastening business, mid-single digit organic growth for the year as the recovery in Japan continued, and that continues to be a strong performer for us. But we do expect to see slower auto production in Europe, although it will result in growth it will be a much less growth than what we experienced in 2011.", "So to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we continue to be focused on margin accretion and top line growth. They are our top priorities for 2012, along with focusing on the integration of various acquisitions, primarily Niscayah. We've taking proactive cost actions. We're prepared to respond to market growth if it's greater than what we're anticipating. We're also rolling out new products. We try to gain as much share as possible in all our different businesses.", "Our long-term capital allocation strategy continues to be the same. We indicated back in January that we were evaluating a meaningful dividend increase. In 2012, we believe that we will have a significant meaningful dividend increase that will be anticipated in the second half and it most likely will be in July, as we want to get back to our normal timing around dividend increases that we had before the merger.", "The Stanley Fulfillment System, as I touched on, continues to drive great improvement and we're focused on our mid-decade goal of the 10 working capital turns. And as a result, we believe we'll have $1.2 billion in free cash flow for 2012, which will be a 20% increase from 2011.", "That concludes the presentation portion of the call.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Great. Sandra, if we could open up for Q&A now?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  And our first question is from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So if we use the historical 18% to 19% of annual earnings for the first quarter -- the first quarter seems consistent with your full year guidance, but you seem to be very confident that Security margins will kind of progress over the course of the year and improve from the Niscayah synergies, kind of better than normal seasonality. What's the offset in the other direction? Why shouldn't the first quarter actually be smaller than that 18% to 19% or the full year number be higher?", "Donald Allan", "Well, I think, Jason, the -- I think the 18%, 19% clearly, as you indicated, represents the historical view of the 2 different companies, primarily driven by a lot less volume in the first quarter versus the other 3 quarters. We tend to have $250 million to $300 million less volume in the first quarter as a result of that seasonality, primarily in CDIY, but also in our Security business. It drives a lot of that. So we do expect continued operating margin rate expansion and additional growth in our Security segment as the year progresses, so we do expect that to improve significantly versus the first quarter. I wouldn't necessarily expect that our Industrial segment would continue with a 19% operating margin rate that we saw in the first quarter. We're really pleased with that performance, but as we look at the investments we're making in that area as well as a slightly lower volume growth as the year progresses, I would expect that, that will return back to levels that are closer to 17%.", "John F. Lundgren", "Jason, this is John. Just to -- to be very specific, because of a lot of those on the call have not followed the company for 10 years, as Jim alluded to. The 2 specific seasonality items, to which Don referred, and CDIY, as it\u2019s been quite evident over the years. January is always a very soft month in terms of shipments as the big-box retailers wind down their inventory in the anticipation of their year-end close in January. It does ramp up in Feb, March, but first quarter for CDIY is always a relatively soft quarter, as Don suggested. And then within Security, there is the seasonality to which you referenced, but for -- I guess, for others' benefit, normally that's in Access and in MAS, Commercial MAS. Within Access, there's often weather-related delays in terms of snow, rain, flooding. Far less of that this year than in the past, but most of that's focused on national accounts and a lot of our retrofits aren't scheduled until the second quarter so they don't face weather delays. And on the MAS business, we do a tremendous amount of business on university campuses, also, albeit [ph] more and more business with our Convergent Security Solutions and it stands to reason the overwhelming majority of that business happens in June, July and August when there are fewer students on the campus. So second and third quarters for years have been better quarters than first and fourth for Security. So I hope that, that adds just a little more color to what I think is fairly well understood, but if not, it's an important clarification.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, that's very helpful. And then lastly, I think kind of given positive commentary from some of the big retailers in first quarter construction activity. I think some people may have thought the CDIY, from a revenue perspective, could have been a little bit stronger. Can you elaborate on, I guess, 2 points, how much of a difference was there, how much of an impact did the difference between POS and your shipments make in the quarter? And also, how much of a lag -- I think you've talked about this before, but if you can kind of refresh our memory on how much of a lag there is between any pickup in construction activity and when you actually start to see the benefit for CDIY sales, [indiscernible] in the quarters typically?", "John F. Lundgren", "Jim, can you [indiscernible]...", "James M. Loree", "I mean I think I covered a lot of the POS versus shipments, but I'll hit the numbers again very quickly. The POS was up 12% for the quarter, and as you know, organic growth was up about 3%. So clearly, there was a significant lag in terms of the sell in to the channel. It is not surprising to me at all. When you think about how the quarter unfolded in the sense that the fourth quarter POS was probably in the neighborhood of 1% positive, and then all of a sudden in January, it's up 10% and it's up 10% all quarter, it didn't get stronger, it didn't get weaker, it just stayed up 10%. So it's almost like a switch was flipped and POS was up 10%. And given that, if I were a retailer and given the warm weather, I would be sitting there saying it's a weather-related pull-in at first. I certainly don't want to bet a bunch of inventory on the fact that, that might not be the -- or that might be the case -- not the case. And then so, normally, we would have a lag of probably about 60 to 90 days anyway, so -- and if you listen to some of the commentary from the retailers, they were clearly citing the weather as a factor. Now whether that was just an attempt to kind of tamp down expectations or whether that was a real issue or how much they attributed that in reality to that phenomenon, I think it's up for discussion or debate. But there was clearly -- that piece of it had a big impact, and I think they were maintaining a cautious stance in terms of -- throughout the quarter, with regard to buying additional product and building their inventories and we know that they ended the quarter with some of the leanest inventories we've seen in a long, long time at retail.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So I wanted to just follow up, Jim, on what you were just talking about. I thought I heard you say in your opening remarks that in your view, given the POS data, that it seems like U.S. housing is, I think you used the phrase \"clearly recovering,\" but I might have misheard you. I guess, my question relates, given the strong POS that you've seen here, I was wondering if you could give us a sense for why you're still sort of waiting for Q2 to shape up and if you -- and if there's something that maybe you haven't mentioned that gives you pause and makes you think, perhaps there is, let's say, a weather-related effect or something about the mix of what kinds of products you're seeing very strong POS versus what kinds of products you're not or -- if there's something like that.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. Well, look, the POS was very strong in Power Tools and in Consumer Products, including Power Tools and Outdoor products. So Outdoor, while it may have been weak last year, if you recall the weather was extremely unfavorable last year, it certainly reversed itself this year, and the POS and Outdoor was up, close to 30%. But Power Tools was up about 20% in the aggregate, a little bit less if you take Accessories and put them into the equation. Now I think some of that is clearly share gain. I don't think you're going to see a home improvement POS numbers around 20% for the Tool category. Some of that was clearly weather. There's no doubt in my mind. We had a somewhat weaker POS last year in the first quarter and I could attribute that to some very, very cold and negative weather conditions. However, I think it would be foolish to assume that all of it is weather or even the preponderance is weather. I think that clearly if you look at almost any housing-related statistic in the country, you'll see some modest improvement. And I think people are going back to work gradually in construction projects. I think, maybe even a bigger part of it, home improvement projects, where you had several years of deferral of do-it-yourself projects. We clearly have heard from some of the retailers that they believe that is a factor. So I think it's a mixed bag of things, but general economic conditions are better, confidence is higher. I mean, it's a -- there is, in my opinion, a clear indication that the home improvement market is getting better and it's not just due to weather. Now some of it is absolutely due to weather.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. That's really -- okay, that was really great. I appreciate that. I guess, as a follow-up, can you give us an indication for how you're Bostitch business or your Fastenings business did, and specific I'm talking about the Bostitch type business. And you had -- and Accessories. You had mentioned -- I think you just mentioned that Accessories POS was not up as much as 20%, but I just want to make sure I heard you. I'm really interested in how Accessories and Bostitch, particularly the nail sales, performed in the quarter.", "James M. Loree", "I mean the Accessories business was -- POS was up about 8% in the quarter, so not the stunningly positive performance that you saw in Power Tools. But still a very respectable performance at plus 8%. And then the Bostitch business was down in the low-single digits. I couldn't give you the exact number, but it was probably in the 1% to 2%, 3% kind of a range. The Bostitch business and the nails in particular will be much more tied to home construction as opposed to doing improvement projects than, say, the Power Tools. And I think that's probably why we got some increase in home construction, but it wasn't as notable as I think in the home improvement area.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, Steve, because you'll get cut off, I mean, just 2 specifics that we have shared and we're happy to, the largest single use, as Jim suggests, above the trends that are the structured housing, the second largest use is pallet repair. So to the extent that the economy is good and industry is good and product is moving on pallets, a very large use of Bostitch or a large consumption of Bostitch products is in pallet. More pallet repair than pallet making, but it's very important in that vertical market.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan Chase.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just to -- sorry, I don't want to necessarily beat a dead horse and I have my follow-ups on a different topic, but just to understand CDIY and the POS lag, which is helpful to point out, we did notice that you aren't necessarily at the same time raising your full year guidance and to the extent that a 12%-type number comes through or of a similar type of magnitude comes through in the second quarter that could certainly drive some upside to the overall guidance for the full year. Is that just kind of initial caution and you want to see how things continue because I think, Jim, you had just mentioned that you think there's something more than just weather at work.", "Donald Allan", "Michael, it's Don. I -- if you think about it from the perspective of how Jim described it, POS is a fantastic statistic for us to look at. It helps us as an indicator of where we see what's happening in our major customers. But we also have to look at order trends, and if order trends are not exactly in sync with that, which they're not yet, then it's not necessarily prudent and intelligent to raise your guidance based on an indicator that, although very positive and we feel good about it, we want it to continue, we want it to translate into orders and ultimately into revenues. And if that trend does continue at that pace, then we clearly anticipate that the revenue performance would be stronger in the second quarter than currently anticipated. But it's something that we believe in our philosophy and our approach that we actually need to see it translated into orders versus POS.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, and as I mentioned last year or last quarter on the call, the -- I guess, it was -- well, it was January, but in any event, we really wanted to position the company to outperform in the event that we had a construction market or a home improvement market recovery. And the reason being that the -- first all, it's a good stock to be in for that type of a recovery. And what happened was the European cloud that was hanging over Europe was causing some dissonance in that respect, so people -- investors couldn't really feel comfortable with betting on a housing recovery by putting their money in the stock because of the European issue. So we felt that we would simply take the recovery off the table and then the cost reductions were really put in place to make sure that we could cover the European issues, and so now the company is still positioned to outperform in the event that this home improvement and housing recovery issue or opportunity is real. And that's where we are today.", "Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, maybe just so I can better understand. With the inventories -- it's a kind of 2 part, if I could cheat a little bit, but just to -- clarifying the first and then second. The inventories, you did note, are fairly lean, so I was surprised that you didn't see at least some level of an increase in order trends given the strong POS. So that's kind of the follow-up. The second thing is, on the Hand Tools and Fasteners, I was wondering if you could remind us about your percent of Hand Tools, how that is in terms of total CDIY, the rough sense of the magnitude. And we've heard that there's a -- Home Depot is doing a private label on Hand Tools that might kind of alter dynamics or competitive or pricing dynamics in that category, if you had any thoughts around that.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, I think this is absolutely typical. I mean, there's nothing new. The private label thing has been going on as long as I've been around and long before I even arrived here in 1999. It comes in ebbs and waves. And ultimately, in Hand Tools -- Hand Tools, there's only one company in tools that has the brands in Hand Tools, that overarching brand that spans all the categories that we sink a lot of money into, has more brand equity than any other Hand Tool brand, and we support it and we have a great end-user demand for it. We back it up with innovation and we are not private label. We do not -- we do very little private label. So let the home centers and the MAS merchants do all the private label they want. What happens when private label grows, the marginal brands get squeezed, and ultimately, we're at the high price point, the midprice point. We don't really play at the opening price point. Private label plays at the opening price point, tries to come up into the midprice point, runs right up against the marginal brands and runs right up against us. We tend to win, so we don't -- we're not terribly concerned about private label. We focus on our value proposition, which really is all about what the brand stands for and we feed that brand and we feed the innovation and we're happy to participate. That's the life we live in Hand Tools. Hand Tools and Fastening is about 20% of CDIY.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Can you elaborate a bit more in terms of what changed with the organic decline in CSS in the order growth that you're seeing and what gives you the confidence that you'll have that organic growth going forward?", "Donald Allan", "As Jim indicated, we clearly have seen different trends in the CSS, North America business in particular. And due to some timing of some of the larger projects, we did see a revenue of flat performance or slightly down performance in that particular business. But the order trends are positive. We had a build in our order book in the first quarter, so we just currently -- we believe it's a timing issue and it's not something that's necessarily reflective of economic or market conditions at this stage.", "John F. Lundgren", "And just to elaborate a little bit, and obviously you don't get denied your follow-up. A logical conclusion, if orders are picking up, why wouldn't you jack up your organic revenue growth rate forecast? The issue, of course, particularly in Convergent Security where so much of it is first install and then ultimately, recurring revenue-related, it is really hard -- it's a much longer-cycle business than CDIY, where we have a POS that ultimately leads to orders, that ultimately leads to shipments. Quite often, we'll see the order backlog pick up, but it's for projects to be installed or things to be delivered 3, even 6 months in the future. So to translate that to a quarter, is very difficult for our Security team and obviously for Don's finance team to do. So we're encouraged by the order pickup, if not to suggest that it's all going to show up in the second quarter or even the third quarter as it relates to organic revenue growth.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then in the Engineered Fastening side, are you hearing anything from customers given that resin shortage that was in the news recently about anything that might curtail auto production there?", "James M. Loree", "Not really, nothing more than we read in the newspapers. It's -- I think they're scrambling -- they're all scrambling to make sure that they don't run into production issues, so we couldn't tell you one way or the other whether ultimately auto production is going to be impacted by that. But I will say that because we really didn't get a chance to talk about Engineered Fastening in the prepared remarks, that we're really pleased with the progress in that business and that the kind of growing content of aluminum-based cars in auto production is a huge positive for Engineered Fastening because of their self-piercing, riveting product line, and there's only one other competitor in the world that really has that and the content in aluminum vehicles is dramatically higher than in other types. So they've got great secular momentum in terms of penetration, and of course, the industry remains reasonably strong this year and perhaps not as strong as it was last year, but still pretty darn strong. I think the -- global auto production was up about 4%.", "Donald Allan", "4% to 5%.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, in the first quarter. And I think we're going to continue to see, notwithstanding some exogenous interruption like you referred to, we're going to continue to see good production in the auto industry, and therefore, good results from our Engineered Fastening friends.", "Operator", "The next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering in the COI [ph] business, you talked about the strong orders and the weather issues there in terms of holding back some of the order trends. But as you think about -- if you were to think about that improving, do you think we'll then see a slightly less promotional environment there as there's a bit more confidence that it's not just a weather issue, is that sort of what's driving the expectation that better margins will come through in COI through the rest of the year?", "John F. Lundgren", "That's a significant factor, yes. You'd said orders, Don was very specific. We have not seen the orders yet or we'd be more aggressive with our forecast. We've seen the POS, and as Don normally follows, night [ph], orders normally and shipments normally follow POS, but until we see them, we're not going to be encouraged. So I want to be sure you understood Jim's comments. But I think that's a very logical, I'll say assumption or conclusion, Dan.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, I was wondering about would the $150 million in terms of the cost reduction where there's been enacted [ph], how -- when should we start to really see the benefits of that, coming through at least the second quarter and then beyond?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, second quarter and beyond. We could -- we were I think pretty granular last quarter, but it's absolutely worth repeating and I'm glad you asked the question. Essentially, none of that showed up in our margin in the first quarter. We were often off and running by late January, early Feb. But precious little, if any, showed up in the first quarter. We expect more than half of it, 3/4 of it to show up the remainder of the year and some of that will, of course -- get carried into next year.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk about the strength in IAR? Obviously, I think in the U.S., you're still gaining share. Europe was kind of surprisingly strong. With FACOM [ph] it seemed to me you're making a distinction between the north and southern markets. And then the strength you're seeing in emerging markets, how is that different than mature markets given the aftermarket exposure?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, well, I mean, first of all, I know that was -- was that one question, Ken? Let me start with Europe. Europe, I was -- I think we were all really pleased with the European performance. I don't think that the distribution channel in Europe has as pessimistic a view of the economy as some of the people I listened to on CNBC over there. But from -- I do think it's getting more pessimistic as the days go on, and maybe more realistic in terms of what's happening overall in Europe. But as we know, basically, Italy and Spain are really, really down significantly, like down as much as 20%, in that territory, and then the rest of Europe is much more sanguine. So in fact, the Nordic [ph] region, for instance, is quite positive in Europe right now. And as we know, Germany, where we don't have much volume but just to kind of complete the journey, Germany is slightly positive too, largely driven by, I think, the auto industry but exports in general. So I would expect it to get marginally worse as it sort of spreads, as the malaise spreads around Europe and the reality of the austerity and so forth sets in, in some other countries. The U.K. is a bright spot, I might add. The U.K. for IAR was quite positive. So mixed bag in Europe. And then the emerging markets, the distribution channels are -- it's interesting that the CDIY and IAR distribution channels in many markets around the world are -- there's a lot grayer and blurrier lines between the channels than there are, say, in the U.S. or in Europe or the developed countries. And so whereas in the U.S., you clearly have well-defined channel separation, sometimes in the emerging markets it gets kind of blurry. And so for instance in Latin America, sometimes it's tough to figure out when you're calling a distributor, whether they're a CDIY distributor or an IAR distributor. So for us, it -- and it's true in Southeast Asia and not quite as true in China, but even in China we see it to some extent, so anyway, for us it really -- it's actually an advantage, I think, to have our IAR and CDIY businesses because we can kind of go into the channel leading with, if the channel leans towards one or the other, those strengths and we can go in with those products kind of as the lead and then bring our IAR products or our CDIY products depending on which is the stronger kind of -- in there as well. I think that's one thing. The second thing for us, and one of the reasons I think we're making a lot of progress, is that when we put the companies together, Black & Decker and Stanley, we really got a much more significant scale in the emerging markets and we put a lot more emphasis at our business unit level as well. So for instance, now IAR, we've actually split the management of IAR, where we have Europe and Latin America is run by one gentleman, and North America and Asia is run by a woman executive. And the reason we did that is so that they could spend a significantly better portion of their time on specific emerging market regions. So Joanna, for instance, who runs IAR North America/Asia, spends a fair amount of her time traveling to Asia and working hand-in-hand with the regional people over there and making sure that they have all the resources, making sure that the products are tailored to that particular market and so on. And then Jim, the gentleman who runs Europe and Latin America, does the same thing in Latin America. So they're running their businesses, which are pretty significant businesses within the developed regions, but they also have much more time than if we ran them as one large business unit. And so I think there's different strategies that we're undertaking in every business to attack the emerging markets, but I think in IAR, it's going to be a unique one. It's an experiment to see if it works, but it's so far, so good.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "If you can give a little bit more color on the margin trends through the years, specifically 2 points: one, is a little bit more color on -- I didn't totally understand how much of the 2012 cost savings showed up in 1Q. And then secondly, the CDIY margin, I know that there's a price versus cost improvement that takes place during the year, if you could just provide a little bit of sense of how that margin should improve as we work our way through the year.", "Donald Allan", "I'm assuming you're talking specifically CDIY, Eric, in your margin comment?", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Yes.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. So obviously, the first quarter, as I mentioned, is the lowest volume quarter for CDIY. It's significantly lower by about $200 million of revenue. And when you look at that and you think about the leverage opportunity where a business that was -- performed at 13.1% in Q1, probably had, as John mentioned, a little bit of the cost reduction actions in the first quarter, but not a great deal that the vast majority of that is going to happen in Q2, Q3 and Q4. Recognizing those 2 items and recognizing that our company -- based on our current outlook, we're going to achieve very close to 15% operating margin this year. The CDIY business needs to achieve that type of level as well from an operating margin rate, which means it's going to get to levels that are around 15% and above as the year progresses. So when you look at price inflation, that's another positive factor associated with that. The inflation is clearly higher, in particular in the first quarter, and it begins to go down significantly in the second and then becomes very small in the third and the fourth quarter. And the price benefits of what we did associated with different actions last year will be a positive that rolls into that as well.  And then there's ongoing productivity associated with just normal productivity that occurs every year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then the underlying margin in the business, is there anything other than inflation, is that the reason why there's cost savings or is Black & Decker cost savings and the profits in the CDIY are flat in the quarter? Does inflation explain -- that's what's offsetting all of the cost saves and the underlying margin is stable, is that something you could help us with?", "Donald Allan", "That's exactly what it is. I mean, it's inflation and then the positives that we have are pretty much offsetting that, which is why we have a flat operating margin rate versus last year at Q1. But then, like I indicated, that dissipates significantly in Q2 and beyond.", "John F. Lundgren", "With volume leverage, 50% of the $150 million cost reduction over the next 3 or 4 quarters and what we feel will be, at worst case, neutral price inflation arbitrage, those 3 things all will -- all should and will contribute positively to the CDIY margins for the next 3 quarters.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, and I think if you'd think about the first quarter margin in CDIY without the inflation, it was a 230-basis-point impact. That would have been incredibly positive story for our first quarter in CDIY. So, yes, we have the inflation, so yes, we absorbed productivity and we absorbed the synergies in the quarter. We're not going to have that in the second quarter anywhere as near that magnitude as what's pointed out, and then you have the positives that were just mentioned. And I think it's going to be a good story as we go forward.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. First off, as it relates to CDIY market share, I know we, we talked about POS a lot, but I'm specifically looking at sell in and reorder rates. I mean, the commentary in the channel was such where some of your primary competitors are looking at growth rates considerably above 3% for their sell in. So if you could give any commentary around that or if you're seeing any cannibalization with your new products, maybe the 20v is cannibalizing the 18v or the DeWalt Hand Tool line is cannibalizing FatMax, something like that? And then I have a follow-up question also.", "James M. Loree", "Sam, I mean, we could talk all we want about sell in. All that is, is a change in inventory if it doesn't have anything to do with POS. So 20% POS in Power Tools seems to indicate share gain, from everything I can derive. And really, I can't even begin to fathom why there would be major differences in sell in. That's just something that's going to have to sort itself out in the inventory line.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. My follow-up question. Last quarter, the valuation of the stock was more like 6x or 7x expected EBITDA, which probably precludes a lot of acquisition appetite on your behalf. Now the valuation is a little bit -- you get an extra turn and if it's closer to 7x or 8x, does your appetite now increase a little bit and what does the pipeline look like for deals this year?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, I guess 3 things. We don't give 6 seconds' thought to what our multiple is, relative to our -- and that's assuming an all stock transaction. And as Don pointed out, we generate $1.2 billion in cash, of which 2/3 is going to be deployed towards acquisition. So our -- if you will, our multiple being up or down a turn, Sam, is not a significant factor in our thoughts about acquisition. Our balance sheet is strong, our cash-generation capability is strong, thus from a financial perspective, our ability to acquire is strong. What will be the governor is organizational capacity. The good news is our 2 large integrations are going extraordinarily well, but if you think about Security, they're digesting an acquisition and integrating one that is almost 50% of their size pre the acquisition. Their plate's full, so obviously we can look for some bolt-ons that'll make sense, but we don't want to overstress the organizational capacity. Small opportunities in other areas where less of the organization is focused on integration. That's where you could expect to see some modest activity. But if you combine 2 integrations that neither of which are fully complete, Don has very publicly stated, and we have -- we've got a couple of $300 million of deleveraging that we intend to do. The pipeline is very full. It'll be -- more organizational capacity than financial capacity that will govern our appetite, speed and size for our acquisitions.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So I wanted to dig in a little bit to this Security seasonality issue. You guys went through a pretty big effort last year, if you go back to your 1Q '11 slides, to reconcile why you had margins down in the first quarter from the fourth quarter as well as year-on-year. And it looks like you guys you should be benefiting this year from the lack of HHI issues, from the lack of some of this acquisition dilution, from the lack of MAS inflation. So if you could just walk me through that, that will be great.", "Donald Allan", "Nicole, it's Don. I would say that you have to think about a couple of the comments that Jim made around, in particular, the commercial and mechanical business and the product gap that we're looking to fill related to certain products in the back half of the year. That has certainly caused some pressure to the profitability of that business, in particular this quarter, and in previous quarters as well. And then also some timing around some of the Access Technologies or automatic door business around that particular business and some of the ordering trends related to national accounts as well. So there's -- and then there's a seasonality aspect related to what John described, which is it's really 3 businesses in there, 2 of which I've mentioned. One is also the residential lock business that for the first quarter, is very similar to a CDIY-type business from a revenue perspective. So that -- certainly feel pressure from profitability in the first quarter as well.", "John F. Lundgren", "Well, and I guess, of equal or greater importance, first quarter '12 versus first quarter '11, x -- we bought $1 billion business with single-digit operating margins. It's math. It's up 130 basis points, excluding Niscayah, quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. So I'm a little bit puzzled as to the need to rationalize the margins. But I think between the 2, remember the 13 4 excludes Niscayah. It's $1 billion business with single-digit operating margins that we will improve over time. But that's why we carved out x-Niscayah, it's 130-basis-point improvement versus same quarter last year, which is the one that was referenced in the question.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And secondly, can you describe how the NiCad promotional activity trended during the quarter? And I guess, I just don't understand why CDIY margins would be flat q-on-q. It seems like price cost should be getting better. Volumes are clearly getting better and you have -- so just can you talk about that?", "Donald Allan", "It really goes back to what we -- what I said earlier, and I think John and Jim touched on it as well, is we have not, we're not completely covering inflation with price in Q1 in CDIY. And as a result, we have 240 basis points of pressure, and they're associated with inflation. That complete -- virtually goes away in the second quarter. But as we've talked about for 2 or 3 quarters now, that's been a pressure point in that particular business. We didn't have that type of inflation in Q1 of last year. It began to -- and the commodities began to trend up late in Q1, and we began to feel an impact of that significantly in Q2 and the rest of the year. So that is anniversary-ing as we go into the second quarter, but that is the main driver for why you're seeing that flat performance.", "James M. Loree", "And I think you're seeing a lot more -- or a lot less promotional activity in CDIY. As you may have noticed, the price was neutral. It was not positive, but it certainly wasn't negative and I think from a trend perspective, that's a good trend. And I think in that business, we've spent a lot of time with them. John and Don and I have spent a lot of time with the CDIY folks, walking through promotional strategy, level of promotion, promotional payback and a number of other things and how important it is to keep the gross margins moving in the right direction. And I think they will -- they have listened and have made some changes that are going to be positive as we go forward.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, just to add on, Nicole, because you will -- to Jim's point, which I think is an important one because you won't get another follow-up. We are very pleased with the increased level of sophistication, albeit from a high base of the CDIY team's ability to analyze the effectiveness of its promotions. If you think about it, you took 2 serious players in CDIY, but with Hand Tools and Power Tools strengthened, may be different drivers. I give the team a lot of credit as we shine the light on margins and on the impact, sometimes negative, of promotions on margins. Which promotions made sense, i.e., did the volume lift more than compensate for the sacrifice in margins and which didn't. They've done great work in the last 6 months, so that's just the long way of saying, we think we're a lot smarter about which promotions are effective and which aren't. And that takes some time with 2 organizations coming together with different databases and different strategies and I think we're cautiously optimistic that by us putting the focus on it and the team taking it very seriously and internally developing significantly improved analytics. We think we've got a better handle on it than we did 6 months ago.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. On auto production, you talked about Japanese production and the rebuild here in the second quarter. But if you look at North American production trend, it's much higher here in North America versus the beginning of the year. So is that factored into the guidance for Industrial? And then my second question is, Don, what's the FX assumption now? I think you had a pretty conservative assumption at the beginning of the year. Euro's certainly tracking a little bit better than we all kind of expected and I know there's still risk out there, but what's the assumption now embedded in the guidance?", "Donald Allan", "Sure. On the Engineered Fastening business, yes, we have factored in auto production forecasts in different geographies around the world both -- and obviously, there's 3 major ones for us in North America, Europe and Asia, plus Japan, both of them. And we have factored that into our particular guidance in that space. From the beginning of the year, we felt that the Engineered Fastening business would be strong, not necessarily as strong as it was last year given some of the significant increases in penetration and market share gains that they've had. But based on where we are at this point in time, we feel good about projections for them for the remainder of the year, but we'll continue to watch that closely as the second quarter evolves. As far as FX, yes, the euro has improved slightly and as I indicated back in January, they're -- we were using roughly a EUR 1.29 to dollar exchange. And our assumption at this stage, it's about EUR 1.30 to EUR 1.31. And I indicated that basically a $0.01 movement in that would equate to $0.015 of EPS on an annual basis, so that could be about $0.03 of a positive, if you look at it from that perspective. But if you also look at a few other things like shares outstanding, which is a bit of a negative versus what we initially estimated, it's pretty much a wash.", "John F. Lundgren", "And weaker yen.", "Donald Allan", "And weaker yen.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. So just a follow-up just to clarify. The North American -- you've got 600,000, 700,000 units of increased production versus January forecast. That's in the guidance or embedded in the guidance?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. I mean, we look at those every month and every quarter as we get new information around auto production forecast, that's factored into Engineered Fastening business ongoing forecast process.", "Operator", "And the next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I have a couple of questions on the Security business. Clearly, without [ph] Niscayah 130 basis point margin lift is a pretty strong performance. But John, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the Security business was feeling some competitive pressure, and I was just wondering if you could go back and talk about that if possible.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes -- no, I talked about in 2 things, and I may have confused you. When I talked about Canada and Australia, 2 established markets, relatively small geographies, but I wanted to touch on them. I said there was a tremendous amount of competition in IAR and in CDIY. What I mentioned was in Australia, we have very small Security business as well as South Africa, that we are deemphasizing. It's that specific. Call it a conscious business withdrawal because it's below-line average margins and I may have unintentionally misled you. No, there's no abnormal competition in the Security business, either in the U.S. or Europe. The major players remain aggressive. Our focus remains on commercial. But nothing abnormal, and if that was your takeaway, I apologize, I unintentionally misled you.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Oh, good. I guess the other question I just had, just kind of tying back to the earlier question on acquisitions and as you answer that question, you made reference to bolt-on acquisitions. But I guess, my question is, maybe a slightly different angle here. As you move through the integration of Niscayah, and you approach the completion of that process, can you talk about where you can go strategically from that point in terms of further acquisitions in Convergent Security, sort of larger acquisitions as opposed to bolt-ons?", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure. I'll have Jim take it, so I think we're all on the same page.", "James M. Loree", "I think we have a clear -- in -- when we stated our strategy about capital allocation. John mentioned that about 2/3 of our free cash flow will typically be allocated to acquisitions, it's been lower over time. So when you look at $1.2 billion, you're talking about a meaningful amount of acquisitions. When you look at the revenue objectives for the company, we try to get the revenue growth up into the double digits, maybe on top of an average of maybe 3% to 4% organic growth. So we're adding about 8, 9 points of acquisitions a year with that money that we generate. And so -- and John also mentioned the organizational capacity being a gating item. It's one of the reasons we have growth platforms, because we have multiple growth platforms. So we have Security as a growth platform. We used to say Electronic and Mechanical, now we just say Security because we run it as one business. We have Engineered Fastening as a growth platform. You can see we really like that business a lot. It has growth characteristics. It tends to be a little focused in automotive OEM, which is great right now, but it's not always great. So there's other growth markets in aerospace and electronics that are really -- other verticals that are interesting to us in Engineered Fastening, so you can expect us to be working on a pipeline there. And then we have 2 exciting new growth platforms in health care and infrastructure. In infrastructure, we did CRC-Evans a while back. It's been a good story for us, as the offshore business has grown significantly and that -- and we've had a weak market in onshore, but that hopefully will change as time goes on. And at some point, we probably will add to our oil and gas activities and infrastructure, maybe branch out beyond oil and gas to some extent. We're looking at some opportunities in that regard. In health care, the value proposition in health care is bring productivity to acute care facilities and bring patient safety to acute care facilities and security. And we have a small but growing business there that we will probably buttress up with a few bolt-on acquisitions to improve our value proposition, to improve our distribution reach, et cetera. Those are the types of areas. Now as it relates to Security, when you start to evaluate the available opportunities in security, especially in electronic, there's one very, very large company out there that while it's not for sale -- it could be for sale, I highly doubt we would ever do anything to acquire a $10 billion security company, so it doesn't look like that's in the cards. Once you get beyond that, you're into regional players in North America. You're into Resi security. Resi security in North America, we don't really like that. We like it better in Europe, but there's nothing really meaningful for sale in Europe right now. So there's not a ton of opportunities. I think we'd like to beef up our Security business in the emerging markets, especially Asia, maybe Latin America. Over time, you might see something there. And then finally, in mechanical security, today our Mechanical Security business is too focused on North America. We've been trying to globalize that for several years. It's been challenging just due to actionability of assets outside of North America, but there's always a chance...", "Donald Allan", "Commercial locks and access.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, commercial locks and access, both. So there's a whole series of different areas that we can play and we can also work on bolt-ons in the CDIY business to the extent that they aren't home center focused or to the extent that they're not Power Tool or Hand Tool-focused. So for instance, Accessories is a great opportunity for us. Higher-than-line average margins, higher-than-line average growth in general over a long period of time. And we are about half our market share in Accessories versus where we are in Power Tools. And by the way, the opportunities in Accessories are plentiful because it's a very fragmented marketplace, so I think you could see something in Accessories. And then also in some of the blurry areas between industrial, automotive repair and CDIY, you might see some activity where it didn't have home center content, and then you might see some geographical expansion in IAR as well.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Josh Chan from Robert W. Baird.", "Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Hopefully 2 quick ones for you. You mentioned really strong POS in CDIY. The one category that was not as strong was Hand Tools. I was just wondering what caused that? And I know you have less share gain opportunities there, but anything else that you could highlight?", "James M. Loree", "Well, clearly, I absolutely believe that the market is stronger for Power Tools than it is for Hand Tools right now, and that's one thing clearly our product development, our new product vitality in Power Tools is exceedingly strong. So vis-\u00e0-vis Hand Tools. Hand Tools is -- if you think about the innovation opportunities in Hand Tools, they're at the margin, whereas in Power Tools, you have lithium-ion, which we came out with. Now we have brushless DC, which we're coming out with as we speak. And these are big game-changing kinds of product innovation areas, whereas in Hand Tools, we kind of go out into the marketplace, we go to construction sites, we evaluate how we can inch up the productivity of a worker by changing the tape rules at the increment. It's just not -- it doesn't drive the same level of excitement and so forth in the marketplace, but it supports the brand and the value proposition, et cetera.", "Donald Allan", "And I think part of it is just math, too. If you think about history of innovation in Hand Tools, much lower ticket item, $15 to $25 ticket item, far less pent-up demand in Hand Tools, we would think or suggest than there has been in Power Tools. So all of those are contributing, I think, to the spread between Power Tools and the Hand Tools.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, it's more of a replacement. Hand Tools is really more of a replacement market than it is a new product market.", "Operator", "And our last question will be from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Just to expand a bit on Niscayah, are you -- in your Security guidance, are you assuming somewhat greater headwind through the balance of the year than what we saw in the first quarter? And is that driven primarily by project delays or are you walking away from certain business or are there vertical markets or -- any color you can provide would be helpful.", "Donald Allan", "Sure, Michael. It's a combination of a few different things. Clearly, whenever we acquire a electronic Convergent Security business, there is a bit of a shift in the model and we like to achieve certain levels of profitability around installations and service and monitoring. And Niscayah's not any different in that sense, and so as we look at new installation revenue and new installation projects, there'll be certain projects that we will pass on because they don't achieve certain levels of profitability. And that's really what we're saying, when we built in a bit of a revenue retraction associated with that, combined with that there isn't -- obviously, 85% of the business is in Europe. And although there's a large chunk of it that's in the Nordic region and the northern part of Europe, which as Jim indicated, is performing relatively well in many of our businesses. There also is a decent amount of that business that's in the southern part of Europe, in particular Spain and Italy, that we do expect some retraction associated from an economic perspective. Those are the 2 main drivers that would really be associated with why we would see a revenue retraction in year one related to Niscayah.", "John F. Lundgren", "And just to add a little more, and hopefully it was clear in what Don said. Maybe to say it in a different way, remember that Niscayah's business, they are extremely capable with demonstrated skills and installation in systems integration. A much lower percentage of their business is recurring revenue in monitoring than our model, than our base business. So as we -- and I think Don said it quite clearly but just to amplify, as the Niscayah business mix shifts from a little bit less systems integration and a little more service and monitoring as a percent of total, some of the lower margin installs, although they're very good at it and very effective at it, if it doesn't come with the service or the recurring revenue, that's what we will pass on therein is the, if you will, top line headwind. But needless to say, it's favorable from a mixed perspective thus the margin accretion assumption that goes into the numbers.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "And just to clarify in the margin accretion, is the mix shift roughly half of the overall expectation for accretion or is it the primarily cost synergies [indiscernible]?", "John F. Lundgren", "No, it's -- Don could give a better -- it's 80-20 cost out mix shift. The mix cost out will happen within a 12- to 24-month period. The mix shift is a very gradual thing. That's going to be 1 to 3 or -- plus year project, so at least 75% of its cost out, I'd say 25% mix in that short term.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over to Ms. Vanek for closing remarks.", "Kathryn H.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today for Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, President and CEO; Jim Loree, Executive Vice President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as via the webcast, and also on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of the call will begin today at 2:00 p.m. The replay number and access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2012 third quarter results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions after the call.", "And as I normally have to do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. And for those of you have been able to read the press release this morning, hopefully, you've taken away from it that our focus does remain on driving long-term growth and achieving our mid-decade vision of being a $15 billion-revenue company with 15% operating margins, irrespective of the macroeconomic backdrop. What we're going to try to cover this morning is what we're doing to counter some of the headwinds in the marketplace in an effort to essentially determine our own destiny, drive organic growth in the face of relatively flat developed markets through, among other things, an increased focus in emerging markets and some, I think, very, very exciting programs in well-developed markets.", "Revenues in the third quarter did increase 6% year-on-year to $2.8 billion. Organic revenues were flat. CDIY grew 4% organically with an operating margin rate, excluding charges, of 15.8%. That is the highest operating margin rate we've been able to achieve since the merger of Stanley Black & Decker almost 3 years ago.", "Industrial and Security were both pressured by certain weak end markets and particularly, Europe. And to counter some of those, you're going to hear a lot from Jim a little later on in his presentation about some of the investments and organic growth initiatives that have already begun and will carry on throughout the next 12 to 24 months.", "Our third quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.40. Again, that's excluding charge of $0.69 GAAP EPS, including all the charges we do in the appendix of this presentation have a detailed definition and explanation of what's in the charges.", "The Niscayah integration continues to go well, operating margins to exceed 12% this year when it's finished. That's up 500 basis points from fiscal year '11, shortly less than -- exactly 1 year after closing that deal.", "Importantly, we've reached definitive agreement to divest our Hardware & Home Improvement business, which marked another key step in the continued transformation of our portfolio. We've discussed this a lot over the last 2 to 3 years. This is a good business with a capable management team, and it's been under review from day 1 of the merger. And our conclusion was that while it may not be the best business long-term given our strategic objectives and geographical portfolio, we needed to fix it first. It's a much more profitable business than it was 3 years ago. And we believe we've accomplished the major strategic milestone in placing that business in the hands of new owners. It brings our U.S. home center exposure, not down to too low a level, but back to the pre-merger Black & Decker levels in the low teens. It does retain, nonetheless, the upside to the U.S. housing rebound, and that our CDIY business, which is still over $5 billion, is $1.5 billion below the revenue, a pro forma revenue, from peak. That's simply the pro forma Stanley Black & Decker revenue 2009, '10, prior to the more recent decline. And as a consequence, HHI never factored into that calculation.", "And finally, Don will give you some more detail on this in his forward look, but when considering Infastech, some of the smaller acquisitions we've completed in 2012, this divestiture -- and this divestiture, the revenue splits geographically around the country will be -- around the world will be approximately 46% U.S., 27% Europe, 16% emerging markets. And again, to reemphasize, Jim is going to talk to you about some of the programs designed to drive that 16% to and beyond our 20% objective by mid-decade.", "Moving on to our -- the global footprint versus prior year. Organic sales, as I said, were flat as strength in U.S. and emerging markets was offset by weakness in Europe and some of the smaller developed markets. You'll hear a lot about this in the segments. But quickly looking at the U.S., which still accounts for 53% of our business in the third quarter, we grew 1%. Europe, overall, was down 3% organically but with a lot of moving pieces. Excluding CDIY, Europe was down about 8%. That's primarily IAR and Security. Jim will talk about this in the segment detail. Including Niscayah, Niscayah is down but actually slightly less than our model at the acquisition time. And operating margin, as previously mentioned, for Niscayah is up almost 500 basis points. Importantly, our high-growth emerging markets, Asia, up 15%; Latin America, up 12%, continue to be strong points, growing well, albeit at a slightly slower pace; and last but not least, some of the smaller developed markets, such as Canada, Australia and Japan, down low to mid-single digits.", "Looking at our sources of growth. Engineered Fastening and CDIY were clearly the bright spots in the quarter in terms of organic growth, and as suggested, offset by softness in Security markets, IAR and Infrastructure. Globally, adding all 3 segments together, volume was flat. Price was flat, which arithmetically is 0% in terms of organic growth. We added 9% via acquisitions, plus 3% due to currency, and as a consequence, that gets you to the 6% revenue growth for the company in the quarter.", "Looking at some of the pieces. Engineered Fastening, up 7% despite being down 3% in Europe, that's obviously a significant share gain for this strategic business, which is what gave us the confidence to add Infastech to this platform to continue to advance that business on a global level. That organic growth rate is obviously well above the rate of light vehicle production, and that's due to increased vehicle penetration across the board. Great work by that team because about 60-plus percent of that business still focuses on the automotive end markets. And one of the strategic -- the primary strategic rationale behind Infastech was to further diversify the verticals that our Engineered Fastening business serves.", "Strength across the board in our Tools business. In our CDIY business, Professional Power Tools, up 5%; Hand Tools and Fastening, up 5%; Consumer Products Group, primarily the Black & Decker brand, up 4%, just very, very solid performance in the third quarter, which gave us tremendous satisfaction and, obviously, strong indication that our -- the new product engine continues to work, and share gains continue to be achieved.", "Our mechanical residential security business was up 3%. The commercial security locking business was down 3%. And Convergent Security, excluding Niscayah, was down 4%. Jim will talk to you a little bit about MAS Commercial, and we're addressing an MPP product gap that we think we've resolved. And in CSS, it's more about conversion of existing backlog that has been and will continue to be our focus.", "And finally, IAR and Infrastructure. IAR in Europe was down 7%, tough market conditions. We continue to have a very valuable business there. IAR North America, Mac continues to perform well, tremendous improvement in that business. And the Infrastructure subsegment of our Industrial platform was impacted by very little offshore activity in our CRC-Evans business -- onshore activity, pardon me. Offshore is doing well. It's growing rapidly, but it's a very small part of the business. And there's virtually nothing happening currently in the onshore market. And of course, in our Hydraulics business, the scrap steel prices are tremendously depressed, and that has a significant and direct impact on our Hydraulics business.", "So that's the view from 36,000 feet. I'm now going to ask Jim Loree to take you through some of the segment detail, looking backwards, but of equal or greater importance. Jim is going to introduce the highlights of some of our organic growth programs, new organic growth programs, that are coming into play right now.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thanks, John. I'll move through the segments fairly quickly today as the story is relatively clear, and I'd like to spend more time outlining the details of our new organic growth initiatives, which will enable us to achieve our long-term objectives with no help from the environment.", "Starting with CDIY. CDIY had a respectable organic growth quarter with impressive margin rate expansion. Revenues totaled $1.38 billion, up 3%. The OM rate was record 15.8%, up 260 basis points versus a year ago. Organic growth was up 4%, with unit volume up by the same percentage. The majority of OM rate accretion was driven by merger synergies, volume leverage and variable cost productivity. Along geographic axis, mid-teens organic growth in Latin America once again more than offset EMEA, which was flat, latter a laudable achievement given weak margin conditions, especially in Southern Europe. The U.S. was up 5% organically.", "Sales by product line were solid as Professional Power Tools were up 5%, Consumer up 4% and Tools Fastening up 5%. Each subsegment had its own success drivers to overcome what was on balance a tepid market environment. Professional Tools continued to exploit its ongoing cordless launch success. Consumer enjoyed growing momentum from its highly innovative Gyro and Matrix product introductions. And Tools and Fastening benefited from Latin America revenue synergies and the DeWalt Hand Tool launch.", "Looking forward, we expect continued solid organic growth performance in the segment despite ongoing external market issues. And we also expect the fourth quarter margin rate to hold in the same zip code as in the third quarter.", "Now moving to Security. Security margin rates continued strong sequential progression as Niscayah synergies are realized. Security revenues totaled $790 million, up 22%. The OM rate was 16.5% and 18.8% excluding Niscayah. The operating margin rate, including Niscayah, is up nicely for the third consecutive quarter. As a refresher, 1Q was 13.4%, 2Q was 15.3% and 3Q, again, was 16.5%. Organic sales were down 3%, with Convergent down 4%, Mechanical up 2 points, and Healthcare, a small percentage of the segment, under some pressure. CSS Europe was down 6% organically or 5% on a pro forma basis, which more than offset legacy CSS North America, which grew 2% organically. A solid performance in Resi hardware, up 3%, was partially offset by Access Technologies and commercial hardware, which were down 6% and 1%, respectively. Access continues to experience declines at its largest customer, associated with reduced remodels and store openings, which was responsible for all of its decrease. Commercial hardware markets are weak in the retrofit segment, including healthcare, education and municipalities, Stanley's traditional strengths. New construction markets are modestly stronger but rely upon -- more upon MPP or mid-priced-point products, which are currently a gap for us, as John mentioned. The Tong Lung acquisition, which is near completion, will quickly address this gap. And just to clarify, part of the Tong Lung acquisition will be going with the HHI disposition and an important part, including a Taiwanese plant and an important engineering center in Taiwan, will stay with us in the Commercial hardware business.", "Healthcare continues to bear the brunt of lower hospital CapEx spending levels, as well as its customers' propensity to defer ordering until its next-generation patient security products are released in 2013. And when the AeroScout acquisition anniversaries in mid-2013 and the legacy product updates are complete, this business should become a robust organic growth driver.", "Moving to Niscayah. The integration continues to progress well, and it appears the cost synergy realization will be in line or better than expected and should be sufficient to protect EPS accretion in light of the difficult European markets. In this regard, the Niscayah OM rate will exceed 12% for the full year 2012, and we expect its run rate to approach segment line average rates by the end of 2013, with the mid-teens performance for full year 2013.", "And now on to Industrial. In the face of difficult global markets, Industrial maintained a solid OM rate performance. Revenues were $621 million, down 2%, both organically and in total. The OM rate was 15.4%, down 150 basis points versus a year ago and up 30 basis points sequentially. For Industrial & Auto Repair, Europe and the U.S. were down organically 7% and 4%, respectively. Emerging markets were a bright spot, with a mid-teens organic growth rate, and Mac also delivered a solid growth performance.", "Once again, Engineered Fastening demonstrated why it is a growth platform, with an impressive 7% organic growth performance. Emhart Europe was contained to a 3% organic decline, and the Americas and Asia both kicked in for double-digit organic performances to enable a strong overall 7% result. This was achieved with only a 3% increase in global auto production, as well as very weak industrial markets, especially in Europe.", "So across the company in summary, weak markets, with Europe by far the weakest, and the slowing but still strong demand in the emerging markets and policy uncertainty in the U.S., this was anything but an easy quarter. CDIY, benefiting from favorable U.S. conditions and strong product introductions, clearly outperformed. Both Security and Industrial maintained respectable margins in the face of market-related growth issues. However, one thing became crystal clear as we move through this quarter, now 5 years into a sluggish macro environment, and that is that we must take our growth destiny into our own hands.", "And during the July conference call, I introduced the major organic growth initiatives that we are pursuing, which we'll do just that. Today, I will expand on that further to give you a lens into what we are doing to drive growth with no help from the environment.", "So on the organic growth slide. In 2Q, we identified close to $1 billion in organic growth programs over a 3-year period, which we shared with you during the July call. Since then, we have refined our approach by staffing the programs with leaders and building the programs out with detailed project plans and resource requirements. And on this page, you can see the 6 programs provide $800 million to $900 million of annualized growth, building over a 3-year period. We expect the growth phasing as follows: 2013, $150 million; in 2014 and 2015, $350 million each year. And operating expense investment of about $100 million will be made to drive the growth, which will be at about a $65 million level for 2013 and also will commence in the fourth quarter. The $100 million includes $20 million of brand development expense for the emerging markets. There will also be about $50 million of CapEx required to support the programs, which will be included within the company's normal CapEx run rate levels.", "So let's take them one at a time. First, emerging markets, a $400 million opportunity, in addition to the robust growth that we are already enjoying in these regions. And I'll come back to emerging markets in a page or 2 and expand upon this because we have a fair amount of information on that, but let's cover the other ones.", "Advanced industrial solutions. The objective here is to create a market, the smart tools and storage market, using RFID and RTLS technology. There are several elements to this. We have electronic kanbans, we have an MRP vending business and several other elements to it that all basically have one thing in common, that is that they utilize technology to drive productivity on the factory floor. What we're going to be doing in this business, since we've already assembled the pieces with CribMaster and with AeroScout, what we are missing at this point is a really sizable field force. And we've put a leader in charge of this. We've created this as a business, and we're going to put 30 to 40 commercial resources on the street in the U.S. in 2013 and get going by really scaling up this business.", "The next item is the RTLS penetration in Healthcare and some Security verticals, such as education and financial services. Taking Healthcare as an example, we're creating an RTLS-based ecosystem, stitching together the other parts and pieces that we have in our Healthcare business today, such as patient security, asset management, asset tracking, storage. And we are going to, again, add about 30 to 40 high-level sales executives on the street, blanket the U.S. with folks that can call on the C-suite folks in acute care facilities and present to them our differentiated value proposition, which can help them take out cost, improve their safety and security and also help them with the revenue recognition and compliance with the new and changing regulations that ObamaCare and other legislation brings to bear. This is a very high value-added business, leverages our technology, and it will be growing at a very fast rate within several quarters.", "The next area is the U.S. government. It seems like a strange time perhaps to be scaling up to go after the U.S. government business but quite the opposite for us since we haven't really ever earned our fair share of U.S. Government business primarily because, historically, our go-to-market strategy has not been aligned properly. After intensive study of this issue, we have determined that we can make significant progress despite whatever spending cuts might be coming along in this area in Healthcare, Security and Industrial. And so we're redefining our go-to-market strategy. And basically, the idea here is instead of having a few people sitting in Washington hunting elephants, we're going to increase coverage at the local level, at the bases and the other places out there across America where the purchase decisions are actually made. And the Washington teams will be repurposed to go after market and business development and provide leads and provide intelligence to the folks out in the field. And not only that, but the government specialists in the field will be working hand-in-hand with the regular sales reps in those businesses. So it's really going to be quite a different approach. And we're already organizing around that as we speak.", "The next area is offshore oil and gas. This is an exciting opportunity in the CRC business, which already has a pretty strong -- the #1 position in what we do in welding and coating and inspection in offshore. And this simply takes it to a new level by growing both in the areas I mentioned, but also by establishing portable factory coating units and portable spool-based capabilities, which nobody else has today. And we have some terrific know-how and innovative ideas here as to how to do that, and we've actually developed some prototypes. And we already have the strong customer relationships with customers, such as Subsea 7 and Technip, the big pipeline companies out there. And they're excited and we're excited about pursuing this opportunity together. And each one of these opportunities that I've talked about so far has about $100 million run rate to it over the period. And then finally, we'll continue to capture the BDK integration revenue synergies that have been out there the whole time, and we've been working on them. And we've done quite well. We're already at about a $315 million level, and you can see some of the organic growth that I did discuss derived from that. However, with the integration coming to a close here over the next quarter or 2, we want to make sure that we capture the remaining $50 million that we think is left there. And so there's a few things there on the page, such as expanding Black & Decker Hand Tools, the DeWalt Hand Tool expansion and so forth, that we will pursue. And I -- it would be remiss of me not to mention, though, that frankly, the entire emerging market opportunity derives from putting these companies together because prior to that time, we really didn't have sufficient scale to go after the emerging markets the way we have -- are able to now. So I'll talk about that more in just a minute. But in any event, we have a solid list of initiatives here with a high level of confidence that they can be executed effectively.", "And why do we have this level of confidence? Number one, because the market opportunities are real. And secondly, in each case, we are uniquely qualified to exploit them. And third, we're implying what I think is a very sound approach to execution here. And the first part of it is that we're funding the initiatives through what I'll call long-term productivity improvements or strategic cost initiatives. We've embarked upon a journey to implement design-to-value techniques in our CDIY business, which will enable us to take out something in the order of about $100 million of costs over a 3-year period. And then we're also elevating the capabilities of our global sourcing team to go beyond traditional sourcing and really take it to the next level, which includes things like clean sheet analysis that we take to vendors, and we explain to them that their costs are not in line with where they need to be from a world-class standpoint. Or -- and so either they're getting too much margin in our relationship, or they don't have the capability or the designs that will achieve the clean sheet objectives, in which case we can help them in that regard. So that, too, will generate $50 million to $100 million of benefit.", "And then there's -- in addition to that, there's some structural reductions, primarily as we adjust our factory footprint in Europe, that will take place over time. And most of these benefits will kick in, in the '14 to '15 time frame. But they will be sufficient to fund the growth initiatives that generate the $1 billion revenue over 3 years, with some timing issues, of course, as the cost benefits are realized. So that's the first element, is that we want to make these programs self-funding through some cost takeouts, because the dilemma here is how do you invest in growth at the same time that you have a low-growth external environment, and that's what we're trying to solve here. And then the other part of this is that we're attacking this challenge to drive growth the way we've discussed here with a methodology that is very, very similar to what we have done with our acquisition integration, which has become a core competency of the company. So we're program-managing this with the integration methodology. We've got a small, dedicated corporate team that is overseeing these initiatives and coordinating with the business units that are actually driving them, helping allocate resources and removing the obstacles to growth. We have seasoned team leaders that are in the field reporting to the businesses that are accountable for execution. John Lundgren, myself, Don Allan, our senior HR folks are -- will be conducting biweekly steering committee meetings beginning in the fourth quarter. We have robust scorecards and tracking tools exactly analogous to the ones that we utilize for acquisition integrations. And we have a very controlled and efficient resource allocation review and approval process, but it is also one that has kind of a fast track so that we don't end up with big delays.", "Now I promised to talk a little bit more about the emerging markets and I will right now. This is a great opportunity. Frankly, we're doing pretty well at it already. This page just outlines how -- what the numbers are by region. You can see the largest is Latin America, then the Middle East and Africa, and then China and so forth. As you get into Southeast Asia, India, Russia, you can see we clearly have a lot of opportunity there. And -- but when you add it all up, it's been a great growth story. Now this is excluding HHI and pro forma for Infastech, but it just shows you that on that basis, 2012 would be about $1.6 billion or 16% of the company and almost 17%, growing at about a 20% rate over a 3-year period with 20% operating margin. And that's driving over $300 million of growth a year. And obviously, it's a nice compounding effect that actually increases the percent of total, particularly given the fact that the developing countries are not growing anywheres near this rate. So I think kudos to the people that have been working on this for years and also the Black & Decker strength that they brought in Latin America and Middle East, in particular. We've got a great team working on it already. The approach is generating good benefits. But with the growth initiatives that we are now embarking upon, we will -- actually, it will enable us to increase the CAGR of our efforts here by somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 to 10 points over run rate, and almost certainly ensure that we blow through the goals that we've set on a long-term basis for the company.", "So we're actually undertaking a radical change to the approach to the emerging markets, and I'll go through this fairly quickly. But we're going from incrementally investing in these markets to a major commitment to resource to the size and the scope of the opportunity. We're funding it, as I described, through this initiative. We're moving from a business unit-centric center of gravity to a regionally led center of gravity, and we're appointing a corporate officer to lead all the emerging markets. Now I've said that we're doing a good job already, and we've got good people leading these efforts and teams already today, so we're simply overlaying a corporate officer over that structure to make sure that we coordinate and we actually execute effectively and maximize and optimize the resource allocation and the best practices across these markets. Then we're moving from high-price-point Western-design products, which generally represents about 10% to 20% of the market in most of these markets to a mid-price-point product approach, which is, on the average, about 70% of the -- of these emerging markets. And we need to be able to do this to have the products designed by folks that are in these regions because the Western engineers really don't have it within their DNA to scale down the products and to kind of orient the products to the local markets the way they need to be, especially as it relates to the mid-price-point products. So we're moving from a kind of tweaking our designs to conform to what we think are the needs of the emerging markets to actually completely redesigning new products to attack the mid-price-point segment of the market.", "We're also going from reinventing the local MPP product lines in each emerging market to one globally coordinated effort, again, with the help from that corporate officer. But also through 3 new product SBUs with global emerging markets responsibility: one in Power Tools, one in Hand Tools and one in Commercial Hardware. All these SBUs are located in the emerging markets, the leaders have already been appointed, and they're off and running. We're also going from a limited product line and MPP to one that was -- and one that was generally sourced to one -- to full product lines of the MPP segment internally manufactured in local markets. And to do that, we need to blanket China, India, Brazil and Turkey with local plants. We just acquired Bajaj in India, which is a power tool plant in India. That's our first foray into that. We have a plant in Brazil. We have a plant -- several plants in China, so we're in good shape there. We need plants in Turkey and some of the other areas. In some cases, we need a hand tool plant in addition to a power tool plant, et cetera, but that is all captured within either our acquisition strategy for emerging markets or the $50 million of CapEx that I mentioned earlier. And then we're going from an under-resourced commercial organization to one that's sized to the market opportunity. What that implies is the addition of 300 to 400 commercial resources throughout the emerging markets over the next year or 2.", "And finally, we're going from an approach where the CDIY business is separately going after these markets and the IAR business is separately going after these markets, and they're kind of running into each other sometimes because the channels -- many of these markets don't recognize the distinction between the 2, the one unified effort focused on gaining profitable market share. And to do that, we're actually creating an internal joint venture between the IAR business and the CDIY business, where we can marshal the resources from both of those organizations and really focus on what's important to driving share gains in those regions and not into internal discussions about who gets credit for what. So we're going to have a little Board of Directors, internal Board of Directors with governance from CDIY, IAR and corporate and should work really well.", "So a really exciting initiative, which is already in progress and will be in full gear by mid-2013. And I will finish this by saying that we have put this company in a position to execute this opportunity through the Black & Decker-Stanley merger. We are now the only tool and hardware company with sufficient scale to exploit this opportunity to its fullest.", "And now I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. Before I move to the 2012 outlook, I just want to touch on free cash flow on Page 14. As you can see, our free cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $170 million; and year-to-date, almost $465 million. For those of you who are familiar with the trends and the seasonality of our working capital and cash flow, you're well aware that a large part of our cash flow does occur in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. And so in this particular case, the working capital through 9 months, or September 30 of this year, is a negative of $286 million. So it's a little larger than we would normally see in this time frame, but, however, it is on track with our expectations because we do believe that we will be at somewhere between 7.5 and 8 turns by the end of this year. And as a result, we'll see anywhere from $400 million to $500 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter just from working capital, pretty much in line with our expectations, as well as the seasonality that does occur, had met a large part of the revenue, in particular, in our CDIY business occurs in the month of October and into early stages of November. And then it slows down in the month of December, which allows for reductions of inventory, as well as collection of many of our receivables within -- or by the end of the fourth quarter.", "Another thing to keep in mind as you look at the trending and where we are through 9 months is if you look back in history, I've reminded folks of this over the last few years, is that fourth quarter tends to represent anywhere from 50% to 65% of the total year's free cash flow. And if you look at those factors, that would just extrapolate to approximately $1 billion to $1.3 billion of free cash flow for the year. So based on our forecast, based on our plans for working capital, we feel comfortable that our $1.2 billion of annual free cash flow is achievable.", "So with that, I'd like to move to 2012 outlook and give an update on our latest assumptions. As you saw in this morning's press release, our new estimate for EPS this year is $5.25 versus our prior range of $5.40 to $5.65. It's based on the following key assumptions. The first one is organic revenue, and this is pro forma organic revenue, so it assumes Niscayah was part of the base in 2011. We previously guided 1% to 2% organic revenue for the year. We believe now that will be approximately 1% for many of the pressures that you heard about from both John and Jim earlier in this call. In particular, though, our Industrial European businesses are seeing a great deal of revenue, organic revenue, pressure, as well as some of our MAS businesses, in particular, MAS Commercial businesses. That combination of those businesses, which are very high profitable businesses with lower volumes, as well as having a negative mix because of the high profitability of those businesses, is resulting in a $0.30 EPS pressure or headwind to our previous estimate for 2012. This provides us, and what that implies, is that for the fourth quarter our organic volume will actually be slightly down, probably approximately a negative 1%.", "Looking at the segments, to give you a little sense of what they'll be for the year. We still believe that CDIY will continue to be approximately mid-single digits. Security will be down low single digits, as we previously indicated in July, but Industrial will be flat for the year for organic growth, where we're expecting to see some low single-digit growth back in July. And that's really where we're seeing a significant amount of the change versus our July expectations and today.", "The second factor that we're updating is based on all the growth initiatives that Jim just walked you through, we will incur approximately $15 million of operating expenses in the fourth quarter, and so that's really beginning to get these initiatives started. Jim talked about some of the hires that we've already done, so it's reflected in those numbers. It's really about getting more feet on the street, as well as creating some more infrastructure in emerging markets.", "The third area that we're updating is we do expect a slight positive associated with FX rates. When we talked in July, we had seen a big drop in the euro, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, in particular, that drove about a $0.35 negative to our expectations for the year. We think we'll call about $0.10 of that back in the fourth quarter, if rates stay where they are today, because we have seen a tick-up of about 5% to 6% in those 3 currencies in the later stages of September. We didn't experience much of the benefit in Q3, but if the rates hold we would expect about a $0.10 benefit for Q4.", "We're maintaining other assumptions. Specifically when you look at organic growth by region, we're relatively in line with our expectations, but the mix within North America and Europe is quite different, as I just mentioned. The emerging markets will be at the low end of our range but still growing nicely but just at slower paces than we have seen in the previous 2 years but in line with our expectations that we created in early January. Cost synergies were both related to Black & Decker and Niscayah continue to hold firm at $115 million and $45 million, as well as the other cost actions we completed in January and July of this year, that totaled $200 million. Our tax rate in Q3 was a little bit lower than our expectation, so for the year, we still expect to be at 22.5%, so in line with our previous guidance in July.", "So you can see at the bottom of the page, if you take the midpoint of the previous range, add the 3 factors or major changes, it gets you to that $5.25, which is an implied fourth quarter EPS of $1.45.", "So moving on to thoughts about 2013. And one of the things that we need to consider is the affect of the portfolio transformation of divesting HHI, the acquisition of Infastech, and what that impact will be. We have not factored that into our 2012 guidance that I just reviewed with you, as we will wait till these particular transactions close, which will either be late -- in late December or early January of next year.", "So to start with HHI. As you know, $1.4 billion of cash proceeds associated with that, which is a 7.5x multiple of LTM, which is approximately $186 million through June 30 of this year. The after-tax proceeds are expected to be about $1.3 billion, so a relatively small tax cost due to the tax basis we have in the United States, in particular, so the tax is primarily related to the small international piece of the business. And we believe, on an annual basis, the dilutive impact to our company will be approximately $0.60 in EPS. The proceeds that we'll actually receive here in the U.S. of that $1.4 billion is approximately $1.1 billion. And what are we going to do with those proceeds? How are we going to utilize them? As we've indicated previously, we wanted to make sure that we took a large portion of it and did some share repurchases. So we're going to take approximately $700 million to $750 million of those proceeds to repurchase shares once the transaction closes, like I mentioned in late December or early January. If you utilize a $75 stock price, which was our stock price when we announced the transaction in early October, it's approximately a $0.30 accretive benefit of buying back those shares.", "The other areas is utilizing some of these proceeds for the Infastech acquisition, in particular the U.S. portion of the acquisition. So approximately $300 million of that $1.1 billion will go towards that transaction, which we expect to close roughly in the same time frame. As a reminder, the accretion associated with Infastech is approximately $0.15 in 2013 assuming a full year and $0.35 by year 3. The remaining $550 million of purchase price will be financed by overseas cash, as well as some of the HHI offshore proceeds that are included in the $1.3 billion. And then a modest deleveraging of approximately $100 million is the remaining portion of that $1.1 million that we'll utilize.", "The net result of this on EPS is approximately, if you utilize the numbers I just went through, will be about $0.15. We've provided a range of $0.10 to $0.20 of annualized dilution given that there are some factors in here such as what will the stock price be when we purchase the stock back, as well as the dilutive impact could move slightly for the HHI. So it's going to range somewhere between $0.10 to $0.20, which is in line with our expectations, but not being a significant dilutive transformation of the portfolio. The good news from my perspective is we're taking approximately 70% of the onshore proceeds in utilizing that for share repurchase.", "So some other thoughts associated with 2013 here on Page 17. At this stage, we feel it's too early to comment on our 2013 views of organic growth. However, there are a few tailwinds and headwinds that are very apparent, which are in our direct control, and that's really what this page tries to highlight. The first is the tailwinds. We've taken various actions, as you know, and some of them are associated with acquisitions such as back in July, we indicated that we have $50 million of Black & Decker cost synergies that will occur in 2013, approximately $0.23 of EPS. We'll have incremental Niscayah cost synergies of $0.15 or $35 million in 2013 and then incremental cost actions, the actions we took in July that carry over into 2013 of $50 million. Strong tailwinds as you'll go into an environment that is still very difficult from an organic growth perspective.", "The headwinds will be the -- really be what I just reviewed to you, which is the net dilutive impact of HHI, Infastech and the share repurchase, which is anywhere from $0.10 to $0.20. Another factor to consider is we certainly expect commodity deflation to occur in 2013 based on current commodity prices. However, we do think that's primarily going to offset some of this mix headwind that we're experiencing, that we'll experience probably in the first half of 2013 if these trends continue. So that will be a net neutral impact. The net of all that is approximately $0.40 to $0.50 of net tailwinds going in 2013, which is not a bad place to be considering the difficult macroeconomic environment we're in today.", "Now Jim touched on the growth initiatives, and I just want to reinforce some comments that he made about the revenue for 2013 specifically. He mentioned $115 million in revenue in 2013 associated with these programs will probably have approximately $50 million of investments, operating costs -- investments in 2013, which means there'll be a neutral impact to 2013. It's really '14 and '15 that we would expect to see the benefits of both the cost initiatives that are funding this, as well as the continued growth of these growth initiatives, a $350 million incremental in '14 and '15.", "So to summarize this morning's presentation. We are investing in organic growth initiatives. We continue to look at the environment as difficult, and we don't see it changing significantly at least in the next few years. As a result, we're responding with these various initiatives that Jim went through in great amount of detail earlier today. The continued volume retractions we see are affecting our profitable businesses, therefore, they've affected our guidance for 2012. We feel that we've taken very sufficient cost actions in both January and July, but they were not enough to stop the deterioration. However, it's not time now to take more costs out. It's time to invest in areas where we can really spur some organic growth in this company. And we're investing in $15 million of organic growth initiatives in the fourth quarter that will help kickstart and jump these programs that we just walked through. The focus here is really on the long-term benefits for the businesses and, ultimately, our shareholders. And we really think this is an important step to move forward in the attainment of our mid-decade goals.", "And last thing I'll mention is Niscayah and Black & Decker integrations continue to be very successful, and we're pleased with where they are at this stage.", "So with that, that concludes the presentation portion of the call, and move to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "First, just briefly, I understand it's early for you to be willing to comment on organic growth. But on the headwinds and tailwinds for 2013, there were 2 that were absent that I would have expected. One is FX headwinds based on current rates, kind of what you think that could be -- at least, in the first half, I would expect kind of some sort of modest headwind? And also I think you touched about AeroScout and Powers Fasteners being accretive next year to some degree or another. I think it was $0.10.", "Donald Allan", "I would say the FX components, actually, were pretty much back to the level we experienced early in the year for most of the major currencies. So we don't see a lot of FX headwinds based on current rates going in 2013. As far as the other acquisitions, I would say, yes, they're kind of in the net neutral category. We didn't call them out because it's a relatively small number, but when you look at the impact of commodity deflation, the mix headwind and those acquisitions, they'd all be in that kind of bottom category that I called net neutral.", "Operator", "The next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Really appreciate all the comments and detail. I had a question about the emerging markets strategy. You mentioned that the 2012e [ph] was also pro forma for Infastech. It looks like that Infastech revenues, and I believe you said Asia Pac was about $270 million or so, are there any other acquisitions in that number? I'm trying to get to the organic growth number. And I guess, looking forward, as you continue to expect to build that business, I assume there'd be -- it would be good contribution from acquisitions as well as organic growth.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, I mean, the numbers are pro forma. So the -- whatever Infastech was in 2012 would be in the base as well. And as far as the acquisition strategy for Stanley right now, it is almost exclusively on emerging markets. And we tend to be looking for power tool, hand tool, commercial hardware and Electronic Security acquisitions, which are very relatively small, in most cases, less than $100 million but very strategic on a one-off basis in a given market. We really feel that some of these companies have strong local distribution, which when combined with our product and manufacturing expertise that we're developing, or the manufacturing expertise that we have and the product expertise in the emerging markets that we're developing, can be very powerful. So yes, it will be supplemented through some acquisition. None of that is included in the organic growth rate numbers that I shared, obviously, that would be in incremental to that.", "John F. Lundgren", "And Mike, this is John. Just so you don't get cut off, I mean, Jim referenced a plant acquisition, which was really a manufacturing base in India. That's a good example of the kind of thing Jim's talking about. And collectively, we have spent a lot of time on target identification and development. Jim has spent, with mine and Don's and our board's full support, a tremendous amount of his time focused on emerging markets in the last 3 to 6 months because, as you know, these relationships, large or small, have a far longer incubation period than, say, a North American acquisition. So that's all part of the thought process. But importantly, the focus is in emerging markets on business development but it's small. Our hiatus on significant acquisition activity going forward remains, because we're going to focus on organic growth. And as I said, we're going to run it. I think Jim explained it really well, we're going to run it like we run a large integration, because that's a model that's tested and proven within our 4 walls, and it looks well for us.", "Operator", "The next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "The CDIY growth number was in line, a good performance. Can you just give us a little more color on what you're seeing in that market in the U.S. in terms of growth, in terms of your share performance, in terms of price competition and promotions, just a little more color on what you're seeing in that important business?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, basically, I think, we're outperforming the market, for sure, in the U.S. Probably, market may be up 1 to 2 points at this point, and, I think, given our performance, a couple of points higher than that. Most of it is coming from the things that I referenced, the cordless, in particular, in Professional Power Tools and to some extent in CPG. But also the -- now we're getting the introduction of the very innovative products that we have in CPG, the Matrix and the Gyro. I think that will definitely be, again, outperformance in the marketplace. And then, the revenue synergies from Hand Tools, in particular, with respect to the DeWalt tools, are also kind of differentiating us in the share point of view. So we're probably outperforming by a couple of points there.", "John F. Lundgren", "And Eric, the second part of your question, we're seeing no abnormal level of promotion or price activity, comfortable at that level. As you know, there's been some commodity deflation, which is helping margins, but not so much that it's placed a tremendous pressure on price. And fourth quarter, there's a tiny bit of seasonality in the consumer piece, but that has been what's driving our business. So right now, I think, another thing that's always an area of interest, our best view in our top meetings with customers is inventories are at a very normal level. The data is so much better, both at the customer base and internally, and the ability to share it transparently, because nobody wins when the channels are stuffed, and nobody wins when they are out of stock, as you all know. We see inventories as of mid-October approaching a busy season up in -- prior to, I'll say, the December doldrums as quite normal.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Dan Oppenheim from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "When you're talking about the emerging markets, you can -- you had shown that Latin American and Middle East being 75% of the emerging market revenue. When you think about the growth initiatives, how much is going to be focused on those regions versus the rest of the world in terms of emerging markets and thinking about sort of what we need to achieve then in terms of growth there, and also what you're thinking getting sort of organic revenue growth in Latin America and Middle East without more initiatives?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, well, clearly, the resource allocation will be towards the larger markets that are -- that we're currently underweight in today. I think where we -- in Latin America and Middle East, Africa -- well, Middle East, I'll say, we have excellent coverage, sales coverage. And really the key there is just we can -- and we have pretty good MPP products that we've developed locally in both those cases. However, in some cases, the products are sourced, so the products that we will manufacture in local markets is -- that's part of the strategy there, and then just to leverage the resources that we have in the market today in those large markets that we're already pretty overweight in. In the underweight markets, it is absolute majority, probably 70% to 80% of the resource allocation will go there. It's all about getting the right products with our SBUs and then basically flooding the market with feet on the street that can develop the distribution channels to drive share growth in those markets. China, India, obviously, are the 2 biggest. But I will tell you, I just got back from Russia, Turkey, Dubai and some other countries earlier in the year. And some of these kind of medium-sized markets that I'm talking about really offer enormous potential, and it's really just about getting the right products and getting the feet on the street. The brands that we have are phenomenal. The recognition of the brands is amazing. The markets are hungry for some market development, and we're going to provide it.", "John F. Lundgren", "And Dan, this is John. Just to follow up and certainly, hopefully, just expands what Jim just said in a very simple manner. As you know, or some of you know, I've spent 14 years of my career living and working abroad. And as Jim, myself, the business leaders huddled to talk about the organic growth opportunity, I guess we always knew, but we've come to the realization that one size doesn't fit all, and that's really been the model that we've been using, which is why we elevated it as a corporate priority. But simply said, it's going to be different in each and every one of those markets. But I think Jim just said it well. It's what's the customer's focal point? It's going to be different in each of those markets depending on its degree of development. What is the product design? We can't simply design one product in Towson, Maryland and dummy it down a little bit and sell it all over the world. So there's 3 engineering centers around the world that are going to drive this activity. And last, but absolutely not least, how we are organized. And Jim described that in great detail, but who is accountable, who's accountable in the region, what's his or her relationship with the relevant business and with corporate, and then finally, how do we track it? So that's nothing different than what Jim said. But I think to summarize it, it is a -- it's a new approach for us, but it's one that we believe it's tested and proven. We've got a lot of experience behind it. And I think we've just validated it with the work we've done with consultants, advisors and, most important, our own team, over the last 3 or 4 months.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.", "Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So I just want to ask a little bit about 4Q, the implied 4Q guidance. So it looks like you're now looking for a modest organic decline in 4Q, and the bulk of that is driven by a little bit of weakening within the Industrial segment. So it would be really helpful to get some color around your expectations Q-on-Q for IAR versus Fastening, what's driving the weakening?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Nicole, it's Don. What I mentioned was that we saw in the third quarter that all of our Industrial European businesses retracted. We expect that to continue at a slightly worse trend, so we would imagine that IAR would retract a little bit more than we saw in Q3. Engineered Fastening will probably have saw 7% growth rate overall. In Europe, they were down 3%. That will be slightly larger as the Industrial European piece of that business, which is not tied to automotive manufacturing, will be down high single digits, maybe double digits at this stage. And then we'll see probably a flat performance with European auto business for Engineered Fastening. So those businesses are expected to experience a fair amount of pressure. There's a little bit of our Infrastructure business in Europe, as well, which will be pressured, but that's not a significant number.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the last question, which you addressed for the European businesses. How much of the cut is kind of related to what you're referring to in the U.S. in locks and doors? And are you really seeing a delay of backlog, so you have it, or is it just that it's kind of weaker backlog? And sticking on the U.S., the recent transfer of Apex to new a owner. You guys have had stellar results in the business that had problems if you go back 5 years ago. So do you think Apex's new owner is likely to bring more margin pressures as they seek to regain market share?", "James M. Loree", "I guess 2 points. Ken, the backlog I referred to is primarily in convergence security, not mechanical locking. The issue that Brett's team is dealing with in mechanical locking is that the market got smaller and faced tough economic times. There was a tremendous move from premium to mid-price point. And full disclosure, our mid-priced point offering was not up to snuff, and the teams worked very hard to get that developed in the marketplace and it's there. That's on the Mechanical Security side. The backlog conversion is simply the orders are there, we've got to get them converted, we've got the installations done, we've got to get them done right the first time. And that's one of the things that led to a management change within our Convergent Security business, where within the last 6 months, we've -- 2 internal, 1 external -- have added 3 senior leaders to Brett Bontrager's team to accomplish that. Regarding Apex, it's not our role to speculate on competitors and what their new owners will do. It's quite a, I'll say, diverse portfolio of brands, many of which are secondary and tertiary. That in and of itself is a challenge. Joint ventures are a challenge. And so as a consequence, we felt that -- we don't think that was a major factor, the Apex joint venture, in our ability to gain share. And I would think that's not going to be a major factor going forward. It's an interesting business. It's in good hands from a very, very professional private equity owners. Talk to them about their strategy as opposed to us. It's not our place to speculate.", "James M. Loree", "I think the only thing I would add is that it's -- of all the various outcomes that could have occurred, it's probably the best for us because they are rational people. They are highly levered. And they will pursue some growth opportunities for sure, but there's plenty of opportunities out there for 2 of us. So I think it's probably in a very good place. And it will probably be for sale in a couple of years, too, so we'll have a look at it then.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Mike Wherley from Janney Capital Markets.", "Michael J. Wherley - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "I was just looking at Latin America, and it's been very strong for you guys despite some slowing of GDP growth in Brazil. Now I was just wondering, how much of your growth in Latin America is from the BDK revenue synergies, and how much is from countries outside of Brazil?", "John F. Lundgren", "There's -- BDK revenue synergies are not just Brazil, Mike. You've kind of asked 2 questions that are hard to answer. Brazil is 65% of our Latin American business. And roughly 65% of the growth has come in Brazil and 35% has come outside. The overwhelming majority of all of that growth, think of it as BDK revenue synergies, specifically Black & Decker, legacy Black & Decker had a very capable manufacturing plant with a very capable local leader, well-established commercial teams and distribution channels in all markets in Latin America, and a very capable business leader in Jaime Ramirez. And what we've been able to do is leverage 2 things. Production in Brazil but for -- it serves all of Latin America through the -- our Uberaba plant where we've been able to do some simple hand tool assembly and production there, number one. And number two, take very, very popular but previously cost competitive black and yellow Stanley products that were imported that are now managed and sold locally through a well-established distribution channel. That's been the big lift. So simply said, the business is pro rata with the size of the markets. And you can contribute the overwhelming majority of that to what we do refer to as the Black & Decker revenue synergy.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Security margins are tough for us to model given the mix shift that you mentioned in the Niscayah integration. Last quarter in the conference call, you talked about flat operating margins in Security for the full year. It looks like that may have come down. So can you walk us through what's changed in the Security side since last quarter on the margins?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I would say that the big thing that's changed is really the impact of what we're talking about around MAS Commercial. So that's clearly creating what we are calling a negative mix impact to the company, but it's also true for the Security segment. So we saw, as Jim mentioned, a really solid performance in Security from a rate perspective given those pressures, but we would expect it to, sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter, retract a little bit more given those pressures and probably, obviously, will be down slightly total year when you look at it versus expectation of flat back in July.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "As you guys think about the organic growth initiatives, historically, obviously, have been focused on acquisitions and that's a bit of a cultural change. Can you talk about what you're doing internally either from an incentive compensation structure, other initiatives to change that culture or shift that culture to an organic growth focus that can be sustainable even beyond when you go back to M&A?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, Dennis, it's a very fair and, I think, appropriate question. 8 or 9 years ago, I implemented, with obviously the tremendous support of Jim Loree, who is already here with our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mathieu, our head of HR, organic growth as a significant portion of the short-term incentive for the entire management team. It made good sense. There were very specific goals for each and every business. And we carried on for 4 or 5 years, I think, with tremendous success, both organically and via acquisition, which is where we deployed most of our -- 2/3 of our cash flow. As we faced what was clearly going to be some really tough economic times, 2008, '09 -- 2007, '08, '09, quite frankly, some very thoughtful and experienced board members led us to the conclusion -- or helped us to the conclusion that it was going to be very difficult to grow organically in that environment, and protecting our balance sheet, focusing on cash flow was a very important thing to do to weather that storm. It's exactly what we did. That was the initiative or the driver, if you will, behind SFS, which has generated tremendous amounts of cash and, quite frankly, I think it's why Stanley was in the position to acquire Black & Decker. As Jim pointed out, we didn't think that would last 5 years, but it has. And rather than continuing to work focused just on cash flow, on income conversion, we've decided, if you will, to take organic growth into our own hands. So the simple answer to your question is yes. Anyone and everyone involved in this, a significant portion of their short-term compensation will be based on profitable organic growth. The exact specifics to that, I'm not going to reveal at this stage. It will be in our proxy that we publish next February. But it will be a specific part, and there'll be a select -- a precious few number of individuals. And Jim talked about how this team was staffed and organized. There'll be a handful of individuals that the overwhelming majority of their incentive will be based on that, but that will be specific to the initiative.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, another element to this is, which is not compensation-related, or at least it is indirectly, is that we are a very, very tightly managed company when it comes to P&Ls, and especially at the business level and the region level. In both cases, when there are revenue shortfalls, the initial reflex in the organization is to cut costs. And frequently, the businesses were attempting to make emerging market growth investments, but when the cost cutting kind of came to bear, typically, emerging markets were not unscathed, although we directed them to minimize that, they just couldn't help themselves because they are measured on P&L and they're very capable people when it comes to delivering those kinds of results. So the overlay that we've created here by absolutely making the investments at more of a corporate level or at least corporate oversight level, we can protect those investments, and we have to kind of sort of put our armor on and kind of get through -- if the environment gets tough, we have to protect these investments, and we will. And that will be a big difference. The other thing is with respect to kind of creating the center of gravity at the region level, you don't have the same incentives to cut costs that you would in the emerging markets that you would if you are running a business that had a global footprint because -- and you are measured on a quarterly P&L. In the emerging markets, your -- the measurements of these individuals are going to be -- well, yes, they are going to be P&L focused. There's going to be a clear understanding between them and us at the corporate level that our expectation is that we achieve organic growth and we do that with investments and the investments are protected. So there's a couple of other subtleties there beyond just direct compensation that we're addressing through this change.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Question regarding the sale of HHI, receiving a 7.5 multiple on EBITDA, whereas the -- at least the housing pure-play comparables that are publicly traded are considerably above that. I know you guys are very savvy as it relates to capital markets, you're very thoroughly advised. I was just curious as to the reasoning behind selling it privately versus a potential carve-out or going to the public markets for that. Was it because the market wouldn't bear it based on your research or data fact that you were getting immediate cash created that decision? Just a little bit of background, if you could.", "James M. Loree", "I think 7.5x, when you really look at that business, I think, is a very fair price. And spinning it didn't make a whole lot of sense given all the extra cost and the fact that it's a very tax efficient transaction. If you look at the composition of the portfolio, the one thing that is, perhaps, underappreciated is that $200 million of that business was Pfister. And Pfister, we attempted to sell on its own and frankly couldn't get it done at anything over 5x multiple, and that would have been a victory if we could have gotten that and would have required seller paper and a number of other things. And we finally just said, the heck with that, let's mix it in with HHI locks and so forth. And so you have to kind to think of it in terms of we got, for what really is the heart and soul of that portfolio, we got something closer to 8.5x. And that's a pretty good price in relation to -- especially the after-tax proceeds that we received for that.", "John F. Lundgren", "It's also a highly profitable business, Sam. And I mean, it's just math. One of the reasons 7.5 doesn't look meteoric relative to some of the comps that you're comparing to is this is $186 million or $190 million EBITDA business. There aren't a lot of housing pure plays, to use your words, with those kind of EBITDA margins. And lastly, not so much the multiple or the margin or how to sell it, we just -- we wanted as disruptive a process as possible because this is an ongoing business that if we didn't sell it successfully, we wanted as little disruption as possible, because it was a business that had then turned around nicely and was performing well. But lastly, remember, this is primarily a design source and ship business. And to Jim's point, Pfister is 100% design source and ship business. Not that we can't do that. We're a manufacturing company and we think we do it pretty well, between global sourcing, product design and production. And that lever for us and ability to further improve the business really didn't exist in this business, and that was part of the driver.  But at the end of the day, we're really happy with the...", "James M. Loree", "Yes. And there's also a missed perception with respect HHI being so tied to the housing market. When you look at the company's exposure to construction before and after HHI, it is still right in the 30% zone. And the fact is that HHI is a replacement business for the most part. It is not a new construction business. You look at channels that it sells into, they are not going into the builder market for the most part. They're going into replacement, remodel, those types of markets. So we haven't really changed the complexion of our portfolio dramatically as it relates to exposure to the construction market. And the market would not have viewed this business as a construction pure play, very important point, which would indicate that we got a very fair price for it, as was mentioned.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on '13 in terms of your initial outlook. When you're assuming for Europe, and I know it's early and you're giving formal guidance in January, but should we assume that Europe is down similarly in '13 or is that how you're thinking about the business right now, and that could be offset by the U.S. and then some of the revenue and cost synergies that you have factored in. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Donald Allan", "Well, as I mentioned, Rich, we're not really giving thoughts on organic guidance for 2013. There's just too many factors out there that are going to change, most likely, over the next 90 days. There's things in Europe, there's things in the United States, et cetera. And as a result, we're not really giving thoughts. But I think if you look at what's happening to us in Europe this year, there's no reason to suddenly indicate we're going to see growth in the first quarter of 2013 in Europe. So I think you can use it from that perspective and look at our overall portfolio, but there's going to be variations that happen in the next 90 days. Things like the fiscal cliff in the United States, that we don't know the impact of that, and the U.S. economy, the continued crisis in Europe, and the Eurozone, as to what will happen with Spain and how that might impact business in that particular area. And then slow growth in China and emerging markets as well. So it all goes back to the theme that we started with, which is that we don't -- the macroeconomic environment is not real robust. And overall, when you look at it, doesn't feel like you're going to see a lot of growth beyond 1 or 2 points. So we're looking to stimulate it with these growth programs, which is what we've tried to focus on this morning and get people to recognize that we're taking action in response to an environment that we don't see changing, or improving dramatically, going forward.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Michael Kim from Imperial Capital.", "Michael Kim - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Just a specific to Niscayah. Can you talk a little about the organic growth profile and how much of that headwind is from project rationalization versus the macro environment, particularly in Europe? And what you guys can do on your own actions to keep more of a flatter growth -- or flatter organic profile and potentially gain some share?", "Donald Allan", "Sure. I think when you look at the pro forma and Niscayah business being down, roughly 5%, I think it's an actual -- it's a pretty good performance given the macro environment in Europe, in particular, given that they're really shifting to a more profitable business model around installation, revenues, as well as trying to drive more recurring revenues into the business model long-term. They'll be down 5% versus our expectation of 7% or even possibly 10%, we think it's a great story. But we would imagine that, that type of situation would continue probably into the early stages of next year and then, depending on the macroeconomic environment, would start to improve. If you look at the 5% today, I would say that probably at least 1/2 of it is due to the macro environment and the other 1/2 is more due to the model shift.", "Operator", "And the last question will be from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Lots of moving parts here, but if we could look at 2013, and, Don, if you could maybe give us a little color on the puts and takes for the free cash flow conversion for the year, and maybe if you could include any sort of pension impact and what the preliminary outlook there might be would be very helpful.", "Donald Allan", "Sure. I mean, I don't have a precise view on free cash flow of 2013, but if you want to get a little input, I would expect that we would imagine we would have continued improvement in working capital next year, and our expectation is usually about 1/2 a turn as we go into the year. We will be making more capital investments related to emerging markets to make sure we have the right products in the different countries that we walked through this morning. So that could be a little bit of pressure but even with that, I still think we'll have improvement in working capital turns in 2013. There's no major pension fundings beyond the current run rate that would pressure 2013, that would be a new item. So I would expect, based on continued accretion in our earnings, continued improvement in working capital, we would expect that our free cash flow would go -- be accretive to the $1.2 billion that we're experiencing this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session of today's call. I will now turn the call back to Kate Vanek for closing remarks.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thanks, everybody, for joining today.

My name is Lorraine, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thanks, Lorraine. Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us for the Stanley Black & Decker Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as our newly revamped iPhone and iPad app and mobile website. A replay of the call will begin today at 2:00 p.m. The replay number and access code are in our release.", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2012 fourth quarter and full year results and various other topical matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As always, please feel free to contact me with any sort of follow-up questions.", "And as I normally have to do: We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may or may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act.", "With that, I will now turn the -- our call over to our CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody. Listen, this morning, beyond reporting our fourth quarter '12 results and providing our 2013 guidance, which I know everyone on the call is interested in, a couple of other objectives of this morning's call are to essentially close the books on the Black & Decker merger and, of equal or even greater importance, lay the groundwork for what we believe is a series of really exciting organic growth initiatives. So thanks for joining us early this morning.", "Quickly, on the fourth quarter. Revenues were up 4%, to $2.7 billion. Half of that was organic growth, up 2%. And very interesting, on the organic growth, 6% in CDIY and Engineered Fastening, 2 of our strategic businesses performing really well, and those were -- that growth was offset by declines in Europe due primarily to market conditions in IAR as well as Security. A little more on that later.", "Diluted EPS of $1.37, combination of strong operations and a favorable tax rate. That was up 12% versus same period a year ago. GAAP earnings of 70 -- were $0.79. Full year revenues, up 8%, 2% organically. And 2012 EPS of $4.67, x charges, was flat versus prior year. But if you normalize the tax rate, i.e., equal -- 2012, make it equal to 2011, diluted EPS GAAP was $2.70 but, with a normalized tax rate, would have been a 12% increase year-on-year. And Don is going to provide a lot more granularity on tax and its progression '11, '12 to '13 when he gives you some more detail on the outlook.", "Strong year in cash flow, $1.1 billion, x charges, for the year. Working capital turns of 7.5, a 42% increase since the pro forma pre-merger levels.", "2013 guidance for diluted earnings of $5.40 to $5.65 a share. That's a 16% to 21% increase versus 2012, driven by organic growth in the range of 2% to 3%, 100 basis points of which we believe will be driven by the early returns on some of the organic growth initiatives that Jim is going to walk you through a little later on this morning.", "And finally, March 2013 marks the 3-year anniversary of the merger between Stanley and Black & Decker. It's an important milestone. It came with a few notable executive management changes, and those were announced in a press release on January 14 and they're taking effect during the first quarter of this year.", "So let's turn to the final chapter of the merger. And I guess it's both a pleasure and my good fortune to be able to talk about it at least on this call this morning and it's probably the last time we'll talk about it in any particular detail. But let's wrap it up.", "We did really well on cost synergies. By the end of 2013, we will have achieved $500 million in cost synergies, significantly exceeding our target and commitment of $350 million. We've exceeded that target by 43%.", "As you all know, CDIY right now represents about 50% of our revenue. The $760 million in CDIY of operating margin in 2012 exceeded the entire 2009 operating margin of the entire company, legacy Stanley and legacy Black & Decker combined. That's the impact of cost and revenue synergies, a prolific new product development activity in process and exceptionally strong execution by the CDIY team led by Jeff Ansell and comprised of really the best athletes from each of the 2 legacy organizations. So it was just a terrific opportunity, and thankfully, in retrospect, we were able to take advantage of it.", "Revenue energy projects continue to yield strong results. We've surpassed $300 million in revenue synergies versus a goal of $300 million to $400 million. And probably the simple example, just to refresh everyone's memory, Stanley Hand Tools are up $25 million in Latin America -- or will be by the end of 2013. Business was virtually nonexistent but -- as we were able to sell premium-branded Stanley products through a well-established Black & Decker distribution network. It's just one of many, many examples of how the -- of the power of the combination of these 2 companies.", "The cultures, driven by world-class innovation, have resulted in more than 1,500 new products and $1 billion of organic growth over the last 3 years. And probably one of the greatest achievements in terms of results from the combination is the degree to which the Stanley Fulfillment System has been initially embraced and fully embedded across the 2 companies. Working capital turns were 7.5, up from 5.3 pro forma pre-merger levels. And within CDIY, which is where the majority of the integration activity went on, working capital is down 50% from the 2009 pre-merger levels. That is a lot of freed-up cash to reinvest in our businesses.", "So by all measures, we truly believe the merger to date has been a resounding success.", "Let's move on to the quarter. In terms of sources of growth, as you saw in our earnings release this morning, Stanley grew 4% in the fourth quarter, 8% for the year. Of the 4% in the fourth quarter, it was 2% organic, which was 2% volume and flat on price. Acquisitions added 3%. Currency was a 100-basis-point headwind, for a total of 4%. Quite similar to how it played out for the year, where volume was up 2%, price was flat, leading to 2% organic growth. Acquisitions added 8%. Currency was a 200-basis-point headwind, and that yields the 8% total growth.", "Looking quickly by business, to give everyone a flavor for the fourth quarter and the year. Exceptional performance of Professional Power Tools in the quarter and on the year, driven by the 18- and 20-volt lithium-ion DeWalt product introductions, just tremendously well accepted across our customer base.", "The Consumer Products Group also had a terrific fourth quarter and a great year. The fourth quarter 9% was driven primarily by new products, Gyro and Matrix, as well as some really good acceptance of some of the smaller products in Japan, which is a small but important market where that business continues to perform well.", "Engineered Fastening, another bright spot, up 6% for the quarter, 9% for the year. MAS commercial, up 3% for the quarter, reversing a trend where they were down on a year-to-date basis. Hand tools and fastening was flat for the quarter, 2% for the year. Europe actually grew but offset in -- by the U.S., where we made the conscious decision to exit some lower-margin businesses in hand tools and fasteners.", "Infrastructure, down 2% in the quarter, 6% for the year. The primary driver there was our oil and gas business, where the onshore business was slow across the board, offset partially by strong growth, albeit from a low base, in the offshore business, and Jim is going to talk about that a little bit in his section a little later on. Quickly, convergent security was off 3% for the quarter and for the year. U.S. Security actually grew in the fourth quarter. Most of the decline was Europe, and a lot of that was Niscayah, much of which was planned.", "And finally, last but certainly not least, IAR was down 5% for the quarter, 2% for the year. You will recall that IAR is one of our few businesses where we have more business in Europe than the U.S., due to the extremely important FACOM franchise, among others. That franchise is stronger than ever. I won't dwell on European market conditions, but we've -- we have, at a minimum, maintained and likely gained share in Europe by being off only 2% for the year in our Industrial & Automotive Repair business.", "So the key organic growth initiatives are in process, we're going to expand on this, and a couple programs in place to rev up the engine for a couple of our smaller businesses that are lagging fleet average in terms of performance.", "Let's look real quickly on a geographic basis. I don't want to spend too much time on this. But upper left, if we want to look at North America, very strong quarter in Canada and a very good year. More importantly, the U.S., which accounts for 48% to 49% of our business, grew 1% in the quarter, 1% for the year. CDIY and Security were up, offset by the Industrial segment, as we've talked about on an ongoing basis.", "Moving to the middle of the chart. Europe was off 3% in the quarter, 2% for the year. It does represent 26% of our business. Again, in the fourth quarter, CDIY grew, whilst convergent security, primarily Niscayah, as well as IAR were off in the fourth quarter. So a total of 3% organic volume decline, 2% for the year.", "Emerging markets remained -- go from strength to strength: a plus 15% quarter, 11% for the year. And then just very, very quickly, Japan and Australia together account for 4% of our business. Japan, a flat quarter but very strong year, driven by Engineered Fastening. And Australia was down high single digits. We think we have a program in place to leverage the opportunity to improve collaboration between IAR, CDIY, as well as leverage the infrastructure of backroom abilities with Stanley Security Solutions.", "Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to spend a little less time than normal on segment detail. And we've included a great amount of detail in the appendix so that you can spend a little more time on introducing some of the growth initiatives to which I've spoken.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thanks, John. As John indicated, I'll hit the segment info fairly quickly. It is a fairly clear and relatively simple story this quarter, operationally.", "And the first part of the story, relating to CDIY, is just a terrific performance by that team, with a 6% organic growth and 180 basis points of profit rate accretion. The organic growth was 7% in North America. We had double-digit growth in the emerging markets and we were flat in Europe. Now of all those accomplishments, I would say the last one perhaps was the most challenging to deal with and perhaps the most impressive because they were able to take what in Southern Europe was a down 10% to 20% type of performance across those countries and translate it into an overall flat performance. Really outstanding work in the U.K. and real strong in other parts of Europe, excluding the south as well. So they've taken the new products and they've done some really creative promotions, and they've really worked hard to offset the difficult market conditions in Europe.", "And now moving to the global business. The Professional Power Tools, up 14%, as John mentioned; consumer, up 9%; hand tools and fastening was flat, as new storage products and Black & Decker Hand Tools strengths were offset by lower U.S. sales as we exited some dilutive-margin promotion activity that we had engaged in last year.", "What's really impressive to me is the profit rate, 14.5% in the fourth quarter. That's really strong for the fourth quarter for this type of business. And as you will probably recall, the margin rates have been pretty strong in CDIY all year. And we think that -- as we enter 2013 with strong organic growth momentum, that we have a new watermark for operating margin rate that represents a sustainable -- we think, sustainable level, with perhaps room for even further improvement. In the home market, that's firming up as we sit here today, and a solid new product pipeline so we're pretty bullish on this segment for the future.", "And then moving to Security and Industrial. The story is -- it was articulated as basically weakness in Europe in both these businesses negatively impacted the growth and profitability in the segments. Security had negative 3% organic growth and positive growth, if -- albeit 1%, but still a sea change in terms of performance in CSS North America and we're happy to see that. Minus 5% in Europe. And the Mechanical Access business, which is primarily U.S., was up 3%.", "The operating margin rate in Security was 15.5%, essentially flat, down 20 basis points versus the prior year; and 17.3%, excluding the Niscayah dilution that -- or rate dilution that occurs because of the lower rate. Although, the Niscayah integration is continuing to progress smoothly and they've essentially doubled their operating margin rate since the inception of that integration activity.", "CSS overall was down 3% organically: North America up 1% and minus 5% in Europe. And as I mentioned, the Commercial Hardware organic sales were up, in total, 3%; and in North America, 4%. We have a very interesting business model shift going on in Mechanical Access in the U.S., and that is that we're converting our direct business to be served by independent distributors, which is freeing up our sales force for -- from the transactional activity to become much more hunters, hunter-type activity. And also, this change enables us to really pursue more aggressively the commercial construction market, which is heating up as we speak. So that's the story for Security.", "Industrial, 16% operating margin rate, down 40 basis points versus the prior year. The operating leverage in Engineered Fastening continuing great performance there, offset by the declines in IAR Europe. And John talked about the numbers, with IAR down 5% organically, Engineered Fastening up 6% and infrastructure down 2%, for a total of negative 1% organic growth.", "Engineered Fastening at 6% positive was a good, really good, story when you put it in the context of the light vehicle production globally, which contracted 1.5%. And they also had a terrific performance in Europe, being up 3% despite the issues on that continent. And they also -- the team at Emhart also made terrific progress planning for the Infastech integration, which we expect to -- the deal to close here over the next several weeks. So all that, very encouraging.", "The infrastructure business. The declines moderated, so trend is getting better there. And actually, oil and gas, that -- the larger part of the segment there -- or the subsegment was slightly positive organically, reflecting what we think is a bottom in the U.S. onshore market, which is very encouraging. In fact, we see activity beginning to become -- pipeline activity beginning to generate very significant activity in the -- North America. And then offshore remained strong. The issue in -- that made the subsegment negative was the hydraulics business was down about 10%, relying heavily on -- end market relying heavily on scrap steel, which was a tough story in the latter half of the year.", "So that's the segment information for this quarter. Now I'd like to spend some time on the initiative that we as a team have been aggressively pursuing for about 6 months now. And we think the #1 catalyst for positive reevaluation of the company in the stock market will be the demonstrated capacity of this team to achieve 4% to 6% organic growth, which has been a long-standing objective of ours ever since John's arrival. And if you average out the organic growth over the long term, we've been running around 3%, if you exclude 2009, which was a kind of an outlier of a year. It will be about 1% if you included '09.", "So we haven't really hit that objective. And if you look at the last 5 years, there's lots of external factors that have been attributable to that. However, we cannot accept the fact that the external environment, a, has been weak; and we cannot accept the lower performance just because the external environment has been weak. And we don't really expect the external environment to be much better over the next 5 years, with continued issues in Europe, slow growth in the U.S. and maybe somewhat slower but still robust growth in the emerging markets.", "So as a team, we've decided that we would take matters into our own hands and we would rev up our organic growth engine. And a lot of the acquisition activity that we've pursued over the last few years has put us in a position where we're actually able to do that, leveraging some of the value propositions that we've acquired and capabilities that we've acquired over the years.", "So we have an initiative, I've talked about it before, which adds up internally to slightly over $1 billion of revenue over a 3-year period. We're going to commit to $850 million, which would give us the ability to tack on a couple of points of organic growth, on top of the 1 to 2 to 3 that we kind of expect attributable to all our other activities and our core activities in these relatively slow markets. So that's how we're going to get to 4% to 6%. We're going to have these incremental activities that require some significant funding and a lot of execution. So about $100 million of operating expense investment over the 3-year period, with about $65 million of it this year and about $50 million of onetime CapEx, is the price for implementing these programs. I'm going to talk about emerging markets, which is the single largest element of the $850 million, at $350 million. But first let me just quickly cover some of the other ones that add up to the other part of this major initiative.", "Very exciting is the smart tools and storage element. It's about $100 million; includes MRO vending, tool-locating systems, electronic can bonds [ph]. It leverages our CribMaster and AeroScout acquisitions. And we've -- we're in the process now of adding about 40 sales executives, primarily in the U.S. but also in some other areas around the world. That's under way and looking very, very positive.", "$150 million will come from health care and security verticals. The acquisition of Niscayah and AeroScout enable us to take a whole new approach to health care where we can bring safety, security, efficiency and compliance to hospitals at a time when they sorely need it and, in many cases, are desperate for improvements in these areas. It's just for health of their enterprises. And we have the value proposition which is very, very powerful and we've really developed it at this point in time. And now it's incumbent upon us to take it to the market and start selling it. And so we are adding about 75 account executives in health care and education, which is also, obviously, in the security vertical, a very, very relevant place to be right now. And these -- the hiring of these folks is well under way. The value propositions are intact and I'm very confident that we'll get to the $150 million.", "Then on the U.S. government. You might ask, why go into the U.S. government right now when the spending looks like it's going to go down about somewhere in the neighborhood of 5% to 10%? But the reality is, as the -- as we look back in our market share with the U.S. government over time, we're kind of underweight in this area and we haven't attacked it in a very efficient manner over the years. And so what we're finding is that we need to have feet on the street at the locations where things are actually purchased by the government and not necessarily just in Washington. So we are putting about 20 people on the street to cover U.S. government in the regional areas, with focus on California, the South and Virginia. And we expect the U.S. government sales to increase by about $100 million over a 3-year period. And that will cover several of our different businesses, including CDIY, IAR, the security business and health care.", "And then we have offshore. Offshore today has already been a great story, somewhat masked by the weakness in onshore which, as I mentioned, is now subsiding. And offshore is going to continue to grow. It's about $100 million today. It was about $20 million when we bought CRC. And the latest chapter in that exciting story will have to do with 2 things and primary things. One is building portable spool bases, which is a -- kind of a revolutionary idea that our CRC folks came up with which helps the pipeline company save enormous amounts of money by moving the spool bases to where the oil is, as opposed to just the fixed spool bases that exist today. And then the other area is a major push into Malaysia, where the offshore activity has increased dramatically over the last few years. And we're in discussions now with the major producers, pipeline companies in that area to implement a major growth program there.", "And then the final part of this is just finishing up the Black & Decker revenue synergies. As John mentioned, we're closing the book on the merger today, so we won't be talking about that much more. But we didn't want to lose sight of the last $50 million that -- of revenue synergies that we have planned for that and so we'll just track it and manage it using the process that we're using here to drive this organic growth engine. And that process is basically taking the integration approach that we used so successfully over the years for our various acquisitions. And using that kind of program management, resource allocation, tracking, monitoring, pulsing-type of an approach to ensure that we manage this organic growth initiative as tightly, as we did those various acquisition integrations. And that is under way, and so far so good. We feel real confident that we know what the status of each one of these initiatives is and that, if we do run into issues, that we'll know quickly and be able to respond quickly. So all of these initiatives are up and running. We will generate a minimum of $100 million of organic growth, as a result of them, in 2012, and then another $350 million to $400 million a year for the following 2 years after that. And the thought is that once we get through this that we will have made enormous progress, just like we did with the Stanley Fulfillment System, in making this organic growth part of the fabric of the company and therefore changing the inherent structural organic growth rate of the company up into that 4% to 6% range, which we think will have enormous value creation potential for the equity.", "So let's move on to a little bit more color on what we're doing in the emerging markets. And this is really a major step function change in the way that we're approaching emerging markets. Historically, we've managed the various regions of the world as very -- tight P&L's, with incremental investments generally made at the local level, monitored by the businesses, with input from the businesses, but because of the tight P&L management and, most of these initiatives, when you make the investments, the payback is greater than 1 year, so any time that there were external market issues or that type of thing, there was frequently kind of pulling back on the incremental investment. And we still -- despite the fact that we only made incremental investment, we still have terrific growth from the emerging markets. And today, they represent about 15% of the company. They typically have grown over the last 5 years about 20%. Last year was slightly lower than that as they have slowed down a little, but they continue to be major growth drivers. They continue to have above-line-average operating margins. So roughly in the neighborhood of 20%. It will be -- operating margin will go down slightly as we make some major funding commitments, but it will still be well above company line average. So we have funded a major push. As I mentioned, the totals that we're spending this year will be about $65 million. And a good half of that -- slightly more than half of that will be spent on the emerging markets where we're going to add about 1,000 commercial resources over the next 3 years. And that, as I said, is well under way.", "We're also moving the management of these various markets from a business-led center of gravity with, generally speaking, U.S. headquarters to a regional-led center of gravity led by one individual, who was appointed in the fourth quarter, Jaime Ramirez, who ran our Latin American business for -- first with Black & Decker and then with Stanley Black & Decker and grew it from $200 million to about $900 million over an 8-year period. He is a proven veteran who has aggressive growth track record and also strong profitability management and people management. So he's the right guy, he's on board. He's about 4 months into \u2013 or, excuse me, 3 months into his planning process. He's got his organization assembled, and we're off and running.", "We're also moving from high-price-point Western-designed products, which only cover about 10% to 20% of the market, to mid-price-point products, which will be designed locally, which address about 70% of the market.", "Now the high-price-point products will continue to sell because over time we'd like to move our MPP customers up into the high-price-point products. But that -- the heartland of the market right now in the emerging markets is the MPP. And these products need to be designed locally by local engineers who are in touch with local market customs and local market needs. So we have formed 3 renew SBUs with global emerging markets responsibility because one thing we have found is that, although there are nuances from region to region, many of the products across all these markets are very, very similar. And so at late-point identification, we can have a relatively streamlined product structure. And those 3 SBUs are in power tools, hand tools and Commercial Hardware.", "And then the other thing that we're going to do is we're going to go from a limited MPP line, which we talked about, but we're -- much of which is sourced, and we're going to go to a much more of an in-house manufactured line in the emerging markets and for the emerging markets, with local plants that are dedicated to local markets. We can't have high-cost plants that serve the West, even though they're located in the emerging markets, serve the local markets because we can't get to the right cost structure.", "So we will have several new plants. We started that with the opening of an Indian plant last year. And we'll have plants in China and Turkey. We'll expand our plant in Brazil. And we'll continue to build plants as necessary as the volume begins to build up. This will not require enormous capital expenditures. There will be a combination of small acquisitions and relatively small capital expenditures for these plants.", "We're also moving from an under-resourced commercial organization in the emerging markets to a very significant troop movement, with feet on the street sized to the market opportunity and over 1,000 commercial resources to be added. And you might say, \"Well, that -- what does that mean in the context of what you have now?\" And it will be more than doubling the resources that we have in those markets today. So, just to give you some context.", "And then finally, we're going from separate CDIY and IAR efforts in Tools and Storage to one unified effort focused on growth. Now as a company, we are the only one with power tools and hand tools. We're also the only tool company with strength in both the CDIY and the IAR channels. And it's very interesting, when you get into these markets, the channels become very blurred between CDIY and IAR. So instead of spending a lot of time trying to figure out how to take our structure and account for it and manage it in a way that isn't a natural fit with the markets, we're going to leverage the advantages that we have, the power tools, the hand tools, the CDIY, the IAR. And we've constructed an internal JV, which will take the best elements of CDIY's aspects and IAR's and it will be managed by the leader of the region. And there'll be no time wasted on internal things like trying to sort out who gets credit for what, it will simply be focused on growing in the marketplace, which will help us drive these powerful results.", "So this is a pivotal moment in our company's evolution, in my view. I think in the past we've demonstrated prowess in cost control, acquisition, integration, deal execution, working capital management, so on. But as I mentioned earlier, our organic growth has been okay but not superior, not an outperformance, let's say, for what it could be. And that's despite the fact that we've more than quadrupled the size of the company over the last 10 years, and now we're going to add organic growth to the fabric of our culture. And I think it'll be a very, very positive thing for our employees and our stockholders.", "I'll turn it over to Don now for the rest of the financial presentation.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. So I'd like to start with a review of free cash flow on Page 13.", "As you can see, our free cash flow performance was very strong in 2012. One thing I would like to highlight, though, is this financial statement is a little different than what you've seen in the P&L, which excludes HHI. The cash flow statement actually has the impact of HHI in it for the majority of the year. However, it does not reflect the full year cash flow performance for HHI because we did close the transaction in the early to mid-December. And as a result, there's roughly $30 million of loss in cash flow associated with HHI. So when you adjust for that, our performance was about $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and compared to the $1.60 billion (sic) [$1.06 billion] that you see here on the page.", "One thing I would like to point out as well is that our working capital performance, as John mentioned, was very, very strong, up to 7.5 from 7.2 in the prior year, which generated in the fourth quarter almost $350 million of free cash flow. It was slightly short of our expectation. We expected it to be slightly above $400 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned back in October. And naturally, the gap that you see, the $1.1 billion versus our guidance of $1.2 billion. That, all set aside, is fantastic performance in free cash flow overall, 2 years in a row in excess of $1 billion, and it continues to be a strong part of the story for our company.", "Couple of items to note as well here on this page. There's a large gain associated with HHI that's included here, and we're actually backing that out. So it's included in that income and then it's backed out so it doesn't affect the operating cash flow. A very tax-efficient transaction selling HHI, which I think most of you are aware of. The growth -- the pretax gain was almost $390 million, and the tax effect -- or effective tax rate was $25 million. So a very nice story there, with less than 10% tax paid on the gain associated with that transaction.", "And then the last item to mention would be our CapEx. CapEx was relatively in-line, about 2.5% of our revenue for the year. And we would expect that, going into 2013, we'd see a similar trend in the percentage of revenue as well.", "So the last takeaway on free cash flow is that we feel this is definitely a differentiator for our company. We'll continue to focus on working capital improvement, going forward. As you know, we have a road to get to 10 working capital turns, and we still feel there's many areas of improvement that are available in our businesses.", "So with that, I'd like to move to 2013 outlook. For EPS, we expect to be between $5.40 and $5.65 for the year, which would be a 16% to 21% EPS growth versus 2012. Let me walk you through some of the assumptions associated with that. First, organic growth. Organic growth, we expect to be up 2% to 3%, which would be an accretive impact in EPS of anywhere from $0.00 to $0.15. Breaking that down into a little more detail: The core businesses, we would expect to grow somewhere between 1% to 2%, so relatively consistent with the performance that we saw in 2012, which adds accretion of $0.15 to $0.30 EPS.", "As Jim touched on briefly, the organic growth initiatives will yield about 1 point of revenue in 2013. However, they will be slightly dilutive to EPS, $0.15 specifically, as we make investments to ensure that we can achieve $850 million of revenue in 3 years and $200 million of operating margin in that same time frame. It's more of a timing issue and it's something just to be cognizant as we make these investments and ensure that we're successful over the next 3 years with this growth initiative.", "The next area would be cost synergies associated with 2 -- our 2 larger acquisitions, BDK and Niscayah. As we close the book on BDK, we do still have some revenue synergies, that Jim touched on, to execute on in 2013 as well. It's $50 million of cost synergies. That will have a cumulative effect of $500 million of BDK cost synergies and really close the book on that transaction. $35 million of Niscayah synergies, which is year 2. And we continue to progress forward with really trying to achieve an OM rate above line average for Niscayah within our Security segment.", "$0.20 EPS accretion associated with Infastech. So it's slightly better than the $0.15 that we provided 3 months ago. We -- the transaction has not closed at this point. We do expect that it likely will close, hopefully before February 1. But if for some reason that doesn't happen due to the regulatory approval process, in China specifically, then we'll provide an update accordingly as needed.", "Carryover effect of our cost actions from 2012, we expect to be $0.15, which is slightly lower than our October view as we've allowed some customer-facing headcount and TD adds to come back into the system to make sure that we drive organic growth.", "The next area is associated with the share repurchase. So as you know, a large part of the funds of -- with the HHI divestiture, we\u2019re going to utilized to repurchase shares. We entered into an accelerated share repurchase program in early December that was executed on post the closing of HHI. As a result, approximately 80% of the $850 million share repurchase, which is up from the $700 million we originally communicated, was executed on in late December. Then as a result, 9.3 million shares were retired associated with that at a cost that's in the low 70s from a stock price perspective. The remainder of the 20% of the $850 million will be executed on in the second quarter, with the total EPS impact will be a positive $0.37 for 2013, resulting in an average shares outstanding, as you can see, of 155.9 million.", "Then we have several other areas that net to a neutral impact that we touched on before such as FX, prices inflation -- pricing inflation, the negative mix carryover effect that we experienced in 2012 and then some positive impacts from some smaller acquisitions such as Powers, AeroScout, et cetera. All that will be net neutral to 2013.", "The next area is tax, and I'd like to clarify a few things in tax, especially related to 2012, before I walk through the guidance. Our tax rate in 2012 for the year was 19.8%. That's on a continuing operations basis. If you include HHI in our results for the year, the tax rate would've been 22%, which is right in line with our guidance of 22% to 23% that we provided in January and reinforced throughout the year, as well as in October. The Q4 associated rate with that 22% was 17%, again in line with our expectations. So I just want to make sure I clarify that because there were a few questions earlier this morning related to the tax rate in 2012, which was in line with our guidance expectations.", "So what does that mean going into 2013? Well, we do expect our tax rate to increase in 2013 to 23% to 24%, which does create a headwind in EPS, as you can see, of $0.20 to $0.30. Why is that? Well, in the last 2 years, we've had some significant tax audit settlements in 2011. Those settlements were over $100 million, $105 million specifically. And in 2012, they were approximately $42 million. When you adjust the effect of those onetime items, the tax rate is between 23% and 24% for those years, which is really the new base for us going forward. We've settled a lot of the old years associated with tax audits and we are current now. And we don't expect to have large settlements as we move forward. And it's a good base rate for our company as you model it into the future.", "And then the last item, which is more mechanical in nature. We do have a headwind associated with higher interest and a little bit in Other. The interest is associated primarily with increased debt related to Infastech that we'll experience throughout the year. Although, we will bring that down as the year closes, but we will -- it will spike throughout the year, which will drive some additional interest expense in 2013.", "So the last thing to mention is free cash flow. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $1 billion in 2013, which is slightly down from the number I just reviewed for 2012, but let me walk you through that math. In 2012, our free cash flow was $1.60 billion (sic) [$1.06 billion], and within that, approximately, was $150 million of HHI free cash flow. So we backed that out as that won't exist, but then we have free cash flow coming in from Infastech, which will be approximately $90 million. That gets you right on that $1 billion number for 2013. And there is a modest working capital turn improvement in it as well.", "So let's move to the next page and a little more clarity in some of the seasonality and geographical aspects of our guidance. First of all, seasonality. As all of you know, our first quarter tends to be one of our lower-performance quarters from a volume perspective and it is slightly higher from a tax rate perspective. We expect the first quarter will represent about 17.5% of our full year EPS, which is slightly below our historical number of 18% to 19%, which goes back, in looking at the combined company, for the last 6 years. And it really is driven, as I mentioned, primarily by volume. We tend to see anywhere from $150 million to $250 million less revenue in Q1 versus the average revenue we experienced through Q2, Q3 and Q4.", "The other factor is that we are making the investments in these corporate growth initiatives that are very important to achieving our 4% to 6% long-term growth objective. They are front-end loaded and so we will experience a little bit of a dilutive impact in Q1 and Q2, in particular, that will cause a little more pressure to this historical percentage that I just provided. And as a result, we think the 17.5% is a reasonable estimate.", "Shifting over to geographic view. North America, we expect this to continue to see low-single-digit organic growth. We do think that we will continue to see the benefit of early-stage recovery in the U.S. residential construction market. We saw a little bit of that in our CDIY business in 2012, with a 5% organic growth in North America. And we would expect those types of trends to continue as we go into 2013. They will be slightly muted by a slower recovery in our security and industrial markets. However, overall, we do expect low-single-digit growth in North America.", "Europe, slightly better performance than we experienced in 2012 but not dramatically. We still think we'll see low-single-digit organic revenue declines, primarily in our Industrial and Security businesses, while our CDIY, or our construction markets, will remain relatively flat.", "And in emerging markets, low-teens organic revenue growth, so somewhat consistent with what we experienced in 2012. But we'll actually start to see that improve more as the year goes on and as those organic growth initiatives that Jim reviewed really start to impact the top line.", "And then the last thing on the page is just reinforcing what we mentioned related to the organic growth initiatives impact. As you know, there was a negative impact in 2012, with $15 million, as we started the investment process. It's $65 million in 2013, with a negative drag of about $30 million in 2013 or that $0.15 EPS I mentioned. The end result, 3 years now, is we still expect $850 million of revenue associated with this program, incremental, with $200 million of incremental OM, which is approximately a 25% OM rate significantly above our line average. Jim touched on the associated operating expenses and CapEx investments that we'll make over that time frame as well.", "So on Page 16, a little more clarity around the segments. First of all, CDIY, we do believe we'll see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, so somewhat consistent with what we experienced in 2012. The new products that we continue to introduce really allow us to increase the momentum in North America and grow in emerging markets and outpace any sluggishness that we really experience in Europe, which we expect to be relatively flat performance in Europe. The OM rate will increase slightly year-over-year due to cost synergies, but there will be a bit of a drag on the OM rate temporarily due to some of these investments in growth initiatives that we've touched on.", "In Security, we do expect a shift from a declining situation to flat to low-single-digit growth in the Security segment in 2013 as modest growth continues to improve in North America. And we'll be able to offset the continued low-digit growth that we would expect to see in Europe in a difficult market over there. The operating margin rate will increase year-over-year due to cost synergies as well as carryover of some of the cost-containment actions that I touched on earlier.", "And in Industrial, flat to low-single-digit organic revenue growth is expected in our Industrial & Automotive Repair tool business. We would say, relatively flat as we see growth in North America that is offsetting a continued weakness expected in Europe.", "In Engineered Fastening, we would expect low-single-digit growth as global light-vehicle production continues to slow modestly, and we would expect our business to be modestly impacted as well, but continuing to show growth. And then operating margin rate will actually decrease slightly for Industrial due to 2 things: one, the addition of Infastech, which is slightly below line average, to start, but we would expect that it would get above line average as we get deeper into the integration process; and then some of the investments I mentioned on the growth initiatives as well. So, growth in CDIY will likely outpace Security and Industrial, and then we'll see some nice operating rate expansion in both CDIY and Security.", "So in summary, to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we do think 2013 will be another solid step towards achieving our mid-decade vision, with 2% to 3% organic growth, beginning to make investments associated with the growth initiatives and 16% to 20% EPS expansion associated with that.", "Looking back at 2012, it was a transformational year for our company. We divested a business, HHI. That was very successful but we had concerns about the long-term strategic aspects of it. We announced the acquisition of a wonderful company, Infastech, that we believe will be a great addition to our portfolio and ultimately drive a significant amount of organic growth and operating margin rate accretion over the long term. We increased our dividend 20%. And we were able to repurchase $200 million of stock, over and above the HHI repurchases we commenced in late December of 2012.", "The organic growth initiative programs have commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012. We do believe $850 million of incremental revenue and $200 million of incremental OM will be achieved by 2015 and will allow us to reach that 4% to 6% long-term organic growth goal. Without relying on macro and economic environment, that could be difficult over the next 2 to 3 years.", "In addition, we have made a tactical pause in significant M&A in 2013, outside of some bolt-ons that we'll do in emerging markets to help us accelerate our organic growth over the long term. But the long-term capital allocation strategy remains the same: Still 2/3 of our free cash flow will be dedicated to acquisitions and 1/3 going back to the shareholders through dividends or opportunistic buybacks, as appropriate. It also allows us to enable a more laser focus on the organic growth and to facilitate our ability to continue to improve our CFROI and allow it to move into the middle of that target range we look for, 12% to 15%, in 2013.", "The Stanley Fulfillment System really allows us to drive a lot of the things that we're doing. We saw the benefits again in working capital in 2012. Jim touched on how we think it will begin to allow us to drive more organic growth in the company. And we feel good that 2013 will be another solid step towards our mid-decade vision.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Lorraine, we're ready for the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit -- from Credit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You talked a lot about the -- sort of the organic growth, but I was wondering about the CDIY. You talked about the operating margin to increase slightly, with the cost synergies. You're doing a great job in terms of looking at sort of pricing incentives there to help margins slightly. Is there further opportunity that you have there in '13 and beyond as we think about margins in that?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I -- this is Don. I think the -- 2013 for CDIY will continue to be a nice year of mid-single-digit organic growth, us focused on more margin accretion related to the cost synergies. But it's also important to recognize that we do want to make sure that these growth investments are in place and begin to get a impact in the back half of 2013. So that will mute clearly the operating margin rate expansion, to some extent. But going forward, as far as looking at this business and operating margin rate, we do see -- still see opportunity for further expansion. And I think one of the bigger areas will be our ability to focus on these organic growth programs in emerging markets. If you look at the incremental operating margin rate, it's 25 associated with these growth initiatives. A large part of that is impacting CDIY. And so even if we do see price pressure in certain areas, overall, I do believe that we'll be able to continue to expand operating margin rate.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "You spent a lot of time talking about the emerging markets opportunity and your approach to it, but I did have one additional question. You -- we talked about opening up a few different plants. I gather these are probably going to be relatively small, mostly assembly oriented, but I wanted to confirm that. And when you talk about opening up an Indian plant and expanding Brazil and maybe China and Turkey as well, I was wondering if you could be a little more specific about which countries you were thinking about prioritizing, particularly as it relates to opening up plants, this year.", "James M. Loree", "Sure, Steve. First of all, you're right about the plants being relatively small. There's no need to build monuments at this point in time. And the key for these plants is to keep the overhead down because the competitors don't have high overhead and some of our plants in the emerging markets that serve the Western markets have a lot more overhead than the local plants of competitors serving the local markets. So there is a very important element of that, which is keeping the overhead down. It's really a different approach. We have to have the -- kind of the Western-company mentality in terms of compliance with regulations and all those sorts of things, and environmental and so on, but we cannot have the Western mentality as it relates to the overhead in the plants. So relatively small, and typical investment for something -- for a plant of this nature would be in the neighborhood of around $10 million. And then the other question that's in terms of prioritization: Interestingly, when we look at the emerging markets and -- 70%, we think, of the growth in the tool and hardware industry over the next 20 years is going to come from the emerging markets, in our view. And when we look at where the growth is going to come from, we can start with the BRICs. That'll be about 1/3. And then there's the Next 11, headlined by Turkey and Indonesia. That'll be another 1/3, the Next 11. And then all the other countries after that will be the last 1/3. So a strategy to go in and just serve the BRICs or China and India or even -- or something like that really won't get the kind of fast-mover advantage that we think we can have here and it certainly won't capitalize on the opportunities. So unlike many initiatives where you say, \"Okay, let's just focus on the 80% rule,\" here you have to have a layered strategy. And we've got terrific infrastructure already in Latin America. So when you look at the BRICs, for us it's really Russia, India and China. In China, clearly, we will have a plant serving the local market plant or plants. We have one in India already. We may have another one at some point in time. And then Russia, Russia, you don't need a plant. Russia can basically import from China very cost effectively. There's no competitor that has a plant in Russia that -- of any material size. So that kind of covers the BRICs. Then you start getting into Indonesia and Turkey. Presumably, at some point, we'll have a plant in Turkey. Not -- it's not a top priority, but it's something that we're obviously looking at and working on. And maybe in Indonesia. The rest of the Next 11 can be served from the plant infrastructure that I just talked about. And then certainly the last 1/3, the strategy to go into those countries will be quite different than it will be for the BRICs and the Next 11. It will be a far less-intensive approach and more -- it'll be much more of a kind of an import model into those countries until they develop over time. So for instance, Africa is going to be incredibly important in the future, but it probably will be 10 years before we can justify a major thrust into Africa with plants and the whole nine yards of infrastructure.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I had a question about your outlook for Security in 2013, specifically in North America. I believe you're looking for modest growth to be offset mostly or completely by Europe. I was wondering if you could go into the growth drivers in North America for Security. And I think over time Security in general has been looked at as a higher-growth opportunity as you've pieced it together over the last 10 years through different acquisitions. And I -- maybe first talk about 2013 drivers, what's working for you, what's maybe still an opportunity and, additionally, how the growth in Security in North America has played out over the last few years relative to your expectations.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, I'll take that, Mike. There's some level of granularity we're not going to provide on this call. But I think we've been fairly public. Remember, our -- you know well, our Security business in general, and North American business in particular, is overwhelmingly commercial. About 20% to 25% of that business is driven by non-residential or commercial construction. That's the biggest driver. About another 15% is retail construction. And as Jim pointed out, while commercial construction is improving from a very low base, we still don't anticipate for that to be a robust market. So what's slowed down the growth of that business the last 2 or 3 years is, quite frankly, the complete lack of any commercial construction activity or, certainly, the reduction in commercial construction activity. And we do need new commercial construction to get the new accounts, to prime the pump to generate the recurring revenue that is so important to that business. The opportunities, though, are in areas such as -- where we're less developed such as health care, which, as you know, is an important small but emerging high-growth business for us that we report within our Security business. And with the acquisition of Niscayah, particularly in North America, the Niscayah team is -- was very well positioned. It has tremendous vertical market expertise in the financial and banking sectors. That's 2 areas where, up until now, we had very, very little business. And we think that we have the opportunity to grow in those areas irrespective of market conditions. So you got a commercial construction market that is anything but robust, but we think it'll be a little better than -- it'll be no worse than prior years, with the upside opportunities in health care, financial institutions, all other things, a very little change from prior years.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, and I'll take a stab at kind of adding something to that, which is we've done as a company, I think, 70 acquisitions over a 10-year period. And of those, the vast majority have been in Security. And they have been all-consuming into -- for the management team. When we bought into what we thought was a high-growth market and in normal -- under normal circumstances historically, it has been both from a secular point of view, given the importance of Security growing and so forth, and also just from the standpoint of being a technologically driven market that has a lot of innovation and value-creating change going on within the industry. So it is a high-growth market. It has been depressed by commercial construction over the years. But the key to growing in -- and outperforming vis-\u00e0-vis the market regardless of what size the market is at any point in time, or growth rate it has, is to have differentiated value propositions. And what I would say we did over the course of building the Security business was we assembled all the pieces that are required to provide differentiated value propositions to various industry verticals, so for instance, health care, education, financial services, government, the global customer that wants to be served in a global fashion like an industrial or that type of organization. So we have all these pieces. And one of the thoughts behind the hiatus that we went on in July was that we're not getting above-market growth in Security. And in order to do so, we have to spend the time and focus the same people that have are -- have been focused on doing over approximately 50 acquisitions and focus them on organic growth and taking with we have and maximizing it. And I just got back from a sales meeting from North America Security, where they had every commercial person in the organization gathered in one location, and they have gotten to the point now where they've been able to take these value propositions that I've discussed here and now commercializing them -- in the process of commercializing them. I've never seen, in the Security business, a more charged-up sales force than we have right now because they finally have what they need to grow and they're going to go out and do it. So I would suggest that we are totally on the right track in terms of growth in the Security business. We have -- if you look back, you can certainly argue that it hasn't been what we'd hoped for, but I'm very confident that it will be, on a prospective basis.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Had a question on the Security, longer term, on the margin. So you're around 15%, 16% right now. What's the progression to get to that -- back to that high-teens rate? I think, John, you referenced you're going to need some macro strength on the commercial construction market, retail construction market. But other than that, is there anything that would prevent you from getting there over a 2- to 3-year period?", "John F. Lundgren", "The answer is -- Don's going to give you a little more granularity, Rich. But remember, Niscayah is a big piece of that now. It's way below line average margin. That being said, we've increased the Niscayah operating margin between 500 and 800 basis points. So part of it is simply math, as the Niscayah represents almost 40% of our Security segment now and the margins continue to increase. But I'll ask Don to give you just a little more granularity than that.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Rich, if you look at -- obviously, Jim reviewed the Q4 performance where you had that segment, it was 15.5%, but without Niscayah, it was closer to 17.3%. So clearly, the underlying business is still kind of in that 17% to 19% range that we're striving for in this business. And in the third quarter, it was closer to the 19% number when you excluded Niscayah. So it really comes down to our continued execution on the cost synergies in Niscayah and a combination of making sure that some of these growth initiatives -- although Jim didn't go through as much detail and the ones in Security, but there are certainly some significant growth initiatives in the world of Security as well, in that $850 million, that will allow us to stimulate more volume growth, which ultimately will help us leverage the cost base and ultimately drive those percentages in that range of 17% to 19%, with an average of probably about 18%. I mean, I really believe that this business, based on its current makeup, is in that category and it's more of a timing issue over the next few years.", "John F. Lundgren", "Rich, and I'll remind you of one more thing. I know you're aware of this, but remind you, and I think it's important for everyone else on the call, this business overall, more on the mechanical than the convergent side, does have a little bit of seasonality. And historically, if you go back in time, you're looking at a couple hundred basis points lower margins in the first and fourth calendar quarters, a lot of reasons. We've discussed them, and more -- better margins in the second and third quarter. It's purely due to seasonality. And so as you're looking at that long-term margins, take a 12-month look and project forward. And be careful projecting off a quarter because I would argue that second and third quarter flatters our margins a little bit, and first and fourth quarter depresses them somewhat artificially due to seasonality.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Joshua Wilson", "This is Josh filling in for Sam. A quick clarification before my main question. You said Niscayah was 40% of Security segment sales in 2012?", "John F. Lundgren", "It's -- well, remember you take out HHI and add Niscayah, it's almost 50% of what's now remaining.", "Joshua Wilson", "50% of the remaining. And then shifting gears to the Infastech acquisition. Could you give us some color, if possible, on what's going on to delay the timing in there and why there might be risk to the close before February?", "John F. Lundgren", "There's -- simply said, it's factors really beyond our control. China has a very methodical antitrust, believe it or not, approval process. We've done everything we can do. We are in the queue and, simply said, any acquisition is very, very thoroughly reviewed and that we see little or no risk. As I'm sure you're aware, Chinese New Year, which starts in mid-February, things do slow down a lot, so I believe there is an incentive on the authority side to get that behind them prior to Chinese New Year. And obviously, there's an incentive for us to get it done. But what our advisers tell us is we've done everything we can do. It's in good hands. It's going through a very normal and expected, albeit a slow, approval process. But we don't see any -- there's -- there are no numerical activities or issues, it's just a question of time.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, exactly. There's no reason...", "John F. Lundgren", "So 100 -- 99.9% probability of closing. The question is purely on timing, if that helps.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Two questions, kind of related to the longer-term targets that are intertwined. The first is, on the ROCE target of 15%, can you just tell us what that is today or what that was in '12 and how you guys calculate that? And then relative to the 4% to 6% organic growth target for the whole company, how would North America look in -- within that target range?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I would say the ROCE at the end of 2012 was about 10.5%. And Kate can send you the details of the calculation because it's not exactly clear cut. But it's relatively consistent with what you would expect with an ROI calculation, with some adjustments for after-tax interest and amortization, in some cases. So when we look at that and we say, \"How are we going to get that to 15%?\" We clearly think that we'll get a significant improvement in 2013 just from the fact that we won't be doing any significant acquisitions. And we'll continue to show significant earnings improvement, with almost 20% EPS growth in that time frame. And so we would expect probably almost a 2-point improvement in 2013 from that level. The associated CFROI, or cash flow return on investment, at the end of 2012 was about 12%. And so there's about a 2-point -- 1.5- to 2-point gap between ROCE and CFROI and that's probably due to the intangible amortization that we experienced through a lot of these noncash expenses through the acquisitions that we've done over the last 8 years. And we would expect a similar result in there, where that would improve probably 1.5 to 2 points as well in 2013. And so we feel like we're on track to really move that forward, and both those ratios, getting them in that 12% to 15% band, even ROCE, probably in 2013. In North America, it's likely going to be a little bit higher than the line average for the whole company, but we don't have -- we don't exactly do a precise calculation...", "James M. Loree", "North America was not on revenue. It was on organic growth, not on ROCE, up to 4% to 6% organic growth.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I mean, the 4% to 6% organic growth in North America, I would say that that's probably -- when you look at that over the long term, I would say that you're probably still looking at a couple of points of growth, frankly, in North America. And so the bulk of the growth is going to come, I would imagine, in emerging markets over the long term.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, if we can get the core growth rate in North America to 2% to 3%, the 4% to 6% is very achievable. And just -- because it is 50% of our volume, yes. And just one other thought on the ROCE and the cash flow return on investment. The ROCE for us over the years has become disconnected from the cash flow return on investment because of our acquisitive activity and the amortization that's associated with it. It's really -- I mean, for those of -- that are familiar and have studied it, it's really more of a book income concept than it is a cash income concept. And we're evaluating -- as a management team right now, we're evaluating moving to more of a cash flow return investment view because it actually is more relevant to our business today because our cash earnings are substantially higher than our book earnings. And we are going to discuss that at the -- at our next analyst meeting, which will occur sometime in the middle of the year, date to be announced. So we'll have more on that, but I think cash flow return on investment is increasingly more relevant to measuring the return on investment of this company.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Quick question. The 17% -- or just to begin to address this, the 17% EPS in 1Q compares to 22% EBIT mix last year, so if there's any outlying driver, if you could address that briefly. But with Niscayah, because it's such a large piece of the business, could you update us where we are in the transition? If I think about HSM, the reverse integration that you did, you were sloughing off low-margin install business as you transition to a more a recurring revenue mix. Can you highlight the challenges and successes you've faced in that relative to the economic stress that we've had?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, I will address the Niscayah while Don racks his brain and tries to figure out the answer to your other question.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "It's seems -- the EBIT mix is lower.", "James M. Loree", "Well, we've owned Niscayah something like 16 months now. And when we bought it, it was one of those -- it was a contested situation. So we didn't have the normal opportunity to go in and vet the management team thoroughly, like we would with a uncontested transaction. And so the hope was that we were going to get some good people at the headquarters and that we were going to be able to take our basic business processes that we have in North America and implement them in Europe in fairly short order. And what we found was that we had strong country managers in -- for the most part, in Niscayah, which was good, but we also found that the centralized management team was quite weak in Europe. We...", "John F. Lundgren", "[indiscernible] country managers in the U.S. as well.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, yes, yes. So in any event, yes, I -- well, everything I've said thus far relates to Europe. And we'll talk about North America separately. So we put a Stanley leader in charge of the business. He replaced the entire management team within about 4 months after ownership, and they have gotten great traction. And they have outperformed their cost synergies. And now they're really focused on growing the business in a tough environment. One of the challenges with Niscayah was that, from a growth perspective, in addition to the environment, was the fact that a fairly significant percentage of their revenue came from referrals from Securitas because they were -- at one time, Securitas and Niscayah were part of the same company and then they were spun, Niscayah was spun from the parent. And they still had a symbiotic relationship because Niscayah was the electronic business and Securitas was the guarding business. And so when a customer needed electronics, they were referred over to Niscayah. So we've had to kind of fill that -- the gap there in the revenue that no longer comes from Securitas because they were the ones that we contested the acquisition with so they're not the -- they're not our friendliest allies out there in the marketplace. So I think the management team has done a fabulous job, when you think about the revenue being down about 5% on the average this last year organically, of filling the gap for the lost business from Securitas as well as dealing with a difficult market in Europe. And they're -- it's very stable. They're going to perform at or above the cost synergy targets. And the acquisition is going to drive every bit of return that we thought it would. And in addition to that, it has really enabled us to be a global security franchise. We're really one -- we're really the only commercial security company in the world that can coordinate globally now, which is a big advantage. So all that is a good story. It's a tough environment. We bought it right before the European market issues were manifested. However, we expected that, we anticipated that. And so I think in the end this is going to be a terrific acquisition. It's -- the operating margins are about double what they were when we bought it, now, and moving on up again this year as well. So it's all in pretty good place. The North American piece, I think, was, for the most part, a pleasant surprise in the sense that -- I talked earlier about these value propositions and the verticals and so forth. They brought in North America great strength in these verticals. So they had a vertical market approach in North America. They were relatively subscale but they managed to do quite well with their business despite that because they have such strong vertical value propositions. We've taken those and we've now integrated them with the commercial force in North America, which has given us an advantage, we think, in the marketplace, especially as we pursue these organic growth initiatives. So I think on balance, we're very happy with Niscayah. It would have been better if the public relations aspect of this, buying a European company, hadn't occurred 2 months before the Europe went into a deep freeze, but nonetheless, we anticipated that. We have it all built into our pro formas, and it's going to be a great acquisition. It already is.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, just one final point, Ken, on Niscayah, and Jim touched on it -- 2 points, I think, just to close the loop because the last thing we'd want to leave is any impression that the integration thus far has been anything but a terrific success, that we're completely satisfied, more than satisfied with the acquisitions and what it does for us. But the first point Jim made and an important one: We normally hit the ground with our feet running 90 days before closing. And simply said, the integration process started on closing because it was a contested public acquisition of a public company. We're on schedule. We just started 3 to 6 months later than we normally are allowed to start. Second, Jim referenced North America and subscale great franchises. Only 15% of the business is in North America, but upwards of 30% of the synergies came from North America because we were able to consolidate, as Jim suggested, and address that subscale issue. Don, you've got a -- you got a view on the calendarization of EBIT?", "Donald Allan", "Yes. So the answer to the question, Ken, is, as I mentioned, 17.5% of our total EPS will happen in Q1, which is slightly below when you look at the historical trends. There's a couple of factors. When you look at Q1 last year, our operating margin for Q1 represented about 22% of the total year operating margin, which is close to the EBIT number or EBITDA number you were mentioning. In this year, we would expect that operating margin number to actually be closer to 20% of the total for the year, in Q1. Why is there a difference? Well, the real -- the main difference, frankly, is these investments we're making in growth. As I touched on, we do have a dilutive impact for the year. The bigger part of that dilutive impact happens in Q1, and it begins to moderate as we get into Q2 and starts to flatten out in Q3. So that's the driver associated with that. And then the other area would be in the area of interest and tax. So we will -- our interest will spike, as I mentioned, due to the Infastech transaction temporarily throughout the year. We will see that happen initially in Q1 and then begin to work its way down as the year goes on. And then in addition to that, the tax rate, we did have a modest tax benefit in Q1 of last year that's also affecting that, that we don't expect to repeat.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Could you elaborate on the roadmap or experience you've had in the past with the mid-price-point product that gives you visibility that you can gain share and achieve a 35% gross profit margin without bringing in more price competition from the people that you're taking the share from?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, I think it's as simple as -- and I think, Jim described it pretty well. We are familiar enough with the end markets that we understand the features that people will pay for and they won't. And our history with a product that was successful at lower margins was, quite frankly, we were up. I'll use the not-so-elegant term of dummying down products produced for the West by taking cost out to get to a price point where it would sell. The new approach, and it's a pervasive effort across our company, of designing to value, what will -- what product teardowns? What will an end user pay for? What does he value, and what does he not value? So simply, it's reengineering these products from a clean sheet of paper, as opposed to trying to just take cost out of a higher-cost product produced with more features and benefits for a market that it wasn't designed for. And as Jim said, to do that, we need basically a 0-base or clean-sheet engineering approach, which we've invested in and that's part of the investment that Jim alluded to. And secondly, we need to produce it locally in plants. They're going to be -- they're certainly going to be capable -- not capable, they will adhere to Western EH&S standards. Some of them are already our plants but with a lot less overhead, a lot less infrastructure than some of the plants designed to produce premium-priced products in low-cost countries but to export to Western markets. So the combination of designed for local market needs and produced in local markets will give us a tremendous edge, and this is something we've got a lot of experience with. We know what the price points are in the market. So we're beyond cautiously optimistic. We're confident that this approach is going to yield the kind of results we're looking for.", "James M. Loree", "And in addition to all that, we have looked at a number of companies that do this and in terms of business development activity. And I can tell you that their income statements and their cash flow statements and so forth, when you consider what -- the things that we know and the synergies that we can bring to that sort of business model, we -- there is an existence theorem. And I think it's really important because what John described was now 80% to 90% the theory of the case, but we have examples in the emerging markets of business development targets that we've looked at that can get there and so we know it can be done.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Thank you for the detail on the strategic growth initiatives. It was very helpful. But when we think about those organic growth initiatives as you kind of stretch to get to the 4% to 6% long-term organic growth range, do we need to start thinking about incremental margins differently as kind of an ongoing structural basis? Or do you view these kind of upfront initial investments as more kind of onetime-ish in nature and then ultimately will kind of get back to the incremental margins that you've targeted historically?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, the organic growth has the ability to drive operating leverage in the company. So while there will be some investments, the investments, for the most part, are simply the operating expense that kind of goes with the gross margin in order to get a certain contribution margin. In some cases, if we're building a plant and so forth, there will be some additional fixed costs. But I would say that we fully expect the emerging market element of this to be, overall, rate accretive to the company, even with all of those investments, very quickly. So it'll be a net positive for operating margins over the long term for the company from the emerging markets. And then most of the other thing that we're doing are very much relying on existing plant, existing facilities. We're adding salespeople, for the most part, commercialization people. That is going to be more incremental at the contribution margin line, based on what we do today. And in most of these initiatives, we're -- as you walk through them, in many cases you'll see that every one of them has a specific value proposition associated with it. And we're big believers in that, the stronger the value proposition, the more you can get paid for something. And we're very much interested in value-pricing these as we go forward.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "The -- you -- I think hand tools, you commented, were flat in the quarter, which related to you walking away from some of the lower-margin business. I'm curious, as you look at '12 and '13, how you look at the market share performance of hand tools and what you see going on inside of that business.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I would say that, John articulated us walking away from business, which I -- this was a very intelligent decision by our CDIY team. As you know, we look at different pieces of our business and make sure that we're achieving certain levels of profitability and pricing associated with that, but ultimately, we also are very aggressive around new product innovation and technologies that help us drive growth as much as possible. And when I look at the hand tools business: It will be a business that will continue to grow. When I think about CDIY in 2013 growing mid single digits, I don't see why hand tools wouldn't be very close to that type of growth in 2013.", "James M. Loree", "Which would imply modest share gain.", "Donald Allan", "Which would imply modest share gain. And it also would imply that we continue to drive activities in emerging markets that will help that global growth number as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "The -- can you give us a little feel for the implications for the change away from the direct model in U.S. Mechanical Access? Just kind of discuss the strategic implications there and what that might mean for what I thought used to be, at least, or might still be one of the highest-return profiles business-wise in your portfolio.", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure, Pete. That's a -- it's a great question. And I think Jim gave a great start to answering it in his prepared remarks, so I'm going to kick it to him. But importantly, it is a conversation that we've spent a lot of time internally having as a corporate management team and with Brett's team. But Jim, why don't you just elaborate a little bit on this year?", "James M. Loree", "Yes. I think now is a great time to do it, number one. It historically has served Best quite well because, if you go back when I -- if you go back to the -- I think it was the '30s when Best kind of came into existence, they had a patented product that was the interchangeable core that played extremely well in certain segments of the market like health care, education, government and so on. And they -- and as the market evolved over the years, they had the direct model and the 2 largest competitors had a distribution-oriented model. And as the economy slowed down and construction slowed down over the last 5 years or so, the distributors, with their profit margins under pressure, began to look more and more at other ways to grow their business and to grow their profits and they started becoming more aggressive in some of the markets that were traditional home territory of Best. And today, we're not dealing with a proprietary interchangeable core anymore. The patents have all expired and so forth. So our sales force is largely accustomed to being sort of -- had a farming mentality, if you will, in serving these customers and did a lot of transactional support for the customers and so forth, things that distributors do very well. But they weren't out there with the size and scope of go-to-market resources that the distributors were. And though -- and we did have the advantage that we could cover multi-geographic locations more effectively with a direct model, but it also is more expensive. And so when we've looked at this change, we think that this is a moment in time when we have enough value to add to the distributors in the sense that we have an installed base, very valuable, and we have extremely robust new product development for the first time during our ownership of Best Access, especially in the mid-price-point product, which has become extremely important in the -- with the economic issues that are going on today. So for us, to get to the construction market, we felt we needed to make this change. And we felt that it's always somewhat risky in an entrenched distribution model, but we believe that this is a time -- a moment in time when we have enough value to add to these distributors that we can partner up with them and put away the competitive aspect that we've had that's always made it difficult to work, to coexist, with the distributors with the kind of a hybrid model that we had. And we've taken a lot of cost out of the field in order to account for the somewhat-lower gross margins that'll be associated with this. And so we think it's income neutral from the standpoint of making the change because of the cost takeouts. And we think that this will enable us to really charge up the organic growth in the MAS model. So we still believe that it will be a great return business on a go-forward basis, but we think it'll be a higher-growth business.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "You've had a great deal of success on the working capital management side. It's been a focus, and obviously, the cash flow is reflected in that. With a lot of effort in the growth of emerging markets, how does that affect your working capital management forecast?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I would say that I wouldn't see them having a significant impact on working capital. We still feel very passionate that achieving 10 working capital turns by the middle of this decade is achievable. And all the initiatives that we're looking at in emerging markets, we don't expect to impact that objective. Now that being said, we probably will end up carrying a little more inventory in that part of the world to make sure that we meet the needs of customers, but when you assess the impact as a percentage of the whole company, it's not going to be more than a tenth or two of an impact across the whole company. And it doesn't really impact our objective of getting to 10 working capital turns.", "Operator", "Thank you. Do you have any final remarks at this time?", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "No. I just want to thank everybody for logging in today and participating. Please let me know if you need anything in the way of follow-ups.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I would now like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Kate Vanek. Ms. Vanek, you may begin.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Thanks so much, Lorraine. Good morning, everybody. Thank you, all, for joining us this morning for Stanley Black & Decker's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is: John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Senior Vice President and Group Executive, CDIY.", "Our earnings release, which was issued this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website as well as our newly revamped iPhone and iPad app and mobile website. The replay of the call will begin today at 2:00 p.m. Replay number and access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim, Don and Jeff will review Stanley's first quarter 2013 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As always, please feel free to contact me with any sort of follow-up questions that don't get covered during the Q&A portion.", "And as I normally have to do, we are going to be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act. With that, I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Just as a top line summary, despite a slow start to the year from a volume perspective, we exited the first quarter '13 with a lot of momentum that, you'll hear later from Don, gave us confidence that we will achieve our fiscal year previous guidance and targets from an income perspective.", "Revenues increased 3%. And that was largely due to the inclusion of Infastech, which closed in February. That acquisition actually took several months longer to close than normal as we waited for various Asian government approvals, so we didn't get as much benefit in the first quarter as we expected. But the extra time really allowed us to hit the ground running. And that integration is progressing very smoothly and on or ahead of schedule now that we've started.", "The organic growth initiatives that we've talked about in past quarters, they gained traction at an encouraging rate. But our core business organic growth did decline. Volume was down 1%. It was due primarily to a slow start to the North American outdoor product season, combined with temporary soft markets in Latin America and modest continued contractions in Europe.", "A bright spot was CDIY operating margin. It expanded 160 basis points despite flat organic growth. And we do remain on track for mid-single-digit organic growth for the fiscal year. And as Kate said, we have Jeff Ansell, our Senior Vice President and Group Executive, responsible for that business, to give you a little more insight on that a little later on in the call.", "Organic growth in Mechanical Security did -- was offset by some declines in Convergent Security in Europe. And as a consequence, our Security segment profitability was temporarily pressured by installation mix and volume declines, primarily focused in the Nordic region, historically a very strong region for the legacy Niscayah business.", "And moving on to Niscayah. The 2013 synergy estimate has been increased by $15 million. The total program estimate, we're now taking a second look at it to think that we may even be able to get more, not this year but next year in 2014, as we combine that business with the former Stanley Black & Decker Convergent Security business in Europe.", "1Q diluted earnings per share of $1.03 was up 5% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.52. And as I suggested and Don will give you more insight, we are reiterating fiscal year organic growth EPS and free cash flow guidance.", "Let's take a quick look at our organic growth initiatives, which suggest that they're on track to contribute about 1 point, 100 basis points of organic growth for this year. During the first quarter, we invested an incremental $16 million in spending. And a lot of that was in feet on the street, 370 new associates hired with about 2/3 of them, 225, in the emerging markets, where we believe our greatest opportunity for growth is, growth and volume leverage rests. All of the initiatives are tracking to their 3-year goals. And as previously stated, that's $850 million in incremental revenue and $200 million in incremental profit.", "But let's take a look at some of the markets, drilling down into some of the geographies. We're going to spend less time on geographies in general than we do historically. That is in your appendix or will be in the appendix. But if you see all the emerging markets with the exception of one, a large one, showed very, very strong increases: Russia, plus 19%; China, 13%; Northeast Asia, 13%; Turkey, 12%; Southeast Asia, 7%. Latin America experienced, I'll say, what we believe is a confluence of temporary issues and they're different in each country: Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia. But as a consequence, our largest emerging market group, Latin America, where we have very strong market positions, is actually down 2%, which we think is temporary. So that gave us a combined total of plus 2% in our total emerging market group, which is below where it has been historically and below where we believe it will be as the year progresses and certainly on an ongoing basis.", "Let me turn it over to Jeff Ansell who, as I said, is the man in charge of our CDIY business. And he's got some fairly exciting opportunities in his business that he's going to give you some more detail on.", "Jeffery D. Ansell", "Thank you, John. Looking at the CDIY results for 1Q. Total revenues, plus 2%, driven predominantly by the Powers acquisition. Organic revenues, flat. As you can see in the upper left, our PPT or our DeWalt business, positive. It was, however, pressured in the quarter due to intentional promotional timing change, moving promotions that occurred in Q1 2012 to Q2 and 3 2013 to match the building seasons in North America and Europe, intentionally done as well.", "Our cordless products performed very well in the quarter pervasively. From a CPG or a Black & Decker perspective, positive. From a power tool perspective, the outdoor season began late, and thus, pressured the results. But overall, positive results in the Black & Decker business, with growth primarily attributed to new products, including Matrix, Gyro, et cetera. In our HT&S business or our Hand Tool business, exceptional growth in our DeWalt Hand Tool range was really offset by weakness in Europe, Brazil and Colombia during the quarter.", "If you look at the center of the page, you could see the track record over the previous 4 quarters of, on average, mid-single-digit growth with this quarter being flat. The 2 reasons are outlined in this portion of the chart. Outdoor, given a 4-week late start due entirely to weather, put 2 points of pressure into the quarter. The Latin American business, as John referenced earlier, added 1 point of pressure. So sans those 2 things, we would've had consistent growth with previous quarters. We do feel good about the correction in the outdoor season, which I'll come on to in a few minutes. And the Latin American business was trending quite positive during the course of the quarter. It essentially just took a little longer to sell through inventories from 2012 than expected, about 6 weeks longer. So you can see the depiction, where January was down 15%; February, down 6%; March, rebounded very nicely to plus 15%. So really the first half of the quarter was pressured. The second half of the quarter was much more consistent with our previous results in Latin America. And finally, in the upper right portion of the chart, you can see that profit rates expanded by 160 basis points, driven by mix, cost synergies and promotional timing to a record 14.5% for the first quarter.", "Turning to the following page. I want to reiterate as strongly as I can our commitment and confidence to mid-single-digit growth for the year even with a flat first quarter. Why do we have such confidence? Well, they're depicted here; 5 reasons, primarily. First is around emerging markets. We believe we'll have continued strength in Asia and other emerging markets, which were up mid-double-digits in the quarter, along with the Latin American recovery that I just outlined, that's already begun. Additionally, we added 185 sales and product headcounts during the quarter. That investment, combined with investment in programming from emerging markets, will certainly improve our business sequentially as these resources and programs gain traction over the course of the remainder of the year.", "Number two reason for confidence is new product development. We have very robust power tool, hand tool and home product new product plans. The launch cycle for our new products really begins in March through October. So very little impact in the first quarter but much greater impact over the coming portions of the year.", "A couple of examples to highlight. In March, we launched the world's first cordless, brushless framing nailer. That product competes extraordinarily favorably with anything that exists in the marketplace. It is the first framer to use cordless battery technology. It does not require disposable fuel cells, which is a negative to the user. And it works in any climate, any temperature, which is also unique. Based on the initial response to that product, we have doubled and are working to triple our capacity for that product for the remainder of this year.", "Additionally, we have really strong momentum in our DeWalt Hand Tool range, up about 30%, as the trend line goes. And then our new steam products, which have led us to the #1 position in Europe, continue to drive growth. So things like that really give us great confidence. And in general, our cordless business outperforming the market while being #1 is another reason for confidence in the terms of new product development.", "The third area to outline is promotional planning. Programming for 2013 essentially starts in Q2 and Q3 versus Q1 of last year. We intentionally moved the timing of these promotions to coincide with the building season in Western Europe and North America because those investments in Q2 and 3 versus Q1 will provide greater ROI for our customers and for ourselves. So we feel very good about that, and that will add volume strength for the coming quarters.", "Fourth, the outdoor season. The analytics have told us recently that April would be the kickoff to this season. We've seen that to be true. Last year, the outdoor season began in week 10. This year, the outdoor season began in week 14. So essentially, we lost a month in the outdoor business, which occurred in Q1. The point would be, though, the duration of the outdoor season is the same length regardless of when it starts. It will run 5 months, the starting point varies. So we will now run from April to August versus last year, March to July. It's very consistent year-over-year. And we have very strong cordless and corded listings across our enterprise, so we feel very good about the uptick once the season does begin. And on average, temperatures globally were minus 11 degrees from where they were this time last year. So a lot of reasons why this season is starting late.", "And then fifth and final but not least is we have really strong revenue synergy plans continuing through the year. We will unveil for you one of these major or mega programs at our meeting in June. Subsequently, we have another mega launch in the third quarter. Both have confirmation with customers and channels in the market already. We just don't talk about those things till they're in the market. And we'll show you again 2 major programs, 1 in Q2, 1 in Q3, with a lot of activity there with really good traction.", "So in closing, strong profit improvement in the quarter, plus 2% total growth, flat organic sales. But with a track record of organic growth in the mid-single-digits as depicted on Q1, we believe we have really strong prospects in front of us. Organic growth headwinds in the quarter were clearly timing and clearly temporary. We remain committed to the growth elements in emerging markets with lag already recovering; with new product development really starting in March running through October; promotional activity as a tailwind in Q2 and Q3 versus a headwind in Q1; the outdoor season starting, as we speak, albeit later than last year; and really compelling revenue synergy plans that are built and ready to execute. So we reiterate our confidence in mid-single-digit growth through the remainder of 2013. Thank you.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Exciting story there and all the more exciting because we really didn't even talk about a recovering U.S. housing market, which as we speak, is indisputably taking place. So no reliance on that, but certainly that's going on as well.", "Let's turn over to Security now. Overall revenues were $599 million versus $592 million a year ago. Organic growth was minus 1%. And despite an OM rate of 10.3% even lower than normal for first quarter, there was some very positive developments in Security during the quarter.", "Let's start with organic growth, which was very solid in several U.S.-centric businesses, including Electronic Security, which was up 3%; mechanical, which was up 5%; and access doors, which was up 4% organically. Europe, while not surprisingly under some volume pressure, will outperform its 2013 synergy commitment by $15 million, as John mentioned, thus protecting full year operating margin and ensuring that the Niscayah acquisition produces a solid return on investment.", "Now some of the CSS or Electronic Security volume growth has come at the expense of OM rate in the first quarter. And I believe we're at an inflection point where the exciting new vertical solutions in K-12 education, health care, financial services and retail are ready to be deployed. And with a differentiated value to be sold, we are training and reinforcing a value pricing mindset with the field, which will address this issue, in addition to some other margin improvement actions that the team is taking. So we expect to see flat deposit of organic growth for the year with overall operating margin slightly positive year-over-year and growing growth momentum heading into the second half and 2014.", "And moving to Industrial. Industrial is also pressured by Europe, especially in Industrial & Automotive Repair. Total revenues were $695 million versus $662 million a year ago. Organic growth was minus 1%. The profit rate was 14.1%. It was pressured by lower volume on the higher-margin European business, cost absorption issues and investment in the organic growth initiatives.", "Now as we take them business-by-business. Industrial & Automotive Repair organic revenues were down 4%. The U.S. was flat. Europe was down 9%. The good news here is the comps for both Europe and the total business ease as we get into second quarter and beyond, second half of the year as well. In the U.S., a strong Mac Tools performance was offset by weak government business and Industrial MRO business for the Proto business. I'd like to highlight one of our organic growth initiatives, the smart tools and storage, or otherwise known as Advanced Industrial Solutions, was up 5% organically, with CribMaster up double-digits on vending success in MRO.", "In Engineered Fastening, they were flat organically. The automotive business grew 6%, outpacing a 4% decline in global light vehicle production. The North America auto business was up 7%. Europe was up 2%, as auto-related market share gains offset declines in Industrial and a $5 million shipment timing issue, which was customer-driven, and pushed $5 million of revenue into the second quarter at the expense of first quarter revenue. Japan, with its difficult situation in the auto industry, was down 8% on a 16% light vehicle production decline. And as John mentioned, the Infastech acquisition closed on February 27 and the integration is progressing well. This exciting new addition to the portfolio will add significant growth potential through emerging market and electronics content.", "And then Infrastructure really was a bright light in the quarter as the offshore pipeline business drove 9% organic growth in CRC, a very positive sign as the U.S. onshore business is gaining cyclical traction and the offshore business continues to grow. So stay tuned for a very strong 2013 for CRC-Evans. Now I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who will take you through the financial aspects of the quarter.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. I'd like to start on Page 10 and talk about our free cash flow performance for the first quarter. There's really 3 things that I'd like to point out. You can see that the performance was a negative cash flow of $132 million, slightly worse than our anticipated result. And let me walk through some of the details associated with that.", "The first of which is working capital. As most of you know in the first quarter, we tend to see a sequential decline in our working capital turns, which we did see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter from 7.5 turns in the fourth quarter to 6 turns here in the first quarter. That was about 0.5 turn lower than our expectation. And it's really being driven by a couple things.", "First of all, the lower overall volumes in the first quarter, as well as the timing of the revenue within the quarter. As you've heard in various pieces of the call this morning, January and February were very slow in certain parts of the company, and then March began to accelerate and we saw improvement. That timing dynamic certainly caused pressure to the working capital number. The good news is that's a temporary phenomena. We don't see that as any major concern for the year. And we still believe for the year, we will have modest working capital turns improvement year-over-year.", "The second item of note is other. Other is an area that always in the first quarter we see a large negative outflow. That's where annual rebates, bonuses, et cetera, get paid, and that impact is reflected there. And then CapEx, slightly higher versus the prior year, as we expected, due to certain growth initiative investments we're making, as well as other key investments around the overall strategy. We still expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be about 2.5% to 3% of annualized revenue this year.", "So the first quarter performance, although a little bit worse than we anticipated, we are not concerned. We believe that these are temporary issues that will subside and correct themselves in 2Q. And we'll still be able to achieve $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year.", "So with that, I'd like to move to Page 11 and talk about our guidance reiteration for 2013. We believe that we will still be within the range of $5.40 and $5.65 EPS for the full year. That'll be 16% to 21% EPS growth versus 2012. The factors on the left side of the slide indicate the items that we are reiterating associated with these certain assumptions within this range. The first is organic growth. We still believe we will grow 2% to 3% versus 2012. And the dynamics within that are consistent with what we said in January, where the core business will grow 1% to 2% and our organic growth initiatives will yield 1 point, but they will be dilutive by $0.15 to EPS. The cost synergies associated with BDK of $0.23 and carryover cost reduction actions of $0.15 are consistent with January. And then Jim touched on, as well as John, the Infastech acquisition. We still believe the accretion will be $0.20 for the full year and even with the 1 month delay in the timing of the closing. Our share repurchase has gone successfully with $0.37 benefit. That will be completed in the coming weeks and be behind us. And that's really associated with a large portion of the proceeds received from the HHI divestiture.", "Moving over to the right side of the page. There's a few items that are changing but do have a neutral impact. The first of which we have mentioned a couple times this morning that we believe the Niscayah cost synergies will be $15 million higher in 2013, now $50 million for the year. That is offsetting some of the volume and rate pressures that we're seeing in the CSS business. So a net neutral impact. And then there's 3 additional items that are neutral as well. A small change in our other net assumption, which is causing a positive of $0.05 versus our January guidance. Tax rate is still within the range of 23% to 24% but is trending towards the low end of the range, so that will be a slight positive as well. And then we have a little bit of pressure in our shares outstanding. So our outstanding share number is expected to be slightly higher.", "Moving to Page 12. A few more assumptions associated with our guidance. On the segment side, you've heard from both Jeff and Jim some of the assumptions associated with the full year. For CDIY, very consistent with what we said in January, still believe that our organic revenues will be mid-single-digit. We expect the OM rate to expand year-over-year as we see continued benefit of synergies, as well as incremental profit associated with volume and a slight offset associated with some of the investments related to our growth initiative.", "Security, similar story to January as well, a flat to low single-digit organic growth, although we have a mix in the geographies, where we'll see growth in North America with offsetting pressure in the European markets. We do expect our OM rate to expand slightly year-over-year, as we will execute more cost synergies related to Niscayah, as well as carry over some of the cost actions from last year.", "And then on the Industrial side, flat to low single-digit organic growth as well, similar dynamic in the geographies, where we see growth in North America. However, a retracting environment in Europe that's partially offsetting that. And then the OM rate will actually slightly decrease year-over-year in this segment, as we see a temporary impact from Infastech margins being below line average, as well as the investments in growth initiatives.", "The one last item I'd like to mention associated with guidance is looking at the first half and the second half associated with EPS. Due to the growth investments that we have engaged and made and started in the end of 2012 and the timing associated with the dilutive impact of that $0.15, the vast majority of that $0.15 dilutive EPS impact will happen in the first half of 2013 and will have a neutral impact from the growth initiatives in the back half of the year as they begin to turn accretive, and we expect them to be significantly accretive in 2014. That creates a dynamic when you look at the first half versus the second half, where we expect the second half to represent 60% of the full year EPS, i.e. the first half will be 40%. That's slightly off historical trends, where if you look at the last 3 years of our company, the second half tended to be between 56% and 58%. The main difference between that and our expectation this year is these investments in the growth initiatives and the timing associated with that.", "So overall, we believe that we'll continue to see -- we will see solid growth in CDIY in mid-single-digits that will outpace Security and Industrial as we begin to see growth in the residential end markets that's outpacing the commercial and industrial markets. So with that, to summarize the call, I'll pass it back to John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Don. So just to wrap it up, hopefully it's clear that we remain focused on driving our organic growth initiatives and efficiencies across the company, maximizing the synergies across our lines of business and certainly allocating capital in ways that provide excellent returns for our shareholders. We are reiterating full year organic growth EPS and free cash flow guidance. The organic growth initiatives are gaining traction and are on track to achieve our 3-year targets of approximately $850 million in organic revenue and $200 million in incremental operating profit. CDIY, as Jeff, I think, walked you through very clearly, will grow mid-single-digits organically for the year, fueled by new products, market share gains and a return to growth in our emerging markets.", "In Security, which has historically been among our higher-margin businesses, we expect profitability will improve throughout the year, as the Niscayah integration synergies and the benefits of a modified field sales model in North America begin to hit the bottom line. And as a consequence, we expect modest year-over-year improvement. So 2013 will be another solid step towards the achievement of our mid-decade vision with 2% to 3% organic growth and 16% to 21% earnings per share expansion. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kate and Lorraine, and we'll start our Q&A.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Great. Thanks, John. Lorraine, let's open up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "John, I wonder if you could just talk about market share trends within the Security business, particularly the Convergent Security business.", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure. Within Convergent Security, we clearly lost a slight bit of share both in Europe and North America, some of which was programmed. If I start with the U.S., we've got some good installs and, as Jim suggested in his segment overview, some of those larger jobs came at the expense of margin. But even with that, we arguably have, I would say, very, very, very modest share decline in North America as we attempt to upgrade our mix and integrate the Niscayah business. And we remain highly focused on new vertical markets, such as financial services, government, education. If you'll recall, our largest single market right now or vertical market is retail. And of course, that's not a very, very robust market. So globally, we arguably saw some modest share loss, which we believe is temporary. Europe, as I suggested, our business remains very strong. We remain a market leader. We did suffer some share loss, particularly in the Nordic markets in Sweden, a legacy Niscayah stronghold. The rest of the business remains very strong. We remain strong in France. We've lost business in Spain, but we've gained share because we've lost business at a far slower rate than the market. And Jim, you might want to -- if you want to add anything on to that, please feel free to do so.", "James M. Loree", "I think when you look at the competitors and their various reports, there's no indication that anything but share loss and share gain at the margin is going on. There is no sweeping trend here. You have the largest competitor in electronic industry shedding some less profitable business. So their numbers are not terribly strong. You have nothing really meaningful going on underneath the 2 of us, the largest and us being the second-largest, and no real meaningful trends with the other electronic players, although there's some noise coming out of a few of them. But thus far, nothing to get too excited or concerned about. In mechanical, I would say that I think we're gaining share in the U.S., and that's a terrific turn of events there. Very recent turn of events, but that's a new business model that we've taken on, certainly seems to be paying some dividends in the early stages. So that's really positive. And then as John mentioned, the European situation, we do have a strong, strong business there, and we're very pleased with it. We have been shedding some business intentionally there, and the market is not terribly strong either. And I think John covered that very thoroughly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "I guess, it's kind of a related question. But I was hoping within the CDIY business, if you could maybe break out expectations domestically versus internationally, if you think about it for the year. And then as it relates to the promotional discussion that you talked about in the first quarter, any help that you can provide on what that impact was on the margin side that will be shifted towards 2Q, 3Q?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Dennis, this is John. Jeff's going to take all but the very end of your question. We are not going to drill into margins forward-looking by segment or by business. I think we can talk to it arguably directionally. But Jeff, why don't you take those?", "Jeffery D. Ansell", "As we look at the full year, our expectation is that we'll have -- the North American marketplace will perform essentially at the range we provided, which is mid-single-digit growth with a plus or minus of 1 point either way but around mid-single-digit growth there. Some pressure in Europe, volumes are holding up pretty well as they did last year. But that business continues to be somewhat pressured, offset by strength in the Latin -- or the emerging markets, which will grow double-digits. So if you combine those 3 things, you have strength in emerging markets above our mid-single-digit total range. You have some pressure in Europe, as expected. And North America will perform about at the range of the total business.", "John F. Lundgren", "And Dennis, just retrospectively to touch on your margin question, as I say, we're just never going to do this prospectively. But we did report strong margins on flat volume. And the math would suggest that was due in part to the delayed promotional activity that Jeff talked about but in equal greater proportion to the strong product mix. Outdoor is a terrific business, but it's not among our highest mix businesses. So less outdoor, less promotion, really strong Professional Power Tool performance certainly helped deliver the very solid margins in the first quarter. Hopefully, that'll help you. Prospectively, we're just not going to go there on this call.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Would you be able to talk about the rate pressures that you saw on CSS, what regions they were in? And also along those lines, how Niscayah is tracking versus your expectation from a sales perspective.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. We'll have Don take it. Mike, we've touched on that, but we'll try to elaborate.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Mike. As Jim articulated and I touched a little bit on guidance, CSS is definitely seeing a combination of volume and rate pressure. There's certainly volume pressure in Europe, some of which we anticipated, some of which is a little bit above expectations. But the rate pressure is also in Europe because where we're seeing that volume pressure is in the Nordic region, which is the highest profitable business we have in the European CSS business. We believe it's temporary in nature, but it does require us to accelerate some of the cost synergies that we touched on through the call, and we believe that can quickly get us back to a level of profitability that we're comfortable with. In North America, we have a little bit of rate pressure as we saw some mix shift from larger installed jobs. But that's really us just continuing to focus on the vertical strategy in that business and ensuring that we're achieving the right levels of profitability. And we believe that's a temporary phenomenon, and a lot of that was actually planned for in Q1.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays.", "John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's actually John filling in for Steve today. So in the release, once again you laid out the $15 billion sales target by mid-decade. Clearly, I would think that acquisitions are a big part of that or reaching that. And there are a few potential targets that are being shopped in the market. So I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how you're evaluating M&A and to what extent future tax planning plays in that analysis.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, I'll take that. I guess, 3 points. One is we've said the temporary -- the very publicly announced temporary hiatus in our acquisition program allows us to digest several of the recent acquisitions, particularly Niscayah and Infastech, and focus our efforts both in terms of organizational capacity and to a lesser extent, spending on our organic growth initiatives. That's number one. Number two, we hadn't -- we didn't have -- about 3 years ago, we didn't have Black & Decker on our M&A or BD target, but the opportunity to combine 2 phenomenal businesses with even greater synergies presented itself. And as an opportunistic proactive management team, we seized that opportunity. So that's a long way of saying were that to present itself again, it's not saying we won't do it. Tax planning is a tertiary thought as we look at our M&A and business development plan. Specifically, those who have followed us, we have a very careful screening. Strategically, is it 1 of our 4 identified growth platforms? And then financially, does it achieve our hurdles? Last but not least, do we have the organizational capacity to absorb it? All 3 of those things go into our thinking and our planning. And it will continue as this year progresses. We haven't in the past nor will we ever talk about specific targets. But this company -- acquisition, valuation and integration is or is rapidly becoming a recognized core competency in this company. And we've been given a lot of credit for that. We haven't forgotten how to do it. Long term, it will remain part of our strategy. But temporarily, it's on the back burner.", "James M. Loree", "And if I could just elaborate as well. We come at M&A more from a strategic point of view than we do trying to fill in some goal that we have for the mid-decade. So we're not out there just willy-nilly shopping around so we can get to $15 billion. What we do believe is that with the capital allocation approach that we have and with the revenue growth objectives that we have, which would be low double-digits total growth and then 4% to 6% organic long-term objectives, that we can get to something along the lines of $15 billion by the middle of the decade using our very publicly stated acquisition strategy, which is to continue to consolidate the tool industry, number one, which means strengthening our CDIY and IAR businesses through investments, and particular -- in this particular market, the accessories is the area that we really are underrepresented in. It's the most profitable area in the power tool business. And it's one where we're constantly looking for opportunities. These would tend to be bolt-ons in this particular space, but we will continue to pursue those. And then the other area that we're focused on is in emerging markets for the tool business because there's plenty of opportunity to continue to complement our organic growth strategy in tools with an acquisitive growth strategy. So protect the core through M&A, protect the tool business. And then we move to the growth platforms. And we have 4 growth platforms. We have Security, Engineered Fastening, Infrastructure and Healthcare. We'll start with Healthcare because we're only $170 million in Healthcare today, and we're not going to go out and buy a multi-hundred million dollar healthcare business that trades at 4, 5x revenue. That's just not what we're going to do. Healthcare, we may do some small technology bolt-ons that could help improve our value proposition, where we bring efficiency and safety and security to hospitals. But the other 3 areas are the ones that you'll likely to see M&A activity in the future. Engineered Fastening, we just completed one, so I wouldn't expect anything too soon there. And then you have Security and you have Infrastructure. Well, as you know, the Security businesses, those folks are busy digesting Niscayah and also getting their organic growth on track. So they probably won't be doing anything significant in the near term. However, as we look further out, I would expect to see some activity in the emerging markets and perhaps some activity targeted at industry verticals, such as retail, financial services, government, et cetera. And then finally, Infrastructure. And we will continue to see plenty of opportunities in Infrastructure, where we can find niche positions that are in secular growing areas that can be defended, that have high margins and high growth associated with them. So we would probably see some activity in that area on a prospective basis. But as we said last July, 12 to 18 months hiatus. Well, we're coming up on July, we've made some good progress, but we will not continue acquisition strategy above and beyond emerging markets until we get to the point where we can say definitively that the organic growth initiatives are working.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I see the investment in the discussion on organic growth across the business. I'm curious how you're balancing this thinking in the Security business, trying to grow Security, improve organic growth share there, while at the same time you're taking cost out. So if you could just talk a little bit about how you're balancing the spending there and especially thinking about Niscayah with the market share and the growth objectives.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. I think it's fairly simple. I think when you look at the model, Eric, the North American business, we are investing for growth right now. And the European business, we are rightsizing the cost structure to reflect the revenue reality. So that's where you see the cost out, the synergy increases, is all in Europe. And in North America, we're investing significantly in vertical markets, in particular, the vertical market growth strategy. But it's as simple as that. It's a bifurcated approach.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And if I could just follow up, the assumption for the year sounds like you expect to make up the margin shortfall in that business through the rest of the year. What changes in 2Q to 4Q relative to 1Q, especially in light of the investments you're making?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, I think I'll take it. Jim can elaborate if he'd like. I touched on that in my comments, and I'll try to clarify. Two things. Obviously, Niscayah increased synergies in and of themselves will make up mathematically for some of the volume shortfall and some of the margin shortfall. Again the Niscayah synergies get -- they get greater every quarter, the run rate not smaller. Second, Jim alluded to it in his segment discussion. We've modified our, if you will, go-to-market approach via distribution in North America on the mechanical side of the business. And early signs are it's been tremendously successful. And we think that's going to continue. A lot of other moving parts. And as Don talked about the total company, within Security, Brett would talk about a lot of puts and calls that are neutral. But strong Mechanical Security business, as well as Access business getting stronger and continuing to put a lot of points on the board from Niscayah's cost synergies, we do believe will get us back to where we've been. And Eric, you've followed this business a long time, it historically has been a very, very profitable business. And the math with Niscayah was low -- very low single-digit operating margin when we acquired it. It is double-digit operating margin, and it's going to get to fleet average within a year or so, and that's just a really big piece of it.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. And I know that when we talk about investments in verticals, it sounds kind of generic and it doesn't really have a lot of life to it. But when you start talking about the individual verticals and what we can bring to the -- what we can and are bringing to the market right now, it's very obvious that we have solutions that are differentiated in a number of these verticals. Just take K-12, for example, where we have the full array of mechanical, electromechanical and electronic solutions to bring to a K-12 scenario. And every school board in the United States is evaluating their security right now. We have deployed an army of people around that opportunity. That will come to fruition at some point in time. We are the best positioned security company in America to deal with that opportunity. In financial services, we have the best iris identification technology in the world, exclusive rights to the best iris identification technology. We're in discussions with major financial institutions about how we help them create branches that are keyless branches using iris identification technology. At some point, that will likely come to fruition. And I could go on and on. In retail, what we're doing in retail, what we're doing with government, what we're doing with the RTLS technology that we acquired from AeroScout. But if you start to really delve into these solutions, our opportunity at this point is to commercialize them. And that's what the Security people are focused on, and that's why we're investing in North American Security. And oh, by the way, once we get these solutions nailed down in North America, the next wave after that is going to be to take them to Europe. So right now, we're getting Europe rightsized, so it's profitable and robust, and we have strong management team in place, which we're well on our way to doing. And then a year or 2 from now, there will be a wave of solutions, these same solutions coming into Europe. And then finally, we're investing in the emerging markets in Security. Our business this year will be about $100 million in Security in the emerging markets. The Tong Lung acquisition, which was quietly done, and the GMP [ph] acquisition, which was done several years ago, have really provided us with outstanding manufacturing and design capability. And we recently completed a series of EN products, which are the European-type standard products that play much more successfully into the emerging markets. Now we have Chinese manufacturing capability. We have Taiwan design capability. And all of that is being assembled for our frontal attack on several of the major emerging markets. So growth in Security is coming and investments are being made. And it's an exciting time, I think, for the Security business. But we're at the threshold of it at this point.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.", "Jeremie Capron - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on the Hand Tools business. You talked about strong performance of the new DeWalt line. So I wonder what is it that is actually holding it back over the past couple of quarters and if you had any comments on market share around this.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, certainly. Jeremie, as indicated, the power tool brand usage in our Hand Tool business has really been positive, while the core Stanley business remains very strong globally. The challenge -- and from a share perspective, we believe our share has increased in Hand Tools over the past 3 years. So from a share perspective, quite positive. Introduction of power tool brands, our power tool brands at Hand Tools have been predominantly incremental. The pressure that business has faced in the past quarter and probably past couple of quarters is high exposures -- relatively high exposure to Europe, which is a strong hand tool market for us that really has been pressured in that business like every other. So that really has offset some of the growth we've had from a power tool brand perspective in our Hand Tool business. But we continue to make progress from a share perspective. And we expect, too, that business will grow consistent with the rest of the business as guided already for the remainder of 2013.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "You highlighted margin synergies. And with a few exceptions, you seem to be on track both from a revenue and margin side. CapEx is roughly in line in the 2% to 3%. Are you comfortable that you're making the progress you need to meet your ROCE target of 15% or objective of 15%?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, this is Don. I would say yes, we are comfortable. I think we had mentioned, I believe, back in January that one of the, if you want to call it, a benefit of us taking this temporary tactical pause around M&A is that it allows us to focus on enhancing our return on capital employed. Because what you've seen over the last 5 years, in particular, or even before that, as we did acquisitions, that before they get integrated into our existing core businesses, they have a lower return and they get to the range of 12% to 15% return on capital employed by somewhere between year 3 through 5 post acquisition. That's been a bit of a, if you want to call it, drag on that overall return of the company. But still the return of the company has been around 10% in that time frame, which is certainly significantly above our cost of capital. But we wanted to be closer to 15%, as you mentioned, by the middle of this decade. This pause allows us to make a lot of progress. We think we can make about 100 to 150 basis point improvement this year. The other great benefit of the organic growth initiatives over the next 3 years is minimal investment to make that happen. And a return of $200 million of operating margin by year 3 really does gives us a dramatic boost on those returns as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert Baird.", "Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just on the positive trends you noted on the business model shift at Mechanical Access. Can you give us a little flavor as to how that translates into maybe a margin progression this year but more importantly what that means longer-term for the business from a return perspective? And potentially, does it enhance the growth aspects of the platform as well?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Peter, I'll say for the third time this morning, we're not going to project margins by subsegment of business going forward. It does us no good and we don't -- we're not sure it helps you that much. I understand the desire from a modeling perspective. What we can say, and I think Jim articulated this quite well, we were slow to shift our model because we had something that was working. But it absolutely will be a catalyst for more organic growth in the North American Mechanical Security market. We were missing a lot of opportunity in terms of both specification and with mid-price point products with our purely direct model, which served the high end extremely well and the restocking captive customers extremely well. But it left us a little void in a lot of areas where we felt it was absolutely essential we have greater penetration to grow the market. So at the end of the day, a better mid-price -- a mid-price point product offering, broader distribution will absolutely be a stimulus for organic growth. And we would not do it if we didn't think it was going to be incremental or positive vis-\u00e0-vis margins. But we're certainly not going to forecast that for one small segment of one segment of our business.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, it's an interesting time when you look at what's going on in distribution in Mechanical Security because these distributors, as they went through tough times, they sort of doubled down on growth and driving organic growth themselves and really started pushing the envelope up into the electromechanical and even into electronic, in some cases. So our business model plays very, very nicely into that trend. And the second thing I would say is while we were farming our installed base very effectively, the armies of distributors that are out there that are hunting in the commercial construction area are absolutely winning that war. And so therefore, if you don't play in that arena with them, you don't get the opportunity to participate in the commercial construction growth that's ahead of us. And so there's several other reasons for doing what we did, but those are 2 good ones.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeffrey Kessler from Imperial Capital.", "Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "And speaking of Mechanical Security, at the ISC show, you demonstrated, what may not be your first but it was certainly the first that I saw it demonstrated, integrated a [indiscernible] a networked mechanical door that would be networked with CSS. Can you speak a little bit about the, if you want to call it, the convergence of getting your mechanical and your electronic businesses together particularly at the door?", "James M. Loree", "Yes. I mean, that's definitely a thrust of ours. You saw the product, that is going to be the first of...", "Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division", "I think it was like the ESA [ph] to the ELA [ph], or something like that.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. It's called the EL. The EL lock, which will be introduced en masse in May to the marketplace, was kind of spotlighted at the show. And it'll be at a price point that no one else can even get near. And that's with sourced manufacturing to begin with, that can be brought in-house if we so desire at some point. But yes, that's a key part of our strategy. It certainly plays to many of the verticals that we're looking at. It also gives us quite an edge with respect to what I was just talking about with the independent distributors and the fact that they are moving into the electromechanical and electronic realm. And that comes in both a networked and a non-networked version. And we're expecting pretty good big things. I didn't really talk about that as part of the equation for Mechanical Security growth as we go forward, but that's certainly out there as something that can help drive it.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Great. Well, I think that wraps us up, Lorraine, correct?", "Operator", "That is correct. I am showing no further questions.", "Kathryn H. White Vanek", "Well, thank you, all, so much for dialing in today. If you have any questions, please just send me an e-mail or give me a call, and I'll talk to you all soon.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. You may begin.", "Gregory Waybright", "Thank you, Christine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. This replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2013 second quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And obviously, please feel free to call me with any follow-up questions after today's call.", "And finally, as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Second quarter highlights certainly included 12% revenue growth due to a combination of 5% organic growth, with which we were very pleased, and the other 7%, the addition of Infastech. Diluted EPS of $1.21 a share were up 7%, and diluted GAAP EPS was actually $1.23. And the press release, if you've had a chance to look at it, explains, I would say, the counterintuitive nuance of GAAP earnings being higher than -- higher due to the reversal of an accrual. And if anyone needs more information, Don can get you that offline or during the Q&A.", "The organic growth initiatives, which we've talked about on the last 3 calls, are accelerating, particularly in the emerging markets. Our CDIY business and Industrial businesses both had compelling top line results, as well as margin growth. CDIY organic growth of 6% and an operating margin, x charges, of above 15%. And Engineered Fastening grew 9%. That's well ahead of its core market -- core automotive market around the globe. And in the discussion of the segments, Jim will talk a little bit about the penetration -- increased penetration and resulting share gains that we're experiencing in that business.", "Security, globally, organic revenue was down 1% due primarily to the Convergent Security Solutions volume declines in Europe, and that was partially offset by organic growth in both our Commercial Hardware and Access Technologies, our automatic doors business. The bright spot is orders increased significantly in both North America and Europe as the quarter wound down. In volume, Niscayah synergies and platform growth investments are expected to lead to margin recovery for Security in the second half. More about that at the end of our brief presentation from Don when he discusses the outlook. But as a consequence, we are maintaining full year guidance as our increased organic growth expectations we expect to offset the significant headwinds that we are facing from foreign exchange in selected markets.", "Looking briefly at the sources of growth. Sequentially, volume, as mentioned, was up 6%; price was down 1%, leading to, on a global basis, 5% organic growth. Acquisitions, primarily Infastech, added 7%. In the quarter, the impact of FX was flat, leading to our up 12% revenue growth versus up 3% in the same period a year ago.", "In the regions, we were quite encouraged. U.S., in total, up 6%; Europe, 2%; emerging markets, 12%; and the rest of the world, the details of which are in the appendix, was primarily Canada and Japan were down low-single digits, while Australia, New Zealand were flat. The rest of the world was about down 2% as a combined group of countries, for the total of 5% in terms of organic growth.", "So the momentum from our growth initiatives continues to build. But let me talk about those for just a second before we get into the segments. We have hired 450 people, feet on the street, primarily sales folks, primarily in emerging markets, to drive the growth that we've talked to you about on our last 2 or 3 calls. We've also completed the acquisition of GQ, the #3 Chinese power tool company and a significant move for us in that it allows us to expand our mid price point footprint in the Asian market in particular, emerging markets in general.", "And we remain on track to our 3-year commitment from our project leapfrog [ph], our organic growth initiative, for $850 million of incremental revenue and $200 million of incremental operating margin. Again, as we've highlighted, this is something that we track rigorously, regularly, with the same, I'll say, intensity and metrics that we would track a large acquisition integration. So we feel, at this stage, quite comfortable with those numbers.", "Looking at the emerging market and the impact that -- the emerging markets and the impact the growth initiative has had, really, really strong quarter: Russia, up 31%; China, 24%; Southeast Asia, 13%; Middle East, Africa, 15%; Latin America, up 15%. Very, very strong performance. And as a consequence, per the press release, we're now expecting those initiatives to contribute 2 percentage points or 200 basis points of incremental growth for the year versus the 100 basis points which was our previous forecast as these programs begin to gain traction and really put some points on the board.", "Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to quickly walk you through some of the highlights from our 3 segments.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thank you, John. Once again, CDIY had a terrific quarter. Strong execution across the globe, coupled with improving U.S. residential Construction & DIY markets, produced excellent results: revenues of $1.446 billion, up $115 million or 9%; segment profit was $219 million, up $11 million or 5%; and organic growth was 6% in total, with Professional Power Tools up 13%; the Consumer Products Group up 3%; and Hand Tools and Storage up 5%. The operating margin rate was 15.1%, down slightly 50 basis points from a year ago, reflecting strong impact of the growth initiatives, as well as strong promotional activity in the U.S.", "Professional Power Tools benefited, from a growth perspective, from those promotions, as well as new product introductions and emerging market gains. The consumer group benefited from outdoor growth, which was a turnaround from the first quarter, when we had some weather issues, a global steam product introduction and strength in the emerging markets. And Hand Tools and Storage gain -- experienced gains from the Black & Decker revenue synergies specifically associated with DeWalt and the continued rollout of last year's program at Stafta [ph], as well as a major U.S. home center. In addition, this quarter, we began a rollout of DeWalt mechanics tools at a major U.S. retailer. They accounted for most of the growth in the Hand Tools and Storage. And in total, as we look at CDIY, we conclude this business is really in great shape as its U.S. market is shoring up nicely while Europe has stabilized and the growth initiatives continue to drive emerging market gains despite somewhat slower markets there.", "Turning to Industrial. They also had a solid quarter all around, with surging organic growth the new story. Revenues were up 28% or $178 million, aided by Infastech, which added 21 points, and 8% organic growth in total. Segment profit was $117 million, up $22 million or 25%. And organic growth was a great story across the businesses with IAR up 4%; Engineered Fastening, up 9%; and Infrastructure, up 22%. The operating margin rate was down slightly, 50 basis points, reflecting the growth investments and a slight mix down from Infastech.", "In Engineered Fastening, the automotive segment of Engineered Fastening was up 15%, and that outpaced a plus 1% global light vehicle production. And the Infastech integration is on track, and in fact, their pro forma organic growth was 9% as well. Industrial & Automotive Repair North America was up 2%, with Mac Tools' strength offsetting a very weak government business, and the growth initiatives gaining traction, particularly in the emerging markets and MRO vending. And then the Infrastructure business, which was up 22%, was really, really powered by the oil and gas business or CRC-Evans, which was up over 40% organically, and that was somewhat offset by weakness in the scrap steel market, which affected our hydraulics tools business negatively.", "The story at oil and gas was the recovery of the North American onshore market, which, as you know, for a year or 2 has been going in the opposite direction for us, and it really, really turned around. And we had seen that coming. In addition to that, we had strong offshore growth in connection with our organic growth initiative. So surging growth in this segment driven by the growth initiatives and Engineered Fastening, performance, all in all, a great story which we expect to continue into the second half.", "Now moving to Security. It was a mixed picture, with organic growth in mechanical offset by continued Europe weakness, resulting in minus 1% organic growth overall and some margin compression. Revenues were $611 million, up $10 million or 2%. Segment profit was down $18 million or 23% to $61 million. And the organic growth story in North America for CSS was modestly positive at plus 1%, Europe was down 5% for CSS and mechanical was up 4%.", "I think the bright spot, as John said, and it's very encouraging for CSS was that the second quarter order rates grew in North America and Europe by 7% and 11%, respectively, as its double-digit order growth in the second quarter in Europe and the backlog, in both cases, grew significantly. And that's a direct result of the organic growth initiatives and the Niscayah integration success that is taking place. In mechanical, organic revenue was up 4% on commercial lock, direct to distributor model successes and increased automatic door installation activity at selected retailers. And I will say there's a wave of new product introduction coming in the second half for the mechanical business, which, when coupled with the distribution change and the move to independent distribution, should result in some very, very strong earnings and revenue growth.", "So overall, the 300-basis-point margin decline in Security was driven by a number of factors: the growth investments, some field cost inefficiency in preparation for increased growth in the second half, the European volume headwinds and the impact of -- the temporary impact of the distributor model shift in the mechanical business. And that basically results from still having the same or similar costs to serve that we had when we had a direct model but taking a slightly lower gross margin in order to run through the distributor channel. And in the second half, you'll see the cost to serve come down as the costs get taken out of the cost structure, and then MAS will restore its profitability to more historical levels.", "So all the headwinds I just discussed are temporary in nature, and we expect the margin rates to bounce back nicely in the second half. You'll have significant benefits relating to the organic growth investments in both vertical market initiatives and the emerging markets. We will convert the growing order backlog, which will drive field efficiency, as well as revenue growth. We'll complete the mechanical model -- go-to-market model transition. The volume will pick up. Some redundant costs will come out related to the cost to serve that I mentioned and -- as we have now fully shifted to the new indirect distribution model.", "And then there will be an increased level of Niscayah synergies as they get executed, and you'll recall that, last quarter, we upgraded our estimate from $35 million to $50 million for Niscayah synergies for the year. Most of that impact will be felt in the second half. So these actions will drive operating margin to the mid-teens levels in the second half '13. The growth is coming, and we feel very bullish about the second half for Security, as you can see. And at that point, all 3 of our segments will be driving organic growth, earnings growth and margin expansion.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little bit of time and talk about working capital on Page 10. Our working capital turns improved from the prior year by approximately 0.3 turn and sequentially from the first quarter by over 1 turn, which allowed us to drive a significant cash flow benefit in the second quarter, which I'll touch on in a few minutes.", "We're very focused on how the Stanley Fulfillment System continues to evolve and get implemented throughout our company. We continue to see modest improvements in both accounts receivable and accounts payable as we focus on the back-office operations and have more efficiencies with our vendors and our customers to drive working capital benefits.", "But the more significant improvement continues to be the focus on inventory, as our inventory days went from 78 days in the second quarter of 2012 down to 72 days here in the second quarter of 2013. In that scenario that we've been focused on significantly for the last year or 2, and we'll continue to be focused on it as we believe there's more efficiency to be gained in inventory throughout our entire manufacturing and supply chain. The impacts of the Stanley Fulfillment System continue to be seen across our company, and our working capital continues to become more efficient. The expectation for year-end 2013 is that we believe we can achieve 8 working capital turns as we continue on our path towards 10 working capital turns by 2016 or 2017.", "So let's move to free cash flow on the next page. Free cash flow, as I mentioned, was very strong in the second quarter as we achieved a 117% conversion rate, i.e., free cash flow as a percentage of net income. This is obviously before special charges, but the result is really seen by strong earnings performance as well as the strong working capital performance that allows us to drive that type of conversion rate in our company.", "A couple of items to mention on the free cash flow statement. The first of which is that if you look at the line called other/restructuring, we had some timing issues in the second quarter, which caused a bit of a negative drag. And that has to do with such things as pension payments, which occurred in the second quarter of this year and occurred in different quarters in the prior year, simply a timing issue that we believe neutralizes itself by the end of the year.", "The other area to notice on the free cash flow statement is the cash outflow associated with our working capital through the first 6 months. You can see it's quite significant. However, it is in line with historical trends. And as many of you know who follow our company, we tend to see a very positive inflow of cash from working capital as the year progresses, and in particular as we get into the fourth quarter, given the seasonality of many of our significant businesses. And as we achieve our 8 working capital turns by the end of the year, we will see that number turn to a significant positive inflow.", "As a result, although our year-to-date free cash flow trails prior year at this point in time, we believe $1 billion of free cash flow is achievable due to the expected strong second half earnings, which I'll touch on in a few minutes, combined with working capital turns improving to 8 turns and then some of these timing issues beginning to neutralize themselves by the end of the year.", "So with that, I'd like to spend a few minutes and talk about our guidance. We are reiterating our 2013 outlook today. We expect our EPS to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.65. This will be 16% to 21% EPS growth versus 2012. The vast majority of our guidance items have remained unchanged since April, but there's 2 items of significance that we want to point out that has changed. The first of which is that we're raising our organic revenue guidance from 2% to 3% in our prior guidance up to 4% to 5% growth versus 2012. This is going to drive approximately $0.20 accretion of EPS versus the prior guidance that was provided.", "Let me give you a little more information and detail on that particular category. If you break it down into core organic growth versus the growth initiatives, we expect the core growth to now be 2% to 3%, which will contribute $0.30 to $0.45 of EPS. That's up from our prior expectation of 1% to 2% organic growth. Additionally, as John mentioned, we believe organic growth initiatives will now yield 2 points of growth versus the previously communicated 1%. However, it still will be slightly dilutive for the year. It will be about 10% dilution versus our prior guidance of $0.15 as we continue to leverage to the effects of the investments during the year, and by the end of the year begin to see some accretion occur related to these growth investments.", "The second offsetting item that is offsetting this positive impact is we are seeing headwinds related to foreign currency, and we expect that to be approximately $0.20 of EPS to the negative in the second half of the year. Several countries have moved negatively versus the U.S. dollar, where we have a significant presence, such as Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Australia, Mexico and India. We continue to monitor that and are focused on what types of actions we can take to offset that impact, such as areas as customer pricing actions, et cetera. But it clearly appears to be a headwind of significance in the back half of the year. The net effect of this is obviously neutral and allows us to reiterate our guidance range as previously communicated.", "One other factor I'd like to mention is really the timing of the third quarter versus the fourth quarter associated with EPS. We anticipate the third quarter to approximate 42% of our second half EPS. This is slightly lower than the 46% to 47% historical norm that you see looking out the last 4 or 5 years. It's really being driven by 2 things: it's the expected sequential second half Security profitability improvements that Jim touched on as we see continued sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3 and then more sequential improvement from Q3 to Q4 related to profitability, as well as that particular segment turning to a revenue growth organically versus a slight revenue decline in the first half.", "The second area is similar to what we discussed in April, is that we continue to see the acceleration and the benefits of our organic growth initiatives throughout the year and the investments weighing that down in the first half, beginning to turn neutral in the third quarter and slightly accretive in the fourth quarter. Those timing factors are resulting in this dynamic that I've just described.", "The last thing I'd like to touch on on guidance is just a little bit of view on these segments. On the CDIY side, our expectation is that we will see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the entire year, with continued strength similar to what we saw in the second quarter. The operating margin rate will increase year-over-year as we see the benefits of cost synergies. We do expect a slightly negative effect of the growth investments impacting the operating margin rate and offsetting some of the incremental profit or leverage that we see from the volume.", "In the Security segment, low-single-digit organic growth is expected, as Jim touched on. We believe, based on the order trends and the backlog that's been created here in the first half of the year, that the North American business will begin to show more significant growth beyond current levels. However, that will be slightly offset by a continued low-single-digit decline in Europe, as that European environment continues to be a difficult environment, in particular, for our Security business. The operating margin rate will decrease year-over-year, primarily due to the factors that impacted us here in the first half, but by the end of the year, the business will be back to historical levels in the second half in the mid-teens, as Jim discussed.", "The Industrial business will see mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for 2013, and the operating margin will decrease slightly due really primarily to the effects of the lower-than-line-average Infastech margins as they're in the early stages of integration, as well as the impact of the growth investments. This allows us to reiterate our guidance of $5.40 to $5.65, as well as our free cash flow guidance of approximately $1 billion.", "So to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we believe we've made excellent progress with the growth initiatives. We're seeing sequential improvement; it is being realized, which allows us to raise our guidance estimate in this particular area. The CDIY business, as Jim touched on, is really performing very well, driving significant organic growth through new product introduction, market share gains and solid returns in the emerging markets, primarily from our growth initiatives. Industrial delivering strong organic growth as well, and the Infastech integration continues to progress on track.", "We're focused on our Security business continuing to improve and showing more significant returns in the back half of the year as we drive that backlog that we touched on, the benefits from the growth initiatives, continue the integration of Niscayah to really ensure that our second half performance gets closer to historical levels for this particular segment. The company remains focused on driving organic growth and really trying to maximize the synergies across all our businesses that are being impacted by integration today, as well as we're focused on allocating capital that really provides excellent returns for our shareholders in the midterm, as well as the long term.", "That concludes the presentation portion of the call. We'll turn it over to Q&A.", "Gregory Waybright", "Great. Thanks, Don. Christine, we can now open the call to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jason Feldman of UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So nice to see, obviously, that the organic growth initiatives are gaining momentum more quickly, I guess, than expected. How do you think about that in relation to kind of the 3-year targets that you'd laid out, the $850 million contribution. Is this kind of a pull forward and then maybe the incremental pick up in the other years won't be quite as high, we're just getting it sooner? Or is it that the opportunity is really larger than you originally thought?", "John F. Lundgren", "Jason, it's John. Per my comments early in the presentation, at this stage, it is the former of your 2 hypotheses, specifically, a pull forward. It's very early days, and as we quantify the entire basket of synergies, we're encouraged we're ahead, as opposed to behind schedule. That being said, we just don't have enough information to suggest that that's a larger pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Do -- rest assured, a year from now, we think that's the case, as we did with Black & Decker synergies. When we realized it was more than just a pull forward on the cost synergies. We raised our estimate, raised the guidance. Far, far too early to do that because we've got nothing to tell if the totality of these programs is any greater than what we initially thought about.", "James M. Loree", "And this is Jim. I would just add to that, that when we set forth this initiative, the idea was to change the culture of the company so it could be capable of generating 4% to 6% organic growth annually. And it was a 3-year commitment that we made, and it was a finite commitment. However, we also indicated that we were hopeful that we would be able to direct the company in a way that would yield a 4% to 6% minimum growth rate on an ongoing basis regardless of the economic environment, and this is where I think this progress that we've made is very encouraging because it seems like while -- even if this is just an acceleration, when we get to 3 years from now, there'll be more acceleration. So the point is that it's a very, very encouraging indication that this company is capable of driving growth while remaining financially disciplined and driving margins as well. So we're excited about the progress. Obviously, not going to commit anything more on a 3-year basis at this point, but it is a very, very positive start.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question on Security with the European order growth in the quarter. That was a very strong number and just wanted to get some additional color on what you saw in the quarter. I imagine the construction markets over there are not great, so how much of this was just growth with existing customers, new products, market share gains? Any color along those lines would be helpful.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, all of the above. Jim will give you as much detail as we're comfortable giving you, Rich, at this stage.", "James M. Loree", "It's early days in Niscayah, and when we tackled this acquisition, we learned that Niscayah really didn't have a very robust sales-generation capability. And in fact, it was sort of a symbiotic relationship between Securitas and Niscayah in the sense that Securitas, being primarily more focused on guarding, often would have customers that it would then hand off to Niscayah as sort of a freebie or maybe for a commission or that type of thing. Well, as Securitas and we have gone our separate ways post the acquisition, we found out that we really needed to build -- not rebuild but build sales-generation capability. And I would say that's the single most important factor going on here, is that we've been hiring a lot of sales reps and they've begun to produce orders, which is now, hopefully, going to be translated into sales at some point, and that's encouraging. But it's really that dynamic that is going on. And so while, for the first year, 1.5 years or so, we were experiencing negative growth that I would attribute largely to the economy, it was also due to the fact that we no longer had the sales handoffs from Securitas, and now we have begun to rebuild our own sales force. I'd say that's the single biggest item there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.", "Michael Sang - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. I was hoping to dig more into pricing. I was wondering if you could comment briefly on the price environment overall. And then specifically on -- in the U.S., in CDIY, where -- I guess just in CDIY, where you, I guess, lost 2 points from pricing this quarter. And then, separately, on Security side, whether the increase in orders was due to -- based on given pricing.", "Donald Allan", "Mike, it's Don. I'll give you a little bit more color on that topic in particular. On CDIY, in the second quarter, we did have a fair amount of promotional activity, which was planned and expected, and so that's driving a little bit of that price impact. It's probably unusually high compared to previous quarters and future quarters because of that factor. The other thing to keep in mind, and we all know this over the long term, is that that pricing number is more of an accounting number. It doesn't necessarily capture the true effect of pricing impacts across the board. As we roll out new products at different price points, that price increase versus a previous product that it's replacing does not get captured in that line. So we know that in that particular business it's not exactly a full encompassing view. So those 2 factors together really are driving that impact. So I don't view it as a significant trend or change in the business. I think it's more related to certain promotional activities that we did in the second quarter that were expected and planned. In the Security side of our company, Security is an area that pricing -- it is a price-sensitive business, but you really drive value through the differentiation of service, as well as the differentiation of bundling the different products that you have and trying to install and enhance the solution to our customers. And that's how you really drive positive price value. I think, over the long term, it's a business that you can drive positive price, and we have demonstrated this in this particular business over the past several years, that it is a business that allows that type of pricing situation. The current market in Security is there's nothing unusual happening around pricing specifically. I think it's pretty much in line with typical trends, and nothing has shifted or no dynamic that's happening that's unusual at this stage.", "John F. Lundgren", "Well, in fact, a couple of quarters ago, we indicated that we thought that maybe we've been getting a little more aggressive on pricing, taking some business that we perhaps, in retrospect, would not have wanted to take in the CSS North America business. And so Don and I have both spent a fair amount of time with the Security team, going through their pricing, their price discipline, going through their backlog and looking at the profitability of the backlog. And I can tell you that it is improving, and the new business, largely being driven by the vertical market initiative and from the organic growth initiative, the vertical market initiative is where we have put together the bundles and the value propositions that Don is referring to. And in fact, what we're finding out in a lot of these orders in the order book in general from the vertical market initiative is that the gross margins are coming in at somewhat above line average. And that is where we want it to be because we think the value that we generate in these verticals is very high and therefore, we should get paid for it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Jim, the oil and gas strength, I understand it's off of a relatively small base. I know -- I think you have also had some organizational changes within your CRC business, but it just -- the growth seems to be a real outlier, particularly based on what, I guess, broad trends would be in the line pipe industry in the U.S. How sustainable are those growth rates? And how should we be looking at that going forward?", "James M. Loree", "Yes, I mean, we've had some tough experience in onshore North America over the last few years, which have made the comps relatively easy. So I do think we have a couple of easy comps in front of us. However, I wouldn't be looking for plus 40% every quarter. That said, the pipeline construction activity in North America is really almost back at the level it was about 4 years ago when it peaked, and we can see that. We've been talking for a couple of quarters about the strengthening market. But it takes -- it took a couple of quarters for us to actually go from doing the proposals and so forth to actually doing the work, which is when we are able to recognize the revenue. So we see -- this is a long-cycle business. We have good visibility forward in North America onshore, and we see a continued strong market, not greater than 40% growth, but certainly very robust. And as far as the offshore business goes, which is the other half of the puzzle, that is extremely strong worldwide, and we expect that to continue as well. So this should be a good growth driver for us for several quarters, if not years to come.", "John F. Lundgren", "Sam, let me just add to that because the format won't allow a follow-up. You'll recall, when we bought this business about 3 years ago, it's new in terms of the business model, relatively new to Stanley Black & Decker. And to Jim's point, these are generally very large orders. They're very lumpy, and it's a huge difference on a $300 million revenue base if something comes in in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So even at the beginning of our ownership of this company, it's a very lumpy business. It may be the best way to describe it. And I think for your purposes and objectives and ours as well, looking at rolling 12 months or rolling 8 quarters, looking at things that way, as opposed to just the much more classic EP-wise [ph] just because of seasonality and things of that nature, is a better way to look at this business. And that's how Don's team looks at it as we try to get a better grip on it and how best to forecast. At the end of the day, though, it's going to be lumpy. If you do $320 million in a year, it's not going to be $80 million a quarter. It's going to be $60 million 1 quarter and $100 million the next, and that's just something we've learned to live with with this business. And your question is very fair, but just recognize that's the dynamic, I would say, unique to the oil and gas business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Wood of Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "Impressive growth with your growth initiatives. I'm curious, at the early stages, what you're seeing in terms of the competitor responses from the market share gains that you're getting in these countries.", "Donald Allan", "Well, we're not seeing much yet. Power tools in the emerging markets are very hotly contested by our biggest competitors anyway. So in some ways, I would argue that we're a little bit later to the game than some of them. However, we haven't really seen any major competitive response. I think it's really too early for that, and there were a lot people betting against whether these initiatives would even be successful, and I suspect that competitive reaction will come once the success has been institutionalized.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, Mike. It would be na\u00efve for us to think -- for we, Stanley Black & Decker, to think that as the share gains start to register -- remember, we're seeing them first in our shipments and in the POS. Competitors will see them 3 to 6 months later as they evaluate our performance versus theirs and others. It would be -- it would simply be na\u00efve and irresponsible of us not to expect reaction because no one relinquishes share willingly. Hey, this is the power tools business. It's -- the tools business in general and the power tools business in particular. We've been in it for 100 years, and that would be our expectation.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Stephen Kim of Barclays.", "John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's actually John filling in for Steve today. Just wanted to get a bit more granularity on the FX headwind outlook. It seems like the currencies you cited are pretty contained for like 25% of sales. So I thought it was a little big 2% -- $0.20 just in the back half of the year. So what is your outlook for the back half in those currencies?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, well, we basically have taken the rates that -- of about a week, 1.5 weeks ago or so and are using them as, really, our forecast for the back half of the year. We don't tend to try to forecast trending, whether they're going to go up or down. As far as the magnitude of the number, you have to remember that, in particular, Brazil and Canada and Australia are pretty sizable businesses for us and make up a significant amount of revenue. The other thing to factor in is it's not just translational FX, it's transactional FX, which means we're shipping products into those countries, in many cases, from the United States or European markets, and so the cross-currency exchange has a negative impact as a result.", "John F. Lundgren", "Well, I think it's about 50-50.", "Donald Allan", "It ends up being about 50-50, exactly, John. So those are really the main drivers. But the transactional piece is why it ends up being bigger than anticipated. Now part of that is hedge, but we don't hedge 100% of those types of activities because of the cost associated with hedging.", "James M. Loree", "And the Latin American moves were very, very sudden and sharp. They're big moves.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, John, you referenced 25%. That's roughly the percentage of our business in Western Europe. And obviously, the pound sterling and euro is all that matters to us there. 50% of our business is outside the U.S., and there are very few currencies in the back half of the year strengthening relative to the dollar. So I think Don gave you some pretty good granularity there. And hopefully, that will help understand and validate the magnitude of the headwind.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.", "William Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Can you talk about the trends in Latin America, especially in Brazil as it relates to the consumer? There were some challenges in 1Q. So just wondering what type of impact you would expect to your organic sales growth initiatives if consumer trends and sort of the political environments in some of these countries deteriorate from current levels.", "John F. Lundgren", "Rank has its privileges so I'm going to delegate that to Jim because if he can predict what's going to happen in Brazil quarter-to-quarter, he's a better man than I. But we did have -- your point is very well taken, in that we really were stunned by the difficulty in Brazil in the first quarter. It was a lot more friendly market in the second quarter, but Jim's been close to that. Give it a whack, Jim.", "James M. Loree", "Brazil consumer market, definitely a little slower than it has been. However, all these markets in Latin America are just exceptionally volatile, and they bounce around from the markets themselves and the demand bounces around from quarter-to-quarter and then the currencies bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, so your pricing positioning in the market changes dramatically over time. And in addition to that, there are some countries that have major political, structural processes that drive further inefficiencies in the demand profile and supply and demand. So it's hard to predict anything in Latin America other than just go there and execute as hard and as fast as you can. And that's where we're adding salespeople, bringing new products that are more appropriately designed for the mid price point segment and so forth, to enable us to achieve growth rates that are definitely above market growth rates. And that's what we're -- what we've been doing in Latin America for a long time because that's where we've -- really, this formula that we're now applying to all the emerging markets has been applied for the last 10 years by the management team that is now running the overall emerging markets initiative. And that's -- they're finding actually that some of these other markets around the world are more stable than Latin America and therefore, sometimes easier to penetrate than perhaps Latin America.", "John F. Lundgren", "Just to follow up, Jim made a very important point. And I just -- and it's probably not news to most people, but unlike several North American-based or U.S. multinationals operating in foreign markets, particularly Latin America, I think it's really important to point out our entire emerging markets group in general and the Latin American group in particular is staffed by foreign nationals who have grown up in, lived in those markets that are well-tenured executives within our company. And this isn't about me. I spent half of my business career living and working abroad. And the value added by people who understand our company and our company's culture, values, codes of conduct, everything else, at the same time, understand the markets, the people, the culture, quite frankly, are quite accustomed to dealing with day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month volatility and frustrations that Jim, I think, very, very adequately described is a huge advantage. So that's just a point that I thought worth making on our emerging markets team, it's -- they are tenured professionals with local experience that we're leveraging across the world. And I actually -- I truly believe it's a competitive advantage, and I just wanted to make that point.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Lisnic of Robert Baird.", "Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. You talked about how the order growth accelerated in CSS Europe, but North America also accelerated quite a bit. So could you talk a little bit about what you saw there?", "James M. Loree", "Yes. I was referring earlier to these vertical market initiatives and they're part of the corporate organic growth initiative that we funded especially and announced a while ago, last July. And we've been working on these growth initiatives in Security, in the vertical markets for about a year now. And what they involve is taking certain markets such as financial services, education, K-12 and secondary education separately, health care, retail and so forth and putting together solutions for the customers using some of the proprietary technology that we have acquired over time, such as our RTLS technology, real-time locating and sensing technology, that would be the AeroScout -- or excuse me, the iLock technology, which is iris identification, and putting together solutions that are specifically designed for applications within these vertical markets. So for example, in the K-12 environment, having the ability to lock down the school using this type of technology or to identify potential intruders, to integrate the mechanical locking systems with electromechanical locking systems and electronic systems, all these types of things are relevant to the end customers. And I could -- we have a demonstration center in Indianapolis, where we have all these different solutions kind of identified, and we bring customers in and so on. And the sales force has now been organized so that we have a segment of the sales force that's specialized to each one of these verticals, and that's what's gaining momentum right now. And in addition to, I'd say, just decent execution in the rest of the market, that's what's providing the extra oomph for the growth. And we expect -- we've seen, on a monthly basis, that order rate is increasing on a sequential basis and really beginning to grow like a wave of new business. And some of it is medium-cycle, long-cycle business, so it takes a while. But we will see that come to fruition in the second half in North America. And in Europe, we think, to some extent, not as much because the vertical market solutions that I'm talking about are primarily, I'd say, almost exclusively focused on the North American markets right now. We're still in the process of integrating Niscayah. When we get to the point that the Niscayah organization is ready in Europe, these solutions are exportable to Europe, and we will do that at that time. So they will provide future growth in Europe. None of that's really baked in to any of the long-term guidance that we've given. However, that's sort of the reason that you start to see North America order rates pick up in Security.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Question for you on CDIY, nice acceleration of growth in 2Q versus 1Q. Just wondering if you can dig in a little bit more to the 2Q growth. You talked about promotions and some new products, and I'm assuming some of the outdoor move from 1Q to 2Q. So wonder if you can break up the 6% and some of the components of that and then how you think about the core and the benefit from some of the efforts in the second half for the 5% or better growth you're talking about in the second half.", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure, Eric. Everything you said, Eric, is correct in terms of outdoor moves, promotions. You'll recall Jim mentioned some major mechanics tools and hand tools moves, but Don can give you even a little more granularity to the extent we're comfortable.", "Donald Allan", "Sure. As Jim touched on, in the second quarter, the growth was significant really in almost all the areas of the business, both geographically and across what we call the SBUs. And there was a promotional aspect in the second quarter, where, in the prior year, that occurred in the first quarter, so that was a factor. We did have the shift of the outdoor season into q -- from Q1 to Q2, and that'll continue to shift into Q3 as the season ends in a month -- roughly in a month or so. So those are all factors. But the reality is what you see within this business is that the new product introductions that they keep rolling out continue to drive organic growth and gain share. The emerging market growth, through the organic growth initiatives, are accelerating to a mid-teens growth or 15% in emerging markets in the second quarter that we expect to continue into the back half. And then we don't talk a lot about Europe, but frankly, the European performance was very strong for them, where they had a relatively flat performance in a very difficult market. And that's allowing us to demonstrate all the other growth that we're seeing and have it flow through across the entire global business of CDIY. And that European flat performance is really because of share gain, as well as some new product introductions that help facilitate that, primarily in the U.K. and in the Nordic regions. So all those factors together are the result of what happened in the second quarter, as Jim articulated. But the reality is as we see those trends continuing in the back half, and the growth that they experienced of roughly 6% is expected to continue in the back half of the year because of all the factors I just mentioned.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Liam Burke of Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "You had a very, very strong quarter on industrial, in particular IAR. Could you give us a little color on where in emerging markets you're gaining traction? That seems to be in addition to the strength of the Mac business, an area that's done pretty well.", "John F. Lundgren", "Sure. We had 4% growth in IAR, and we had double-digit growth in the emerging markets. So that was a good -- one of the big forces behind the growth, as you point out. I think, well, first of all, the answer to your question is very simply that the emerging market growth initiative is what's driving that double-digit growth in the emerging markets. But more specifically, we're very fortunate because we are the only tool company that has both Construction & DIY strength in the emerging markets, as well as Industrial & Automotive Repair access to those markets, channel access. So the way we're going about this is, as opposed to coming at it from one perspective or the other, we're coming at it -- we've joined forces internally between our Construction & DIY business and our IAR business. And that has actually given us much better access to, I think, the emerging of the IAR channels than we otherwise would have because what happens in the -- many of these emerging markets is that the channels are very blurred in between Construction & DIY and Industrial. You don't have -- in many, many of these markets, you don't have the highly developed channels that distinguish between construction and then large retail -- I mean, construction, 2-step large retail, industrial channel, automotive repair channel. You don't have that in the emerging markets. You have much more chaotic channels, much less well-developed channels. And our ability to come at it from a joint perspective and cooperate internally between our Construction & DIY business and our IAR business, I think, gives us the ability to drive that growth the way I just described.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dennis McGill of Zelman and Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "I think this question maybe is for Jim. But is there a way to take the backlog, both across electronic and mechanical, and just think about Security backlog overall and have one number as far as what you're entering third quarter with as far as the growth year-over-year? And then kind of within that, Jim, is there a way to separate out what you're seeing market-wise on the Security -- or nonresidential side from what your internal initiatives are? Are there signs, in your opinion, that you're starting to see the market actually pick up and get into a cyclical recovery?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, Dennis, this is John. Jim will take it. But just one point, and we've made this many times, but I think it's important to make it again on backlog. Whether it's one number or 2, what's more important is when it's executable or convertible. As we've increased our sophistication with architectural specifiers and things of that nature, we could have an order in the system that can't be executed until 12 to 15 months from now because, if you think about new construction, we're at the very end of the process. I mean, as the building is being finished, it's when wires are being laid or our systems are being put in. So whether you have one number or 2, it's not possible for us, and as a consequence, I guarantee it's not possible for you, to take that and have it be of much value to you in terms of the next quarter or quarter after that. But I just think it's important to make that point, but Jim can give you just a little more detail.", "James M. Loree", "I mean, I would only make 2 points, and that is definitely one of them, which is that the mechanical part of the business and frankly, the electronic are both at the tail end of the process. The second one is that, without question, there is an increase in the level of non-resi construction activity and increasing backlog related to that in the Security business. I mean, that is a piece of the puzzle. It's a much bigger piece of the puzzle in the mechanical business than it is in the electronic business. But it is, in fact, true that the non-resi construction market is picking up steam and therefore, affecting both these businesses.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Oppenheim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was wondering, John, I guess you talked in the past a lot about the goals of getting to 20% in terms of emerging market exposure. Now you're getting awfully close to that. Given the different growth rates in some of the markets, so this may be -- it's always a moving target. As you think about this, where do you now think of it in terms of what your goal would be for emerging market exposure?", "John F. Lundgren", "I don't know if you -- it doesn't matter if you directed it to me or Don. Our goals are unchanged. And as we would have a tendency to do, when and if it looks like we're going to achieve it and it's adding value to our shareholders, we'll raise that bar. But your point is correct. The combination of divestiture of HHI, acquisition of Infastech and good growth, we've gone from 10% or 11% up to 16% or 17%, depending on the quarter on an annual basis. We closed the year at about 16%. So we're getting there quickly. As we start to approach it, that 20% could well become 25%, if those markets remain as profitable as they are now. It's incredibly important not just to grow but to grow profitably. And as Don and Jim have pointed out in various conversations, these markets are at or above line average in many cases, which is not the case for a lot of businesses. So 20% could well become 25%, but let's get 20% in the bank before we change that goal. So what we talked to you and the investment community about in May, those goals are all unchanged.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Just on the Security business, encouraging to see the order book building. But wonder if you could just help us by elaborating on that 310-basis-point margin decline. And you'd parsed out 4 different drivers in your presentation, Jim, and I was just wondering if I could get you to elaborate on that and maybe quantify the contribution to that 310 basis points.", "James M. Loree", "I mean, there's not much more I can elaborate other than to say that if you take those 4 items, they really do account for the vast majority of the 300 basis points. And they're all significant, so I could say they're roughly 25% a piece or whatever. That's directionally accurate but...", "Donald Allan", "They're all within 20% to 30%.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, they're all within 20% to 30%.", "Donald Allan", "Or each one is within 10% to 30%, I should say.", "Gregory Waybright", "Christine, I believe that's all the time we have for questions, and we'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning. I know certain of you weren't able to ask a question. Please give me a call after the call, and we'll be able to handle and accommodate any questions you have.

My name is Dawn, and I will be the operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Waybright, Vice President of Investor and Government Relations. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Gregory Waybright", "Thank you, Dawn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR portion of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 p.m. today. This replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's 2013 third quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And please feel free to call me with any follow-up questions after today's call.", "Finally, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Just to touch on some of the highlights of the third quarter. Revenues did increase 10%, of which 4% was organic growth. The rest was the addition of Infastech, and it was partially offset by currency. Diluted EPS of $1.39, up 14% versus 3Q '12. Diluted GAAP EPS, including charges, were $1.07.", "Our growth initiatives that we've talked about the last couple of quarters really continue to deliver some strong results. They contributed about 200 basis points or 2 percentage points of the growth. Both CDIY and our Industrial segments achieved some compelling top lines. Specifically, CDIY achieved organic growth of 5% at a 15% OM rate. And within our Industrial segment, Oil & Gas delivered another really strong quarter of organic growth of 32%. In Security growth, both the growth rate and the margin improved sequentially. Globally, organic growth was 1% versus prior year, driven primarily by our growth investments in the North American verticals and emerging markets, and the OM rate within Security improved 170 basis points sequentially to 12.2%, so good progress.", "And as a consequence, we see no changes to our expectations for the long-term financial prospects for Security, and we believe the strategy and the programs that are in place to deliver our long-term financial objectives will get where they need to be. But we are revising our full year 2013 guidance -- EPS guidance to a range of $4.90 to $5, as a result -- primarily as a result of the slower margin recovery within Security, weakening in emerging markets and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown on near-term organic growth. So full year EPS, $4.90 to $5 and resulting free cash flow at approximately $800 million. And a lot more detail on those 2 projections and pieces of guidance from Don later on this morning.", "Let's look briefly at our sources of growth because organic growth remains strong and the momentum is good. In the third quarter, volume was up 5%, bringing it to 3% on a year-to-date basis. Price was down 1%. So organic growth, as previously stated, at 4%. Acquisitions added 7%. Currency detracted by 1%, so a total revenue growth of 10%.", "Looking at the organic growth year-to-date of 3%. Just it's -- where -- third quarter was not too different from year-to-date. We have a slow first quarter, as you'll recall, very robust second quarter and a healthy third quarter, which was right above the midpoint or slightly above the midpoint of our year-to-date performance. So a little bit bumpy but good organic growth on a year-to-date basis, with third quarter falling between first and second quarter. First quarter, as you'll recall, we had very little traction from our organic growth investments, but they're really starting to produce the kinds of result that we have expected.", "Looking at the regions. And there is more detail in the appendix, but I think it's important to point out the U.S., our largest market, was up 3% and is up 3% year-to-date. It's still strong but it's not accelerating. Europe was down 1% in total and was down 1% on a year-to-date basis. As I think all of you know, the macro environment is more stable than it has been, but there's still certainly no tailwind and arguably, a headwind.", "And within Europe, within our businesses, Security was down as, further detailed in our press release, as a combination of organizational changes and moves we're making and the macro environment. CDIY, it continues to gain share, and John Wyatt and the CDIY European team are doing a terrific job driving new distribution and share gains with product innovation and tremendous commercial efforts. Industrial within Europe was down slightly as well in -- pretty much in line with the market.", "Emerging markets remain a bright spot, up 14% in the third quarter, up 8% on a year-to-date basis. Industrial and CDIY posting strong results. And Security was up nicely in emerging markets but it's from quite a small base, but we're making good progress there on our Security business in emerging markets. And the rest of the world was flat. So again, 4% organic growth on the third quarter, 3% on a year-to-date basis.", "Just a quick snapshot, and I'll say some anecdotes on the specific initiatives that we've talked about for the last couple of calls. These initiatives are demonstrating results and within the third quarter, the emerging market expansion continues. We've hired about 300 people, including key country leaders and sales positions. Our distributor expansion is progressing nicely, both in the traditional and industrial channels or with that base, as well as in the modern channels in northeast Asia, where those channels are more established. That all helps us prepare for the mid-price-point product launches, which will come later this year. And the ability to launch those essential mid-priced products in emerging markets has been accelerated by 3 to 6 months through the GQ acquisition that Jim spoke to you about on the last call.", "Finally, the Security verticals are gaining traction. We have order momentum building, and we've had some recent success in our K-12 and Healthcare programs on a global basis, specifically, new access card control systems in 73 schools across the country in the third quarter alone and orders in excess of $1 million at 3 hospitals. Obviously, we don't want to name them without their permission, but just as a demonstration of some meaningful points on the board with some of these initiatives. So as a consequence, we remain on track for our 3-year commitments with the organic growth program.", "And finally, just a quick look inside emerging markets with some real highlights in our tools businesses: Russia, up 32%; China, 27%; Middle East and Africa, 9%; Latin America, 8%; Southeast Asia, 7%, so total emerging market growth -- tools business growth of 13%. And previously, as I said, Security's growing nicely in emerging markets as well but from a very small base.", "Let me turn it over to Jim, who's going to take a deeper dive into some of the segments.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thank you, John. Starting with CDIY, another respectable quarter for CDIY, with 5% organic growth and near 15% operating margin. Revenues were $1.388 billion, up 5%. The operating profit was $207 million versus $204 million last year or up 2%. Profit rate was 14.9% versus 15.5% last year, a 60-basis-point decrease, which was largely attributable to the cost of the organic growth investments totaling 40 basis points of impact.", "Organic growth was solid across virtually every region and every business unit within CDIY. PPT or Professional Power Tools was up 10%, as NPI, emerging market growth, promotions and the recovering U.S. construction market all contributed to the performance. In particular, the brushless XR and the cordless framing nailer, new products, registered significant gains. CPG or consumer products was up 5%, as outdoor continued its strength, while the innovative Matrix power tools gained share in the developed markets and new products in steam and hand vacs performed well in Europe. Emerging markets also contributed significantly to CPG's growth.", "Hand Tools and Storage was up 3% organically, led by continued growth in DeWalt Hand Tools in the U.S. and positive growth in Europe.", "As far as the regions, Europe was up 3%, an especially encouraging performance and their best since the euro crisis began, with share gains in a stabilizing economy and an especially strong performance in the U.K. Emerging markets at plus 10% was strong, but about 5 points of growth short of our expectation, as slowing markets, credit issues, currency volatility and in-channel congestion all took their toll. North America was up 4%, but could easily have been up an additional 2 points or so if inventory cautiousness at certain retailers and independents as a whole had not dampened shipments in September.", "All in all, inventories of the larger retailers are in good shape, with some dispersion across that universe. And POS, in the aggregate, at the large customers remained healthy, so it appears that the consumer demand and construction-related activity have yet to be adversely affected by the U.S. government shutdown. So all in all, CDIY fared reasonably well in the quarter, with somewhat less growth than expected due to the emerging market slowdown and late quarter caution in the U.S. CDIY channels.", "And now moving to Industrial. Industrial, too, had a respectable quarter, with 4% organic growth despite several headwinds and challenges. Operating margin at 14.5% was solid, down 90 basis points versus 3Q '12, driven primarily by organic growth investments and a slight mix down resulting from the addition of Infastech, which remains on track. Revenues were $771 million, up 25%, and operating profit was $112 million, up 18%.", "Infrastructure, once again, was the star of the quarter with 23% organic growth, fueled by a 32% increase, as John mentioned, in Oil & Gas. Organic revenues and a high-margin onshore automatic welding activity drove the revenue growth in both the U.S. and the rest of the world.", "Industrial & Auto Repair delivered 2% growth in the face of several headwinds, including a virtual no-show for a normal 3Q U.S. government spending, as well as Europe being down in the mid-single digits as SAP was implemented there and their major industry trade show will occur in the fourth quarter this year versus the third quarter of last year. Without these 2 discontinuities, IAR Europe would have been modestly positive. Mac Tools grew in the high-single digits, providing some offset. However, IAR's positive growth can be traced to the organic growth initiatives, with emerging markets up 13% and smart tools and storage collectively contributing about 3 points of growth.", "Engineered Fastening had what appeared to be an uncharacteristically weak organic growth performance, being flat. However, underlying that story was a very difficult equipment sales comp from last year's third quarter, which resulted in equipment sales down 23%, and that was offset by fasteners up a more normal 6% organically, about 2x global light vehicle production. So the story for Industrial this quarter was a solid performance in the face of several material, but mostly temporary, headwinds.", "And now I will focus on Security for a few minutes. Security is one of the drivers behind the recalibration of our outlook, with a general theme of progress but not at the pace that was expected. However, there is a definite distinction between the North America/emerging markets piece and Security Europe, with the former showing good growth and OM rates nearing but not at normalized levels and the latter taking more time to achieve desired growth and thus, profitability levels. I will delve into each one of these stories, but first, a quick overview of the segment.", "Revenues were $600 million, up 3%. Organic sales were up 1%. Operating profit was $73 million, down 22%, and the OM rate was 12.2% versus 16% a year ago, but, importantly, up sequentially from 10.5% in 2Q. And this represents 170-basis-point improvement, which is moving in the right direction but just not at a fast-enough pace.", "Now when we turn to the 2 pieces, starting with North America, you begin to see a reasonably positive story, with the business returning to a healthier state. And there, you can see 4% organic growth in North America/emerging markets and sequential rate improvement of 180 basis points from 13.3% to 15.1%. And without the investment in the growth initiatives or adjusting for that, the operating margin rate would have been in the mid-16s. So the organic growth, pretty positive story there, really resulting from several factors, some of which John touched on: the vertical market initiative definitely gaining traction, particularly in health care, education, also, in financial services. The automatic doors business was robust, with mid-single-digit growth. We had strong product introductions across the businesses, had a really outstanding ASIS show, which is the industry show in Chicago in September, where we showcased new products across the businesses. They were very well received by our customers, as well as our vertical solutions.", "And as we mentioned earlier, the emerging markets are also contributing. So the sequential OM rate improvement on top of the growth is promising. Several key drivers for that: the vertical market mix as these systems are at above line average profitability; some improvements in field efficiency, not as much as we were looking for, but definite improvements in efficiency in North America; and then the commercial lock transition in the Mechanical Access business, now 9 months into the transition, entering a phase where the OM rates are now improving. So North America and emerging markets, about 60% of the segment is returning to a healthier state and will continue to make progress in 4Q and beyond.", "And then when we focus on Europe, turning the page, the other 40% of the segment, we see a situation where organic growth is still elusive and negative, which, in turn, is slowing the sequential rate improvement and slowing our ability to get the operating margin rates back up into that zone that we're looking for. And the reality here is that the shortfalls in organic growth have gone beyond the 2-year shortfalls that we were expecting when we closed Niscayah, and they're now cutting into the margin rates. And we haven't had much help from the macro environment, although, frankly, we didn't expect much, and it is stabilizing.", "So we are dealing with several structural issues, the first being historical overdependence on referrals from the mother company, Securitas, that really referred a lot of business to Niscayah back in the days when they were affiliated. So we had to rebuild the sales force almost from scratch over the last 2 years. And then we had, in various countries, weak legacy management that we had to undertake significant management replacements and changes. And then finally, we had a legacy systems integration model mindset and business model at Niscayah versus a recurring revenue model, which is what we're familiar with in North America. And then there is just the pace of change in Europe in general, which is a challenge.", "And so these are all significant challenges, some of which we expected, some of which were deeper than expected. But we have a strong and capable management team in place in our Brussels headquarters for Security Europe, and although the progress is slower than desired, real progress has been made. As I mentioned, the sales force rebuild is well underway, and the France and U.K. and even southern Europe elements of this business are now performing quite well. In Nordics and Germany, Nordics being the largest region, which, fortunately for us, both decent economic environments over there, are really more self-inflicted works in progress, and we just made a significant management change, leadership change in the Nordics. And so most of the management upgrades are complete at this point in time. And we're gradually moving the model now towards a recurring revenue base model. So we should continue to see progress here in Europe, but we are not going to overcommit the pace of change at this point.", "I'll now turn it over to Don Allan, who will cover the financial aspects of the quarter.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. So I'd like to start with a walk through working capital and then move into cash flow. So our working capital performance was flat versus the prior year at 5.9 working capital turns, which was slightly off expectation. We expected to improve our working capital turns by about 0.4 turn in the third quarter of this year. Let me walk through a couple of the specific reasons for that variation. The first of which is that when you look at our receivables or DSO, the expectation was is that we'd be closer to a flat performance versus the prior year, but given the timing of how the revenue occurred within the third quarter, it actually drove an increase in our DSO of about 5%. We view that as a temporary situation and don't see that as a major hurdle for our objectives related to working capital and cash flow for 2013.", "Second area is inventory, DSI which was flat. We did expect our DSI actually to improve in the third quarter, but due to the lower organic revenue performance in certain businesses in this third quarter versus our expectation, it caused some inventory pressure in our supply chain. And then the fourth area is the payables or DPO, which improved by 9%, and this is an area that we continue to demonstrate improvement over the last several years. This is really where the impact of the Stanley Fulfillment System and the hard work of our supply chain teams continues to demonstrate the benefits that the Stanley Fulfillment System can have on working capital as we continue to accelerate our progress there.", "The end result was 5.9 working capital turn, as I mentioned, which was about 0.4 below our expectation. The vast majority of that was the combination of inventory and receivables. Our expectation for the end of the year is that we will be closer to a flat performance versus 2012 at 7.5 working capital turns versus our original expectation which was a modest improvement over 2012. And I'll walk through that in a little more detail on the next page. But our expectation is that we still believe, with all these things that we're doing through the Stanley Fulfillment System, that we can continue to work our way towards our goal of 10 working capital turns.", "So moving to free cash flow. You can see the significant impact of working capital in the third quarter, which was a cash outflow of $244 million and year-to-date, cash outflow of $372 million. The good news is the expectation is, given the way that our fourth quarter works and the seasonality of several of our businesses, specifically the CDIY business, where a large portion of the revenue occurs in October and November, we believe, given that, that we can reverse the vast majority of this negative by the end of the year. However, instead of it being a slight modest positive versus our original expectation, we expect it to be flat or even a slight small negative at the end of the year. The reasons I walked through on the previous page.", "The Other area -- Other category made some modest improvement. If you remember, back in July, I talked about some negatives that occurred in other that were more timing issues. We saw some of that reverse itself in the third quarter, and that trend will continue in the fourth quarter as that becomes more in line with our expectations by the end of the year.", "So the question some of you might be asking is, \"What's the roadmap from where we are to $800 million in free cash flow?\" Well, if we start with our original expectation of $1 billion back in July, there's really 2 drivers that reduced it to $800 million. The first is our working capital expectation has dropped by about $100 million, and you'll hear on the guidance section and right after this that our earnings expectation is $100 million lower as well. Those are the 2 main drivers versus prior guidance.", "But where we are today, at $150 million roughly of free cash flow, what is the path that gets us to $800 million? Well, our fourth quarter would have approximately net income and D&A of about $310 million based on current outlook. The working capital reversal of roughly $372 million, as you see up above, and then Other continuing to improve by about $50 million and then CapEx of about $80 million to $90 million would get you to roughly $800 million of free cash flow for the year. And that would be the roadmap to that expectation.", "So with that, I'd like to turn to our revised outlook for 2013. Our current view of organic growth for the year is that we expect it to approximate 3%. We're year-to-date, through 9 months, at right around 3%, which means the fourth quarter is expected to be a similar number, versus our prior expectation of 4% to 5%. And I'll walk through some of the details of that in a few minutes. What that means to our EPS is that, combined with Security's slower recovery, we believe that EPS can be $4.90 to $5 this year versus our previous expectation.", "So let's walk through some of the details of that. About half of the EPS reduction relates to a slower-than-expected pace of Security margin improvement versus our expectation in July. Jim did a great job walking through the detail of that a few minutes ago, so I'm sure you can understand the aspects of that in more detail. The second portion of it is related to a reduced view of organic growth, that I previously mentioned a few minutes ago, of now 3% for the year.", "And there's really a couple of drivers to that. We believe that with the pressure that we're seeing in emerging markets, it's -- which is a slight temporary deceleration, we believe, associated with some of the macroeconomic environment pressures we're seeing in those geographies around the world will contribute to this. And then two, we really believe the U.S. government sequestration and shutdown has had a modest impact in Q3 on us and will have a slightly more significant impact in us in Q4. The good news is we believe these issues are temporary, that they're not issues that will carry over into 2014. But we cannot guarantee that at this point, so our view is to be prudent about where we are today and focus on what we can achieve through our growth initiatives and other organic initiatives across the company.", "The last thing I'd say is that partially offsetting this pressure is an improved tax rate. As you saw in the third quarter, we did have some accelerated tax credits, as well as a shift in the distribution of our earnings across the world that allowed a lower tax rate. We expect that to carry through for the year. And now our tax rate will be 20% versus the 23% expectation in July.", "The last thing I'd say associated with guidance is that, when you think through where we were in July, we were at a situation where we felt we were beginning to accelerate organic growth. As we close Q2, we saw accelerating organic growth in many areas, emerging markets, the U.S. and even Europe continuing to slightly improve. Our second quarter organic growth was 5%. Our second half view was organic growth slightly above 6%. Now, we see some deceleration in the -- with the second half being closer to 3% to 4% organic growth versus that 6% number.", "The second area, which is a change is really our slower recovery in Security. We believe we're doing all the right things in Security to get this business back to historical levels. But in the case of Europe, it's going to take a little longer than our original expectation, but we're hitting all the right areas to make sure we achieve that in 2014 and beyond.", "There's a little bit of segment detail associated with our guidance to the right. I'll touch on a few things very briefly, and then you can have follow-up questions as you see appropriate. CDIY will still be a mid-single-digit organic revenue performance for 2013, although slightly lower than original expectations due to the emerging market growth expectation being slightly muted. The modest OM rate increase is still expected to occur for the segment versus 2012. Security's organic revenue is expected to be a modest decline versus 2012. And we'll continue to see modest growth in North America, which will be offset by the continued mid-single-digit decline that we've been seeing in Europe. The operating margin rate will decrease year-over-year based on the information that Jim provided a few minutes ago.", "And then Industrial will continue to be a low- to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth expectation for 2013, slightly lower than our expectation in July due to the emerging market situation, as well as the uncertain government situation here in the United States. And then the OM rate is expected to decrease slightly, mainly due to the initial Infastech margins being slightly below line average, as well as the impact of some of the growth investments.", "The last thing I'd say on this page is that our view for 2014 is still being developed. But we still believe that many of the things that we're seeing here are temporary around the pressures in organic growth and that our long-term objective of 4% to 6% organic growth is achievable in 2014. Along with that, we believe that we can grow our EPS year-over-year 7% to 9% associated with that. Obviously, those numbers are excluding charges.", "So to summarize the presentation portion of the call this morning, we believe 2013 is continuing to demonstrate traction in organic growth, even though we are seeing some pressures in certain areas that I just touched on. We continue to focus on the organic growth initiatives. They drove half of our 4% organic growth in the third quarter, and we're definitely seeing the benefit of them. CDIY and Industrial had a solid performance in the third quarter, and we continue to see positive momentum in those businesses. We've recalibrated our Security margin performance. The expectation is below -- or is below expectations but it's progressing. And we really believe that we will regain position in this business as being a revenue and earnings grower and a driver for our performance in 2014 and beyond.", "The emerging market macro environment is difficult, and the U.S. government situation is creating some uncertainty for us, but we're still demonstrating solid organic growth even with that. Our 2013 outlook has been revised for the items that I mentioned, and we remain focused on driving organic growth in our company, the efficiencies across the company, trying to maximize synergies and then allocating our capital in a way that provides excellent returns for our shareholders.", "So that concludes the presentation portion of the call, and we'll move to Q&A.", "Gregory Waybright", "Yes, great. Thanks, Don. Dawn, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.", "Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Last couple of years, I know have certainly been challenging from a macro perspective, in currency and a lot of acquisitions and divestitures. But when I look at your revised guidance for this year, it's actually very similar to the initial guidance you gave for 2011, 2 years ago. When you look back kind of over the last 3 years, what do you think, over that period, kind of drove the shortfall versus your expectations? Do you see any kind of structural issue with the 3 segments that you have? Was it execution? Was it M&A? Or was it really just end markets and macro?", "Donald Allan", "Jason, it's Don. When I look back at the last 3 years, there's things that have happened in that time frame, and obviously, we've had shifts in the portfolio. We've sold businesses such as HHI. We've had acquisitions that have kind of shape-shift the structure of the company in that time frame. In 2011, the performance, in my view, was pretty solid and achieved our objectives for that year. In 2012, we had some dynamics in Europe that were difficult that hit every company, not just ours, in the second quarter and the third quarter of that year, and we think we responded accordingly with appropriate actions. And then the acquisition of Niscayah certainly had an impact on us here in 2013, and Jim walked through that in a lot of detail, and we're responding accordingly to it. We feel like we've taken the actions to get the business back on track here in '13, so it can be -- get itself closer to historical levels as we enter '14 and move further into 2014. But my view is there's not something structurally wrong with the portfolio of the company or structurally wrong with other aspects of the company. I think it's more due to the continued portfolio transformation of our company and driving performance and trying to maximize shareholder value along the way.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So just 1 question. So you're guiding for 2, 3 points of sequential margin improvements at Security in 3Q, and you've got within that range. And it sounds like your implied guidance suggests there's no further improvement in 4Q. So can you just maybe just confirm that and just give us some color in terms of what's changed in the last 3 months?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Nigel, it's John. I'll confirm there is no implied guidance despite your calculations for the fourth quarter. That being said, nothing has changed other than, I think Jim did as detailed a job as could possibly be done on this call, that we're pleased with the direction of Security. We are not pleased with the pace. I think the other very important point is the situations in the U.S. and Europe are dramatically different. Europe, we are in the midst of meaningful organizational changes, and those take time. That does take time to, I'll say, put points on the board and have you realize the results. And as I think Jim pointed out pretty clearly, we've got a lot of things going on in the U.S. on the Mechanical side. We've talked about our business model change which -- to a distribution versus direct, which is going to help with volume but, short term, have an impact on margins. I think that's quite clear. And on the Convergent side -- access is making great progress. And on the Convergent side, we've also -- we've talked about the need to focus or refocus on more recurring revenue and less systems integration and installation, which was, I don't want to say a trap but which was a tack we found ourselves going down that's not consistent with our long-term strategy. So a lot of things going on, but there was no implied guidance for the fourth quarter as it relates to margins. My expectation is we'll continue to improve globally, the question is at what pace.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. The only thing I would do to clarify what Nigel said is that we certainly gave an indication of the sequential improvement back in July, with the expectation in Q3 being a much higher number than what you said, Nigel, which was we expected it to improve about 300 to 350 basis points, and it improved 170 so about halfway there, and then by the fourth quarter, get to historic -- closer to historical level. So if there was a \"implied guidance\" that was really what it was.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question -- I know 2014 is in flux a bit, but when you look at that 7% to 9% EPS growth and you're saying 4% to 6% organic revenue growth, it seems like you should be able to get much better leverage on that organic revenue growth than what you're implying in that EPS growth for '14. What are kind of the drivers of the deleveraging or the reduced leverage on the volume growth that could potentially occur next year? I'm just trying to square that.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. I would say that -- this is Jim. I would say that the single biggest aspect of that is a hedge because the government is shut down, business confidence is shaky right now in the U.S. We don't know what the consumer is going to do. So we're putting 4% to 6% out there because the assumption is if the economy kind of stays at the current level, then we should be able to generate 4% to 6%. If that 4% to 6% does not materialize, we still think that we're in a situation where we'll be able to generate some meaningful earnings growth in the range that Don mentioned. However, it will require some more cost cutting and perhaps, some deferral of investments and that type of thing. And we're just at an early stage here, and we can't really determine what the external environment is going to bring with it. So hold on for a couple of months and come January, we'll be talking about that in more detail. Hopefully, the U.S. government will be back in business and business confidence and consumer confidence will be moving in the right direction again.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. And I would add that we're really just looking to give folks an indication that we saw the potential for growth next year, both top line and EPS growth. So it wasn't necessarily to say that this is a locked-in number and the view of exactly what it's going to be, but I think the way that Jim articulated is an excellent summary.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I've covered Stanley for a long time, and historically, at least, there's been a clear pattern of anytime there's been weakening business conditions and/or executional issues, you've also announced further restructuring actions in order to rightsize the organizational cost structure and offset the earnings shortfall in short order. And notably, I'm not seeing that sort of new restructuring announcement today, which seems really curious given the scale of the current shortfall. So how should we read that as it really -- it seems like it's a significant departure from historical management actions at Stanley, not to announce a restructuring at the same time when there's a material miss?", "Donald Allan", "Sam, it's Don. The way I would respond to that is I certainly understand that perspective, and I think we are very -- as you know, very active in managing our company and responding quickly to situations. The current situation, though, our view is that it is temporary and to some extent, we believe, unorganic growth. Now we do have some situations related to Security that it's taking a little longer for us to recover, but frankly, we're taking all the restructuring actions we can take in our Security business to make sure that, that gets back on track. And it would be difficult to do a lot more beyond what we've already done, especially given that we're talking about a European business, where it takes time to do these types of restructurings and they can't be done overnight. But going back to the organic growth point of view is that we believe that we're seeing a bit of a deceleration, as I mentioned, here, and it's not the right time to react by a dramatic cost takeout. But to what Jim was saying earlier, if we get into 2014 and we start to see this trend continue, because it's more issues related to the U.S. government or there's some other type of economic impact either associated with that or independent of that, then we will have to take those types of actions. And I am convinced that we'll do that because this leadership team knows how to respond to those types of difficult situations.", "James M. Loree", "And if you look at where we are in the cycle, to kind of reiterate Don's point about this, we think this is temporary. If you look at where we are in the cycle, you have a construction market in resi which is pretty hot here in the U.S. You have a non-resi market that looks like it's going to be pretty hot in '14. You have Europe, which is stabilizing, not out of the woods, but certainly not a big negative like it has been for -- from an economic point of view. And you have the emerging markets, which are slower, but still 2 to 3x times the growth of the developed markets. So when you look at the macro backdrop, you say, \"Well, this is not a permanent problem.\" It's a bit of a deceleration right now, and in particular, our emerging market activities performing in the low teens pretty impressive, I think, performance under the circumstances. Our issue is that to sustain a mid- to high-teens performance in markets that are decelerating would only put us in a position where we'd be getting into a trap or the channels would get too full. So we're throttling back temporarily. And next year, we have a significant MPP, mid-priced-point, growth program that John referenced. That's going to help us in the emerging markets. So we look around and we say, \"The environment is not terribly negative right now. In fact, there's more positives than negatives.\" Therefore, we're cautiously optimistic that '14 will be a good growth year. There's no point in going and taking a business that has great organic growth momentum, in general, and going to take a hatchet out and take a big chunk of costs out because we're trying to make up for a couple of -- $0.50 of EPS this year. So that is the backdrop. And as I said, we'll have another look in early '14, and we'll share with you our view. And we haven't lost our ability or our inclination to cut costs when the revenue isn't going to be there. But we think, based on everything we see at this point, that the environment could be relatively favorable in '14.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "It looks like in terms of the Security margins, without knowing how much you're spending in terms of the growth investments and the restructuring that you're doing with Niscayah, it's hard for us to model that out. But in a similar fashion, in terms of getting to your growth investment targets of the 35% gross margins and somewhat robust operating profits by 2015, can you provide us some more clarity in terms of what gets the gross margins up from where they are currently and what sort of leads to that margin ramp over the next 2 years?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, Mike. I would say -- well, first of all, the gross margins are not a major drag related to these initiatives here in 2013, and they won't be in 2014. The drag tends to be more at the operating margin rate level, which is where we're making the SG&A investments and the feet on the street in, streets in the emerging markets. Some of the enhanced resources and investments we've made around vertical solutions in the Security business here in North America, those are all SG&A-related costs, so the drag is more at the operating margin rate level. Now as we get into 2014, we'll be embarking on our mid-price-point product launch in the emerging markets, which our expectation is that will be reasonably close to line average gross margin and should not be a drag in that area in 2014. So our view is that we continue to make these SG&A investments. It's more about a volume leverage, getting the volume up to the right level. So the SG&A is giving -- the investments we're making is giving us a return that's in excess of 15% OM.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Jim, you talked about throttling back a little bit on the emerging markets business. You're at low teens now. Can you just talk about the profitability as it stands today on the emerging markets business? You've talked in the past of it being 20% or better margins. I'm just wondering how it should go in the quarter and your thoughts for the next couple of quarters.", "James M. Loree", "Well, there hasn't been any significant change in the profitability levels of emerging markets, with the exception of the fact that the SG&A investments are a bit higher. So that's probably costing us 200 basis points of operating margin or something in that order. So instead of 20%, we're probably closer to 17%, 18%, but it's still above line average profitability.", "Operator", "We have Stephen Kim from Barclays on the line.", "Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask you a question, I guess, about the Security business, in particular any lessons you think that are applicable as you sort of look into future opportunities. You cited the fact that there were some sales relationships and then maybe a sales force there that wasn't exactly up to your expectations, relationships with the parent company that were, I guess, losing some of the reported results beyond your expectations. As you look in the rearview mirror and you're trying to assess the lessons you learned from this and you apply that forward, what would you think you might do differently as you assess future M&A opportunities?", "John F. Lundgren", "Steve, great, great, great question. And maybe there's a spot for you on our Board of Directors because we've had the same conversation with them, and I mean that very, very seriously. I'll give you the short answer, and then I'll add some color because I think it's a really, really important thing to understand. The answer is nothing. And the different -- I would argue that Stanley Black & Decker has a core competency rapidly developing, if not already recognized, for acquiring, integrating, improving the performance of the business. And even in the past, when it's been suggested we've acquired at a very high price relative to our trading multiples, within a year or 2, it looked brilliant. In the case of Niscayah, there was one really, really important distinction. It was a contested publicly-traded company, where the former parent tried to buy it. We had the opportunity to intervene as a white knight, for lack of better terminology. It was a business we knew strategically was a very important fit. We had tried to buy that business when it was part of Securitas. That being said, Jim, myself, the Security team did a lot of due diligence to the extent we could 3 or 4 years prior. We had the opportunity -- we did not have the opportunity to do the kind of due diligence that we do, so we hit the ground running Day 1, where we know what the organization looks like, we know what the projections are, we're really comfortable with the synergies. We used our best estimates. That being said, what did we get right and what did we miss? And I think you asked that. We knew that the senior management was not there for the long haul because it was a newly upgraded -- newly created public company. They had no desire to carry on and weren't a good fit with our organization and they left. We underestimated the degree to which the field sales organization and the field tech organization in both countries needed to be upgraded. That took some time. I think it's well in process. But as we've suggested earlier, we depleted some of our existing Security business' bench, and we've put some very capable resources, including Massimo Grassi, one of our most tested and proven European leaders, added him to our Security business team in an effort to drive the changes that needed to be made. And I think the other thing Jim mentioned that we missed and I don't think without proper full due diligence in hindsight -- with the guide of 20/20 hindsight, it's easy. But we underestimated the degree to which the Niscayah business allowed on referrals from Securitas to maintain their installed base and as a consequence, turn that into recurring revenue. So all those things that Jim touched on are real. We've sat back and asked ourselves the hard question. Would we -- could we have anticipated that ahead of time? And the honest answer is, we think, no. To answer the last part of your question, were it to be a publicly-traded company and we were having -- we had the opportunity to intervene because we've never made a hostile acquisition in our career. It's not our style, and that tends to not work out very well. We might try to ask more questions, do more research. But understand, we had 2 weeks to mobilize to do this deal or not. I think 2 years from now, because we're asking ourselves the question now, \"Would we have made the acquisition if we had to do it over again?\" The answer is absolutely yes. Are we enduring some short-term pain for long-term gain? The answer is yes. And it's a long answer to a simple question, but it's appropriate that -- we've had this question internally, and we've had the discussion with our board. And I think that's exactly where we come out.", "James M. Loree", "Yes. And I'll just add to it that when we did this deal, we knew there were a lot of unknowns, and we knew the environment in Europe was uncertain, although we were not in the midst of a euro crisis. And so we've put pretty significant hedges in the plan. There was a $100 million revenue hedge as an example. We assumed we would lose $100 million of revenue. That would have been sufficient to cover the Securitas issues and some of the other things John was talking about, but it wasn't sufficient to cover the euro crisis and that at the same time, so not a big enough hedge, a very large hedge. We outperformed the cost synergies, and we continue to outperform the cost synergies on this deal, as well. And we knew that was a conservative estimate of the cost synergies that we undertook when we announced the deal. And the hedges just weren't big enough based on a combined euro crisis and some of the internal structural issues at the same time.", "John F. Lundgren", "And last point, Steve, it kind of relates to Sam Darkatsh's question on restructuring, which I think Don answered quite well. We haven't forgotten how to do it. We do it when we need to. We've made over 50 acquisitions in the last 10 years. We haven't gotten them all perfect on Day 1. There are very few that after we've owned them for a reasonable period of time, we haven't fixed them or figured out what's wrong with them and dramatically restructured them or changed them. And I personally am confident that we'll get there with Niscayah. It's going to take longer for all the reasons you've identified. They're all completely accurate. There all with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, and that's where we stand on it. And then I'm hoping within -- a year or so from now, we'll be able to say we told you so. You asked the right questions, and we had the right programs in place, but spot on for now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert Baird.", "Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. Just on the idea of possible deceleration, I know, Jim, you've talked a little bit about some slowing in September in CDIY. I was just wondering if September was just a slow month in general across your different kind of businesses. I was wondering if you have any color on that.", "James M. Loree", "Well, September was a slow month in Industrial & Automotive Repair for sure, with the government basically shut down. And there's usually a surge in September related to the government spending and so forth that just didn't occur, so that was clear. We think that there were some inventory corrections, as I mentioned, at retail, which was definitely a factor in CDIY. And then we also had the systems implementation in IAR, as well as the Kip [ph] Auto Show, which is the trade show which would occur in the fourth quarter and not September as in previous -- as in the previous years. So these factors all contributed to a slow September. It was a very slow September in relation to what we expected and what we've been experiencing on a run rate basis. And that's why a fair amount of the deceleration is attributable to both the emerging market slowdown and the U.S. government issues that we have right now with respect to the budget funding levels.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. Just wanted to focus on North America also for a bit. If you could go into more detail with regards to, I guess, what you would call some of the areas that you are happy with and that you still expect some additional improvement in, particularly in Security. You had mentioned on the -- where you felt room to go is on the field efficiency side, for example. And also in the CDIY, where you'd mentioned the inventory reductions, if it's possible, can you give any additional clarity there, if you think that will continue into the fourth quarter, for example?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. I can't give too much more clarity on the inventory reductions other than to say that what we're -- I said there was some disparity across the population or the universe of these customers, and we would never call out any one in -- specifically. But what I will say is that there is a pattern where the retailers that are performing well are not necessarily adjusting inventories. Their inventories are in pretty good shape. And the retailers that are struggling a bit are in a different place, so their inventories are getting a little bit out of line. On the average, the inventories are in good shape. So -- but you do have a little bit of a dispersion across the universe. And on Security, their -- the fourth -- the third quarter performance in terms of margin probably fell about 200 basis points or so short of where we had hoped it would be, and a good half of that is related to the field efficiency. So we did make improvements, but there definitely are some areas in the area of efficiency that are improving even as we speak on a month-to-month basis, but just not improving on a fast-enough rate. And we have good visibility into that, and we should see some improvements continue into the fourth quarter on that front. And then, in general, what I'm very happy about in North America is the organic growth. We really haven't -- we've made a lot -- talked a lot about it, but I defy anybody to go back and find out when the last time CSS organic growth was at that level in North America. So we've been talking for a long, long time about Security ultimately becoming a growth engine -- organic growth engine for the company. The vertical market solutions is the way to do that. It's a terrific, terrific business because it has a defensible value proposition. It has above line average margins, and you can grow it. It's not like the basic monitoring business, which is the more you install, the lower your margins go until you get the recurring revenue built up. It doesn't have that dynamic, so it helps us deal with that. Very excited about the growth in North America Security.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets.", "Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "You'd had -- Engineered Fastening, you had a tough comp in terms of the systems orders year-over-year. It did affect your operating margins for the quarter. Looking at current order rates, how do you see that business trending for the balance of the year and into '14, both on the systems side and on the margins?", "Donald Allan", "Well, this is Don. The portion of the business that we're referring to is the legacy Engineered Fastening business, which is tied more to light vehicle production globally. And as Jim mentioned, the fastener piece of the business outperformed light vehicle production growth in the third quarter and has done that over ...", "James M. Loree", "2:1.", "Donald Allan", "2:1 and has done that for quite some time. But we did, in the third quarter of last year, have a significant equipment -- set of equipment sales that occurred in our European business. That was a difficult comp for them in the third quarter. But our view going forward is that we believe that, that performance versus light vehicle production will continue to be strong and healthy. And they have been very focused on gaining market share over -- well, that's certainly part of their differentiation model over the long term. But in the last 2 years, they've really been able to demonstrate that in the financials, and we believe they will be able to continue to do that at a significant pace. And when you look at the Infastech business, which is more significantly tied to the electronics industry, we believe that we're doing similar things there around differentiation that allow this business to continue to demonstrate mid-single-digit growth going forward over the long term.", "Operator", "We have Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Just quickly, Jim, on the '14 numbers and the puts and takes. I can appreciate risks from the government side and kind of the uncertainty, but I would think that would flow through the revenue outlook as well. But for a given 4% to 6% increase and realizing you'll be anniversary-ing some of the brand investment or the strategic growth investments, you'll have lapped a lot of the problems in Security, it would seem like the incremental growth should be a lot stronger for that given level of 4% to 6%. So is there something else within the margin structure that would be offsets to that?", "James M. Loree", "There's nothing structural at all. I mean I think Don, as he said earlier, put that numbers -- those numbers out there because he wanted people to understand that we expect positive growth in 2014 no matter what the environment looks like, based on the government shutdown, et cetera. The -- so for you to conclude that if anything beyond that would be wrong -- and the 4% to 6% growth is a number that, as I said earlier, I think we can make if the economy is kind of more the same that we've had this year, for the most part, and the organic growth initiatives will buttress that number up against kind of a normalized economy that we're having this -- that we have in the first half this year and, hopefully, we'll have in '14. So it's just as I said earlier, there is a pretty substantial hedge in that number, and if the volume doesn't come through, we still expect to be able to deliver growth of that magnitude at the earnings line.", "John F. Lundgren", "Dennis, it's John. Let me just add a little perspective that I think will help you, but I think Jim and Don described it perfectly accurately. This is -- it's available on the public domain. It's in our proxy. And a lot of it reflects on how we compensate in an effort to motivate our organization, and the overwhelming majority of the organization is compensated based on 3 metrics: organic growth, earnings and cash flow and/or working capital turns, if you're in a business. And we want the organic growth number to be more of a stretch than the earnings number for all the reasons Jim and Don talked about. But all 3 of those metrics are important. That's how we measure our people, that's how we measure ourselves, that's how we pay our people. But I think it's important to note that earnings per share or operating margin depend on where you sit in the company. Cash flow and working capital turns are weighted slightly higher than the organic growth. We've had a lot of conversations about that internally with our comp committee, with our folks, and we think it's the right weighting. So yes, don't jump to any conclusions based on that. But I've -- hopefully, what I just walked you through will help you understand it.", "Operator", "We have Andy Noorigian from Vertical Research.", "Andrew Noorigian - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "And just really quick, I think on the CDIY, you've mentioned emerging market channel congestion. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what exactly that was. And as you look to '14, with the medium price point rollout, are the channels all in place for that as you look out? Or is there more investments to be made there?", "James M. Loree", "The channel congestion that I referred to simply relates to the fact that almost all business in the emerging markets is done through distribution, independent distribution. We have done a lot of developing distribution this year, and in doing so, we have sold a lot of tools to these distributors, who are now in the process of marketing these tools to end users. And we are in the process of creating end-user poll and end-user demand, and it's a natural process that you go through when you develop distributors. When you look at the markets, just to be clear, these markets are not growing at the pace that we're growing in the emerging markets. So our growth is coming from the development of distribution, as well as share gains that are with the existing distributors. And so part of the deceleration is driving a slower growth outlook because we certainly are not going to fill the channels to the point where it becomes an issue for the end distributors from a liquidity perspective or just it doesn't make business sense. So we're being prudent in not pushing too hard until the pool is sufficient at the end-user level, so the channels are operating smoothly.", "Operator", "That was our last question. I will now turn the call back to Greg Waybright for closing comments.", "Gregory Waybright", "Dawn, thanks. And we'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning.

My name is Paulette and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor & Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright", "Thank you, Paulette. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2014 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR portion of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's second quarter 2014 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A section. Because of the size of the queue, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release in our in most recent 34 Act filing.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks, Greg, and thank you, Paulette. Thanks to those of you listening in this morning for our second quarter call.", "During the second quarter, our organic growth of 1% was negatively impacted by the shortened North American outdoor product season as well as some volatility and slower growth in emerging markets. Each of those two factors was worth about $25 million in revenue or 100 basis points for a total of about 2 percentage points of growth of the combination of those factors.", "This being said, our sharp cost focus on price realization delivered some healthy growth as well as operating margin expansion despite some significant currency pressure. Currency was about a $20 million headwind in the second quarter, and that was in line with our expectations. And as you'll recall, it's slightly below the $25 million headwinds that we experienced during the first quarter. So about $45 million during the first half of the year thus far.", "Gross margin expanded 100 basis points versus prior year to 36.5%. And operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 13.7%. Diluted EPS was up 17% versus prior year to $1.43. And as the spread between reported and GAAP earnings narrows, that's $1.37 on a GAAP basis. You're going to hear a lot more about segments in just a few minutes, but just a couple of highlights on the segments.", "CDIY operating margin expanded to a post-Stanley Black & Decker merger record of 15.7%. Price productivity cost action more than offset currency and the previously mentioned outdoor product headwinds. Our Industrial segment delivered 3% organic growth and a very strong 17% operating margin, which was up 260 basis points versus second quarter '13.", "Security North America and emerging markets organic growth was 2%, and their 16.5% operating margin was up 310 basis points versus prior year, approaching the historical levels of profitability that that business has demonstrated its ability to achieve. And Security Europe turnaround took a very positive step as operating margin was 240 basis points sequentially.", "So based on the segment results, the net performance and the programs that we have in place in the second half of '14, some of which you'll hear a little bit more about today, we're going to increase our 2014 EPS guidance range and we are reiterating our cash flow guidance. Specifically, the EPS range of $5.50 to $5.60 ex-charges with at least $675 million of free cash flow, and that's inclusive of $250 million of one-time payments.", "Turning to our sources of growth, on our first quarter call, we communicated that we expected organic growth and total growth to decelerate modestly in the second quarter, based in part on prior-year organic growth comps of 6% and 9% in CDIY and Industrial respectively. And the addition of adverse impacts of the outdoor product softness and the emerging market volatility resulted in total organic growth of 1%. And there was no incremental growth via acquisitions in the quarter, all of which is depicted in the chart that's projected on the left.", "In terms of the regions, the US remains healthy, as POS exceeded shipments excluding outdoor across the board. CDIY share gains in Europe as well as solid performance in Industrial was partially offset by Security Europe volume softness. And it was a rocky and volatile road in emerging markets with geopolitical issues in Venezuela, Russia, currency in Brazil, all having impacts. But this being said, we remain quite optimistic based on the strength and efficacy of our mid product price range. Early indications are very good. Jim will talk a little bit more about that in just a minute or so.", "And in the gray area, you see a shaded portion called emerging market organization. The reason we differentiated that and we've shown the plus-3% in the second quarter versus the 1% is our emerging market organization, this is the area of the group of products and people and markets where we have focused our organic growth initiatives. And specifically, it excludes Engineered Fastening and our hydraulics and CRC infrastructure businesses. So I think it's just worthy of note that where we have focused and targeted the incremental investments to drive organic growth despite the market headwinds, we did achieve 3% in the second quarter.", "Let me turn it over to Jim who is going to do a deeper dive into some of the segments. Don is going to follow that with some guidance and a look at the cash flow.", "Jim Loree", "Thank you, John. Starting with the CDIY, it was an impressive quarter for margin expansion with the post-merger record of 15.7%. Achieved in the phase of flat organic revenue growth, an outcome which was about 4 points lower than expected organically for CDIY due to the weak outdoor product season and unusually volatile emerging market conditions that John referenced that we were able to absorb these two transitory growth issues in CDIY during the quarter, while handily beating consensus and upgrading our total year estimate is a testament to the underlying earnings power of the company. Even more encouraging, the outlook for CDIY organic growth in second half is strong with the resumption of mid single-digit growth and the operating leverage that goes with it.", "I will now address the two second quarter CDIY growth governors in a bit more detail. First, outdoor products. Some of you will recall that last year, the outdoor season selling was delayed in 1Q, mostly notably in March, due to cold weather, causing us a CDIY growth issue in the first quarter of 2013. The second quarter 2013 proceeded normally, but the season got off to a late start and in total was relatively soft based on historical norms. Given the easy comp this year, the big four retailers in the aggregate were relatively optimistic in first quarter about the overall season despite the unwelcomed cold weather conditions at the time. Plus orders and selling were both good in 1Q '14 against an easy comp for us. So no issue.", "However, as the cold weather persisted into second quarter, retailer sentiment regarding the season quickly were pessimistic and replenishments virtually ceased as they attempted to liquidate their high inventories of outdoor product. So instead of an outdoor quarter, which was expected to be up in the high single-digits right around 10%, we ended up with one that was down about 15%, which caused us 2 points of year-over-year growth in CDIY. That is now behind us.", "The other growth challenge in the quarter, emerging markets was simply one of unusually high volatility in the face of gradually slowing markets. It was a quarter in which Latin America, about half of our emerging markets tool business, grew only 2% with Brazil slightly negative as the World Cup became a huge market distraction and with zero sales in Venezuela once again. The other half of the emerging markets portfolio was impacted by Russia and Turkey, which were down 16% and 30% respectively. China was also quite slow. Normal indications are that the second half will be stronger for both tools emerging markets with our major NPI foray into mid price point power tools and hand tools hitting the market across the geographies as we speak, the Venezuela sales drag anniversarying in September and the outlook for Brazil and China looking modestly better.", "Now moving to a very bright spot in the second quarter organic performance, Europe. We couldn't be happier with the progress that the CDIY team is making there with organic growth up 7%, representing a five-quarter streak with growth averaging 6% in one of the more tepid economic regions among the developed markets. This represents clear market share gains stemming from both new listings at retailers and distributors as well as a deluge of NPI including great success with the XR brushless cordless product as well as multi-tools and steam products. Our four major product categories, professional power tools, consumer products hand tools and storage and fastening and assembly each averaged 500 new distribution outlets on a year-over-year basis.", "So as we step back from the CDIY picture, we see a very healthy franchise with world-leading brands, broad and deep global distribution, delivering record margins during a quarter in which organic growth was suppressed by a few unusual items. And as we look forward, we have tremendous NTI momentum in both developed and developing markets and the cost structure that is poised for operating leverage.", "Turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter once again hit on all cylinders and demonstrated the kind of operating leverage that is achievable with a few points of organic growth. In this case, 3 points of organic growth and 1 point from acquisition yielded 22% growth in operating margin. The margin rate came in at 17.0%, up 260 basis points versus a year ago, as price, productivity, SG&A control and volume all contributed to the performance. Both Industrial and Automotive Repair or IAR and Engineered Fastening developed strong OM growth, up 22% and 18% respectively.", "For IAR, organic growth of 2% was a mixed bag across geographies. North America was solid 6% with strong performances from Mac Tools, industrial distribution, engineered storage and Advanced Industrial Solutions. Europe was off 3 points, primarily as a result of timing related to an ERP project. And emerging markets were up 1 point, the latter impacted by the same type of market issues as CDIY.", "Engineered Fastening was also up 2% organically with automotive up 9%, significantly outpacing global light vehicle production, which was up 2%. The industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was down 2%, with timing of sales to electronics OEMs weighing down a strong performance in industrial distribution. Infrastructure was up 5% organically with oil and gas up 4% and hydraulics up 9%. In total, it was an excellent quarter for the Industrial portfolio and we can expect continued momentum to carry into the second half.", "Moving to Security, this was a quarter in which the financials began to reflect the underlying progress which has been made in both North America and Europe over the last nine months or so. Revenues were flat with organic growth down 1 point, operating margin up 8% year-over-year recovering to 11.3% and up 80 basis points. North America and emerging markets was up 2% organically with Europe down 6%. North America and emerging markets OM was up 310 basis points versus a year ago, approaching very healthy historical norms at 16.5% of sales, benefiting from volume, better pricing, field efficiency and a tight SG&A framework.", "In North America, vertical market penetration continued to grow with a series of large exciting wins in retail, financial services and higher education. Europe was characterized by improved stability and predictability as many of the operational and organization fixes discussed over the last few quarters began to produce results. In that regard, Europe performed in accordance with expectations with OM still in the low single-digits, but improving sequentially by 240 basis points and setting the stage for continued improvement in the second half. Over the 14 country P&Ls in Europe, 12 are now considered stable or improving and only two, Spain and Italy, representing 10% of the European portfolio, are still facing significant structural and operational headwinds.", "On a very positive note, Europe attrition is tracking to a targeted range of 10% to 12%, with that 700 basis points favorable to last year. Our focus in Europe continues to be on tight operational management and cost reduction to drive margin expansion and ultimately organic growth. So while Security is still a work-in-progress, especially in Europe, we are quite confident that we are on the right track and the results will continue to improve as we go forward.", "With that, I will turn it over to Don Allan for some commentary on the financials.", "Don Allan", "Thank you, Jim. I'd like to spend a little time talking about our cash flow performance this morning. We're very pleased with our second quarter free cash flow of $376 million, as the earnings growth and lower one-time payments resulted in this excellent performance.", "And you can see as you look at the second quarter versus the prior year in the line other, there's a significant benefit and that's being driven by these lower one-time payments in a significant way. As we've begun to wind down these activities as discussed back in the late part of 2013 and begun to execute that throughout the early stages of 2014 and are very pleased with that result.", "Moving to the right side of the page, looking at our year-to-date performance, you can see that we still have a very significant working capital negative outflow. That was planned and expected. Our working capital turns are at 6.7 times, right in line with our expectations. We still have plans in place to achieve a goal of somewhere between 8.5 and 9 turns by the end of the year. And we feel very good about those plans and the ability to execute on them in the next six months.", "Another item of note is our CapEx. As you know, we have been very focused on controlling the level of CapEx, getting ourselves within a band of 2% to 2.5% of our revenue. And through the first six months of the year, we're at 2.15% of revenues. So very pleased with that as well.", "Looking at free cash flow in total through the first six months, a $166 million. If you look at the history of our company post-merger of Stanley and Black & Decker, the historical trend would say that roughly 24% to 25% of our free cash flow happened in the first half of the year. And just extrapolating that will give an indication that our goal of $675 million is very much achievable. The other thing to factor in those, we are very much focused on controlling CapEx, controlling the one-time payments, and we feel very comfortable with our plans related to working capital, which gives us the confidence that we have the ability to at least achieve $675 million cash flow for this year.", "Moving to guidance on the next page, I obviously touched on cash flow over the last few years, but let's spend a little bit more time on EPS. As John mentioned, we increased our guidance range for 2014 for EPS to $5.50 up to $5.60 from the previous range of $5.35 to $5.50. On a GAAP basis, the range is up the same amount of factor to $5.38 to $5.48. So the difference between GAAP and adjusted is roughly $0.12, which approximates to $25 million charges that we have anticipated since the beginning of the year. So no change there.", "What is driving this change in guidance? It's really three factors. The first is that we do expect our organic growth to be a bit lower as emerging markets are experiencing some volatility that Jim walked through in a fair amount of detail. Although things are looking better in the back half of the year, we do expect the full year to be slightly lower versus previous expectations. The outdoor season has been short and obviously that has an impact on the full year as well. So as a result, we believe our organic growth where we originally thought of approximately 4% will be somewhere between 3% and 4%. So a modest decline in organic growth versus prior expectations.", "More than offsetting this impact, however, is a much stronger performance in our Industrial business and a very strong performance across the entire company related to lower indirect cost as well as pricing benefits. As we continue to focus on really programming the company to be prepared for certain volatility in the topline, which is most likely will occur.", "And then the last factor that's changing is we will be lowering our tax rate to the bottom part of the range where we gave initial range earlier in the year of 21% to 22%. We expect that to be closer to 21%. However we do expect a little bit of share creep in those two items will neutralize themselves.", "Two other factors to note really to guidance, I mentioned this factor back in April that if you look at the company most-merger for the last three or four years, our earnings have been split from first half and second half approximately 45% and 55%. When you do the math, you'll see that the new guidance range indicates that that is consistent with these trends. And so we feel comfortable with that expectation as well.", "And then looking at the second half earning split versus the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we would expect 47% and 53% respectively, as we do some timing issues related to tax, which shows some positive benefits in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And then as we continue to accelerate these indirect cost benefits and pricing benefits, that will have a more positive impact in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.", "And lastly, a little bit of flavor on the segments over to the right, you can see that our CDIY and Industrial segments continue to be consistent. We expect mid single-digit organic growth in both segments. Our margin rate year-over-year improvement as the operating margin rate continues to increase due to some volume leverage, cost actions. And those items are more than offsetting the negative FX that John walked through in a little detail earlier on. In Security, we expect a flat to modest decrease in organic revenue, consistent with prior expectations, and the margin rate to be relatively flat. So no major change with the outlook associated with Security.", "We feel like we've programmed the company to be prepared for a little bit of volatility associated with some of the economic and market conditions around the world by really focusing on indirect cost and certain pricing actions. And it positions us well to achieve our new guidance range.", "So to summarize the call this morning, 2014 continues to be focused on executing operating and capital allocation actions. We've delivered a very strong second quarter performance despite some significant weather issues, foreign currency pressures and emerging market volatility. We were able to demonstrate margin expansion across all our segments. We have very tight cost focus across the entire enterprise, which enabled significant operating leverage. We remain optimistic about Security European recovery and we feel like the second quarter was a very positive step forward.", "We remain focused on our 2014 near-term items, which is really to make sure that we're focused on the returns and relative performance of the company. And we're focused on organic growth initiatives, the continued Security margin improvement, surgical cost actions across the entire company to ensure we continue to achieve operating leverage, not losing sight of our working capital focus and achieving 8.5 to 9 working capital turns by the end of the year, and then of course making sure that we continue to stay on track with our capital allocation rebalance for 2014 and '15 with an acquisition moratorium and then the share repurchase and deleverage as we continue this year and into 2015.", "All these items, we believe, position us very well to make sure that we deliver our long-term financial objectives.", "With that, we'll move to Q&A.", "Greg Waybright", "Thank you. Paulette, we can now open the call to Q&A please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse.", "Mike Dahl - Credit Suisse", "With respect to the margins, really impressive job on CDIY this quarter, hitting a new record. Was wondering you highlighted a bunch of things, but given that, the mix of geographies and products shifted a bit. Could you quantify how much that also may have helped and how you think about margins longer term in this segment, given how far you've come?", "Jim Loree", "I think one of the great misperceptions about CDIY business or any of our businesses is that as you go across the globe, we have radically different profitability structures. And while the gross margins and the SG&A can be somewhat different as you go from geography to geography, typically the operating margins are very consistent. So the mix of, for instance, the lower emerging markets did not have a dramatic positive impact on the operating margin. The extra-good performance in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis, say, the US with its outdoor issues did not have a significant impact on operating margins from a mix perspective. So really the geographic mix in general is not a big deal in terms of driving the margin rate.", "What really drove it was a series of things that Don and actually all three of us talked about, which is a really, really tight focus on margin management, starting with gross margins, productivity in the factories through the Stanley fulfillment system, pricing and new product introduction, driving competency in the organization in terms of price management. And then on the cost side in SG&A, as you know, we took several actions in last year that are now carrying over into this year as planned. But on top of that, we have a very sharp focus on indirect cost reduction across the company.", "We spend over $1 billion a year of cost in this indirect area, which would be the non-people related expenses. And every dollar that today is under a microscope as to whether it's really driving revenue, driving value and whether it can be reduced without hurting anything really to the company's overall growth and profitability. So that's what drove the margin improvement and not some kind of a mix impact.", "John Lundgren", "Let me add one point and it'll just even further amplify what Jim said, because you asked basically about geographic mix, and I think Jim described in quite accurate detail. They're consistent. He didn't talk specifically about product mix. Historically, hand tools and storage have been slightly higher profitability than power tools. This being said, the team has made great progress on power tool margins with some of its design and engineering efforts. And in this particular quarter, you'll note from Jim's deep dive on this segment, power tools was up 2%, while hand tools and storage was flat. So if anything, it's a negative product mix in the quarter, more than offset by the initiatives that Jim just talked about. So there're lot of good things going on within the four walls of our CDIY business. And I think Jim described them quite accurately.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays.", "Stephen Kim - Barclays", "I guess I wanted to follow up here on CDIY. I think you're looking for mid single-digit organic growth as we go forward. Obviously the broader context in things housing related has gotten softer of late, it sounds, both on the remodeling as well as on the new construction side. You called out outdoor, which makes a lot of sense due to the weather. But I was curious if you could provide a little bit more granularity around what your expectations are for things getting stronger. You just mentioned, I think, that hand tools and storage was flat in the quarter. Was kind of wondering whether you think any of that maybe reflects some of the softness I was referring to in the broader housing context, and what international or emerging markets expectations you've got embedded in that mid single-digit CDIY outlook.", "John Lundgren", "The North American POS was 6% in the quarter. It was up sequentially versus the first quarter. So we didn't see any softening in our POS in North America. And we, as we forecast POS on a go-forward basis, continue to see a strong performance in whatever market conditions we happen to be in right now, which don't appear to be slowing from our perspective. And that's partially because as you know we're not directly tied to the housing market. We're indirectly tied to the housing market.", "In Europe, we continue to see strong performance based on the product introductions that I referenced and the outlets that were increased. So we expect continued mid single-digits there. And in the emerging markets, we were 5% in the first half and we expect to be up at least that much in the back half and potentially more based on a tremendous, as I said in my comments, new product introduction in the mid price point product. That's not to be underestimated, and that is a significant initiative that's been in the works for about a year-and-a-half now, almost two years and the products are literally being sold as we speak. Whatever geopolitical situation that we have as we sit here today, that will drive our performance under those circumstances. So we're quite confident about the mid single-digits in CDIY in the back half.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie", "In terms of the European Security business, is any of the resizing of the business there incremental based on the organic growth weakness in Southern Europe? And at this new resized level, can you talk about much longer-term where the structural margin range is for that European conversion Security business?", "Don Allan", "Obviously we talked to the European Security business in the sense of how much sequential improvement it made quarter-over-quarter, very pleased with that. We're not seeing incremental improvement yet versus the prior year. And our expectation is as we go through the remainder of the year and we get closer to the fourth quarter that at that point, we could see some year-over-year improvement in the business performance.", "Now that's really going to be dependent on a couple of factors. One, we are seeing some difficult performances, Jim mentioned, in Spain and Italy. When you exclude those two countries, you'll most likely see a healthy performance year-over-year in this business excluding those two countries. But those two countries right now are weighing down the business a little bit. Our expectation at this point is that we would expect some incremental improvement even with them by the end of the year, but that could be modest challenge for us. We've factored that into our guidance. So we're not overly concerned about this. But when we look at that business specifically, we do see that as a bit of a challenge.", "As far as long-term, we still continue to believe that it is a business that can be double-digit profitability over the next few years. And then eventually it can get to mid-teens levels along with the rest of our Security business. And the factor that's really going to drive that second stage evolution is going to be what we've been doing in North America over the last 18 months or so, which has been rolling out the vertical market solutions to key verticals such as retail, financial services, healthcare, et cetera, and bringing those to Europe, because we haven't done that at this stage, because we're kind of in a turnaround recovery mode of that business getting all the basics in place, the operating rhythms, the field organization structure the right way, et cetera, et cetera. And by the end of the year or early next year, we would begin to bring this vertical approach to the European marketplace. And as a result, that will help us move the profitability of the business closer to the mid-teens level over the long-term.", "John Lundgren", "Don reference Spain and Italy without too much cause and effect, but I think you're all quite familiar with what's going on, particularly in the Spanish market, which is a large market for us. Just three things to touch on, first of all, a very intense competitive environment which makes it a difficult market in the first place. Second, not news to anyone, commercial construction is nom-existent in Spain and has been for the last year-and-a-half. And thirdly, with the Niscaya acquisition, we were largely influenced by the financial services verticals, specifically banks. And it's probably not news to anyone that our bank branches in Spain are closing at a very, very, very rapid rate. So we are fishing in a much, much smaller pond in an intense competitive environment two years ago and that's creating some headwinds for that business that Don referenced to. But it's probably appropriate to give you just a little bit of the whys.", "Don Allan", "Yeah, but there's really no cause for major concern, because it's really less than 10% of our European portfolio and less than 5% of our total Security portfolio. But we're being very right in saying that we don't think we've solved the issue in Spain and Italy yet.", "Jim Loree", "And we factored it into our guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Mike Sang - Morgan Stanley", "It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. Wanted to jump back on the MPP initiative. It sounds like it's going well and you alluded to it earlier, but against the backdrop of weaker emerging markets. I was wondering if that changed your view at all on how much you need to invest to build that business and how the calculus impacts the topline and margin contributions?", "Jim Loree", "So just to refresh everybody who may or may not have heard this in the past. But the MPP markets in tools across the emerging markets are about 60% to 70% of the total markets. And they are where the growth is the fastest, and they are where the local competitors are the most skilled at driving growth. So if you're going to play in tools on a serious global emerging market platform, you have to play in the MPP market and you have to do it with products that are at the price point and at the performance point that you are meeting or exceeding the local competition.", "So our strategy has been very much focused on exactly that. And it actually plays quite well into slowing markets, because slowing markets tend to have some economic distress. And when distress occurs, people move from higher-priced products to lower-priced products. So we expect the growth in the mid price point and we call it MPP+, which is mid price point plus or MPP or MPP-. And we have a next step with MPP to see a little degradation from MPP+ to MPP kind of a water fall down in terms of where the market goes. And I think we're extremely well positioned in that regard, and we made our investments. It's not like we have to make a lot of new investments. We put 300 feet in the street. We've designed the products. We bought GQ, the Chinese power tool company. We've upgraded the products very nicely with local Chinese leader in that market. And they also export beautifully into all our markets around the world. So we're in a pretty good place there.", "And I think in addition to that if the markets were accelerating, I suspect that the desire to invest amongst all the competitors would be even stronger. I think the likelihood of investments by competitors is still there. But perhaps the magnitude and speed at which they invest will be regularly sum up by the market expectations. So in kind of a perverse way, I think we're in a very good spot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo", "What's the organic growth rate that's assumed in the 3% to 4% for the year in terms of the contribution from organic growth initiatives? And then second one, John, you talked about Spain and Italy being a pressure point within European Security. At one point, you start to look at that and say, do we really need to be there and is that structurally important to our overall Security business and it may make sense for us to just move away from those markets longer term.", "John Lundgren", "2% organically in the first half, if we're going to be up 3% in the second half for the year, the math would say we have to be 4%. It's just math. 2% plus 4% divided by 2 is 3%. So it's 4% to 5% in the second half, if that's your question, versus 2%. And this is globally of course for the entire corporation all in. And obviously that's going to vary by segment.", "And the answer to your second question, that's a great question, we ask ourselves that question all the time. We look at all the alternatives and will continue to. I think what's important to note is before we abandoned something, we give it our best effort to fix it. And we've made some tremendous improvements there. We will continue to do that. But you are right on, we're not in a position on this call to talk about paths forward. But I think let's get realistic. Jim gave you a very important number. It's 10% of our European Security business, which means it's 5% of our global Security business, which means it's 1.25% of our company. We are looking at it. We're focusing on the alternatives. We're not going to move a lot of needles irrespective of what we do.", "But to the extent it continues to be a drag, you've followed us a long time, we have a history of if we can't fix something in 18 to 24 months, we used to do something else with it. And we don't follow more than anything that is in earnings cost to capital.", "Jim Loree", "The growth initiative impact for the year, and it's going to be about 1.5 point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's actually (inaudible) for Mike. Part of the increase in the operating EPS guidance was due to better Industrial performance expectations. Within Industrial, was there a specific area that's driving this outlook, or is it kind of evenly spread across each of the individual groups?", "Don Allan", "Within our Industrial segment, the largest businesses are Industrial and Automotive Repair business, which are very large businesses in the US and Europe, our Engineered Fastening business which is performing extremely well, and then our smaller businesses within the Industrial segment as we report are oil and gas and hydraulics. Each and every one is up beautifully year-to-date, and we expect more good things. Jim talked about how well Engineered Fastening was performing. It's still 50% to 60% of that business is OEM auto and it's performing at a level four times the rate of the market. So we're obviously gaining share, well managed business, diversifying into other verticals.", "IAR is strong and we think will continue to be. IAR has a large percentage of its business in Europe, but it's performing quite well in Europe despite a relatively stagnant market. And oil and gas and hydraulics being much more volatile had really nice second quarter and we see those trends continuing. That's a very long way of saying there's strength across each and every business within our Industrial segment. And at the current point, there are no fixed uppers. There is just leverage, the great positive momentum that those business leaders have taken into the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA", "Good progress on margins and I wanted to follow up on liquidities question on the Industrial segment where we've seen over 200 bps of margin expansion there. I'm wondering if you could give us more color on what's driving this margin expansion and what we should expect going forward as manufacturing activity seems to be expanding. Should we expect operating leverage to continue to play a large role there and to see margins trending up further?", "Jim Loree", "We clearly see that across the portfolio within Industrial for components of it, if you want to look at that, which is really three ones that we talk about externally, infrastructure, IAR and Engineered Fastening are contributing in a positive way for organic growth and continuing in a very positive way for operating leverage. And the reason they're contributing in such a significant way for operating leverage is all the things that all three of us have articulated in a fair amount of detail this morning, which is the focus on surgical pricing actions in our businesses. We're focused on indirect cost controls. We've also taken other SG&A cut actions that we embarked upon in the fourth quarter of last year. And we've been very focused on how we improve our operating leverage across our company. And I think you're seeing the most significant impact within our Industrial segment.", "But then again when you look at the rest of the company across at CDIY and even in Security, so it's just really representing the impact of all the things that we're trying to do to manage the business, manage the organic growth, manage the margin mix, manage the price, manage the cost and really enhance the operating performance of the business. And ultimately the true cash flow of the business in the company starts to come through. And you saw that in the second quarter with a very strong cash flow performance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.", "Ken Zener - KeyBanc", "John, I wonder if you could do the math for me. On US Security margin split between CSS and mechanical and expand on you guys' comment on how the domestic field efficiencies are lifting the CSS business, because I know there have historically been some real spread there. Do you think that part is picking up as well as mechanical coming down?", "John Lundgren", "I won't do the specific math, because we don't necessarily want margin by sub-segment within a segment in the public domain. You know this business really well, but I think I can help you directionally. Ken, historically mechanical access security and access of that higher margin has been convergent, that is converging as electronic margins increase and we maintain or increase it at a faster rate than either access or MAS. Our MAS business is still a little soft, so it's representing a lower percentage of the total due to no other factor than what Jim has talked about on several of the calls, specifically the switch from a direct to a distribution model and the resulting margin impact of that, which over time we're highly confident will be offset by increased volume, by increased share, by operating leverage.", "But as we speak, consistently high margins, there's no huge spread across the three sub-segments within North American Security. And as Jim referenced to a previous call, the Asia-Pacific or emerging market piece that's baked into that same number, there's no dramatic difference there either. By healthcare business and emerging markets business, margins are a little lower than North America. And that's really all the detail on sub-segments that we care to get into.", "Jim Loree", "Ken, you've been with us a while. You remember, I'm sure, when the Security business in North America started having some issues about a little over a year ago, we discussed at the time one of the reasons for that was that we had made an organizational change where we had taken the structure that we had been running the CSS business on historically, which was a centralized structure in terms of metrics management and field deployment, and we had pushed that centralized structure out into that AD P&Ls in the various geographical regions of the United States and had placed accountability at that level for managing P&Ls and then rolled it all up into a total.", "And it turned out that that particular move was not a very smart one. And so when we started going backwards in the field about a year or so ago in terms of efficiency, we determined that one of the reasons was that we did not have the people in running these P&Ls that were really capable of managing the efficiencies and the labor loading and all the complexities that go with managing a field like that. So about nine months ago, we reversed that decision and we went back to the centralized model. And now what you're seeing is the benefits of a very, very metric-based daily intense management model, which is the way that you make money and manage your field effectively in electronic security business. And having made that mistake once, we will not make it again. I can promise you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Winnie Clark from UBS.", "Winnie Clark - UBS", "You talked about the headwind you saw in CDIY in North America in the second quarter as retail inventory replenishment came to a halt. Have you started to see that come back and is there a potential for the tail of the outdoor season to be a bit longer and strong due to the slower start that you saw? And then could you see some benefits from restocking in the second half?", "Jim Loree", "The outdoor season, it's so very specific to the first quarter and the second quarter that there's very little replenishment that goes on in the third quarter. And really what you've got now is retailers are just trying to make sure that they don't get stuck holding it back with a bunch of inventory. So there's really no chance for, I'd say, either really any significant upside or downside relative to outdoor.", "John Lundgren", "I think that's very well said. I mean to oversimplify what Jeff Ansell's team would say, you get to the middle of June, that season is over. They're already looking forward to fall products. So we're optimistic what's there. We'll sell through. But due to the late start, to Jim's point, it was the reorders that didn't take place. In their minds the season is over. That volume, there's probably no reason to think that volume in terms of shipments will come back. And we'll move it on from there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Can you break out the second half assumptions kind of embedded in that 4% to 5% organic across the major regions, I guess, just compared to the volume that you saw in the first half growth?", "Don Allan", "We don't really give it that way. But the reality is when you look at the trends that we've seen in our company in some of the commentary that Jim mentioned this morning, we've seen a very strong performance in certain pieces of our European business. Other pieces such as Security Europe have been a little weaker. Emerging markets had a solid performance in Q1 and then had some volatility in Q2, and we expect that to improve in the back half for all the reasons that Jim walked through around MPP.", "So I'm not going to give you specific numbers by regions. But what I can tell you is that from a trend perspective, things will move. I think Europe will be relatively consistent with a little bit of it tailing down as we start to comps and difficult comps in CDIY Europe. Emerging markets will ramp back up from what we saw in Q2 and get stronger. And then the US will be a little stronger than what we thought, because we were definitely impacted by outdoor in a negative way, and we don't expect that to repeat. So we would expect a modest improvement in that particular performance.", "Jim Loree", "To help you with your modeling, it's too much detail to get into on the call. We do included in the appendix in tremendous detail at least in terms of Europe performance and history. But just thinking at a high level, 50% of our global business is in the US or 53% is in North America, 25% in Europe and 25% in the rest of the world. Rest of the world is clearly going to grow faster than North America and Europe. And weighted average gets you to the 4% to 5% in the second half and 3% to 4% for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital.", "Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital", "Security has been talked about previously as well but if you're looking at much of the drag on the overall revenue growth it's previously been the result of Security business, particularly as we're looking at Europe. Now Stanley has been criticized by the investment community for a lot of its challenges within that division, which has traditionally been a very high margin business. There have even been talks about the divestiture of the Security business from the rest of Stanley, I know someone mentioned that previously as well. Now we've been writing a lot about Security turnaround strategy for several months now and it's really nice to see that Security is finally seeing an uptick. With that being said, within the vertical market penetration, specifically in North America, which segments are you seeing the most traction in, and what is working within those segments that you can use to penetrate in other segments and also try to emulate that strategy in the European market as you look into the back half of 2014 and go into 2015, I know that a large number of the sales force within Security sector has previously been replaced by those people that are not just looking for new business, but also farming for existing businesses as well?", "John Lundgren", "Those two issues, which verticals are gaining traction in the US and is there learning that applies to other verticals, and then second that's I think will help the audience the most. Well, our order rates are running close to $100 million annualized on the verticals. And within that $100 million, I think the number one vertical would be retail. And we've been doing some work in integrating EAS systems with Security systems that seems to be very appealing to large retailers. And we've had one very large win and then a couple of smaller ones. And we see a couple on the horizon in retail, which is kind of a very unique value proposition that nobody else is providing at this point in time, which does a lot of data analytics for the headquarters and the regions of the retailers. So that's one exciting area.", "Another one is healthcare. And our healthcare activities are really divided into two pieces. The one is the traditional security business that covers acute care facilities and senior living facilities and just medical facilities in general. And that's your basic security systems. But we also have this other part of our business which we call it healthcare, but it's centered in patient security, but now it's evolved to an asset tracking a patient safety, a compliance productivity generating business that really ties together a lot of software solutions with hardware components and peripherals and brings the ability to kind of manage the hospital better or the senior living facility better to the hospital. And we're kind of combining that now in a go-to-market basis in selected areas with our core security business.", "And what we're finding is that the value proposition that we can bring to the C level type people in hospitals, for example, is very, very compelling. So we've had some wins already that are pretty significant there and we have some wins on the horizon that I think will eye-opening in size.", "And then another one is higher education. We've had several significant universities wins in the last six months or so. And these tend to vary from providing kind of campus control solutions to more traditional or more basic security solutions. But we have several technologies today that we are kind of weaving together as we go to these various verticals. And one of them is the RTLS technology that we gained through the AeroScout acquisition. And another is the EyeLock technology that we have exclusive rights to in these markets.", "And then we have done a really nice job I think also integrating with the PSIM systems, the basic security systems, so that we can kind of go to a customer and take what might be a hodge-podge of various security systems that they might have installed across their enterprise and sort of tie them together in a better way. So these are kind of all at the root of the success of the vertical initiative. And I think just to focus on becoming a subject matter expert in each one of these verticals and providing solutions to the customer.", "The ability to transfer this to Europe, I think we're getting very close to the point where we can begin to do that. That will not be an overnight sensation. It will take at least one to two years for it to really settle in and start driving the growth there. But it is very powerful. These solutions are transferrable. And there's not a whole lot of extra work that needs to be done to take them to Europe in terms of the product modifications. It's really more of preparing the European sales force to sell these and commercialize these. And that is something that we want to do, but we also want to make sure that the environment is stable and that the talent is there to be able to do that in Europe. And we're nearing the time when we can kind of make that happen, but it's going to be a quarter or two before we actually make that happen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Janney Capital.", "Liam Burke - Janney Capital", "IAR had a good quarter with Mac Tools up, so the automotive vertical looked pretty strong for the quarter. Are there any other verticals that contributed or have shown unusual strength either in this quarter or as you see it going forward?", "Jim Loree", "Liam, I don't know if you jumped on the call late. I talked a little bit to a previous question on the Industrial segment. As you know, IAR and Engineered Fastening are the big businesses. And Engineered Fastening is about 50%, OEM auto the other 50% spread across aerospace, consumer electronics and other verticals. Then the rest of that segment, as you know well, is infrastructure or hydraulics and oil and gas businesses. All performed extremely well in the quarter. So we really had broad-based organic growth and operating leverage across the entire Industrial platform. It was a very encouraging quarter. And no one specific vertical or end-market to single out has been an extraordinary driver.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James.", "Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James", "The inventories on a year-on-year basis are up pretty sharply. Now I don't think I should be too worried about it. You did mention, Don, that you are expecting working capital to improve by year-end and you did raise guidance. But where are those inventories on a year-on-year basis and was there any benefit to fixed cost absorption during the quarter?", "Don Allan", "As I mentioned back in the April call, I actually indicated that we would be mostly like building some inventory in the CDIY business in the second quarter to prepare for the remainder of the year to prepare for the MPP rollout in emerging markets. And as I indicated a few minutes ago, the working capital turns pretty much came in line with our expectations by the end of the quarter. So you're exactly right, the inventory levels are a little bit higher than maybe what we originally anticipated six months ago or so. But they're right in line with what we're anticipating as we began the second quarter.", "We feel good about how we're positioned for the remainder of the year. We have very robust plans, like we do every year, in place to address the inventory payables and receivable levels over the next six months and feel that the working capital numbers that I provided are very achievable.", "As far as absorption, yeah, obviously the impact was part of our guidance, part of what we planned. It was not very significant, but clearly it does an impact on the higher levels of inventory versus the prior period or the prior quarter, but didn't drive anything significant beyond our expectations. It was right in line with what we expected.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor - Longbow Research", "I guess the question from here is, which is kind of the other side of the equation, is how do we grow the business and what might be achievable in terms of just growing the RMR portfolio from here and if you could just talk about what sort of the most impactful levers are to you at this point.", "Jim Loree", "You're right on. I mean the first quarter of business was to keep what we have. And then in the process while we were doing that, we were also and have been now for almost two years building a sales force and a commercial engine for that business, because when we acquired it, we didn't have one. We had an organization that was reliant on its cousin, which was the Securitas Corporation. So I'd say that sales force rebuilding process has gone reasonably well in most geographies. And if set aside Spain and Italy, which if you look at the organic growth being down 6% in the second quarter, I think it was down 7% in the first quarter, what you have there is two things going on.", "One if the spill-over effect of the prior attrition from prior quarters having an impact. But equally as important the installation business is down. And it derives from Spain and Italy being about a third of the issue. And then beyond that, we have a very, very focused initiative to make sure that we're not taking on business that is low-margin business and low value-added business. So that has an impact.", "And then finally, it's just a matter of making sure that we have the requisite number of salespeople or feet on the street on the payroll. We need to deal with the Spain and Italy issues, as was talked about earlier. So that's part of it. And then I think the feet on the street issue, earlier in the year, we were down probably about 30 to 40 people versus what we needed to have or wanted to have in sales in Europe. And I think today, we're right around down 10. So we're making a lot of progress on that front, getting to where we need to be.", "And the order rates in the back half of the year need to kind of come up. They're negative right now, consistent with the organic growth numbers, and they need to come up. And so that is the focus right now. It's making sure that the feet on the street are performing. And all this is very tactical. But as you've seen when we address these tactical issues in sequence here, we've been relatively successful. So we're confident that we can get that done. And then of course, the medium to longer-term solution to this is to have this vertical market of products and the vertical market sales organization that was discussed a few minutes ago transferred over to Europe. So this is a staged execution project just like everything else we've been doing here.", "And right now, we're in the stage of making sure that the origination capability of the organization is not only there, but performing at a level that is acceptable. And then of course, the next step from there will be bringing in the vertical market solutions.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Waybright for closing comments.", "Greg Waybright", "Paulette, thank you. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation. And obviously please contact me if you have any further questions.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is John. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright.", "Gregory Waybright", "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. On the call, in addition to myself, are John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today.

It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements we might make today.

Lundgren", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I am really pleased with the performance of our team in the third quarter, given what's going on in the geopolitical front and many others.", "Let's get right into it. Organic growth of 6% was led by CDIY and our Industrial business, and the combination of the 6% growth, sharp cost focus and price realization delivered strong operating leverage. Our OM rate expanded to a post-merger record of 14.1%, that's x charges, of course, and 120-basis-points increase versus 2013. Diluted EPS, up 12% versus 2013 to $1.55, $1.50 on a GAAP basis. And please note the convergence of GAAP and reported EPS as the large acquisitions, accompanied by outsized restructuring charges, are more fully integrated and the overwhelming majority of that is now behind us.", "CDIY revenue grew 10% organically, another post-merger record of 16.5% operating margin rate as volume leverage, productivity, price and cost actions offset the continued foreign exchange and emerging market headwinds that you'll hear more about later in today's call. Industrial delivered 5% organic growth, 15.9% operating margin, and that's up 170 basis points. And the turnaround in Security, Europe continues. At the same time, we're taking some further actions to strengthen the global Security business as well as sharpen our focus on our vertical market solutions activities. And Jim Loree is going to give you a lot more detail on Security, in general, and vertical markets, in particular, when he gets into the segments.", "Free cash flow is $189 million in the third quarter and remains strong. Year-to-date, it's up $464 million versus 2013. And as a consequence of the earnings performance in the third quarter cash flow, we're raising our fiscal year free cash flow guidance and reiterating the earnings midpoint while tightening the 2014 EPS range. We're looking at approximately $800 million of free cash flow for the year and EPS of $5.52 to $5.58.", "Let's turn to the sources of growth during the quarter. The developed markets showed great strength, and they led the way this quarter as both CDIY and Industrial performed well in the U.S. as well as Europe. And remember, those 2 geographies account for 74% of our total revenue. Pricing in the emerging markets, as well as surgical pricing actions elsewhere in -- primarily in our developed markets, led to a 1% overall increase. And pricing offset the negative foreign exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar against virtually every currency. More to come on that in the fourth quarter as we think this is going to continue, and Don will get into that in far greater detail in his piece of the presentation.", "Within the regions, U.S. demand remains healthy in both retail and industrial channels. Overall demand in Europe is flat with the exception of the U.K. and several smaller countries. So the 4% growth that you see in Europe is clearly the result of share gains. Emerging markets remained under pressure, most notably Venezuela, Russia and Brazil, but we're really encouraged that the recent mid-priced products that we launched earlier this year are gaining a tremendous amount of traction. More on our recent product launches, as well as the current initiatives in those markets, as Jim dives into the segments. So in the interest of time, let me turn it over to him.", "James M. Loree", "Okay. Thanks, John. Let's start with CDIY. It was a blockbuster quarter for organic growth in the developed markets with double-digit performances in both North America and Europe, overwhelming a second consecutive slow growth quarter, in this case, 2% in the emerging markets, for a total performance of 10% globally. CDIY operating margin grew 19%, achieving another post-merger record rate of 16.5%, and margin gains resulting from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operations productivity and tight SG&A cost management overcame currency pressures.", "Last quarter, in my remarks, I said, and I quote, \"So as we step back from the CDIY picture, we see a very healthy franchise with world-leading brands, broad and deep global distribution, delivering record margins. As we look forward, we have tremendous NPI momentum in both developed and developing markets and a cost structure that is poised for operating leverage.\" That is, in fact, exactly what our CDIY team delivered in bigger proportions in North America and Europe than even we expected. Across the global product lines, strength was broad-based with growth in Professional Power Tools, Consumer products, Hand Tools & Storage and Fastening & Accessories, each in a range from 8% to 11%.", "As the cover page indicated, CDIY new product development momentum is driving both revenue and profit growth. DeWalt DC brushless, an important and growing segment of cordless, is off to a very strong start. A host of other examples around the globe, ranging from highly innovative products, such as the first-in-world cordless electric pneumatic nailer and the Autosense drill, as well as practical products, such as the new designed in the market for the market, emerging market power and hand tool lines, all contributed. Putting the company's leading array of brands to work across categories also continues to produce strong results with examples such as DeWalt storage, adhesives and hand tools, Stanley FatMax power tools and Porter Cable hand tools all registering gains. Although difficult to quantify exact incremental revenue from these types of activities, we're confident that contributions from our NPD effort yielded 3 to 5 points of global growth benefit in the quarter.", "In the U.S., our Built In The USA program, which promotes tools assembled in our U.S.-based production facilities, including our recent plant addition in the Carolinas, has been highly successful. The U.S. business also enjoyed a kicker from an unexpected 3Q appearance of the outdoor season initially thought to be lost to weather back in the second quarter. On top of these benefits, underlying U.S. tool demand remains solid as DIY fundamentals are strong even as new construction markets are choppy but positive. So to sum up North America, exceptional growth execution and a good underlying market led to great 12% organic growth.", "And now moving to Europe where the market fundamentals are weak but the performance is equally as impressive. As I said last quarter, we couldn't be happier with the progress that the CDIY European team is making with organic growth up 11%, representing a 6-quarter streak with growth averaging 7% in one of the more consistently stagnant economic regions within the developed markets. This sustained performance is indicative of clear market share gains stemming from intensive NPD, new listings at retailers and distributors and a high-performance commercial team, which refuses to succumb to a victim mentality in a weak market.", "The other growth challenge in the quarter, emerging markets, up 2% organically, was one of continuing high volatility in the face of generally slower markets. It was a quarter in which Latin America, about half of our emerging markets' tools business, once again grew only 2% with Brazil flattish while issues in Venezuela and the western mining-dependent countries essentially offset stronger performances in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Central America.", "The other half of the emerging markets portfolio was also up only marginally as modest rebounds in Russia, Turkey and India were offset by weakness in China and Southeast Asia, to a lesser extent. Our major NPI foray into mid-price point power tools and hand tools across these markets is hitting the sweet spot for end users at a time when they tend to be more cost-conscious with their purchases. The program is thus tracking to plan but generally cutting into distributor's share of wallet as tougher markets create constraints on distributor willingness and ability to finance incremental inventory levels.", "As we look ahead for CDIY in total, we see the continued benefit of forward momentum with the winning combination of global scale, robust NPD, great brands, a growth culture and a tight rein on margins and cost more than compensating for lackluster markets in Europe and some of the emerging regions as well as a strengthening dollar environment. In that vein, we expect what is already an excellent CDIY growth story to continue.", "Now turning to Industrial. Industrial this quarter, once again, performed well and delivered respectable 3x operating leverage off of 5 points of organic growth with 17% growth in operating margin. The rate came in at 15.9%, up 170 basis points versus a year ago as price, productivity, SG&A control and volume all contributed to the performance. Both Industrial & Automotive Repair and Engineered Fastening delivered strong OM growth, up 29% and 19%, respectively.", "For IAR, organic growth of 7% benefited from strong demand in developed countries. North America was solid at 9%. Europe was up 11 points and still up an impressive 7% when adjusting for a prior year SAP conversion, which resulted in a 4-point easier comp. IAR Europe enjoyed strength in virtually all regions, driven by strong NPD and commercialization activities. Emerging markets were only modestly positive, the latter impacted by the same type of market issues as CDIY.", "Engineered Fastening was also up 5% organically with automotive up 16%, significantly outpacing global light vehicle production, which was up 5%. The Industrial portion of Engineered Fastening was flattish with sales to electronics OEMs weighing down a positive performance in industrial distribution. Infrastructure was down 1% organically with oil and gas down 4% and hydraulics up 7%. In total, it was another overall strong quarter for Industrial with a similar story shaping up for fourth quarter.", "Moving to Security. Revenues were down 3% with organic growth down 2 points and operating margin at 11.0%, down 12% and 120 basis points year-over-year. North America emerging markets was up 1% organically with Europe down 7%. North America emerging markets organic growth was modestly positive in both Convergent and Access Technologies, partially offset by a decline in Mechanical Access. Operating margin was essentially flat with last year. The OM rate was also consistent with the year ago, solidly in the mid-teens and just slightly shy of historical norms. Installation of a large vertical market retail win in North America, which has substantial future recurring revenue content, coupled with lower sales in the higher-margin Mechanical Access business, produced a less than desirable operating margin result in the quarter. Vertical market order progress continued to be a bright spot.", "In the spirit of allocating management resources where they are positioned to optimize their contribution to business success, several recent management adjustments have been made in North America in emerging market Security. Jim Cannon, a proven Stanley Black & Decker management veteran who has previously led both Oil & Gas and IAR, including responsibility for the Mac turnaround, has been named president of the unit. Brett Bontrager, who is succeeded by Jim, has been named to lead Global Vertical Markets, where he will continue to leverage his strength in developing these markets and winning customer accounts in North America while coordinating the transfer of Vertical Solutions to Europe as well. And then finally, Joe McCormack, another seasoned Stanley Black & Decker leader with extensive experience leading distribution commercial teams, has assumed leadership of Mechanical Access. We expect these changes to enable the continued forward progress of the Security North America and emerging markets team in both revving up organic growth and tightening operational execution.", "Moving to Security Europe this quarter. Performance was stable and consistent with commitments, extending its recent track record of predictability. OM is now in the mid-single digits, once again, improving sequentially this time by approximately a point. 3Q attrition came in within the target range of 10% to 12%, and order rates were up in the high single digits. This is an important calculus and that we will be looking for an easing of negative organic growth in the first half of '15 and then a flattish second half of '15 in order to continue to drive forward OM rate growth and a business turnaround.", "Finally, as mentioned last quarter, of the 14 country P&Ls in Europe, 12 are now considered stable or improving and only 2, Spain and Italy, representing 10% of the European portfolio, are still facing both significant structural and operational headwinds. We are committed to completing our strategic review of these countries in Q4, and you could expect a decisive solution dealing with the issue in the near future. So while Security still has a ways to go, especially in Europe, we are confident that we are in the right track, and our recent actions will continue to improve the probability of success.", "And with that, I will turn it over to Don Allan for some commentary on the financials, including the total year outlook and some preliminary thoughts on 2015. Don?", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. We are very pleased with our third quarter 2014 cash flow performance, which resulted in $189 million of free cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow performance was $355 million as we continue to benefit from increased operational earnings, lower restructuring payments and reduced capital expenditures. These 3 factors are responsible for the vast majority of our year-over-year improvement through the first 9 months.", "Additionally, we are also pleased with our third quarter working capital turns performance at 6.4x, which is up a half a turn versus the prior year. We believe this bodes well for us achieving our year-end goal of 8.5 to 9 working capital turns as we're looking for a half turn or better improvement versus the 2013 year-end.", "Many of you are aware that every year we experience a significant positive working capital benefit in the fourth quarter due to certain seasonality aspects of our CDIY business. As a result, we tend to generate close to 60% of our annual free cash flow in the fourth quarter. If you extrapolate our year-to-date performance through the third quarter, which is $355 million, and consider the fact that it indicates our free cash flow for the full year of 2014 will approximate $800 million. Considering all these factors I just mentioned, we are increasing our annual guidance for free cash flow to approximately $800 million from the previously communicated, at least, $675 million. This improved performance will ensure we will achieve our debt deleveraging goals for 2014 and then allow us to begin the previously communicated share repurchase program at some point in the fourth quarter.", "Now let's review our 2014 EPS outlook on Page 10. As indicated by John earlier, we are reiterating the midpoint of $5.55 while tightening our range, which is now expected to be $5.52 to $5.58. There are factors changing within our annual guidance which have an overall neutral impact on full year earnings. As a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar versus other key currencies, we now expect $75 million of currency pressure versus the previously communicated $60 million for the full year of 2014. However, offsetting virtually all of this new $15 million of Q4 currency pressure will be continued strong operational performance of several key businesses within CDIY and Industrial. This operational performance is being driven by solid organic growth in developed markets, strong cost controls over indirect costs and focused customer pricing initiatives, all the things that you heard from Jim a few minutes ago.", "An additional factor potentially impacting our annual guidance would be a modest benefit to earnings from the potential or possible reclassification of our Security Southern European business to discontinued operations. We will finalize this strategic decision in the later stages of Q4 and communicate it in the appropriate time frame.", "Let's turn to segments. We continue to expect mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in both the CDIY and Industrial segments, primarily due to volume leverage, solid price actions and cost controls, which are more than offsetting currency. Our Security segment will have a modest, organic revenue decline of for the full year, and the margin rate will decline modestly as well versus the prior year. The organic growth in North America and emerging markets will be more than offset by the declines we are experiencing in Europe, as Jim has discussed, based for the Q3 performance.", "Although headwinds have been somewhat unrelenting in 2014 due to currency pressures, combined with economic or political issues in emerging markets which have caused volume challenges, we believe we are taking all of the correct actions to combat these headwinds through cost-control actions and customer pricing initiatives. This approach will allow us to achieve strong operating leverage on solid organic growth, specifically, earnings will expand 13% on organic growth of 3% to 4% in 2014.", "We'd like to give you some thoughts on 2015. We see these currency and emerging market volume headwinds continuing and currently estimate it to be $50 million to $75 million against our 2015 operating profit growth expectation. Most of you know we have a track record of responding to these types of headwinds with focused cost-reduction actions or other profit-enhancing initiatives. And I think 2014 is a great example of this. We are currently considering several cost-reduction initiatives, which would largely, if not completely, offset these headwinds that we see for 2015 at this point in time.", "We're evaluating 3 areas for potential cost reductions: the first is combination of a few existing Stanley Black & Decker businesses to maximize the commercial go-to-market opportunities and, of course, leverage the back-office functions. In my mind, this would be a continued evolution of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger: number two, further cost rationalization of the Security businesses to improve profitability while enhancing our SG&A investments to stimulate growth within the verticals; and then three, other surgical actions and certain functions as well as corporate overhead.", "If we proceed with these actions, which I believe are highly likely, it will require additional restructuring charges of $10 million to $25 million in excess of our current 2014 estimate of $25 million. However, do not misinterpret our 2015 comments. We do expect solid growth in profit during 2015, and we are simply discussing one headwind we need to offset.", "Moving to the next slide, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing 2015 foreign currency impacts. As we are all aware, the U.S. dollar strengthened during late September against the 4 major currencies which impact us: the Canadian dollar, the European euro, Brazilian real and Argentinian peso. As a reminder, these transactional exposures primarily exist in our CDIY and Industrial businesses with 80% of it within CDIY. This is due to the extensive global supply chains that are in place as well as the importing of finished goods and components into Latin America and Canada in U.S. dollar-based transactions.", "We have finalized most of our initial key currency-hedging activities for 2015 at this stage. And based on yesterday's spot rates, we estimate the 2015 negative currency impact to approximate $45 million to $50 million versus 2014, which includes the impact of these recently executed currency hedges. To give you an example of the sensitivity of these 4 major currencies shown on the chart, a 1% movement of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar will result in approximately a $2.5 million to $3.5 million annual currency impact, and you can see examples of the other 3 currencies on the page.", "As I mentioned previously, we are focused on managing these types of headwinds with mitigating actions and are currently in the process of evaluating what these potential offsets could be. I believe this slide provides good transparency to the impact of currency in 2015 on our company.", "So I'd like to summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We are very pleased with the strong Q3 2014 EPS and cash flow performance. The strong organic growth of 6% mentioned by John has been supported by solid innovation and the 2013 growth investments continuing to blossom. The tight cost control and surgical price actions across the entire company enabled excellent operating leverage, and our operating margin expanded to a post-merger record. Security Europe continues to perform better and made another positive step forward in Q3.", "Our focus in 2014 continues to be on improving the near-term returns and relative performance of Stanley Black & Decker through organic growth initiatives, Security margin improvement, cost actions, pricing, ongoing working capital focus and, of course, the rebalance of our capital allocation through the end of 2015.", "Finally, we are preparing for new currency and emerging market volume headwinds with offsetting mitigating actions in 2015. So we continue to drive operating leverage as we grow revenue organically. We believe this approach in 2014, '15 and beyond positions our company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives we have established.", "That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now let's move to Q&A.", "Gregory Waybright", "Great. Thank you, Don. John, if you would, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Winnie Clark from UBS.", "Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Could you talk a bit about -- a little bit more about the emerging market expectation continuing to be sluggish and now somewhat weaker in 2015? You quantify the dollar change in your expectation, but what does that translate to from an organic growth expectation? Does that impact your ability to drive 3% organic growth via your initiatives next year?", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. No, a very fair question. Let me start at a higher level. Emerging markets, depending on exchange rates, accounts for 17% to 19% of our total revenue. So first and foremost, put that in perspective. Within the emerging markets, we didn't touch on specific geographies. But historically, as a group, these are growing in double digits, low teens and now they're growing at 2% and 3%. Specifically, certain markets, in our case, Venezuela, where we've had essentially no business for the last 12 months, that will anniversary which is nice in terms of our ability to grow. Argentina is difficult but continuing up. We've seen some bright spots in the last quarter. Brazil, it's much about currency and the economy, and of course, China, a very, very good -- switching to Asia. China, a big piece. We saw 7.3% GDP growth in the third quarter. That's encouraging. It's below where they have been, but better than of late. And of course, the geopolitical situations in Russia, Turkey, the Ukraine is impacting all of it. So at the end of the day, it's 17% of our volume. And if the markets are growing at 10% and we're gaining share -- maintaining share, excuse me, that's 170 basis points of organic growth. If they're flat, it's 0. So simply said, we have the products to go into those markets. We are certainly tempering our expectations for those markets in total, but that's what's baked into the kind of guidance that we've been able to provide thus far.", "James M. Loree", "And if you just think about it from a macro point of view, there clearly is a rotation of economic growth away from the -- in the short term, away from the emerging markets and more into North America, in particular, and Europe, kind of sort of -- expected to continue to sort of stay the same, maybe get slightly better. So we would expect to see the organic growth profile of the company mirror that economic growth rotation. So I would expect to see developed markets kind of -- and emerging markets converge for a period of time in sort of similar growth rates and then, over the long term, emerging markets to kind of ramp up again. We have taken considerable action in terms of product innovation and product development, brand development channel. We've made significant investments in the emerging markets. So we do think that we will be able to outperform the market or the economic performance of various countries. However, the volatility does remain high in the short term and are probably well for the medium to long term as well, but one has to be in these markets because these markets are the future. The 2/3 of the world's economic output and -- within 20 years will be from the emerging markets, and we will be there. So this is a -- this is not a period where one should get shy or cautious about being in these markets or second guess their strategy. This is a time to hunker down and gain as much share as possible.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes, and thanks, Jim. And just to follow up because you only get the one question. I think 2 things. Jim's referring specifically to our feet-on-the-street advertising promotion efforts in those markets, but a greater importance, made in the market for the market to hit the right price points to get the products to the -- particularly to the distributors who are short on cash and thinking very hard about their purchase. So at the end of the day, think about the math. And in the appendix, if you're not familiar with it, we don't go through it in each presentation, but it'll just help you with the math that will give you every region of the country and the percent of Stanley Black & Decker revenue that, that region accounts for. So if you're modeling, it'll just help you with kind of a weighted average and you can apply your own assumptions to the market. And to Jim's point, we will mirror that.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Don, I just wanted to dig into your comment about currency with the hedges, about $45 million, $50 million headwind for '15, and you're mentioning the possibility of further actions this year to offset that. And so what I'm going to try to figure out is do the incremental actions you're considering offset the $45 million to $50 million? Or do we think about that as the total actions you've taken this year offsetting that headwind, potentially?", "Donald Allan", "The actions that we're -- that we are evaluating would offset the currency impact as well as the emerging market volume impact. So I -- we described a $50 million to $75 million headwind for 2015. Within that, there's a $45 million to $50 million currency pressure, and then the other component is the volume concerns that we were just talking about related to emerging markets. We're looking to take actions that would offset all of that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just quickly on -- 2 questions. Don, I think you said buyback in Q1 because of higher cash flow. Just wondering why you wouldn't be aggressive here in Q4, given this is seasonally the strongest cash flow quarter. And then the second question, CDIY margin, 16.5%, very strong number. How should we think about this from a sustainable standpoint? I know there's some seasonality within the business, but just trying to understand as we think about '15, given the strong margin here this quarter.", "Donald Allan", "So the first question is, I said the fourth quarter, maybe there was a Freudian flip and the word first came out, but I did say fourth quarter. So we expect to start the repurchase in the fourth quarter. So our objective has always been, since the beginning of the year, would be that we would focus on deleveraging. We had about $300 million roughly of deleveraging we wanted to do. We believe with this outperformance of cash flow we will be able to adequately achieve that, and then we'll be able to move forward with our repurchase program at some point in the fourth quarter. As far as the cash flow and the seasonality comment, yes. I mean, when we look at the history of our CDIY business, it is -- it was a little muddy last year, I think because of some other dynamics. But every other year, post-merger, about 60% to 70% in some cases, of the free cash flow or working capital benefit occurs in the fourth quarter. And it's because of the timing of the different promotions and other activities related to the holiday season and the vast majority of those shipments occur in October, early November. And then the good news is we're able to collect a lot of those receivables. And then we ramp down our production in our plants, so our inventory levels are actually able to decline because we do -- the -- our major customers tend to have a weak first quarter because it is the winter months.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ken Zener from KeyBanc.", "Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "On the Security, it seem to be very specific in the U.S. on Mechanical, if I interpreted your comments correctly. So would you expand on that, if it was related to -- going to the distribution model, if it was aggressive behavior by a competitor? Or was it simply more misexecution?", "James M. Loree", "Well, the Mechanical issue is kind of the issue for North America and emerging markets Security in the quarter, without a doubt. The other issue, which is the CSS kind of efficiency and operating margin rate, is simply a one quarter blip, where we have a big installation of a huge vertical market customer project. So you do have that correct. And I'd say what we believe about the Mechanical business today is that we have selected the correct strategy, and we have attempted to implement it effectively for about 2 years now and, at some point, the -- once patients dwindles with execution. And we've made some mistakes along the way, and we expect that new leadership will tackle the project and get it right. So that's the impetus behind the management change, and we're looking forward to Joe's experience coming into this job and getting this right very quickly. We've studied the strategic elements and aspects of this in depth, and we see that as the right strategy. We've got the specifiers in place. We haven't seen any untoward competitive activity. The market is going to be good at some point in time. It's not bad right now. We're just not performing at that level. So we get to those situations and it's time to make a change.", "John F. Lundgren", "Just to add to what Jim said, the one thing you didn't mention is coming out of that is -- which as you know, is the largest annual Security trade show. It's not a product issue as well. The product is very, very well received. We're encouraged by that. So just to reinforce everything Jim said, plus we're -- not only do we feel the strategy is right, we're -- we feel we're in better shape than we've been in the past in terms of product offering. So it's up to us to execute.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC", "Just a question around Europe Security. I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of granularity, maybe it's collectively, not by country. But in the -- what's going on in the 12 P&Ls you view as, at least, satisfactory versus the other 2? And what would actually be the gating decision to drop Spain and Italy into disc ops? I mean, the -- obviously, if you decide to exit, that might be one thing. But if you're looking at a sale, I wonder if you would consider dropping it into disc ops before you have an agreement on the exit.", "John F. Lundgren", "I'll take it, and Don can correct me on the accounting. Let me take the second part of your question first. We've said all we could say about whether or not -- what we said is we're evaluating it. We will have a decision in the fourth quarter, and we will communicate it. That is all we're going to say. It's all we're in a position to say for all the reasons that I know you understand. I respect the question. Please respect the fact that we're not able to provide any more insight on it, other than we want you to be aware we're not letting that issue fester. What I think is important to understand, we timed that and allow us to go through '14 P&L. We do report them. And the ones, the big ones that matter, U.K., France and Sweden, all performing pretty well and very near line average and historical margins. The math is really important, and it's interesting. We talked about Spain and Italy, which, together, from a revenue perspective, represent 10% of European Security; if you just cascade that with the math, which represents 4% of Stanley Security and 1% of Stanley Black & Decker revenue. Yet that region is accounting for 70 to 100 basis points of headwind or negativity to our Security margins. And quite frankly, that's just math. And it's 2 things going on, those are very competitive markets. They're difficult markets, as you can imagine. But secondly, particularly, Spain, which is 80% of that 10% or 70% of that 10%, the financial services industry, as you know, is in turmoil. Retail bank branches closing left and right. I'd be off -- I shouldn't speculate, at least 30% to 40% down. And that was our strength in Europe. So when you got -- very competitive in Spain -- so when you have a very competitive market that's 30% to 40% smaller than it was 1 year, 1.5 year ago, that's just tough sledding. So we're evaluating all the options in the best interest of our shareholders and of our employees in the company, recognizing the pros and cons of the 2 or 3 different alternative that you outlined. And when we're ready to -- when we're in a position to take a firm stance, you'll be among the first to know.", "James M. Loree", "Let me also just mention that another way to look at this situation, Security Europe, is -- and at the P&L, is that once you excise the Southern Italy part that we're talking about, the gross margin rate is north of 40%, and the operating margin would be a couple -- kind of in the mid to slightly above mid-single-digit range. So what that says is that the SG&A is quite high, and it's in the 35-plus-percent range, which is just too high for a Security business, no matter where it's located in the world. So it's very important that part of what Don mentioned in terms of this cost exercise that we'll be going through in the fourth quarter to yield profitability improvements in 2015, there will be a significant -- as he mentioned, a significant portion of it targeted at the Security Europe cost structure, and particularly, as it relates to the SG&A. And we will find a way to make some significant improvements in that structure, that cost structure so that we get the operating margin lift that comes with that. So I think is very encouraging, from my perspective, that the gross margin is north of 40%, once you get that Southern Europe portfolio excised.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.", "Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up a little bit on the CDIY. I think you talked about the outdoor previously as, I think, hindering you by about 2 points of growth. I think you mentioned that in either 2Q or 1Q. And I'm triangulating on that to be about $30 million impact. I was curious if you could give us some sense. Is that kind of in the ballpark of what you benefited from this quarter? Can you get it all back? Or just some color around that. And then what you think the incrementals on that look like? Is there a reason to think the incrementals there sort of higher or lower than the segment average typically?", "James M. Loree", "We -- just so -- just for clarity, we only got about 1/3 of that back. So it didn't even contribute -- it might round to a point, point of growth for CDIY, but it wasn't a significant an issue as -- or a benefit as it was a hurt in the second quarter. And incrementals are going to be pretty much consistent with the rest of the portfolio.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Steve, outdoor -- just to quantify what Jim said, outdoor was up 2% VPY in the quarter, which was nice, but it's still down 3% year-to-date, emphasizing what Jim -- that helps to quantify what Jim just said. So despite a pleasant surprise in the third quarter, it didn't begin to fill the hole in the second quarter. It's just added a bit in the third.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I wanted to just ask about the vertical market solutions revenue in Security and how much revenue you're expecting that to contribute in North America in 2014. And wanted to also clarify the margins there, I know there was some mention of project mix headwinds in the quarter and some mention of -- perhaps that was related to a big vertical market install? I wanted to clarify that because I thought the margins on the VMS was higher. And then just finally, the latest thinking on bringing the vertical market solutions to Europe.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. I'll take that one. I think that was 4 questions in one and I'll have to break that down. So when we look at 2014 for the vertical market solutions, we've said throughout the year that our expectation is that we'd probably get pretty close to $100 million of revenue from these solutions during the year, and we're tracking relatively well to that at this stage of the year. So we feel pleased about how that's progressing. As far the gross margins, we've also said that they most likely will be accretive to the overall business. But you have to look at this across the entire contract. And what I mean by that is when you have large jobs like this, you have an installation component. And in the case of the third quarter, as Jim was describing the impact of a large job, we were doing the install, and we'll be close to finishing that here in October. But that does have a negative mix impact, but the profitability is lower on the installation. And then the recurring revenue stream starts later this year and continues into next year. And then when you look at the overall profitability of the entire job, it achieves the type of profitability we were describing before. And that's the way you have to evaluate it. I think it's important to remember that as we continue to focus on the vertical selling solutions, that we're occasionally going to have a quarter where we have a little bit of a mix challenge we have to work through when we have a large installation. But over the long term, these will be profit-enhancing activities.", "John F. Lundgren", "Simply said, you need to do the installations to keep the pump primed to generate the future recurring revenue. It's always a challenge to balance the -- balance the mix and balance the timing. But it's the nature of the business. And the larger the install, the more of a short-term challenge it is with the -- yet, at the same time, the greater the long-term reward.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Tim Wojs from Baird.", "Timothy Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just on European CDIY, really strong growth there again. I guess what type of growth should we expect going forward there? I know you said new products and retail expansion has been a driver, I guess. But can you give us some color on what might be in the pipeline there? And especially if comps get more difficult in the 2015, what we should expect for growth?", "Donald Allan", "I'll take that one. So yes, we -- obviously, we talked about how pleased we are with the performance in CDIY Europe. Jim went through that in a great deal of detail. There's been a lot of activities around new product introductions, new customer listings, some new brands put on products that didn't exist before in the European marketplace, such as the Stanley FatMax brand on power tools, so some great examples of that. And I do think there's momentum to continue that into 2015 in the sense of having new product introductions, expansion of some of the things that we did in certain countries into other countries within Europe that we haven't penetrated yet. I wouldn't expect to see high single-digit revenue performance, but I do expect them to outperform the market as a result and continue to have share gains.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael Wood from Macquarie Capital.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Research", "I wanted to focus in on the CDIY business. The CDIY sales in North America for Stanley took a while to reflect the housing recovery, given there was a considerable lag. Now we're starting to see building product companies reflect more tepid growth in end markets that are slower compared to last year. What are you able to do -- or what are you planning to do proactively in the North American CDIY business to get out in front of the curve from a cost or share gain perspective?", "James M. Loree", "Well, I think what we're doing is exactly what we did in the quarter, which is we're basically driving new product innovation as hard as we ever have. As I said in my remarks, that new product innovation resulted in 3 to 5 points, at a minimum, of contribution to revenue growth.", "John F. Lundgren", "So 1/3 to 1/2 of the growth.", "James M. Loree", "Yes, which also drives profit growth because you mix into higher-margin new products. And so it's a growth -- it's an innovation machine right now, which is clearly -- I mean, I can guarantee you that there are significant share gains going on in the U.S. and in Europe and, frankly, globally. I mean, this business has grown its market share significantly over the last 4 years, and it will continue to do so. Now we don't see any near-term abatement in the CDIY business U.S. market. It is largely DIY-driven, much more so than new construction driven. New construction, when it hits and the lag occurs and so forth, that will be an added bonus. But we did not ride that curve up in the last couple of quarters, like some of the building products companies did, and we certainly aren't going to ride it down, having not ridden it up. So I wouldn't correlate us quite as closely to the building product companies as your remarks seem to imply as well.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Just to help you, Mike, I think you're aware of this, perhaps not. For the 10, 11 years I've been here, and I think for the 100 years before that, we have been 3 to 9 months, so take the midpoint, 6 months, behind any significant change in North American residential construction. That's just the nature of our business, the wallboard folks and the timber folks and those who are involved in foundations, et cetera, are obviously at the beginning of that program, and we're closer to the end. So the lag, to use your words, not -- and Jim, I think, described it well. He just didn't put a number on it. That's been going on for 100 years, and we don't anticipate that it's going to change.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.", "William W. Wong - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Don, thanks for providing the additional color regarding the cost cuts. The company has initiated cost-cutting actions over the last 2 or 3 years to offset weakness in end markets as well as FX and we're just wondering how long this can continue without cutting into the core capabilities for growth and operations, but your license fees appear to be unplanned and reactive rather than proactive?", "Donald Allan", "Well, I think we -- for those -- as I mentioned, for those of you who have followed us over the years, we are very proactive about looking at certain headwinds we see and how we're going to react to it. And so you can describe that as reactive or you can describe it proactive. I look at it as proactive. At the same time, I look at our company and I see, every year, significant productivity programs that occur in the supply chain, productivity programs that incur in our SG&A costs that we never talk about. We just do those every year, and those are the more proactive things that you're describing. They need to happen to continue to enhance our profitability to allow us to deal with occasional periods of time when we have commodity price pressures, et cetera. We don't like to sit back and just let things come at us and then not do anything about it. Our response is to do something about it. And what we're basically saying is that we are going to take a proactive approach to a headwind that with -- become a reality in the last 30 days. And we're going to do it in a way that is surgical in nature. It's going to be a combination of continued evolution of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger. It's going to be the continued improvement of the Security profitability, Europe and -- specifically, as Jim and I both talked about it, and it's also going to be the continued enhancement of the efficiency and effectiveness of our functions and our corporate overhead. These are all things that we need to do every year and sometimes we accelerate some of these things to deal with headwinds that come at us quickly.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. And just, again, to quantify, we've said this before in a lot of calls, but what Don's talking about, the proactive or ongoing nature of our business, particularly to CDIY and IAR, for that matter, the tools business. It's as simple as -- and real prices have declined 1% to 2% a year, let's say, 1% for the last 15 years, real prices. We get price by mixing up, by being -- by mixing into higher-margin items and a good price discipline. But with gross margins round numbers of 35%, real prices declining 1% a year, if you don't get net 3% productivity every year, your margins would decline. Look at the math, our CDI margins are not declining. So if you exclude all the new headwinds to which Don's referring to, particularly foreign currency, emerging market growth, just to stay in the game you need 3% productivity every year to offset 1% real price declines, and we've been doing that for a long time. I think Don can account for 15 years of it.", "Donald Allan", "Yes.", "John F. Lundgren", "And that's just part of our DNA. That's part of SFS that we don't talk about too much. But I just kind of want to steer you away from anything we're doing, is we see something going wrong and the knee-jerk reaction is to fix it. That's a necessity, too. We wouldn't be where we were this year if we hadn't done a whole lot of those programs. As Don described, the level of unanticipated and uncontrollable macroeconomic headwinds we faced, yet we're plodding along with a pretty successful year relative to expectations.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Don, can you just talk a little bit about some of the cash flow items that are dropping below the free cash flow line? I think one seems to be on the head settlements and then there's a lot of grouped in the other line, about $200 million so far this year, and I think last year is about $30 million. Can you just maybe explain what those are? And then let us know if there's anything that you'd expect along those lines in fourth quarter or next year.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. The other line in operating cash flow is where you see the impact of all the reduced restructuring payments.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "And was it down on the -- in the financing investing side?", "Donald Allan", "Well, that would simply just be the activity around commercial paper and financing. And as we go through the year, we see fluctuations in there. We tend to increase our commercial lines, paper lines as the year begins because we have cash outflows in the operating levels. And then as the year goes on and we have our strong fourth quarter, as I described, that slowly and gradually goes away, and you'll see that this year. You do have some other type of currency and hedging activities that do happen below there, but we could certainly walk you through that in a little more detail off-line.", "Operator", "And our next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "The question is -- the questions I have are really on the mid-price point. You mentioned that the launches are pacing to expectations. I guess the question is, are your distribution build-outs where they need to be? And Jim, I think you made some passing reference to some pressures that are being felt by some of those distributors. Can you just talk about what you might be doing to support those distributors, such that the fourth quarter and beyond isn't at risk in terms of the growth?", "James M. Loree", "Well, I mean, we're doing everything we can, obviously. We're not going to overextend our sales from a credit point of view with distributors in markets that are relatively volatile and weak. So there's only so much you can do in terms of financial support, and we're certainly not giving significant extended terms or anything like that. You'd certainly see that in the working capital if we were doing that. So what it really boils down to is distributor training and end user kind of support, so through advertising, through having feet-on-the-street, working with the end users to try to stimulate demand and construction projects, those types of things, creating awareness for the products in the market. But this is just going to take its course. We're not going to jam these products into channels. We're going to allow them to gradually kind of take root and let the products speak for themselves. And I'd say we've done a pretty good job about 1.5 years ago of sort of sprinkling the resources into the various markets. And what we're also doing right now is we've done a study of our sales force effectiveness in managing this distribution channel across all the different countries. And we're looking at the emerging markets right now as sort of a portfolio of countries, and we're saying, \"Okay, we had -- we added about 300 feet-on-the-street, 200 salespeople, 100 marketing people during that time frame.\" And now we're kind of looking at that resource allocation and saying, \"Okay, number one, where are the folks effective? And are there certain folks who are more effective than others?\" Of course, there are, so some rank ordering, some performance evaluation, some changing out some of the folks who are nonperformers. And then the other piece of the activity is to look at some reallocation of resources based on the economic outlook for various countries. So for instance, we wouldn't want to have a -- an army of people in Venezuela trying to sell products when there's no market. So those type of resources could be reallocated to countries such as Colombia, which are -- which is very, very robust right now, so that kind of process, looking at the whole picture of doing the resource reallocation. So no incremental costs of any significance, however, more effectiveness. That's really what we're looking for. But this is not going to be a -- given the market status that we are in right now, this is not going to be a huge sensation. Don't look for 20% growth because of the new products or 10% growth. This is going to be -- will keep us in the game, drive market share quietly, market share increases steadily, methodically. And then when the markets come back, there'll be a lot more share for us and lot more growth.", "John F. Lundgren", "Yes. Importantly, Doug, the key is, as Jim said in his presentation, made in the market for the market. In our history, if you go way back, and you followed us a long time, we would make western-specification products, then we try to take 10% of the costs out and sell it for 20% less. And it was a strain on margin -- it's not quite that simple, but it was a strain on margin nor were the products at a price point that appealed to the distributors in some of these emerging markets where wage rates are so much lower and things of that nature. So the acquisition of GQ which we've talked about, leveraging that capability across a broader portfolio, our Design To Value program where we're truly starting with a blank piece of paper, building these tools from scratch with no extra cost or no extra feature that the end user isn't willing or able to pay for. That's what's driving this. And as I say, it's early days, but we're encouraged thus far.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Liam Burke from Wunderlich Securities.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division", "IAR was very strong, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Was there any particular vertical that showed inordinate strength? Or did you just see strength across-the-board?", "James M. Loree", "I mean, there was -- I wouldn't say across-the-board. I mean, mining is still weak. But generally speaking, pretty strong. General manufacturing, very strong. But lot of strength in various verticals.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.", "John F. Lundgren", "In Rich Kwas', I'll say, multi-faceted question, but it was an important one, and as Don was processing, he didn't get to it on the sustainability of CDIY margins. It's probably worth a word from Don before we close.", "Donald Allan", "Yes. So Rich was asking about the 16.5% margin we saw in Q3, what's the sustainability? What does it mean going into 2015? What I will tell you is that for this year, as I mentioned in the guidance, we'll probably see 60, 70 basis point improvement in the CDIY margins year-over-year, and it's due to a lot of the great things that Jim walked through and that we've discussed through the first 9 months of this year. We expect continued improvement in the margins going into '15. As we all know, quarters change and fluctuate. But on a full year basis, we would expect that we would continue to see improvement. I think the next step and hurdle is we want to try to move them towards 16%. We will see a little bit of pressure against them next year because of the FX that we talked about and maybe all the cost actions don't get allocated directly to CDIY. But even given that, I do expect to see some year-over-year improvement.", "Operator", "And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is John and I\u2019ll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. You may begin.", "Gregory Waybright", "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's first quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we\u2019re going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks, Greg, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We\u2019ve got a strong quarter and I think a lot of encouraging news that we\u2019re very much looking forward to sharing with you and then taking your questions.", "During the quarter, revenue expanded 8% organically. Total growth was 1% as the topline impact of foreign currency was negative 7% in the quarter. Our Tools, Storage and Engineered Fastening businesses all continued strong momentum. They both grew in the double digits organically and Security built up the momentum from the fourth quarter and posted 2% organic growth as North America and emerging markets as well as Europe grew organically within the quarter. I won\u2019t dwell on those numbers because Jim is going to dive into much more detail on the segments in just a minute.", "Both gross and operating margin rates expanded in the first quarter, 50 basis points in gross margin and 120 basis points in operating margins. They increased due to higher volume, along with sharp cost focus and price realization delivering operating leverage, despite $50 million of foreign currency pressure just within the quarter. Earnings per share were $1.07, the same number versus flat in the first quarter of 2014 as the strong business performance most notably in Tools and Storage, offset higher plant restructuring and tax rate. Due in part to our strong fourth quarter cash flow in conjunction with our previously communicated equity derivatives, we executed repurchase actions that reduced the share count by approximately eight million shares in the first quarter. This was a meaningful acceleration versus our prior plan. ", "We are also reiterating full year 2015 guidance for earnings in the range of $5.65 to $5.85 on a GAAP basis. That\u2019s inclusive of $0.25 a share in restructuring charges. It represents a 5% to 9% year over year EPS growth, despite $60 to $70 million of incremental foreign exchange pressure since our last report and it\u2019s now expected to total between $200 million and $220 million in 2015. We are also reiterating free cash flow outlook of at least $1 billion. Don is going to walk you through the moving pieces and our assumptions around them with respect to the share repurchase, currency impact and cash flow in just a few minutes. ", "Moving to the next slide and looking where the growth came from. The momentum continues in the developed markets and that\u2019s been led by the US. As they say, another solid quarter of organic growth, but with currency headwinds almost two times what we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2014. The organic growth of 8% came on the heels of 7% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Over the last eight quarters, our organic growth has averaged 5%, right in the midpoint of our targeted 4% to 6% range. ", "Strong volume growth, particularly in the US, but we also had solid growth in every other region of the country as you can see in the box on the right. Pricing was again positive in the quarter, as actions to combat currency primarily in the emerging markets, but also surgical pricing actions across the remainder of our businesses are contributing to the organic growth. Currency headwinds did intensify as we moved through the quarter. They ramped up toward the end of the quarter and they did dampen the organic performance by 7% as I previously said as the dollar strengthened against almost every currency in countries where we do business. Don is going to give you a very granular look at that in his portion of the presentation. ", "Just quickly on a regional basis, demand in the US remains very healthy, particularly in retail, both strong sell-in and sell-through in the industrial channel, as well as within our security business. Europe has been a very pleasant surprise as we continue to show strong share gains, most notably in Tools and Storage, as well as our industrial business. As you can see, total organic growth is 6%, with these markets tracking flat to slightly up, maybe in low single digits. Finally, the Emerging markets were aided by strong shipments in our Engineered Fastening, Automotive and Electronics businesses, while certain markets, most notably Russia, remain under a lot of pressure. ", "Let\u2019s move it over to Jim and he can give you a lot of detail on the segments. ", "James Loree", "Thank you, John. I think this first quarter performance on the heels of a very strong showing in 2014 is indicative, not only of how far we have come in pursuit of exceptional value creation, but also how much potential there is ahead of us. The title of our opening slide this morning is, Accelerating Organic Growth and Margin Expansion. That is a topic we are very excited about here as a company. A record 8% organic growth is notable considering that the US is one of the only major world economies with legs. European economic growth is still spotty at best and emerging markets in the aggregate are weak and getting slightly weaker. ", "120 basis point operating margin expansion speaks clearly to the underlying operational strength and volume leverage potential of the company, especially reviewed in the context of overcoming well over 100 basis points of year-over-year currency headwinds. Our ability to upgrade total year organic growth guidance to 5% and hold EPS guidance in the 5% to 9% growth range despite total FX headwinds of between $1 to $1.10 a share, means that the underlying organic EPS growth of the company for 2015 is expected to be somewhere between 25% and 30%. Our global tools franchise is on a tear, gaining share and hitting on virtually all cylinders. Our large, highly profitable Engineered Fastening business, has fully digested the successful Infastech acquisition and is growing at rates well above market. Security is now generating positive, albeit modest organic growth and is tracking to previously communicated improvement benchmarks and thus offers more in the way of future value creation upside than downside. ", "Overall we emerged from Q1 2015 with strong operating momentum and conviction that despite one of the tougher operating environments in recollections, we can continue to perform well. In a few minutes I will conclude my section with some commentary on how we plan to keep the growth and operating margin expansion momentum going, but first I will provide some color on segment level performance, starting with Tools and Storage, which offered up another outstanding quarter. ", "Total Tools and Storage revenue was up 3% and operating margins grew 21% to 15.7%, demonstrating impressive operating leverage. Gains resulted from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operations productivity and tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset the severe currency headwinds. Organic growth was again in double digit territory, this time 10%. North America was up 15%, Europe once again delivered outsized growth, in this case up 9% organically. Emerging markets were flat as 9% growth in Latin America was wiped out by a steep greater than 50% decline in Russia and minus 8% in Asia, as softness in China prevailed. The mid-price point product rollout continues to proceed well and this important initiative provided support for the emerging market organic revenues and prevented them from contraction in the quarter. ", "Across Global Tools and Storage, organic strength was broad-based once again, with Professional Power Tools up 13%, Consumer Power Tools up 10%, Accessories up 13% and Hand Tools and Storage up 7%. All categories benefited from strong new product introduction momentum and customer level execution. POS and major box customers in the US was robust despite less than ideal weather conditions and aggregate weeks in hand decrease during the quarter. We believe sell-through in the hardware lumber store and staff channels was also very strong as both resi and non-resi construction markets benefited from good growth in end user demand. Industrial markets in the US were somewhat weaker than we saw in 2014, but still positive. Our best guess is that the total US tool market was up about 5% including power tools, which we believe was up a slightly higher rate, maybe 7%. The European market, as measured in local currency, continued to be soft, perhaps up a point or two. In the developed markets, we believe we continued our share gain momentum during the quarter. ", "As Tools and Storage, which was previously known as CDIY and IAR recently combined, continues to rack up gains now in its combined form, the question we often get is what exactly is management doing to drive the performance? The simple answer is we are taking a great asset, feeding the new product innovation machine and coupling it with outstanding commercial and supply chain execution. By combining Stanley and Black and Decker five years ago, we created the world\u2019s leading tool company with power tools, hand tools, storage and accessories as well as a broad array of leading brands, global scale and the only tool company in the world with meaningful presence across all four major channels, construction, DIY, industrial and automotive repair. ", "We executed the integration well, extracting over $500 million of cost synergies and greatly exceeding our original targets for both cost and revenue synergies. Most importantly, we fused these companies together by creating a winning culture with both an innovation growth orientation and operational discipline enabled by the Stanley fulfillment system. What we are experiencing today in terms of performance is the manifestation of all the above. It was a great idea on paper. In practice, it is exceeding our expectations. We look forward to delving more deeply into this story as well as offering insight into how we plan to keep the growth going with those of you who are interested at our upcoming Analyst Day on May 15. ", "Now moving to security, it was a modestly successful in line quarter for security, which registered 2% organic growth and 110 basis points of operating margin rate accretion while facing an overall 6% revenue decline as FX took its toll. Nonetheless, operating margin was up 4%. North America and emerging markets revenue was up 2% organically and Europe was up 1% on the same basis. Notably, the European team delivered the first organic growth quarter for this unit since Niscayah was acquired in 2011. This came on the heels of a flat organic growth performance in 4Q 2014. ", "During several 2014 investor conference calls, we foreshadowed that the next marker in the European turn around would be shifting from negative organic growth to modestly positive growth, something we expected to occur sometime in 2015. Having first wrestled the European attrition to rates within our targets range of 10% to 12% during the first half of 2014, as of 1Q 2015, we have stabilized the value of our recurring revenue portfolio and are now in a position to achieve positive overall European security organic growth and a prospective basis. The benefit of revenue stabilization was clear in the quarter as the team delivered its internal operating margin commitment, a $4 million increase over prior year. Late last week, I visited with them in London and I can say that they\u2019re fully grounded in what they have to do to continue the positive trend and they have both the substance and the strength of conviction to back it up. I will look for continued progress on that front. ", "The other really positive turnaround news in security was the commercial lock business in North America with delivered 4% organic growth, their first positive growth quarters since fully converting to the independent distribution model in early 2013. And also on a positive note, Automatic Doors continued along its strong growth trajectory. ", "In summary now, two full quarters into the leadership adjustment in both Europe and North America, the early returns are promising. Both units are poised to deliver improving organic revenue and operating margin results while continuing their recent track record of predictability. And as I mentioned last quarter, we expect the overall security recovery to be slow and steady during the next several quarters, but we do expect it to continue to gain momentum as 2015 progress. ", "Now turning to industrial. Industrial had a mixed quarter, with an outstanding performance from Engineered Fastening, the largest part of it, offset by market related issues in oil and gas. The net result was a 2% decrease in revenue with 6% organic growth. But oil and gas deleveraging and FX pressures decreased operating margins by $12 million or 14%, bringing the rate down 210 basis points to a still respectable 15.3%. Engineered Fastening achieved a very strong 12% organic growth, including a plus 20% performance in the automotive sector, aided by strong equipment and fastener growth. This was in contrast to global light vehicle production, which was up 1%. With about two thirds of their business overseas, FX wiped out 10 points of Engineered Fastening revenue growth. So their total revenue was up only 2%. Nonetheless, they achieved both absolute margin growth and rate accretion.", "Infrastructure, which includes oil and gas and hydraulic, was down 15%. Oil and gas, approximately 2% of total company revenues, was down 23% organically as the market related contraction in pipeline activity depressed the topline. All in all, a solid operational performance by the Engineered Fastening team mitigated, but could not completely offset the OM pressure from both the market related issues in oil and gas and currency. ", "There were a lot of moving parts to our total company first quarter story, but the punch line is 8% organic growth with 120 basis points of OM expansion, while overcoming well over 100 basis points of year over year currency headwinds. Clearly this management team is executing in a high level despite numerous external obstacles, with the biggest being the strong dollar. We have confidence in our total year outlook that we will continue to overcome these obstacles and deliver. However, a natural question from the investment community is, what\u2019s next? We plan to answer that question for both the total company and for its individual parts on May 15 during our Investor Day at our Tools and Storage headquarters in Towson, Maryland.", "An important part of the story will be a deep dive into the Stanley fulfillment system 2.0, otherwise known as SFS 2.0. This is an initiative which we have been quietly working on for over a year. It is the next chapter in the evolution of SFS, which many of you know is a key element of our culture and has been for over eight years. SFS has enabled us to achieve a high level of customer facing supply chain execution and working capital efficiency, as well as generating well over a billion dollars of free cash flow since its inception. SFS 2.0 is the next generation of that business system, which focuses on fueling additional organics growth and margin expansion in the coming years. ", "It is an exciting set of initiatives which provides us with a clear path to differentiated out performance, leveraging off the base that we have already created. The initiatives are listed on this slide. It starts with core SFS, which is simply a continuation of what we have been doing for years, supplemented by four new elements; Digital Excellent, Breakthrough Innovation, Commercial Excellence and Functional Transformation. We will provide greater insight into these elements as well as business strategies, portfolio strategy and acquisition criteria as well as capital allocation and financial objectives at the upcoming May Investor Day.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, our CFO for his comments.", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. I\u2019m going to start by spending a little time on our first quarter free cash flow performance, which was an outflow of $243 million. This was relatively consistent with prior year and typical of normal seasonality that we see in our company where our inventory levels rise, especially in the Tools and Storage business to ensure we\u2019re adequately prepared for Q2 and Q3 demands of key customers, in particular in a mature or developed market. However, the incremental investment we made in Tools and Storage inventory during the first quarter of this year was modestly higher than normal as we managed through the west coast port strike and we prepared for strong organics growth to re-occur in the second quarter of this year. ", "The core SFS principle Jim just mentioned require agility to respond when business conditions change, such as strong organic growth such as we have experienced over the last three quarters. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital and asset efficiency levels that are considered world class compared to other industrial and security peers. SFS continues to assist us on our journey to 10 times working capital turns. But we want to ensure that we are agile in changing market conditions, just like we saw over the last few quarters. ", "Due to our confidence in our ability to generate at least $1 billion of free cash flow during 2015, as John mentioned, we were able to accelerate our share repurchase activity relating to our repurchase program that we announced at the end of 2013. By using a mixture of cash repurchases and equity derivatives, we took actions to lower the share count by roughly 8 million shares within the first quarter and 9.6 million shares since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2014. This brings our cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of approximately $900 million for the program that we announced in the fourth quarter of 2013. ", "Moving to page 11, as John touched on and as all of us are well aware, another significant weakening of currencies versus the US dollar occurred during February and March of this year. Given this shift, I would like to spend a few minute updating you on our 2015 foreign current impact. For us, it resulted in significant incremental currency pressure, most notably from movements in the Brazilian Real, many other Latin American currencies and several other currencies that moved in concert with the Euro. The result of these fluctuations has created a total negative annual impact of $200 million to $220 million versus 2014, which in an incremental headwind of $60 million to $70 million versus what we communicated during our earnings call in January. As a remainder, these amounts are net of our derivative hedging activities. ", "The incremental currency headwinds of $60 million to $70 million have been broad based and in fact out top exposures in the Brazilian Real, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Argentinian Peso, represent only approximately $30 million of this incremental impact, with two thirds of that $30 million impact due specifically to the Brazilian Real. This demonstrates the positive impact of our Euro and Canadian dollar hedging program in 2015. As you may recall, I spoke of increased hedges on the Euro and Canadian dollar in January and while those currencies moved negatively during the first quarter, much of that impact was mitigated by these hedges. The remaining portion of the $60 million to $70 million incremental headwind from currency is caused by exposures in approximately 20 countries around the world, which clearly demonstrates the broad based nature of this currency movement.", "As we have reviewed during past calls, we attempt to mitigate these currency impacts in our P&L beyond what we do in hedging activities through a multi-stepped approach. The first is pursuing customer pricing increases where large transactional FX headwinds emerge due to importing of US dollar-based products or components specifically into countries such as Canada, Brazil and even parts of Europe. ", "The second area of focus is we focus on improving our cost base thought he pursuit of likely commodity deflation in this environment, which we have been seeing in the last three to six months as well as we evaluate pulling forward certain specific cost rationalization projects for selected businesses and function to ensure that we try to offset this impact. And then the last area which we can never lose sight of is the long term pursuit of increasing our localized production and component supply in certain key emerging markets around the world to minimize this impact. So in summary on this page, we continue to activity manage a difficult currency environment with a proactive approach that has enabled us to manage near time volatility, but at the same time balancing the requirement of continuing to invest for future growth. ", "Let\u2019s move to page 12 and talk about 2015 EPS outlook. As indicated by John and Jim\u2019s comments earlier, we are reiterating 2015 guidance as $5.65 to $5.85 EPS and free cash flow of at least $1 billion as the strong organic growth performance in Tools and Storage, combined with an acceleration of our share repurchase actions, has allowed us to offset the incremental currency headwinds that I just described. Let\u2019s walk through these assumptions which led to a neutral impact on our guidance in all more detail. ", "First, we expect organic growth to be approximately 5% versus our prior expectation of 3% to 4%. This change recognizes the strong organic growth momentum that emerged in the second half of 2014 with our Tools and Storage business, which we expect to continue for the coming months. Additionally, as we saw in the first quarter, our two other segments are generally on track to their planned organic growth rates and we expect this trend to continue for the reminder of the year. This overall improved organic growth performance contributes an incremental $0.25 of EPS impact for the full year of 2015, which is over and above the $0.45 to $0.55 EPS benefit we described in our initial guidance back in January. ", "The second item is our ability to accelerate our share count action in the first quarter of 2015 given our confidence in cash flow outlook that I described earlier. Specifically, we executed cash repurchases and equity derivatives that reduced our share count by approximately 8 million shares. Our prior assumption was that much of these actions were to occur during the second half of 2015. We did increase our debt levels modestly to execute this plan, and combined with normal first quarter seasonality of cash outflow, this increase in debt will be a temporary phenomenon. The results of these share count actions are a benefit of approximately $0.10 of EPS over and above the initial range we provided in January of $0.09 to $0.12 of EPS. ", "Then finally, as I just covered in a fair amount of detail, we expect to $200 million to $220 million of currency pressure given the strengthening of the US dollar over the past 90 days, versus our prior expectation of $140 million to $150 million. This will generate an incremental $0.30 to $0.35 of EPS headwind for 2015. Also keep in mind that our other planning assumptions, including tax rates and restructuring costs remain the same for the full year. ", "There\u2019s three other items that are important to take note of related to guidance as you start to think about the different quarters and how they stage for the full year. The first item though is related to revenue and the adverse currency impact is now expected to be approximately 7% versus our prior assumption of approximately 4% to 5% for the full year. This will result in total revenues being down approximately 2% on the full year. Second item is restructuring charges in the first half of 2015 will approximate 80% of our full year expected restructuring charges of $50 million. ", "Then finally I remind everyone to recognize the seasonality of revenues and profitability that happens in our company every year in the first half. We expect that our operating margin as a percentage of the full year to be relatively consistent with 2014 when you evaluate first half versus second half. However, higher planned restructuring charges and the higher tax rate in the first half of 2015 will result in first half EPS approximating 43% of the full year EPS, which is modestly lower than the 2014 first half as a percentage of the full year and clearly due to the dynamics of restructuring and tax. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to segments, which are presented on the right side of the page and in our reporting structure. We expect mid to single high digit organic growth in the Tools and Storage business, as well as solid operating margin rate expansion year over year. The operating margin expansion is expected to be due to volume leverage, cost actions and price which more than offset the negative currency impact. Organic growth within this segment is expected to remain strong in the first half and show lower levels of growth in the back half as we begin to experience more difficult comparables. Our security segment will have a modest organic revenue growth for the full year, with the margin rate increasing versus the prior year. The organic growth in security in North America and emerging markets will compliment an improving performance in security Europe, which started the year with good momentum as you heard from Jim earlier. ", "Profitability in security will continue to improve versus prior year, from volume leverage and cost actions, which again will allow us to more than offset the foreign currency impact. We expect solid year over year profit improvement as we continue progressing forward with our security Europe multiyear recovery plan. Then finally for industrial, we expect solid mid-single digit organic growth as Engineered Fastening strengths will be able to offset the expected declines in our oil and gas business. However, due to the now increased importance of oil and gas as a percentage of this particular segment, we do expect margins to be relatively flat versus the prior year as volume leverage generated by Engineered Fastening will be offset by the deleveraging impact of oil and gas due to the sluggish market conditions in that particular business. This assumption change more about the impact of recasting our reporting segments than it is a change in business assumptions since January. ", "In summary, the strength of our Tools and Storage organic growth, combined with accelerated share count actions, offsets the higher foreign currency impact I just described. Therefore we still expect to achieve solid operating leverage and healthy organic growth even with the incremental currency headwinds, which means we expect earnings will expand 5% to 9% on an overall revenue decline of 2% in 2015. Additionally, we believe we will continue to demonstrate strong free cash flow as it would be at least $1 billion. ", "To summarize the presentation portion of our call today, we believe we delivered a very strong start to the year and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with the strong robust organic growth story in the first quarter of 8%. Focused on the tight cost control and surgical price actions across our entire company, which enabled an excellent Q1 operating leverage in the face of $50 million of currency headwinds. Security took another positive step forward on its multi-year transformation, with 2% organic growth and year over year profit growth. Then finally, because of our confidence in our free cash flow outlook, we were able to accelerate our share repurchase program, which means we\u2019ve really completed $900 million of our program since the fourth quarter of last year in the program that we announced back in the end of 2013. ", "Our operational focus in 2015 will continue to be on improving near term returns and the relative performance of our company through organic growth initiatives, the security margin improvement and stability and continued growth organically, cost and pricing actions and of course our ongoing working capitals focus. We believe this approach was very successful in2014 and again here in the first quarter and we will continue this focus for the remainder of 2015 and beyond as it does position our company to deliver on the long-term financial objectives that we have established. ", "That concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let\u2019s move to Q&A.", "Gregory Waybright", "Great. Thanks Don. John, we can now open the call to Q&A, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.", "Jeff Sprague", "Thank you very much, gentlemen. You made a very busy day a little easier here today. I have one question really on your cost actions and kind of thinking about the holistic nature of them. And really the nature of my question is, these offsetting actions you are taking, would you view them all as structural and permanent? Or should we expect some of this to come back the other way as perhaps the FX pressures hopefully wane at some point in the future? If you could give us a little context around that, I think it would be very helpful. Thank you.", "John Lundgren", "Yeah, absolutely. So we embarked on this journey of cost actions in a more significant way about a year and half to two years ago and one of our main objectives was to take actions that were permanent in nature and not temporary that would result in some type of snapback of costs in the future. We\u2019ve been targeting areas such as indirect spend, which is basically all costs that are non-people related and putting forth policy changes, structural changes, procurement changes, etc., that are driving a lot of those benefits. And they\u2019re permanent changes that we expect to be maintained over the long term. ", "The other thing that we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken specific headcount restructuring actions related to the combination of our CDIY and IAR business for Tools and Storage. We\u2019ve taken some corporate headcount actions, as well as some of our other businesses that are more surgical in nature that will allow us to really continue to focus on productivity and driving a more efficient P&L Because of this approach and these different types of actions, it really gives us confidence that it\u2019s not of the nature that we are just pushing down costs on a temporary basis and we will experience some snapback in the future.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Rick Kwas from Wells Fargo.", "Rich Kwas", "Good morning, gentlemen. In terms of the competitive environment with regards to currency, any changes you've noticed here in the US with competitive actions from foreign-based entities? And then quick follow up, hedging activity for 2016, Don, does this leave you in a position where you're going to still get hit in 2016 unless you put incremental hedges in? How should we think about that as we look forward here? Thank you. ", "Donald Allan", "Yeah I\u2019ll take the latter one first. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve done a lot of hedging activities specifically around the Euro and the Canadian dollar. The benefit we are getting for that here in 2015 or the neutralization I guess of currency is about $70 million. And so that would be an impact that we would see in 2016. We\u2019ll also have a modest carry over impact by some of the recent currency movements we\u2019ve seen. So we think going into next year, there is about $100 million headwind for currency that some of which we are focused on how we deal with through hedging activities, but we are also focused on what cost actions we can take as we go into 2016 to offset that impact as well. Similar to what we\u2019ve done over the last two years, we are going to take a very similar approach to that as we embark into 2016 as well. And Jim maybe you want to answer the comment on \u2026", "James Loree", "On the competitive environment in the US and whether there have been any changes related to the FX dislocation that\u2019s occurred. Most of our, in fact all of our major competitors have global footprints that are relatively similar. Our major European based competitor has a little bit more European footprint in terms of supply chains and our major Japanese competitor has a little bit more in Japan. But we all have a lot in China, Mexico and other low cost areas around the world. So there really isn\u2019t a major structural change to the cost competitors that is created by the dislocation. I think we are all responding -- all competitors are responding as you might expect, which is in the emerging markets where we are shipping into those markets from dollar stable kinds of -- or dollar, like Chinese or dollar denominated supply chains, there is a fair amount of price appreciation going on to partially offset the currency impact and then the US is always brutally competitive and continues to be brutally competitive.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.", "David MacGregor", "Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter and all the progress. I guess the CDIY, your incremental margins were substantially larger than I'd expected and obviously there's an awful lot going on in that segment right now. But I guess the question is just how much of this is from the combination of the IAR business and are these contribution margins expected to sustain through the rest of the year?", "John Lundgren", "David, very fair question. There are cost benefits to the combination of the IAR business. They\u2019re quite small relative to the volume leverage particularly the advantage of a prolific new product development process that really was founded or grounded in our CDIY business. It\u2019s now incorporating IAR. So roughly three quarters, two thirds of the benefit and ability to maintain margins is due to the volume leverage new products and incremental margins and only a small portion would be due to the -- there are some cost benefits, but that is truly the icing on the cake rather than the driver for putting these two businesses together. ", "James Loree", "But as far as the impact in the quarter or in the past couple of quarters, it\u2019s been nil. This is just getting going, so the impact that John just described is yet to come.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Robert Barry", "Good morning. Congrats on a very solid quarter. Wanted to just talk a little more about the organic growth outlook. You raised it by 1 to 2 points and wanted to clarify how much of that is stronger end markets versus better momentum on your own initiatives and to the extent that it's the markets, where are you seeing any incremental strength or weakness?", "John Lundgren", "Yeah, I\u2019ll take a shot at that and I\u2019ll certainly ask Jim or Don to chime in. It is overwhelmingly share gains in our case. 50% of our revenue roughly is in the US. Those markets are slightly stronger than we\u2019d anticipate. But you saw our Global Tools and Storage business up 12% in the quarter. So there\u2019s significant share gain there. Europe as I said in my piece of the presentation, globally the markets are up 2% at best. Some estimates are flat and we are up six 6%. So again, it\u2019s easily 3X the market growth rate. Now Tools and Storage business is up more than that. So again share gains. I think the wild card is in the emerging markets, which collectively represent about 20% of our revenue. They\u2019re up but at a much lower rate as Jim mentioned in his piece of the presentation. Certain markets like China and Russia are down, but in total the emerging markets are growing at low single digits and so are we. So simply said, the overwhelming majority of what you\u2019ve seen in our numbers is share gain and again it\u2019s focused in our Global Tools and Storage business and our Engineered Fastening business. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley", "Mike Sang", "Hey, good morning guys. It's actually Mike Sang in for Nigel. I didn't see capital deployment guidance and I apologize if you talked about it, but you didn't change your free cash guidance, but to the extent you do better on free cash this year, how should we think about where you'll spend that incremental upside?", "Donald Allan", "This is Don. We didn\u2019t specifically give guidance related to capital deployment. What we have said about this year though is our primary objective was to complete our program of up to $1 billion of share repurchase and you could argue that we\u2019ve pretty much done that with $900 million of it completed at this point in time. We also said that we have opened up our -- reopened our funnel of BD opportunities over the last six months or so and we are evaluating different things and we may have some types of small acquisition later in the year of modest size. But that\u2019s really about what the plan is at this stage and we feel good about where we are. If we outperform our cash flow, we\u2019ll have to evaluate the timing of that and would make sense based on what\u2019s happening in BD as well as what our stock is trading at that point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse", "Mike Dahl", "Hi, thanks and quite a nice quarter again. Some pretty challenges conditions with the FX side. I wanted to go back to one of the prior comments on walking around the regions. John, I think you've been clear that some of these European comps, a lot of it's been driven by some tremendous share growth and new product innovation. What's the expectation as far as -- I know you mentioned that you think it'll moderate, but has the continued strength caused you to push out your expectation for how long you can keep a four or five point premium to the market growth on that side of the business?", "John Lundgren", "Sure. I'm going to have Jim walk you through that, but remember we\u2018ve got a stated objective of growing at 2x the rate of the market and we\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job in our Global Tools and Storage business. But Jim, I know you want to shade more light on that.", "James Loree", "It's a great question because the comps are -- we are comping against two years organics growth in the tool business that\u2019s averaging about 7% per quarter. When you look at the market growth and you look at that you say how long can this go on? It's very fair question, but I would say that the team in European tools in particular, but also in Engineered Fastening, those two management teams are really, really growth oriented teams. And the ability to gain share is not constrained necessary by structural conditions. If they keep executing at that level, then I think that it will be in that 4% to 6% range for a while.", "And the other thing about Europe is that even though the markets haven\u2019t picked up, the optimism in Europe is palpably higher. If you talk to business people in Europe, there\u2019s a lot of hope I guess is the best phrase or word I can think of, but not necessarily with our people. But when you just talk to people in general in Europe, there\u2019s a sentiment, a more positive sentiment than we\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. That may actually help with the market and may over time push the market up a few points and certainly that would be helpful as well. But the reality of tough difficult comps is a real one and it's one where we don\u2019t necessarily push our expectations to organic growth much higher than say 4% to 6 %. I think achieving that 2x market growth is something that we can continue to do for a while.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital", "Jeff Kessler", "Not to steal the thunder from Investor Day, but could you go over -- be a little bit more specific as to the four parts of SFS 2 and how they impacted the first quarter, how you expect them to impact the year? What are -- specifically what are they going to do? And number two, put some numbers to that to flesh it out.", "James Loree", "Sure. That\u2019s kind of like Investor Day, but I'll give you a quick snapshot.", "Jeff Kessler", "Yeah. That's all I want.", "James Loree", " The four initiatives, Digital Excellence, Breakthrough Innovations, Commercial Excellence, and Functional Transformation, we\u2019ll start with functional transformation is an approach that we are taking to reduce the cost of our staff functions if you will, so increase their efficiency while maintaining their effectiveness, which is very high. The functional transformation will yield benefits over a multi-year period, but really at the moment we are investing in this. There\u2019s an actual expense related to it in the quarter and we\u2019ll get into that at the investor day. The other three are intended to drive growth and they all require some investment, but the functional transformation is a way to fund that investment without affecting our day to day operations in a negative way. ", "Digital Excellence, we are doing a fair amount of work in that area to prioritize where we\u2019re going to make our investments. So there\u2019s not really any revenue impact from that at this point in time. There are some expenses associated with that. I think the one that has the most near term impact is Commercial Excellence because commercial excellence includes several different elements. One of those element is pricing effectiveness and you probably have noticed over the last year or so that we have been averaging about a point in price as a company and that is about a point higher than we have been doing historically. I would say virtually a large portion of that differential impact is associated with the Commercial Excellence initiative.", "There are many other parts to it. I think I used the term Commercial Excellence several times when I was discussing the CDIY or the Global Tool Business and they have really taken Commercial Excellence and each element of it and deployed it within that business to achieve some of their differentiated performance and share gains. They can do even more with Commercial Excellence and the rest of the company can really do a lot more with that. So that\u2019s what we expect to see in the future. And the final one, it's important to differentiate between what I\u2019ll call incremental innovation or day to day innovation, which I think we and our competitors all do reasonably well. We have things like, a good example do that would be the DC brushless innovation that we\u2019ve done recently and the share gain that we\u2019ve achieved through that. ", "The Breakthrough Innovation is basically taking, going beyond Incremental Innovation and really looking for those breakthroughs that can change the whole competitive framework of the industry and give us a competitive advantage. So we have studied competes in the best pockets of breakthrough innovation in the world, primarily in the US. And we have deployed some of the practices that you\u2019ll see in the valley and so forth. And we are doing some experimentation with that and we are hopeful that we can create some breakthrough innovations. In the meantime we are going full speed ahead with our normal incremental innovation and the incremental innovation is really what\u2019s driving the share gain and one of the things that\u2019s driving the share gain on the tools business today. That\u2019s a quick snapshot. There\u2019s plenty more to come on May 15.", "John Lundgren", "Jeff. Just let me tie that up in a bow without -- and Jim there I think did a very nice job of not stealing our own thunder for Investor Day because we\u2019ve got a lot of communicate. We want communicate it very coherently and systematically all in the same place. But SFS or SFS 1.0 if you like was focused on operational excellence. We think we\u2019ve done a very, very good job and working capital turns have doubled as a result of that. Eliminate ways to eliminate complexity, unless it adds a benefit that the customer is willing to pay for and so forth. You\u2019ve heard us talk about it a lot. We think we\u2019ve gotten it down. We\u2019ve been at it about eight years and we think it truly, truly is imbedded in the DNA of this company. What Jim described is an effort -- in terms of when will the benefits come, we are paying as we go and I think Jim described that perfectly in terms of we\u2019re investing in getting a little bit of benefit. ", "The future benefits will come well down the road just like they have with SFS. But importantly, it is all designed to embed a growth culture, first establish an embedded growth culture within the company. If we look at all our long-term objectives, we\u2019ve done a really good job meeting or exceeding all of them with the exception of organic growth, where over the years we\u2019ve been at 3% to 4%, which is then about the industry average, about our competitors average, peer group average. Of late, we\u2019ve stepped that up due to some phenomenal results from the incremental growth platforms and programs that Jim described. Long-term we are looking to drive that up and just embed it into our culture and have it become equally as important in our DNA as we think running our operations effectively and efficiently has become.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.", "Jeremie Capron", "Thanks and good morning. I wanted to follow up on your commentary on pricing. You had a full point of price gains in the quarter, and you sounded pretty dismissive in terms of any deterioration in the pricing environment globally, yet we're seeing a peeled down train in commodity prices. My question really is how sustainable do you think your price gains are for the remainder of the year and what sort of dynamics are you seeing in terms of your price cost. It looks like a nice tailwind here.", "Donald Allan", "Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. Yeah, we were very pleased as John mentioned with our price performance in Q1. We\u2019ve talked about price as a company on and off over the last decade several times, but in the last year, year and half, we\u2019ve really put a significant emphasis on gaining price in different ways across many of our businesses. It\u2019s not always just about list price. It\u2019s about other types of activities that happen with your customers and really trying to drive the maximum value associated with the product or the service that you\u2019re providing to your customer. That emphasis has not changed. There has been a new dynamic as you mentioned in the last six months or so where commodities have moved in a certain direction it\u2019s been a benefit to companies like us. ", "The reality for us is the number is not overly significant. We touched on it briefly back in January. It\u2019s roughly $50 million of benefits for us on an annualized basis. At this point in time, we continue to evaluate that as we go into next year and see what other opportunities we have. But it\u2019s not really large enough to drive a significant pricing discussion across an $11 billion enterprise like our company. If that dynamic ever changes, then we could potentially have the circumstances that you described and we have gone through those cycles. But we have put significant routines and processes in place around pricing to really deal with these types of dynamics and make sure that we understand the levels of profitability that we are achieving on key products, especially what we call our A products and services that we provide and I don\u2019t expect that focus to change. I actually expect it to accelerate and become more mature overtime.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please go ahead.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Your growth domestically on Tools and Storage was pretty strong. You have brought back manufacturing to the US. Has that program helped drive organic sales growth and do you plan on adding more capacity in the US?", "John Lundgren", "Yeah, Liam I\u2019ll take it. The answer is absolutely yes. Yes and yes. Simply said, we knew -- it\u2019s turned to be not a terrific hedge in terms of production costs, because when we first brought this production back we had total delivered product cost. Obviously we took a lot of product off the water in time and improved our working capital turns. We had costs within flat to 5% and we are driving that down towards cost neutral relative to some of the low cost countries. It\u2019s probably not at parity now given the strength of the dollar. That means, but we knew it was a good thing to do in terms of supply chain, satisfying our customers, keeping fill rates above 98%. We underestimated the positive impact customer reaction, particularly in the industrial distribution channel and what we call the two step channel of the, quite frankly the loyalty. It created the incredibly positive reaction from professional contractors and folks working in manufacturing facilities around the country. ", "So we are very pleased with not only our ability to get the facilities up and running, we\u2019re very pleased with -- we\u2019re delighted by the customer reaction. As a consequence, we\u2019re looking at two other opportunities near term in the US and again, it\u2019s not going to be a step function ship, but it will be a gradual shift to expand two existing US facilities to produce more of our core products sold primarily in the US in those markets. More to come on that when it happens. We can\u2019t get ahead of ourselves in terms of our own workforce then our planning and various negotiations are currently in process. But there is more to come. As I say it will not be gigantic, but it will be incremental or an evolution versus the revolution, but based on the results to date, we\u2019ve got a lot of good reasons, qualitatively and quantitatively to do some more of this in the next 6 to 18 months.", "Operator", "Our next question is from next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Go ahead Michael with your question.", "John Lundgren", "Mike, are you on mute? ", "Gregory Waybright", "Move to the next one.", "Operator", "We have a question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "Good morning. Thank you. I just want to go back to an earlier question on the margin performance in the first quarter and the new tools and storage business. If you look year over year, that incremental margin being over 70%, and I think you talked to for the full year some of the drivers that are plus or minus. But was just hoping maybe you can talk to specific in the quarter, what the drivers were there and then how you think some of those drivers progress as you move through the year.", "John Lundgren", "Sure, we can touch on that. As we touched on obviously, we saw significant operating leverage through the organic growth. We also are seeing really solid benefits from SG&A actions that I mentioned around indirect costs. We\u2019ve seen some good pricing initiatives that drop all the way to the bottom line. It\u2019s a combination of all those factors. Of course there\u2019s also a little bit of commodity deflation occurring as well that\u2019s beneficial to this particular business. Combining that with the fact that I mentioned at the beginning, which is organic growth, you have a high level of activity happening in our plants that occur because of higher organic growth in Q1 and expected higher organic growth in Q2 well above what we experienced in the first half or the first quarter of last year. So there\u2019s certainly a leverage effect that\u2019s even greater than you would normally see because of organic growth numbers that are basically double digit.", "Operator", "And I will now turn it back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.", "Gregory Waybright", "John, thank you. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation in the call. And obviously, please contact me if you\u2019ve any further questions.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright", "Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself, is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim and Don will review our second quarter 2015 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we\u2019re going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty.", "It is, therefore, possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent '34 Act filing.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Hey. Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. This is an encouraging quarter to say the least, as everything from organic growth, the margin, earnings and capital allocation demonstrated that innovation is robust, SFS 2.0. is gaining traction and our management team and our 50,000 associates around the world are demonstrating agility and executing really well in a volatile environment and as a consequence they are overcoming numerous challenges that are well beyond their control.", "So let\u2019s get to it, second quarter organic growth of 8%, offset by currency of negative 8%, so essentially flat revenue. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of organic growth at or above 6% with Tools and Storage leading the way up with 11% organic growth. We as a company achieved and delivered growth across all three segments.", "The Black & Decker merger closed in the first quarter of 2010, more than five years ago and our operating margin in 2Q \u201815 expanded to a post-merger record of 14.4%, plus 70 basis points versus second quarter 2014.", "Volume with sharp cost focus and price realization delivered robust operating leverage despite a $50 million foreign currency pressure. There are lots of puts and takes with respect to FX and Don will provide a lot more detail around this in our estimate for the year, which still includes $200 million to $220 million of foreign exchange headwind that we have every intention of overcoming.", "Second quarter diluted EPS was a $1.54, up 11% versus prior year, overwhelmingly, on strong operational performance. And on June 23rd, we announced the dividend increase of 6% from -- to $0.55 a share from $0.52, that maintains our compelling dividend payout and as well as, an unrivaled history on the New York Stock Exchange in terms of continuity of dividend payment and increasing the dividend.", "As a consequence of a great first half and actions we are taking up for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our 2015 full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $5.70 to $5.90 from $5.65 to $5.85, so the range is now up 6% to 10% versus 2014 and that\u2019s despite a $1 to $1.10 per share foreign currency earnings pressure.", "Let\u2019s take a look at our sources of growth, which in fact were very similar in terms of both source and geography for the first quarter of 2015. Volume was up 7%. We got 1% from price, leading to the 8% organic growth that I referred to previously. No impact from acquisitions, offset by 8% price, so you see flat revenue for the year -- for the first half of the year, as well as for the second quarter.", "All geographies showed some strength, with the U.S. leading the way at 11%, strong growth in Europe [Technical Difficulty] despite relatively stagnant market condition, emerging markets as a total were up 4% despite some areas of weakness, specifically Russia and China that Jim will talk to you about in a minute, and the rest of the world was up 7%.", "So the very, very strong second quarter back to back up 8% organic growth, so enough from the total there is lots of really good news and strong momentum within each of our three segments.", "So let me turn it over to Jim to take closer look.", "Jim Loree", "Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with Tools and Storage, which continues to be a great story. Revenue was up 4% while operating margin grew 9%, we said our post-merger record with a 64.4% rate, once again demonstrating impressive operating leverage, gains resulted from volume leverage, modestly positive price, operational productivity and continued tight SG&A cost management, which more than offset another quarter of severe currency headwinds.", "Organic growth remained in double-digit territory, this time 11% averaging a noteworthy 10% over the last four quarters. All regions contributed with strong performances as North America was up 14%, Europe 7% and emerging markets accelerated to 5% growth.", "Across the global product lines, organic strength was broad-based, with Professional Power Tools up 14%, Consumer Power Tools up 15%, Accessories up 12% and Hand Tools & Storage up 5%.", "The categories benefited from strong customer level execution and new product introductions as the Tools and Storage innovation machine not only remains robust but continues to gain momentum.", "Contributing to growth within the quarter was an outdoor season, which is tracking to a more normal pattern. Against this backdrop we released the stream of new products in the category, including the DeWALT outdoor, which delivers a full line of products with the performance and runtime demanded by long care professionals that includes a compelling new [indiscernible] line which competes favorably with many gas power tools. This is a great example of DC brushless technology and advances in lithium-ion that have opened up segments that historically have not been served by cordless.", "POS was again robust to get across the channels with major big-box customers in the U.S. continuing their strength, aggregate weeks on hand, are in a good place remaining at or below prior year levels.", "We also believe sell-through in the hardware, lumber store and staff channels was very strong as both resi and non-resi markets -- construction markets benefited from good growth in end user demand.", "The e-commerce channel continues to grow an importance, particularly for the DIY end-user. This is true for both big-box and independent retailers. Not surprisingly Industrial markets in the U.S. remained somewhat weaker than we saw in 2014, but we are still positive.", "For the ninth consecutive quarter, we are able to highlight Europe at an impressive growth story for Tools. The business is averaged 7% organic growth over this time period in a relatively flat market.", "Our team continues to control their destiny by leveraging our broad stable of leading brands, launching new innovative products across categories and adding new points of distribution. European Tools represents a prime example of commercial excellence and action as we define it in SFS 2.0.", "Growth within Tools emerging markets accelerated in the quarter as a double-digit performance in Latin America and solid growth in India, Turkey, the Middle East and Africa was enough to overcome a steep market related decline in Russia and a weak performance in China.", "The mid-price point product rollout led by our Stanley Power Tool line continues to proceed successfully and this important initiative provided support for emerging market growth amidst volatile underlying market conditions.", "And looking at the markets, our estimate is that the U.S. is growing about 5% to 7%. In constant currency, the European market is slightly positive and the emerging markets are growing about 2% to 3%. On a global basis, this takes our total market growth in 2Q at about 3% to 4%, which when compared with our 11% organic performance implies continued share again.", "Many ask us whether or not the high levels of growth can continue as the comps get tougher and global GDP trends slightly lower. Our response has been consistent. Organic growth in the double digits against this backdrop will be difficult to sustain, however, in the environment we are operating in. This business has the ability to deliver growth within our 4% to 6% targeted levels on an ongoing basis.", "We have leading brands, global scale and organization that continue to raise its own high standards for innovation, as well for commercial and supply chain excellence. And clearly we are well on the way to creating the organic growth culture and vision when we integrated Stanley and Black & Decker. SFS 2.O is the new catalyst, which will continue to drive momentum.", "Now moving to security. We continue to make progress on most underlying businesses in security, although this quarter it was two steps forward and one back. Execution in both Europe and the North America Mechanical Locking businesses was very encouraging. However, North American convergent, we are continuing to deal with growing pains related to an increasingly complex business mix, specifically installing jobs efficiently.", "It was truly a watershed quarter for Europe, where the list of the compliments, including 3% organic growth and double-digit order rates, attrition within target ranges and the successful sale of Spain and Italy, with nominal but positive cash proceeds.", "Our European management team is executing well and delivering their turnaround commitments. North American Mechanical Lock business also showed excellent progress with 4% organic growth and improving profitability.", "The business looks to finally be emerging from the challenges of the distribution model change era and is now focused on revitalizing its performance through innovation and commercial excellence.", "The biggest challenge of the quarter was in our North American Electronics business, where continued gains in vertical markets were achieved at the expense of core growth as the team struggled with the efficient installation of some of the larger, more complex vertical market jobs.", "These challenges are well understood and being addressed by our new and capable management team. Softness in Asia also cut into security 2Q organic growth and profitability.", "So, overall, we made some very good operational progress in the quarter with some isolated and manageable issues. We continued to be confident in a positive trajectory for security and remain committed to our assessment of its strategic fit by the second half of 2016.", "Now turning to Industrial. Industrial had a solid quarter, led by another steady performance from Engineered Fastening and Resilient Infrastructure business, the latter of which is battling significant market headwinds in oil and gas and hydraulics.", "The net result was a 4% decrease in revenue as 4% organic growth was more than offset by an 8 point negative currency headwind. Margins rebounded sequentially to 19.1% and expanded 140 basis points versus 2014, while operating margin grew by $3 million or 3%. Volume leverage across Engineered Fastening and Oil and Gas, combined with tight cost controls and pricing, more than offset the negative profit impact of foreign exchange.", "Engineered Fastening delivered a 4% organic performance, led by high single-digit automotive growth, once again outpacing light vehicle production, which was relatively flat.", "Additionally, we saw solid growth within Electronics. This was offset lower North American Industrial sales tied to a slowing market. So it was an impressive quarter of organic growth and margin expansion despite the translational currency headwinds experienced within the business.", "Infrastructure which include oil and gas and hydraulics, was up 3%, quite an accomplishment considering the market exposures of these businesses. Oil and gas benefited from a large international equipment sale, which contributed to 11% organic growth for the quarter.", "We still expect this business to decline organically for the full year, but this quarter's results are a great example of the team\u2019s willingness to drive forward in the face of market headwinds. Growth was moderated by a 13% decline within the hydraulics business, which services demolition markets that are highly correlated to the vagaries of the scrap steel market. All in all, it was a solid operational performance in industrial with organic growth and margin expansion despite soft markets and significant currency headwinds.", "But as you look at this quarter's performance in the aggregate for the company, it represents another strong quarter with 8% organic growth, record operating margin levels that expanded 70 basis points in the face of 80 basis points of year-over-year currency headwinds. Our management team continues to execute at a high level, overcoming numerous external obstacles, including the strong dollar and dynamic end markets to produce exceptional results.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Don Allan", "Thank you, Jim. Good morning. I\u2019d like to start by spending a little bit time on our second quarter and year-to-date free cash flow performance. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $247 million, which brings us to a relatively neutral performance on a year-to-date basis.", "The quarterly and the year-to-date declines versus the prior year are explained by carrying higher amounts of inventory compared to last year to service the increased levels of organic growth we are experiencing, primarily within Tools & Storage business. We do, however, continue to realize benefits from applying our core SFS process and principles. And for the second quarter, we achieved seven working capital turns, which was two times of a turn expansion versus the prior year.", "We are confident that we will deliver a continued improvement in 2015 towards our vision of 10 plus working capital turns for the company. We will continue to monitor the working capital levels closely to ensure they are adequate to support our higher growth expectations for the full year. The core SFS principles require agility to respond when business conditions change such as the strong organic growth we've experienced in the last four quarters.", "SFS has enabled us to reach working capital on asset efficiency levels that are considered world-class compared to our Industrial and Security peers, but at the same time allowing us to be agile in changing market conditions to ensure we meet our customers\u2019 needs.", "I\u2019d also like to spend a little bit of time and give you a quick update on our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we executed cash repurchases of approximately $100 million. Taking into account all the actions to date, this brings the cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of approximately $1 billion, which fully achieves our plan announced back in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "As we reviewed during our Investor Day in May, you should expect us to return over time to a capital allocation of approximately 50% of our free cash flow being deployed to M&A and the remaining 50% back to our shareholders via dividend or the occasional optimistic share repurchase.", "So let\u2019s move to page 10 and spend a little bit of time on the 2015 outlook. As indicated by John earlier, we are increasing the 2015 EPS guidance range to $5.70 to $5.90 versus the previous range of $5.65 to $5.85. This is due to stronger organic growth as well as additional indirect cost savings, which will be partially reduced by slower margin improvement trajectory within Security.", "So let\u2019s walk through a little bit of the detailed around these assumptions to provide a level of information that leads to a $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our prior outlook guidance range. First, we expect organic growth to be approximately 6% versus our prior expectations of approximately 5%.", "This change recognizes the strong organic growth momentum that continues with our Tools & Storage business. Additionally, we are increasing our expectation modestly within Engineered Fastening due to the solid first half trends within that business. These improve growth expectations, combined with all of our other businesses tracking to their planned organic growth rates results in an overall improved performance for 2015.", "This overall improved growth performance contributes an incremental $0.15 EPS impact over and above the EPS benefit that was included in our guidance last quarter. The next item I\u2019d like to touch on is the work we\u2019ve been doing on our indirect cost savings programs across the company that continue to yield benefit throughout 2015.", "This should contribute approximately an additional $0.05 of EPS benefit versus our last quarter's guidance as well. So the total of those two items contribute $0.20 in positive momentum versus our April guidance. Finally, we now expect a slower trajectory of margin improvement within Security, due primarily to the North American electronics project mix matter that was described by Jim earlier. This represents a headwind of approximately $0.15 of EPS for 2015 versus our April guidance assumptions.", "All the other planning assumptions within guidance, including FX, tax rate, shares and restructuring costs remain the same. But I would like to spend a little time discussing FX, but there has been various movements in currency over the past few months. However, based on the present spot rates this week, our current estimate of 2015 versus the prior year is still within our April range of $200 million to $220 million. Significant movements in the British pound, the euro, Canadian dollar and Brazilian real over the past few months have netted to a relatively neutral impact versus that April estimate.", "A few other key items of note relative to our annual EPS guidance that you should be aware of. The first item is restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2015, will approximate 30% of the full year expectation of $50 million. There is some timing shift from the second quarter into the third quarter for several key actions.", "The second item is related to the third quarter as well. I have a few comments that I want you to understand related the timing for the back half of the year. First, we obviously expect higher planned restructuring charges in the third quarter versus our April estimate, as well as a higher tax rate in that quarter as well.", "Combining that with the significant currency headwind, this will result in the third quarter EPS of approximately 24% to 25% of the full year EPS estimate. Another factor to consider when you look at the third quarter is the operating margin rate. It will be relatively flat versus the prior year, as we experienced the largest quarterly impact of currency headwinds during this quarter, which is estimated at this point to be approximately $75 million.", "Let\u2019s turn to segments on the right side of the page. We expect high single-digit organic revenue growth, solid operating margin expansion year-over-year in the Tools & Storage segment, due to the volume leverage, cost actions, price and other significant positive actions that Jim touched on earlier in his commentary, which will more than offset the significant currency headwind we are experiencing in that business. Organic growth is expected to decelerate slightly in the back half on more difficult comparables but still will be at very healthy levels.", "Moving to our Security segment, we still expect to have modest organic growth for the full year. The organic growth in Security North America will compliment an improving performance in Security Europe, which continued its good momentum in the second quarter as you heard from Jim. This growth will be partially offset by declines within the China markets, as we continue to see some pressure in that part of the business.", "Profitability will be relatively flat versus the prior year as Security Europe will deliver solid year-over-year profit growth and North America mechanical will have healthy volume leverage. However, these improvements are being offset by negative North America electronics project mix as well as lower volumes within China.", "As Jim stated earlier on the call and we have stated previously several times, the multi-year growth in margin rates recovery trajectory of this business will not necessarily be linear. And we will have occasional timing dynamics to work through resulting from the ongoing transformational activities.", "Now moving to Industrial, we still expect solid mid-single-digit organic growth as Engineered Fastening strengths will be able to move -- to more than offset the declines in our infrastructure business. We also expect margins to be flat to up versus prior year as volume leverage generated by Engineered Fastening and cost controls will more than offset the deleveraging impact of both of our infrastructure businesses due to the sluggish market conditions that were touched upon by Jim.", "In summary, our revised EPS guidance range demonstrates the impact of our organic growth strength, combined with indirect cost savings, which are more than offsetting the slower margin improvement trajectory within Security. Therefore, we will achieve solid operating margin leverage and a robust organic growth even with significant currency headwinds, which means, we expect earnings will expand 6% to 10% on an overall revenue decline of approximately 1% in 2015.", "The last thing to touch on this page is related to our free cash outlook for the year, which we still anticipate be at least a $1 billion. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring the relatively higher levels of working capital experienced in first half of the year to ensure our working capital is adequate to service the higher organic growth expectations for the full year.", "This dynamic could put modest pressure on our free cash estimates for 2015. So let\u2019s summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We delivered a very strong first half for the year and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with another quarter of strong organic growth, our fourth in a row, at or above 6%. The proactive tight cost controls, surgical price actions across the company enabled excellent second quarter operating leverage in the face of $50 million currency headwinds.", "Progress continues with Security\u2019s multiyear transformation with favorable results in the European electronic and North America mechanical businesses. And then finally, our share count actions we have taken since the start of the fourth quarter of 2014 have effectively satisfied the approximately $1 billion of share reduction plans that we announced in November of 2013.", "As we communicated during our Investor Day in May, our focus in 2015 and beyond will be leveraging our world-class franchises and brands, strong free cash flow generation and continued shareholder friendly capital allocation. This continues to manifest itself through our focus on accelerating organic growth through SFS 2.0, advancing our Security multiyear transformation, so the portfolio review of this business is fit by the second half of 2016. Continue our disciplined approach to cost and pricing actions to ensure operating leverage is achieved.", "And ongoing focus on working capital towards our 10 plus returns goal and finally resuming M&A activity likely in the second half of 2015, with a focus on Tools & Storage and our Engineered Fastening franchises. We believe this approach will help position our company to deliver on the 2018 financial objectives we communicated back in May.", "That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now let\u2019s go to Q&A.", "Greg Waybright", "Great. Thanks. Thanks Don. Amanda, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Tim Wojs", "Yeah. Hey guys. Great job.", "John Lundgren", "Thanks Tim.", "Tim Wojs", "I guess just starting I guess my question\u2019s more in the Tools & Storage business. Could you just talk about maybe what you are seeing from a DIY and Professional Power Tools end customer standpoint? And you\u2019re starting to see I guess on the professional side -- are you starting to see employment come back in construction? Is that really a multiyear trend that will really benefit growth as we think about the next couple of years?", "John Lundgren", "Yes. Hey, Tim, this is John. It\u2019s a complex answer and that it varies a lot by geography. And I think that\u2019s the only point I want to leave you with. The trends in the US are good. As demonstrated by the numbers that Jim walked you through, we\u2019re seeing more end users, we\u2019re seeing both online purchases, purchases through the two step channel, professional purchases through the big box, all good. You see or large customer\u2019s numbers, at the same time we do. They are nicely 5% to 7%, and of course we\u2019re above double that rate. So we are gaining share.", "Now that being said, and that\u2019s 50% as you know, or 52% of our revenue is in North America. Europe is relatively flat. So our organic growth in Europe is representing growth of 2, 3, 4 times the rate of the market. It certainly hit bottom. We don\u2019t see it getting any worse. But in Europe, it\u2019s far from robust. And the rest of the world, I think Jim talked about it pretty nicely. There are certain emerging markets, China and Russia way down, China relatively flat, the rest of the world doing okay.", "But in the North American market, we are cautiously optimistic that the signs are positive. They could be better, but they are certainly more positive than they have been. That shows up in our customer\u2019s numbers and it certainly shows up in our numbers. So that\u2019s helping us maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeff Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. The phenomenal performance in tools and storages forces me to a question on security. So North American conversion, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what\u2019s going on there? Is there an issue of not pricing properly for complexity? Or is there an issue of just kind of experience and competency on bigger jobs and kind of a learning curve? Any additional color there would be helpful.", "Jim Loree", "It\u2019s Jim. I think the issue is more of a learning curve issue. It\u2019s also a little bit of an organizational issue in terms of how exactly, how we\u2019re organized and the types of people we have experience, the level of experience that we have with people installing these very complex jobs, because we\u2019re getting into highly engineered solutions with Internet of things and software. And it\u2019s much more complex than the typical historical access control and intrusion type systems that we used to have. So there is a learning curve there and there is also a bit of a talent kind of training and development issue.", "Now pricing, I think we\u2019re gaining experience on pricing. We are creating a lot of value with many of these solutions and some of the verticals we are doing a really job capturing the price, the value in the form of price and then some of the other verticals. We need to improve it as well. So I think we will see continued progress in terms of the moving up the learning curve, but it\u2019s not an overnight kind of a process.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Yes. Congratulations on a great quarter as well. In security, you talked last quarter about seeing an increased order rate and then that came through strongly this quarter and now you\u2019re talking about seeing the ordering rate in Europe continuing to grow. I guess the question is really just, what\u2019s the rate of growth you\u2019re seeing in those orders? Does that order growth have a long tail or do those orders come through much more immediately?", "Jim Loree", "The order growth definitely has a long tail. It typically averages about six months in terms of its tail and the backlog is growing in North America and in Europe, it is growing as well, I would say growing even more in North America. The European folks are doing a better job efficiently installing the backlog.", "North American folks have a growing backlog and have the opportunity to install at a faster rate, but are experiencing some learning curve issues as we just discussed. So it\u2019s all encouraging from an order rate perspective and we just need to do a better job in North America on the installation side.", "John Lundgren", "Yes, David. This is John. Just to add on because it ties into a Jeff\u2019s question earlier and I think Jeff, you are on the right track and Jim I think explained very well what it is. Within that long tail, you have a mix of obviously size of projects as well as margins. And in appropriate world, we installed a higher margin projects first, which is not always an option, obviously given contractual commitments and customer needs.", "But it\u2019s one of the more difficult businesses when we just look at open orders or backlog to forecast that on a quarterly basis because the sixth plus months of time to get these things install. So Jeff\u2019s earlier question and yours are right on. I think Jim described it is as accurately as we are able to. And we continue to learn more about it everyday and we\u2019re getting better everyday at both prioritization, pricing, cost estimating, and it\u2019s all part of a learning curve to which Jim spoke.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Robert Barry", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "John Lundgren", "Good morning.", "Robert Barry", "I wondered if you could comment on the benefit to industrial revenue and margin in the quarter from the large oil and gas equipment sale. And then more broadly, what is your outlook for the oil and gas or infrastructure business? Thank you.", "Don Allan", "Sure. This is Don. I will take that one. We did -- as Jim mentioned, we did have a large order in the second quarter associated with equipment, which does happen occasionally in this business and particularly in the Far East. We do get an occasional situation whether the large pipeline being constructed and we are just primarily selling equipment and then training them on how to use the equipment effectively in the construction process. Those things range from occurrence from anywhere from 6 to 12 months occasion they happen, but they are very sporadic. And we don\u2019t end to plan for those types of sales. And I think it\u2019s just happened to occur in the month of June, which we\u2019re all very pleased to see.", "As far as our outlook of oil and gas, I mean which continues to be similar to what we\u2019ve been saying for the last almost year now where the level of activity of construction of pipeline is really on the onshore really not existing at this stage. There continues to be a lot of activity within the industry about the potential kind of ramp up of activity in 2016. We have not seen specific quotes within that nature of the stage that would give us a high level of confidence, but then we\u2019ve also seen a downturn lately in the oil prices as well.", "So there is still volatility in this space, but ultimately we do feel that we are going to see some type of ramp up in activity in the next 12 to 18 months of pipeline construction, because there is a great deal of pent-up volume that needs to be dealt with and have to take to the stage.", "John Lundgren", "We are also seeing on the oil and gas onshore. It\u2019s the onshore business that looks like it might get some legs next year, because we are doing a lot of prep work with specifications right now. Our concern is and the reason Don is very circumspect about it is, because there is a good chance that these types of projects will get delayed if the oil prices don\u2019t recover.", "And again, the gas prices are also a factor here because the onshore market is about 70% gas. The offshore market, which is another big piece of our business, doesn\u2019t look to be too favorable anytime soon. So it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag and we expect probably double-digit declines in the oil and gas for the next couple of quarters, and then we will see what happens when the comps get easier and the activity picks up.", "Jim Loree", "The other thing I would want to just go back on the first part of the question just to make sure people don\u2019t get a view that this order was a huge impact to the second quarter. The impact at margin, the profit for EPS was less than $0.02 of EPS in the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Grace Lee", "So this is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. Congratulations on a good quarter. We hear quite a broad-based trend in automotives end market. Could you give us a more color around engineered fastening? In which market do you see the strongest growth? And also how would you envision the growth trajectory going forward?", "Jim Loree", "Well, when you say which market, I mean, we generally\u2026", "Grace Lee", "Geographically.", "Jim Loree", "Yes, geographically, okay. So Asia was -- we\u2019re generally outpacing light vehicle production wherever we are operating geographically. I will say that I think the North American and European markets were a little stronger than the Asian markets in this particular quarter, but it\u2019s all over the map in terms of quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter. So it\u2019s -- I would say that it\u2019s -- our growth is not -- is less market related and more just penetration of platform, lot of platforms as we go here, but we do consider, although overall production was about flat for the global light vehicle. So it wasn\u2019t a particularly strong quarter at all for the market.", "John Lundgren", "And our long-term view of that business answering the second half your question is that we think it\u2019s a business that fits into our long-term organic growth vision of 4% to 6%. And it\u2019s demonstrated a good track record to be within that range. And as it adopts more of the commercial excellence activities and innovation activities, that\u2019s 2.0, we think that will only assist in that ability to continue that on a long-term basis.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Deepa Raghavan", "Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Two questions. Two parts to it. Oil and gas business, I know you mentioned 11% organic growth spike -- from one-time spike, but could you share with us what the revenue growth for the total industrials would have been on an organic basis ex this spike? And also what the margin number might have been ex this one-time item? I am just trying to squarer up these strong margins you printed this quarter with the forecast. Second one.", "Don Allan", "I will make it very clear. It was $7 million of revenue and $3.5 million of operation margin.", "John Lundgren", "Which translates to less than $0.02 a share due to the large relatively large for oil and gas, it\u2019s less than a $300 million business. So when you get a $7 million order shipped in the quarter, that\u2019s large on a very small base on our $2 billion plus industrial segment base or $1.7 billion engineered fastening base. However, if you want to look at it within oil and gas, it was large; within the segment, it was tiny.", "Don Allan", "And then just for analytical purposes, we understand why you\u2019re trying to get to a run rate, but please don\u2019t think of it as a one-time item because it\u2019s part of the ongoing discussion.", "John Lundgren", "As we said many times as it relates to oil and gas, it\u2019s one of our few businesses, infrastructure in general, and oil and gas in particular where it\u2019s a long cycle business with large lumpy orders, unlike our Global Tools and Storage business and even a security business the way we install and recognize revenue. You get large orders and depending on when they are fulfilled in a quarter has tremendous variations. So it\u2019s one of our few businesses where quarter-to-quarter the numbers can vary dramatically due simply to timing.", "Jim Loree", "And as I said earlier an answer to the first question, we\u2019ve seen this roughly every six to nine months. We have sometimes as large order like this, so it\u2019s not a one-time item. Maybe one time in a specific quarter, but when you look at a year, you can have one to two of these and even occasionally three that happen every year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Liam Burke", "Yes. Thank you. In the tools and storage business, you talked partially about the construction. Outside the construction, both on the industrial and on MAC tools, how those markets have been for you?", "John Lundgren", "Well, the markets have generally been good in terms of MAC tools and markets. As you looked at some of the numbers that come out, they\u2019ve been very good. The statistics very recently published in the last 10 years in the U.S., which is overwhelmingly where MAC tools is of course.", "Car ownership, the average age of cars on the road has gone from slightly under nine to slightly over 11 years, which means cars have been built better, but it also means they\u2019re on the road longer and so there is a generally healthy environment for automotive repair and automotive aftermarket. That\u2019s clearly helping MAC.", "What\u2019s also helping MAC is just the benefit of it been part of our Global Tools & Storage business with a great product development, product introduction, good sales rhythm, good forecasting. A lot of the newer cars of course require a lot of diagnostics and something where we\u2019re relatively underdeveloped compared to some of the competition.", "But in general, Liam, those markets are healthy. And we benefited from that, but we clearly believe we are growing faster than those end markets, which implies share gain of course.", "Jim Loree", "On the industrial side, clearly, there is a big differentiation within industrial markets by segment. And so the oil and gas issues within industrial marketplace are weighing on growth. We got ag laying on growth and mining as well and hydraulics. So, mixed bag in industry, I would say the MRO channel is little weaker than it has been, maybe inventories are little higher, we\u2019re not sure about that, but it feels that way.", "We don\u2019t have great data on the MRO channel. It seems like there might -- won\u2019t call it a correction, but sort of an inventory build maybe going on there. So in general, the industrial markets are a little weaker than they have been over the last year or so.", "Operator", "And next question comes from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Stephen Kim", "Yes. Thanks very much guys. Strong quarter. I guess a couple of questions, but let me just ask one. Essentially, this quarter in terms of guidance, you are talking about your year coming in about $0.20 better, due to the, frankly, organic growth and then I guess $0.15 headwind due to the security issues that have been discussed. I guess I'm curious as to what happened in the quarter.", "If you could give us a sense for how much better the organic growth in terms of cents in that same basis, $0.20 and that was the $0.15. If you could give us a sense for what happened in the quarter in those two buckets? How much better was the organic growth in terms of cents and how much worse was the security, relative to your expectations going-in in the quarter? Thanks.", "Don Allan", "I\u2019ll take that. This is Don. I think our organic growth was about two points better in the second quarter versus beginning of the quarter expectation and most of that was driven as you might imagine in Tools & Storage, a little bit an Engineered Fastening. Our EPS level, how does it play out $0.20 versus $0.15? I mean, the way, my view would be, security was about $0.03 to $0.05 off expectation in the second quarter and you can do the math the rest of the way.", "But clearly, Tools and Storage outperformance, depending on how you look at our outperformance of the company, we look at the vast majority of that $0.10 as an operational outperformance and a lot of that\u2019s being driven by Tools & Storage. There is some plusses and minuses below operating margin but the bulk of that is next to zero. And really what you\u2019re looking at is a $0.05 to $0.08 operational outperformance, but if you factor that $0.03 to $0.05 in, then Tools & storage was somewhere around $0.08 to $0.10, or $0.12 outperformance.", "John Lundgren", "Tools & Storage plus industrial.", "Don Allan", "Plus industrial. Thank you, John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Mike Sang", "Hey. Good morning guys. It\u2019s Mike Sang for Nigel. A few comments on how the quarter phased? I mean, we\u2019re getting conflicting data points with oil and gas over dipping and [indiscernible] is volatile and I think even construction has been a little bit lumpy. So if you could talk about growth ex in June and how that\u2019s trending to July that would be great? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for back half of this facility? Thanks.", "Don Allan", "This is Don. I\u2019ll take that one. We -- actually when you look at the second quarter, we saw a pretty balance level of growth across the quarter, especially in Tools -- actually in all our business. As we look at all our businesses, we saw relatively healthy growth in all our businesses in each point of month across the quarter.", "And so we didn't see an accelerating trend or a decelerating trend in the month of June. Our guidance is reflective. Obviously, we feel good with what we\u2019ve experienced in the first half of the year and the momentum as we exited the first half of the year, which allowed us to increase our organic growth assumption of 5% to 6%. So, we\u2019re clearly seeing trends that make us feel at least, reasonably good about the market.", "We will be the first one to admit. There is a lot of conflicting data and information out there across the construction and industrial phase as to what might happen in the back half of the year. And as a result, we\u2019ve evaluated that combined with a very healthy organic growth performance in the first half. I think we\u2019ve put forth a very balanced view of the full year.", "John Lundgren", "And just to add briefly do that. I think as Jim pointed out in his piece of the presentation, our largest business obviously is within GT&S, Global Tools & Storage. It\u2019s where we have the best data. Inventories are at or slightly below normal levels that bodes well for the future. That\u2019s partially offset by relatively weak industrial markets compared to what we\u2019d like to see.", "But simply said, a very smooth quarter and a very good position in terms of inventories at the customer level, which has led to our guiding the second half of the year the way we have versus importantly, if you look at the details, some very, very steep and difficult comps, but keep that in mind as you look forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.", "Mike Wood", "Hi. Congratulations on the organic growth.", "John Lundgren", "Thank you.", "Mike Wood", "My question was on the Security business. You return to the organic growth in Europe. Can you give us some color in terms of what the margin range is now, the improvement in Europe? And is that -- is your decision on what action you\u2019re going to take in security, dependent upon the execution of the business or the valuation kind of how that parses out within family? Thank you.", "Don Allan", "As far as, Europe goes, as Jim mentioned in a nice level of detail that the business continues to progress forward. It\u2019s turned the corner in the sense of organic growth over the last two or three quarters. We\u2019re starting to demonstrate modest level of 3% in the second quarter, which we're pleased with.", "The profitability continues to improve. It\u2019s still in the range of mid to high-single digits and as it exit this year, it will certainly be at the high single-digit level as it continues to progress in the back half of the year through its transformation. So, we really -- and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve communicated in the past, so it\u2019s consistently performing with our expectation.", "As far as, our view as to our decision associated with the fit in the portfolio, it will be a combination of factors to evaluate. And certainly, the one that, probably, drives the most, a largest part of decision will be valuation and if the valuation improves based on a certain outcome that we make related to that decision.", "And ultimately, we believe we\u2019re here to drive shareholder value over the long-term and if we think whatever decision we make is going to achieve that result that will be a big driver of decision. Certainly, evaluating how its performing is a factor but I don't think it\u2019s the primary one.", "John Lundgren", "Yeah. Let me -- this is John. Let me just add to that. I certainly agree with everything Don said. But as we\u2019ve had a lot of focus again on the 15% of our business that\u2019s performing slightly below our line average specifically. So, I think, Jim pointed out European security and North American conversion.", "We\u2019re focused on improving the performance. But I think it's fairly important just to note that while it\u2019s -- that subsegment of that segment are performing at a level slightly below our [OM] [ph] average. They\u2019re performing right in the middle of fair way, relative to their peers.", "This is not a broken business. It\u2019s the business that\u2019s performing not as well as it has in the past. There is some industry trends, as well as some internal executional issues that Jim spoke about I think in great detail.", "I guess, I just -- we need to be on record. This is not a broken business. It\u2019s a good business. It's been better and it will be better going forward. And our assessment of it will be based on both the trends that as Don said, we\u2019re here to create shareholder value. That\u2019s ultimately going to be the driver this time next year as we zero in on it fit in our portfolio relative to elsewhere.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Greg for closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright", "Amanda, thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again calling in this morning and for your participation in the call and obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions.

Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Operator", "Welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor & Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2015 conference call. On the call, in addition to myself is John Lundgren, Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, President and COO; and Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning, and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad applications. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, John, Jim, and Don will review our third quarter 2015 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty.", "It's, therefore, possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, thanks, Greg. Good morning, everybody. We are fortunate to be in a position to report another healthy operational quarter featuring strong organic growth as well as margin expansion. You saw in the press release, organic growth was 6% offset by currency which was a negative 8%, and as a consequence, net sales were down 2%, as the foreign exchange headwinds we've talked about on past calls continue at historically high levels. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth, at or above 6% for the company on a combined basis, with impressive growth once again, from the Tools & Storage business, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more segment detail in just a minute.", "Our operating margin rate expanded to a post-merger record of 14.8%, which is 70 basis points ahead of third quarter 2014. And we attribute this to volume, with sharp cost focus, price realization in both developed and emerging markets and commodity deflation that, together, delivered robust operating leverage, despite $70 million in foreign currency pressure during the quarter.", "And we opportunistically repurchased about $200 million worth of shares within the quarter, capitalizing on the recent U.S. equity market declines. So the combination of organic growth and the margin expansion led the third quarter fully diluted EPS of $1.55, which is up 1% versus prior year, as the strong operational performance more than offset tax and restructuring headwinds. Specifically, the third quarter tax rate that Don will talk about, of 24.5% with 540 basis points higher than prior year, while restructuring charges in the quarter were approximately $14 million higher than the third quarter of 2014. So the restructuring charges were about a $0.07 (3:47) EPS headwind during the quarter.", "As a consequence of our third quarter performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're increasing 2015's full year GAAP EPS guidance range to $5.80 to $5.95, and that's up from our prior guidance of $5.70 to $5.90. So, up 8% to 11% versus the prior year. Not surprisingly, I'm just really pleased with our organization's demonstrable agility in delivering both organic growth and operating leverage in such a dynamic operating environment.", "Organic growth remained strong, but diving just a little bit deeper into the sources of our growth, it was broad-based. Volume grew 5% and was aided by 100 basis points of price realization, from a combination of efforts to combat the currency headwinds in many of our markets overseas, and the implementation of surgical pricing actions domestically, resulting in a total of 6% organic growth for the quarter. As already mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds remained severe and they detracted 8 percentage points from our performance during the quarter.", "All geographies grew mid-single digits, with the U.S. leading the pack and Europe growing well above market rates. Our emerging market group in the rest of the world also posted solid growth despite doing no business in Venezuela and softness in Russia, China, and Australia. Interestingly, Japan grew 8% driven by strong STANLEY Engineered Fastening performance in the automotive markets.", "Let's take a closer look at the segments and Jim is going to walk you through that in a lot more detail.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. Thank you, John. I'll start with Tools & Storage. It was another banner quarter for the team in this strong momentum business. Revenue was up 2%, while operating margin grew 8%. We once again set a post-merger record with a 16.7% operating margin rate, demonstrating impressive leverage. Gains resulted from volume related incrementals, modestly positive price, variable cost productivity, continued tight SG&A cost management and some benefit from input price reductions, the combination of which more than offset severe currency headwinds.", "Organic growth remained strong, up 9%, overcoming a 9% comp in a noteworthy fifth quarter in a row at or above that 9% growth level. All regions contributed with strong performances as North America was up 11%, Europe was up 7% and emerging markets up 6%.", "Organic strength was prevalent across the global product lines with professional power tools up 9%, consumer power tools up 12%, accessories up 9%, and hand tools and storage up 8%. All categories benefited from strong customer level and new product commercial execution.", "Encouragingly, this overall performance shows that the Tools & Storage growth in innovation machine can continue to be successful in the face of tougher comps. The combination of the launch of our DEWALT Outdoor line as well as other enhanced products in conjunction with a more normal weather pattern this year resulted in the successful outdoor season that was up double digits for the quarter as well as year-to-date.", "POS was again robust across the channels, with major big-box customers in the U.S. continuing their recent strength. Aggregate weeks on-hand at retail is in a good place in line with historical levels. The U.S. hardware, lumber stores, STAFDA and online channels were again very strong as construction markets benefited from growth in end-user demand and our own commercial execution took that a step further. Mac Tools growth continued at impressive levels continuing to outpace the healthy North American automotive aftermarket on the strength of new product and a growing franchisee base.", "Not surprisingly, we did experience softness in our U.S. industrial markets, which was directly attributable to the slowdown in Oil & Gas and mining end markets. Europe continued with its impressive organic growth and commercial excellence, averaging 7% growth over the last 10 quarters in a flattish market.", "The share gains in the quarter have been broad with almost all markets showing a positive performance. The stream of new innovative products, adding new points of distribution and leveraging our stable of iconic brands is a winning model that continues to reinforce our position as the world leader in Tools & Storage. Emerging market organic growth was again encouraging at 6% as double-digit performance in Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia more than offset steep declines in Russia and a weak performance in China.", "The mid-price point product rollout, led by STANLEY Branded Power Tools, continued to be timely and effective as end users tend to be more value-oriented in economies under economic duress. And clearly the scale, maturity and depth of our emerging market team, in conjunction with this important initiative, continues to bolster our organic growth and overall developing market performance in a more than challenging and volatile environment.", "I would like to take just a moment to recognize our Global Tools & Storage management team in both the developed and developing markets. The results speak for themselves. Organic growth averaging 10% over the last five quarters, margins up by 130 basis points year-to-date and at record levels despite about 150 points of FX pressure expected for the year, SFS 2.0 is clearly enabling strong customer execution, outsized organic growth, margin expansion and over 9 working capital turns. And some people have the perception that we are simply riding the U.S. construction and DIY wave, and we are to an extent. However, only about 40% of the Global Tools business benefits from that.", "What we're clearly seeing is the manifestation of a performance culture grounded in SFS, second and third order benefits from the Stanley Black & Decker merger and the potential of the world's leading Tools & Storage franchise. What is exciting is that there is even more opportunity ahead as the team takes SFS 2.0 to the next level, which we will begin to see in 2016.", "Now, moving to Security. This was clearly a quarter of advancement for Security, demonstrating the operational progress that we are looking for as we pursue our multi-year plan to transform the business. Execution within Europe was outstanding and both the North American electronics and mechanical locks businesses took encouraging steps forward. Europe, again, had a long list of accomplishments, including 4% organic growth, another double-digit order rate performance, attrition rates within their target zone, and operating margin which improved versus prior year for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now in the high single digits.", "Commercial execution exhibited good breadth with organic growth achieved in all major geographic markets and signs that we are beginning to move the market share needle into positive territory. In recent quarters, our European management team has demonstrated the winning spirit that comes with consistently delivering organic growth and profitability commitments, while winning in the marketplace. The U.S. mechanical lock business also showed progress with 4% organic growth and improving profitability. Our management team remains focused on specification writing, revitalizing product lines through innovation and driving commercial excellence.", "North American electronics security had a mixed quarter with more positives than negatives. On the plus side, there was sequential margin expansion, operational stability and financial predictability. And on the other side of the ledger, inorganic revenue decline. While we continue to improve field operational performance, increase order rates and grow a healthy backlog, the opportunity to deliver growth and margin expansion is there in coming quarters. And Security is relatively a small emerging market domain, significant softness in China cut into overall segment organic growth and profitability, once again muting some of the gains across the other businesses.", "Now, turning to Industrial. Industrial delivered another steady performance from Engineered Fastening and weathered market-related declines within Infrastructure. And that result was a 7% decrease in revenue as flat organic growth was more than offset by 7 points negative currency. Margins were up modestly, as volume leverage in Engineered Fastening, tight cost controls and pricing, more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange and organic declines in the Infrastructure businesses.", "Engineered Fastening posted 3% organic growth led by double-digit performance in automotive, once again, outpacing global light vehicle production which was relatively flat in the quarter. Additionally, we saw a solid growth within electronics. This growth offset lower North America Industrial sales tied to weakening market conditions. All in all, it was an impressive quarter of organic growth and margin expansion for Engineered Fastening, despite the translational currency headwinds experienced within the business.", "Infrastructure, which includes Oil & Gas and Hydraulics, was down 10%, in line with our expectations. Oil & Gas was down 7% as signs of life in the onshore North American market were not enough to offset continued declines and global onshore and offshore pipeline activity. Growth in Hydraulics was down 17%, as volume in our demolition shares is correlated to pricing levels in the scrap steel market.", "In summary, it was a solid operational performance by the Industrial teams, holding organic growth flat and expanding the operating margin rate despite soft infrastructure and global industrial markets as well as a significant currency drag.", "So, as we assess this quarter's performance in the aggregate, it represents another strong quarter for the overall company with 6% organic growth and record operating margin levels that expanded 70 basis points despite approximately 150 basis points of currency headwinds.", "We are now on track to grow EPS 8% to 11% in 2015 despite friction from external obstacles including the strong dollar and dynamic end markets. We are also in good shape for 2016. Our balance sheet is solid and at current exchange rates, our FX headwinds will begin to decrease and we have a series of growth and margin enhancing initiatives, both underway and planned.", "We also have a solid M&A pipeline and expect to resume our inorganic growth activities in a measured but meaningful way in the near future. We look forward to finishing 2015 at our upgraded EPS guidance levels and entering 2016 with a viable roadmap for revenue, cash flow and EPS growth.", "We thank you and I'll now turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Jim. I'd like to begin with our third quarter and year-to-date free cash flow performance. For the third quarter, free cash flow was $171 million, which was down modestly from last year's results. This brings the year-to-date performance to $174 million. The lower year-to-date results compared to the prior year is mainly explained by higher inventory levels needed in the summer and the fall of 2015, which were required to service the increased levels of organic growth we are experiencing, primarily within the Tools & Storage business.", "The core SFS principles require agility to respond when business conditions change, such as the strong organic growth we have experienced recently. SFS has enabled us to reach working capital and asset efficiency levels that are considered world-class compared to our industrial and security peers, while being agile to changing market conditions to ensure we meet our customers' needs.", "We expect that by the end of 2015, we will deliver approximately a 0.5 working capital turn improvement versus the prior year and achieve turns within the range of 9.5 to 9.7 times, which will demonstrate another step closer towards achieving our goal of 10 working capital turns.", "However, given our strong organic growth performance in 2015 of 6%, the 0.5 working capital turn improvement will not translate into cash flow benefit for the full year of 2015 but, instead, will result in a modest cash outflow. This is one of the benefits of great strong organic growth as it begins to become a bit of a pressure to your cash flow.", "One other item of note related to cash flow, the improvement of approximately 3 turns from 6.4 turns in Q3 to the end of the year is heavily influenced by the normal Tools & Storage seasonality. For those of you who have followed our business for many years know that this fourth quarter Tools & Storage seasonality dynamic is a regular occurrence given the timing of sales and shipments as they occur within the quarter. This outstanding working capital results, combined with capital expenditure control and our improved earnings outlook will result in the company delivering free cash flow approaching $1 billion in 2015.", "As John mentioned, during the quarter we also executed opportunistic share repurchases of $200 million. This brings our cumulative total share actions to the equivalent of $1.2 billion in the last 12 months. As we have reviewed during our Investor Day in May, you should expect us to return over time to a capital allocation of approximately 50% of our free cash flow being deployed through M&A, and the other 50% through our shareholders via dividends and the occasional opportunistic share repurchase.", "Let's move to the next page in our updated 2015 outlook. As indicated by John earlier and Jim, we are increasing the 2015 EPS range to $5.80 to $5.95 versus the previous range of $5.70 to $5.90. We are able to raise our outlook primarily due to strong business performance across several areas of the company, driven by commodity deflation and cost control.", "In particular, we are starting to see stronger than initially expected benefits from steel, resin and other base metals that manifest themselves in our income statement's result. However, these benefits are partially offset by foreign exchange headwind that is now expected to be at the high end of our previous $200 million to $220 million range, when you use current rates. Most of that impact is related to the weakening of the Brazilian real over the last two or three months. The net result of these changes is $0.07 to $0.08 increase to our midpoint outlook range that I just provided.", "Moving to the right side of the page and a little bit more detail on the segments. First, let's start with Tools & Storage. We continue to expect high single-digit organic revenue growth within Tools & Storage. This is slightly better than compared to our July outlook. We also expect solid operating margin rate expansion year-over-year in this segment due to volume leverage, cost actions, price, and commodity deflation I just mentioned, which will more than offset the impact of currency.", "Security remains on track with the forecast we provided in last quarter's guidance. Margins for the full year are expected to be generally consistent with the prior year on relatively flat organic revenue. Industrial will continue to benefit from the momentum in our Engineered Fastening Electronics and Automotive businesses, which will be modestly offset by slow growth and/or pressure in some of the general industrial markets, and infrastructure that Jim touched on. However, this still has us on a path for low to mid-single-digit organic growth for the year with a solid operating margin performance.", "In summary, our revised EPS guidance range demonstrates a strong year-to-date performance across much of the company, which means we are now on track for 8% to 11% EPS growth, despite currency headwinds of appropriately $220 million or $1.10 of EPS.", "Before leaving this page, I would like to make a few comments regarding 2016. While it is premature to get into a lot of detail for 2016, the current exchange rates will result in approximately $100 million headwind. This is related to continued devaluations of various currencies, including the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar, as well as the impact of our 2015 transactional foreign exchange hedges rolling off next year.", "Similar to what we did in 2015, we are proactively identifying cost reductions, aggressively pursuing commodity deflation, and other pricing opportunities to partially mitigate this impact and will position us to demonstrate continued operating leverage in 2016, as well as reasonable earnings growth.", "So let's summarize the presentation portion of our call today. We delivered a very strong third quarter performance and here are some of the highlights. We are very pleased with another quarter of strong organic growth, our fifth in a row at or above 6%. The proactive tight cost controls and surgical price actions across the entire company enabled excellent third quarter operating leverage in the face of $70 million of currency headwinds.", "The third item is progress continues with Security's multiyear transformation, with sequential improvement across most of the operations, and we were very pleased with the result. We were also able to execute additional share repurchases in the third quarter, as I mentioned, bringing the total share count actions we have taken since the start of the fourth quarter of 2014 to $1.2 billion.", "As we communicated during our Investor Day in May, our focus in 2015 and beyond will be on leveraging our world-class franchises and brands, strong free cash flow generation and continued shareholder friendly capital allocation. This continues to manifest itself and are focused on accelerating organic growth through SFS 2.0, while supplementing that growth with acquisitions, advancing securities multi-year transformation to achieve consistent low-single digit organic growth and 15% profitability by 2018. Also continuing our disciplined approach to cost and pricing actions to ensure we have annual operating leverage as we grow. And finally, an ongoing focus on working capital turns. We believe this approach will help position our company to continue our strong performance trend and achieve our long-term financial objectives.", "Thank you. And that concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let's move to Q&A.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Great. Thanks, Don. Stephanie, we can now open the call to Q&A, please. Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. Our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to squeeze in two questions here. But Jim or John, could you comment on price as you start to look at 2016 with the deflationary environment? A lot of companies are starting to struggle in terms of pushing through price, like to get your views on that. And then in terms of the near term on Industrial, how do you feel about the landscape right now? There are some pressures in the environment. Have you baked in some cushion around Industrial and the landscape peers as we move out the next few months? Thanks.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Don is going to give you the view on price going forward, to the extent we're going to talk about it for 2016. And then Jim, I think, can give you a little deeper dive on Industrial and our thoughts.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, Rich. On pricing, I think it's a couple of dynamics. One is, certainly, we've been able to achieve positive pricing benefits because of some of the negative foreign exchange impact we've had in emerging markets in particular, and even a little bit in our European regions as well. So, as we import our products into those particular regions and we are impacted negatively by foreign currency, we obviously try to recoup as much of that as possible through pricing actions in the local market.", "With us having a continued headwind going into 2016, we will continue to be prudent about our approach in that area and go after specific price actions where it makes sense, given the different dynamics in those markets. So we do think there will be ability to gain some price in emerging markets as a result of that pressure from foreign currency.", "In more developed markets like the United States, or even Europe where we're manufacturing product and selling it within the region, pricing will continue to be an area that we stay very focused on. We've been heavily focused on specific surgical pricing actions in the last year-and-a-half to two years in those developed markets. We don't see any reason for that to change. I think the commodity deflation impact will be an area that we have to watch closely. It impacts certain types of products and it doesn't impact other products quite as much. And as I said, being surgical allows you to evaluate those types of decisions.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Jim, talk about the three pieces. Obviously, Rich, you're aware that STANLEY Engineered Fastening is the overwhelming majority of our Industrial segment. But they really are responding to some very different market dynamics.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. I think, when you talk about Industrial, it always boils down to the sub-segments both geographically and also just sub-segments within industrial categories. And I think what we see right now in the North American market is a dichotomy between some of the more difficult end markets, such as oil and gas, mining and ag in particular, and then we see continued, I won't call it buoyancy, but maybe continued perseverance in the automotive market.", "So while automotive kind of chugs on, I think that's driven largely by the kind of the resurgence in consumer and also the ageing fleet. So automotive is very important to Engineered Fastening, about 40% of its revenues or so. And as long as automotive is healthy, that particular part of the business is going to be fairly healthy. And then, of course, electronics is the other big part of Engineered Fastening, another big part, and that continues to be strong as well.", "And then the general kind of MRO-related industrial, it's a function of kind of the accumulation of the sub-segments. And that is a little bit on the weak side right now in North America. You can see it from some of the results of the distributors that have actually come out; so a mixed bag in North America. We don't see it going negative at this point. It's flattish and maybe slightly up or slightly down, but kind of hovering around the flattish.", "And then Europe, Europe has been challenged in that flattish kind of a way for a long time, and we see a little bit of negative drag in Europe but nothing catastrophic at this point. I think the weak euro as much as the strong dollar has hurt exports in the U.S. The weak euro tends to have the potential to maybe boost the industrial in Europe a little bit.", "So I think on balance we do see some pressure in industrial. We have factored that into our thought process, but we don't see recessionary conditions, although industrial production is relatively weak in the aggregate right now.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The only thing I'd add, Rich, and we'll move on, when Jim talked about the North American markets in our sub-segments, he mentioned obviously oil and gas, mining, ag, and the relatively depressed prices in the scrap steel market has had an impact on our hydraulics business. Of course, demolition, as you know, is a very large part of that. So we've got those headwinds in a couple of our smaller businesses, but a modestly healthy environment in Engineered Fastening, both domestically and abroad. I mentioned a bright spot in Japan for us, which was quite encouraging, and the business is doing quite well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The question I had was just regarding getting a little bit more granularity with the adjustments to the full-year guidance. If you kind of take the midpoint of the prior FX headwind to where you are expecting today, it doesn't seem like it's that much more, maybe $10 million, $15 million, or $10 million from the midpoint. So just want to understand versus three months ago, what were the biggest drivers of those?", "And then conversely in terms of the upside stronger business performance combined with better commodity deflation, if you think of like $10 million incremental headwind to get to the guidance range, we're talking about maybe another $25 million of positive roughly speaking. So if that math is right, $25 million, $30 million of incremental positive, how does that break down between the stronger business performance and the commodity deflation? And more specifically, where within the business are you seeing that better performance and what's the bigger weight?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Rank has its privileges and I'm going to let Don try to tackle that one. There are a lot of moving pieces, Mike. But I think Don can kind of tie a little bit of a bow on it for you.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. Your math is actually pretty close, so as you think about us raising our midpoint by about $0.07 or $0.08 of EPS, yeah, we probably have about $10 million of new FX pressure. As I said, we're at the higher end of that range; that's about $0.05 of EPS. And then you have about $25 million or so of positive impact from commodity deflation and other indirect cost controls. And the net of those two items gets you basically to $0.07 and $0.08.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on the Tools & Storage segment. Margins were very strong. I understand the good volume leverage here, but looks like we're coming in at the high end of that range that you've talked about in the past as being sort of the cyclical high margins that we could expect from this business. Any change in your view here given that at this point you still have 150 points of forex pressure in those margins? Should we envision margins continuing to trend up into next year as long as volumes go up?", "And the other question, a follow-up on this, is I understand you have very strong share gains across regions. I just wanted to get a better sense of what do you see in terms of the underlying demand trends in North America in particular.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. This is Jim. When we think about margins and margins through the cycle, we don't necessarily let the cycle drive the margins, per se. We tend to be much more proactive about it. So at the down part of the cycle, we're taking out cost at a very healthy pace. And as we enjoy the ride up the cycle, we don't back off in terms of some of the things that we do to maintain the upward pressure, everything we can do to maintain the upward pressure on margins. So I think the potential for what you're calling the peak cycle margin rate is quite high. And I think evidence of that is if this whole FX headwind hadn't occurred, we would be at record-margins for the company and the Tool business.", "So the things that we do are things like continuous productivity, 3% to 4% cost productivity. Every year we have a very, very surgical and data-driven pricing program in this company, which goes across all the businesses, including the Tool business, where we constantly are improving our subject matter expertise and our analytics in pricing and looking at price/volume tradeoffs and making sure that we're optimizing our margins and our overall margin in that regard.", "And then we have design-to-value which is a more programmatic approach to driving cost out of products. In the design cycle we have a simplification and complexity reduction program, which again drives cost out of the products and we have mix management. We are doing everything that we know how to do to drive margins up. And where that limit is, we don't know, but we constantly try to drive them up. So I think that's kind of the way we think about it.", "As far as the share picture in various geographies in the Tool business, I have to say that I don't think there is any region in the world, except with the possible exception of China, where we are not gaining share. And this business has implemented a commercial excellence initiative, which has taken the strength of Stanley and Black & Decker's scale, its brands, its products, its innovation, and it is driving that across all geographies in a very aggressive way and it's been very successful and we expect it to continue to do so.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And Jeremie, it's John. Just to add to that, both in terms of our drive for margins and share gain, more from a qualitative perspective, but I think it's demonstrable. In the past two months we've been named category-specific Vendor of the Year by our two largest customers. Never before, at least in our history, I've been here 11 years and Jim and Don 15 years, have we achieved such coveted and prestigious recognition from our two largest customers in the same year. And I think if nothing else, or just anecdotally, that's a tribute to the strength of our brand, the strength of the programs, and the commercial execution that Jim was talking about. And obviously, those kinds of things are leading to share gain and we're pleased with that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. John, you briefly just mentioned China and I just have a question overall thinking about kind of the dynamics in the EMs and Tools & Storage specifically. A very strong performance as you characterized with strong Latin America offsetting weaker Russia and China. It's being difficult for Latin America to continue to carry that ball with what's going on in Brazil, et cetera. Just wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit more granular lay of the land on how you expect...", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes...", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "...those things to play out.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Sure, Jeff. Very fair. To give you some numbers because it \u2013 boy, they're all over the place, but Latin America, what we call our Latin American group organically grew 13%. Brazil, which is the largest by far market, we grew 4% organically. But obviously, we're suffering some huge currency headwinds that Don talked about. But we have smaller countries, Venezuela, as I say where we've done zero business essentially for about the last six quarters.", "We had good performance in Mexico, good performance in Colombia; Brazil as I say, up low-single digits, which gave us low-double digit growth in Latin America. Country-specific, they represent a small percentage of our volume, but Russia was down 30%, China was down 28%. We think that's not inconsistent with the markets in general. The silver lining in the clouds for us particularly in China is the expansion of our mid-price-point product offerings, locally produced by a subsidiary that we control. We think that in and of itself is going to help us a lot, but we we're working off some high comps. The bad news is we're down 25% to 30% in both Russia and China. The good news is those are very small markets and a small base. So $2 million, $3 million, $4 million of improvement will bring us back to where we were.", "What we're doing about it? I think the simplest way to describe it, we aren't withdrawing, we aren't cutting back, we've stopped adding feet on the street and variable cost resources at the pace we were adding them, but we haven't cut anything, and we're reallocating resources within our emerging market group, Asia, and to a lesser extent Latin America, because we just think those are still huge economies, 45% or 46% of our business is still outside the U.S., that includes Europe, of course, and we're not going to withdraw our support for those markets.", "So, a long answer to a simple question, but I think the huge volatility in certain countries gives you a flavor for how we're approaching it. It's much more a question we're reallocating resources as opposed to cutting them, because we're in these bit markets for the long haul.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the Security segment. You've got kind of diverging trends here. On one hand the previous problem area in terms of Europe is improving and seeing accelerating organic growth, and now it seems like you're seeing some deceleration in North America and emerging markets, I guess, on the electronics side in particular. So just curious, as you look out to \u2013 obviously, you've outlined a path to what you need to see from this overall business over the next year. How are these trends playing into that? Are you more or less positive on the positioning of the business as you see it today versus how you were thinking about it three months or six months ago?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Fair question. Don will give you a little detail, but I guess from top of the house, I can say we feel as good or better about these businesses as we have in the past. You talked about Europe; they're delivering on their commitments, which pleases us and pleases the folks there. And we think we have the right people in the right chairs. And we think we understand what the issues are within North American Security. Don has been spending a lot of time with that team. So let me have him give you a little more granularity.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. Thanks, John. So, what John said is exactly correct. And, yeah, we're really pleased, and Jim went through it in a lot of detail in his presentation around the European performance, how it continues to improve, demonstrating a short stretch of time here of consistent organic growth, sequential improvement in operating margin rate. All the things that we talked about a year ago that we wanted to accomplish for that business; we're seeing them really get traction in all those areas.", "In North America, I wouldn't say that we feel like we're losing traction or slowing down. We definitely know that we had a little bit of a, kind of a blip on the radar in the second quarter of this year because of a large installation that completed itself. It didn't repeat, as you can see, in the third quarter because the third quarter bounced back to our expectations. They're actually slightly better than our expectations around profitability. And we continue to deal with an evolving and changing environment related to our vertical selling solutions, specifically targeting two verticals, retail and healthcare, as an area to really concentrate and help the business grow.", "The positive in North America that I see is that the backlog continues to grow and the order rates are double-digits and these are trends that we've seen now for two quarters or three quarters, which is positioning us well for next year to demonstrate some organic growth in North America in electronic security and mechanical security, for that matter.", "The last piece is China. I mean, overall, emerging markets is relatively small for the Security business. And outside of China, it's doing relatively well. But in China, because of the economic circumstances, market conditions, we've definitely seen some of the retrenching revenue declines that John mentioned in China a few minutes ago of double-digit declines, and that's been significant.", "We think that's more market related. It's not a big part of the business. Like everyone else, I think we all think China will begin to gradually get back on track at some point in the next two quarters to three quarters probably. So we're not overly concerned about that. So our focus now is continued execution improvement in Europe; continued execution improvement in North America, and really hunker down in the emerging markets, get through this period of time in China and then begin to demonstrate growth as we come out of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.", "Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good job again in a tough environment.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "I just had a bigger picture question on Tools. What inning do you think we're in around some of the adoption of some of the new technology development that's been going on, whether it's brushless or just improved battery performance? And I guess would you characterize this as maybe a technology step function that's similar to what lithium-ion was a few years ago or several years ago?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say, Tim, it's a really good question, and I would say no. Lithium-ion, if you think about it relative to NiCad, it was a better mousetrap, more power, longer run times, better for the environment, and the only issue was cost. And like any technological breakthrough, when you can get the cost in line, it's going to displace its predecessor.", "What we're seeing now and I don't think is a step function, I think to answer your question, which is a very fair one, and it's only one person's opinion that you're getting. That being said, the leverage for us is going to come from what I think we do best. We weren't the inventors of brushless. We obviously didn't invent, and we were a slow follower on the application of lithium-ion and things of that nature. Where I believe we've excelled, and I give tremendous credit to our global Tools & Storage team, both in the product development perspective, commercial execution, et cetera, is just the application of all of those technologies.", "The application of brushless, lithium-ion, the way we've been able to get more power, more run time combined with the DEWALT brand, good programs to support it, those are all, I would argue, incremental as opposed to step functions. And that's where our success has come the last two years or three years. Is there more on the horizon? I think, yeah. I think we can see we're cautiously optimistic about what our team has in the pipeline in terms of further advancements of those existing technologies, but I don't see anything in the application of those technologies, but I don't see another lithium-ion, if you will, breakthrough per se in the foreseeable future. But that doesn't mean we're not going to push those hard and get more than our fair share of the market growth by applying the technologies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us some color in terms of the North America vertical products in Security, just what the life cycle on the margins look like relative to your more typical products there? If you could just differentiate maybe on the installs, would we expect lighter, is that what we're seeing now and does that become more of a tailwind as you get more to recurring with the vertical products?", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. I'll take that one, Mike. You know the verticals that we're really concentrating on right now are retail and healthcare. And, as you know, the idea of a vertical selling solutions is to really create a solution that offers much more than just security to our customers. Security is certainly a core component of the solution, but are there other things that we can do, such as in retail where we provide certain information and database on traffic flow in and out of the stores, correlating that with POS, et cetera.", "In healthcare, we're looking at helping productivity within the healthcare environment, the nurses and doctors, and offering solutions in that area to help the customers reduce cost or save money. And so, the model is really to bring forth those types of solutions that give more value, and does that translate into more beyond the installation into certain types of recurring revenue streams. And, that's really the intention of it.", "At this stage, it's still early development around that. But as we get deeper into these verticals and particularly the two that I just mentioned, I do believe that certain recurring revenue streams will evolve from those types of solutions. So, I think that's something you continue to watch and monitor. It's an area of focus as part of our strategy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Robert F. Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Just a quick housekeeping first. I wanted to clarify those growth rates John was giving earlier on the emerging markets, if that was for just Tools or the total company. But then, my question was really on SG&A, 21.5% of sales, very good performance. It actually looks like a record, at least, in recent history. Just wanted to unpack a little more what's driving that, how much is structural and how should we be modeling SG&A going forward? Thank you.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll clarify the first one. The numbers that I gave, the growth rates or lack thereof in some of the emerging markets, were total company. That being said, with the exception of certain Asian markets, that is overwhelmingly Global Tools & Storage. As Don mentioned, Singapore, China, some, we got meaningful Security business, 20% of our total in those markets. But they were total company numbers which were overwhelmingly Tools & Storage. But Don, you want to talk about...", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "SG&A. Sure. Yeah. So the performance, very pleased with the SG&A as a percentage of revenue in Q3 at 21.5% or in that category. But for the year, we do expect us to be somewhere around 22.3%, 22.4% for the total year. We do have some additional costs that do creep into the systems for lack of better word, in the fourth quarter related to some of the promotional activities we do and in-store activities around the holidays that will likely make that number creep up a little bit in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But we are definitely seeing another step-change in this particular area in 2015.", "So, in 2014, we were close to 23% as a percentage of revenue, and when we end the year, we'll be somewhere between 22.2% and 22.4% by the time we close out the year. So, that's a significant improvement. Part of that is what we've been doing for the last two years around indirect cost focus and how do we become more efficient, how do we drive more benefits and productivity in the use of those particular dollars.", "And then also, we've had a little bit of benefit, although it's not huge, from consolidating our CDIY and IAR businesses into the new business called Tools & Storage. So those things together have really helped leverage that objective. And I do think we're at a point now where we can continue to drive that down further.", "As you know, we talked about \u2013 I specifically talked about it in Investor Day, that we think we can get this number down even further through functional transformation, as well as taking some of those savings that we achieved and reinvest in things of digital excellence, commercial excellence, breakthrough innovation, et cetera. But the net result is really to drive our operating margins to 16%, and a lot of that's going to come from what we're trying to do in SG&A along the way.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "The Black & Decker brand has been fairly successful in your mid-price point overseas. But how is the Black & Decker brand being positioned domestically?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the Black & Decker brand domestically \u2013 I've got to bifurcate, Liam, but just from the perspective of Tools, it's overwhelmingly domestically a DIY brand, and it's performing really, really well. You'll find it in the home centers, but you'll also find it in big boxes like Target, like Walmart and places like that, where it's very, very well perceived. A large outlook for the Black & Decker brand, which I'm sure you're aware of, but I need to be careful to distinguish, it's in the home products, both in the U.S. and in Europe.", "The overwhelming majority of those products are licensed, as I'm sure you know, and we obviously receive a royalty for the use of that brand on products designed for use in the home and primarily in the kitchen secondarily. So, it's important to bifurcate. But in both cases, it's DIY non-professional, but premium quality for folks who are doing it not for a living, but folks who are serious about the product they purchase.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on a great quarter.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC", "I guess the question on engineered fasteners and then just the automotive business in particular. And I realize you're not talking about 2016 yet, but automotive is a business where maybe there is a little more forward visibility because of the platforms. And I'm just wondering about your content per vehicle and how you expect that to grow in 2016, if you can talk about that?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, our strategy is always to grow our content for vehicle. And as you know, we're selling solutions. We're selling the equipment or the systems as well as the consumables that go with it. I am not going to get ahead of myself or ourselves or the business particularly as it relates to anything proprietary with our customers.", "But our strategy is always to increase the content per vehicle, and that in and of itself, is a great source of growth. And it's why we've been able to grow in some cases 2 times and 3 times the rate of light vehicle production. And what's playing to our strength there, and I know you understand our business very well, what's playing to our strength there is the lighter that the vehicles become, particularly aluminum, it plays to our strength when you can't well protect for obvious technical reasons, that advantages systems such as ours, so we're looking to grow that content, and that absolutely is the source of growth, all things being equal, above and beyond the growth of light vehicle production.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Stephanie, thank you.

My name is Stephanie, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.", "Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Conference Call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO and Don Allan our Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and the supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and our 2016 outlook followed by a Q&A session.", "Consistent with prior calls we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in the most recent 1934 Act filing.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Today we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance, and then of course take your questions. First for the year, organic growth was up 6% with Tools & Storage leading the way, up 8%. Security was flat while Industrial delivered 2%. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.2% which is a post-merger record for the company. EPS of $5.92 was a 10% improvement versus 2014. Jim's going to provide a lot more detail particularly on the margins and growth by segment when he gets into the segment reviews.", "Free cash flow came in at $871 million on strong working capital turns of 9.2 times. And in line with our previous commitments, we executed over $1 billion of share repurchase actions in 2015, wrapping up a really strong year in which we overcame numerous challenges not the least of which was foreign currency. Guidance for 2016 is being established with an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 a share or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3% versus 2015. Don's going to take you through this in more detail later in the call.", "Moving to the right on the chart for the quarter, revenue expanded 1% organically with total growth down 5% as the top line impact of foreign currency was negative 6% for the quarter. There was a fiscal calendar phenomenon in the fourth quarter that did have a modest negative impact on organic growth that Don's going to address more in detail when he walks through the quarter, but I think it's an important point. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 14.2% which was in 100 basis point improvement ahead of the fourth quarter 2014.", "Our margins increased due to continued sharp focus on price realization and some commodity deflation delivering operating leverage despite $50 million from foreign currency pressure in the quarter. EPS with $1.78 was up 30% versus fourth quarter 2014 as the solid operational performance combined with lower tax, share count, and some restructuring less than the prior quarter offset the foreign exchange.", "Turning to slide five and an overview of the sources of growth for the quarter. As previously mentioned, organic growth remained positive due to the continued strength of Tools & Storage, particularly in the U.S. and the European residential and nonresidential construction markets, and the Stanley Engineered Fastening automotive business, which offset pressure in the Industrial channel, lower emerging market volumes and customer specific volume declines within the Stanley Engineered Fastening electronics business. This growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds of 6% in the quarter, resulting in total revenue down 5% as previously mentioned.", "Looking at it geographically, Europe led the way, up 3%, as share gains continued in the region and nearly every market contributed positive growth. The U.S. generated 1% organic growth while solid Construction POS performance has left customer inventories in good shape as we enter 2016. Emerging markets in the rest of the world began to show signs of macro pressure to the top line, contracting 2% and 3% respectively. There was, as always, significant variation among the countries, but China, Russia, and Venezuela showed the largest year-on-year declines.", "And quickly for the year, organic growth was 6%, 5% volume, 1% price. This growth was offset by 7% currency, netting down to a 1% decline in total revenue, as shown in the box on the left of the chart. We were pleased that geographically the organic growth was shared around the world, spread fairly evenly of course with the U.S. leading the way at plus 8%, Europe plus 4%, emerging markets plus 3%, and the rest of the world plus 3%.", "Let me turn it over to Jim to get into some more operating detail on our three segments.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with Tools & Storage, which wrapped up a banner year with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets, and a relentless dollar strengthening. Tools benefited from strong execution momentum in all areas: new products, supply chain, and commercial excellence.", "As for markets, continued strength in U.S. Construction, DIY, and Consumer was a help. However, emerging market and overall Industrial conditions were more than challenging. European tool end markets continued to be flat to slightly positive, and continuing U.S. dollar strengthening, especially against Latin American currencies, presented familiar but increasingly large headwinds for both revenues and operating margin.", "Organic growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter, with all regions once again contributing. Europe led the way up 6% followed by North America and emerging markets contributing 3% and 1% respectively. Although revenues were down 3% due to a 6 point currency impact, operating margin was up 1% with a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement in the rate. Execution of price, productivity, and cost control initiatives, along with a little help from lower commodity prices, enabled us to more than offset the onslaught from currency pressure.", "And across the global product lines, Power Tools posted 5% organic growth with contributions from Professional Power Tools up 7%, Consumer Power Tools up 3%, and Accessories up 2%. Our Hand Tools & Storage business was down 2% as strength within Construction Tools and our Mac mobile distribution business was offset by significantly lower sales within the Industrial channels. Innovation continues to generate solid growth across the business with ongoing contributions from DC brushless power tools as well as new product rollouts such as the DEWALT 20-volt and DEWALT 40-volt Outdoor, Stanley FatMax power tools in Europe, and DEWALT Pneumatics.", "Within North America retail POS performance was again strong in the quarter, wrapping up a record year which saw positive POS in 50 of 52 weeks, growth across every SBU and as impressively across all major brands \u2013 Black & Decker, DEWALT, Stanley, and BOSTITCH. Importantly, retail inventories remain at healthy and appropriate levels consistent with prior year. And in addition, the team continues to drive out-performance in Mac Tools, which closed the quarter with growth in high single digits, delivering its sixth consecutive year and 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And finally, we continued to enjoy robust growth in e-commerce, this time highlighted by success with our rebranded and very innovative Black & Decker consumer products.", "Europe continues to perform at multiples above the underlying market, posting 6% organic growth in the quarter for a full year total of 7%. This region has shown remarkably consistent share gains in a relatively flat market, delivering approximately 7% organic growth across much of the past three years. Importantly, the growth in Europe continues to be wide-spread across nearly all regions as consistent share gains validate the success of our innovation and commercial excellence initiatives. The emerging market team once again overcame significant market headwinds generating 1% organic growth in the quarter, with contributions from Argentina, Mexico, and Turkey more than offsetting continued pressures in Russia, China, Brazil, and other parts of South America. And meanwhile the timely global release of the Stanley power tools line for emerging markets continues to gain traction in the large and growing mid-price point segment helping to offset regional economic and geopolitical market turbulence.", "The fourth quarter caps off an exceptional year by our Tools & Storage team, 8% organic growth for the year against a 6% 2014 comp with an operating margin rate up 110 basis points, executing on all fronts, taking share, improving profitability in the face of a volatile backdrop. And at the same time, the team very methodically and successfully positioned the business for more growth ahead.", "In that regard, we see continued robust growth for Tools in 2016. Our innovation pipeline is stronger than any time since the merger, and our supply chain and commercial teams are operating at very high fitness levels with the SFS 2.0 firmly embedded in our operating culture. These are exciting times for Tools & Storage and we expect the performance level to continue to be very high as we go forward.", "Turning to Security, progress continued across our Security business with Europe advancing on all fronts and North America showing steady progress in its transformation efforts. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically, the fifth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Commercial wins were widespread across most countries as we recognized benefits from investments in our regional sales organizations. Profitability continued to improve sequentially and versus prior year with a fourth quarter operating margin rate approaching 10%. Solid order intake and a healthy backlog both up double digits year-over-year combined with stable attrition rates within our targeted range leave us well positioned to continue forward momentum into 2016.", "While organic revenues were down within North America due principally to a large installation in last year's fourth quarter, the team posted sequential margin expansion due to improved field productivity within the commercial electronics security business as the benefits from the Stanley standard operational improvement initiative began to take hold. Strong orders, a healthy backlog and a growing RMR portfolio position this business well as we head into 2016.", "Emerging markets were again a modest drag on Security growth and profitability as weak market conditions in China continued. But overall for this segment, profitability was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially, a solid indicator that our transformation efforts are taking hold within the organization.", "Turning to Industrial. Industrial saw a 1% organic decline in the quarter as lower volumes in Engineered Fastenings, Electronics and Industrial businesses more than offset strong global automotive revenue and organic growth in our oil and gas business. Operating profit was up 5% with a 210 basis point improvement in the margin rate as productivity gains and cost controls were able to counteract lower volume. Engineered Fastening's 3% organic decline was attributable to weakening within the Industrial channel and lower sales volume in the electronics space as our largest consumer electronics customer unexpectedly reduced production levels on their recently launched smartphone. This more than offset another quarter in which our automotive revenues outpaced light vehicle production.", "The business was able to anticipate some of the Industrial market's softness and thus benefited from proactive cost actions taken within the quarter. Infrastructure delivered positive organic growth of 2% as oil and gas grew 17% organically, propelled by increased project activity in the North America onshore market more than offsetting declines in hydraulics, which continues to be impacted by depressed scrap steel prices. All in all, an impressive operational performance was registered by the Industrial teams, expanding profitability and margin rates in the face of a choppy and mostly inhospitable end market environment with the exception of auto production.", "In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins, and record EPS. This performance highlights our team's agility, passion to perform, and ability to be proactive and responsive to market condition, balancing investments for growth and taking out costs when necessary, strengths that will serve us well as we head into 2016.", "As we consider the 2016 outlook, which Don will share with you in a few minutes, our ability to generate outsized organic growth albeit at a slower pace than in the preceding two years will be enabled by the investments we have made and are making in SFS 2.0, which is our transformational business operating system. In early 2015, we launched the next generation of SFS, creating a more powerful mechanism to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion with high asset efficiency. The expanded SFS 2.0 is transforming the company by focusing our activities in five key areas: digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, commercial excellence, functional transformation, and core SFS.", "I would encourage serious long-term investors to develop a deep understanding of SFS 2.0 in that this is not an investor relations marketing jargon but rather a carefully constructed and executed framework that enables our organization to extract maximum value out of our world class franchises. We do this through capital efficient organic growth and continuous margin expansion. You have already seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in the organic growth and margin expansion in Tools & Storage and other parts of the company.", "In 2016, you will see a growing impact from breakthrough innovation, digital, as well as the other elements of the initiative which is now in its second year and gaining momentum. I would also say that we are once again open for business when it comes to inorganic growth. We look forward to supplementing our organic growth with a disciplined approach to M&A that we have deployed during almost 100 hundred acquisitions over the past 15 years, a period of time when we more than quadrupled our revenues and market cap and outperformed the S&P 500's total shareholder return by five times.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full year. This full-year result is approximately $50 million to $75 million lower than we anticipated going into the quarter and is the result of lower than expected fourth quarter volumes in Tools & Storage and Engineered Fastening, which in turn, resulted in lower working capital liquidation. Nonetheless, working capital turns finished the year at 9.2 times, flat to the prior year, but at a level that many industrials would envy. Overall, our cash flow performance remains strong, a 96% conversion rate for the full year and our leveraged metrics are in line with our year-end expectations.", "One additional comment on free cash flow as it relates to the other line. As you can see, we experienced approximately $120 million variance versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. This variance was planned and is due primarily to discontinued operation activity in the fourth quarter of 2014 combined with the timing of certain derivative settlements and tax payments.", "So, let's turn to page 11. I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. Certainly, it won't be news to anyone that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against the vast majority of currencies around the world. This strong dollar has resulted in approximately a 50% increase against the Brazilian real since the beginning of 2015. Also, the British pound, and the Australian dollar are at levels we have not seen since the 2008 credit crisis, and the Canadian dollar has not been this weak versus the U.S. dollar for well over a decade. And last but certainly not least, the Argentinean peso, which essentially has been on a constant decline since the government's default back in 2001, accelerated its correction with a 30% cliff devaluation in December, resulting in another meaningful headwind for us in 2016.", "The effect of all these moves is that we are facing another significant foreign exchange headwind in 2016 which, at current spot rates, results in a year-over-year impact to operating margin between $170 million and $190 million. This impact is a combination of transactional and translational. However, approximately two-thirds of the 2016 headwind will be transactional, pressuring our margins, while approximately one-third will be translational. The transactional amount is substantially higher than prior year, as we feel the impact of the 2015 derivative hedges expiring in 2016, and this is approximately $60 million of our total currency headwinds.", "This 2016 currency impact is on top of over $300 million in currency headwinds we faced over the past two years, where our teams focused on significant operational actions which more than offset these pressures in 2014 and 2015. However, given the magnitude of these continued headwinds, we will not be able to completely offset currency in 2016 with price and cost actions. That being said, we will offset approximately 50% of this $170 million to $190 million headwind within 2016. And as we have previously discussed, over the long-term, we will continue to identify opportunities to localize production to help mitigate currency as well as improve the efficiency of our global supply chain.", "So, let's transition to our 2016 outlook on the next page. As John mentioned, we are guiding to an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3%. Let's walk through some of the key drivers in our guide. First, we expect organic growth to approximate 3%, which will contribute $0.45 to $0.50 EPS for the year. As Jim discussed, SFS 2.0 will help fuel this growth in 2016 and beyond. We expect our Tools & Storage business to continue to take market share in most regions. Our innovation pipeline is robust and we believe this business can leverage that to grow in the low to mid-single digits in the face of challenging global macroeconomic environment.", "We expect progress to continue within the Security platform resulting in low single-digit growth, and we also expect Industrial to have low single-digit growth as the Engineered Fastening and Automotive business will continue to demonstrate strong growth, while the remainder of the segment faces pressures across several end markets including oil and gas, scrap steel, general industrial, and electronic.", "One additional point related to organic growth before I move on to the next topic. It's worth noting that when normalizing for a 53-week activity, which was included in the 2014's fourth quarter, which is a fiscal calendar phenomena that occurs every seven years. If you adjust for that, the total company's organic growth would have actually been 1.5 to 2 points higher or approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is notable when you consider the fact of 1% organic growth and us guiding to 3% organic growth in 2016. We believe, this, along with the strength of certain markets we operate in, namely U.S. construction, along with global automotive production, combined with our focus in SFS 2.0 gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 3% organic growth outlook for 2016.", "Continuing to the next EPS driver, you will see another $0.45 to $0.50 of earnings improvement from additional cost and productivity initiatives. We have a solid amount of carryover commodity deflation materializing in 2016 and the business teams have worked hard to identify additional cost reduction opportunities which on top of our normal productivity gains will result in a solid contribution to the bottom line. Also, we see an additional increase to EPS of approximately $0.13 from a lower share base due to the carryover benefit of our 2015 share actions as well as opportunistic buybacks particularly if we continue to see depressed share prices.", "Working against all of these strong operational actions will be the previously-mentioned foreign exchange headwind which results in approximately $0.85 to $0.95 of EPS pressure year-over-year. Because of the severity of this transactional currency headwind and its impact on margins, we expect the company-wide operating margin in 2016 to be relatively flat year-over-year. To put this in perspective, we estimate that the FX headwinds net of benefits we are receiving from lower commodity costs as well as pricing activities will cause us to lose 60 basis points to 75 basis points of margin rate improvement in 2016.", "Our three-year financial vision presented at the May 2015 Investor Meeting contemplated a 50 basis points to 75 basis points of margin improvement each year, which assumes a stable foreign exchange environment. So, we believe we're continuing to perform in line with that objective, albeit with our improvements offsetting FX rather than resulting in OM rate expansion that we like to see.", "A few other items to mention related to guidance are: we expect our restructuring charges and tax rate to be relatively flat to the prior year, and then finally, as we look to the first quarter, we expect our first quarter EPS percentage of the full year EPS to be approximately 18.5%, which is very close to the prior two years' average.", "Moving to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, I've already touched on most of the drivers behind our organic growth so I'll spend a minute on margin rate expectations. We expect Tools & Storage margin to be relatively flat year-over-year and that is primarily the result of the FX dynamic I described earlier netting against the really impressive operating leverage this business continues to achieve.", "We expect Security margins to continue to improve modestly versus prior year reflecting benefits from further progress in field productivity, our commercial investments, and the realignment of the cost structure of the business to help drive profitable future growth; another good step forward, as anticipated. Industrial margins are expected to be relatively flat, as productivity gains in cost takeouts particularly within the Engineered Fastening business are expected to offset top line pressure I previously discussed related to key portions of this segment.", "Before moving on to the summary of this morning's call, I would like to discuss the potential for a recessionary environment and make a few comments on what actions we would take if, and I emphasize if, we are faced with deteriorating economic conditions. At this stage, we believe a U.S. recession is low probability in 2016. However, we have established contingency plans to ensure we are adequately prepared. If we were faced with this type of an environment consistent with our behavior in past similar circumstances, we would execute mitigation plans and they would take the form of head count reductions, investment delays, and further discretionary spending reductions.", "Specifically, if the environment resulted in us experiencing a flat organic revenue performance versus our current view of 3% growth, we would take cost actions to hold EPS relatively close to our guidance range. Clearly, if a more severe environment were to occur, which appears unlikely at this stage, we would focus on protecting our earnings base as much as possible, similar to the approach we took in 2009.", "Now, moving on to the summary page. We are very pleased with the business' performance in 2015. We witnessed strong operational execution to overcome a host of external challenges including $220 million of foreign exchange headwinds, which delivered ultimately organic growth of 6% at the top end of our targeted range; a record operating margin rate of 14.2%, which was up 90 basis points versus the prior year; and of course, double-digit EPS growth. We are also encouraged with the progress in our Security business, particularly Security Europe, which really made meaningful improvements on all fronts.", "As we look to 2016, we are focused on positioning the company to manage through another year of turbulent markets and severe foreign exchange headwinds. As such, we remain committed to our core objectives: maintaining our focus on organic growth through both continued innovation and commercial excellence; ensuring progress within the Security segment to maintain the momentum we saw in 2015; of course, executing on additional cost and pricing actions to help partially offset our FX headwinds; and also being prepared to take further actions as conditions warrant; as always, maintaining our perpetual focus on working capital management and improving that as we move forward; and importantly, leveraging the pillars of SFS 2.0; and to continue driving momentum in 2016 and beyond.", "That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now, we move to Q&A.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Don, thanks. Stephanie, we can now open the call to Q&A please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just one question in line with the rules. Obviously, the Tools & Storage performance in 2015 was exceptional. A big part of that was SFS 2.0 and the innovation pipeline. I'm just wondering how does the NPI look for 2016? And maybe just comment on the share gains in Europe; any categories to call out there?", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Sure. It's Jim. The innovation pipeline for Tools & Storage is as robust as it has been at any time since the merger. And what we've been focusing on, if you rewind to 2010 when we put the companies together, there was a lithium-ion problem, they were losing share, we inherited that. Fortunately, they had done a fair amount of corrective action that began to manifest itself shortly after the merger and we started regaining share. And then we, after a year or two of that, really came out strong with the DC brushless, a complete redesign of the DC brushless products. And that became the fastest-growing segment of cordless, and we were growing at about 2x and still are growing at a very rapid rate vis-\u00e0-vis competition.", "And then at the same time, there was a lot of, call it, incremental innovation going on in Hand Tools & Storage in revitalization of the Black & Decker brand and product lines, the Consumer Products and accessories as well. So there's been a lot of, I'd call it, broad-based but relatively small-scale innovation in addition to the lithium-ion gains and then the DC brushless gains. So that's all really what's driven the NPI, that's driven some of the growth here in addition to the commercial excellence that you referred to.", "Now, what's coming is something more on the order of breakthrough innovation, which is the real SFS 2.0. And without getting into the details of exactly what it is, I think if you stay tuned during 2016, you will start to see some pretty interesting innovation that would be more in the category of breakthrough. And in addition to that, we will continue on with the incremental type innovation and the DC brushless and the continuing progress in lithium-ion. So, it really is a step function increase in innovation that is occurring in the Tools business, and you'll start to see the manifestation of that I think in the second half of the year.", "As far as Europe, there's a number of things going on in Europe relative to the Black & Decker products, the Consumer business, the brushless, which is a big deal over there, and a number of other things. But I'd say Europe is a combination to the NPI plus just the tremendous thrust into commercial excellence, which, as we've described it or as we describe it, involves a multi-pronged attack into the seven pillars, if you will, of customer-facing processes, which include gaining customer insights, driving innovation, driving brand awareness, being excellent at pricing and promotion, deploying the sales force properly, doing channel and partner programs that are very aggressive and successful, and then finally providing outstanding customer sales and post-sales support.", "And it's a focus on all those various processes. When you put them all together, that's what's really driving the growth in Europe. And I'd say on top of that, you have what I'd call second order revenue synergies from the Black & Decker merger that are even today manifesting themselves in further growth, customer white space, distribution channel white space, those types of things, brand white space are all helping drive the European growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Your line is open.", "Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Hey, in terms of Tools & Storage, the outlook for U.S. construction still positive. Maybe there and just for the broader company that we're getting this offset now from Industrial, can you sort of frame and provide a little more color on the magnitude of the drop-off you saw there in 4Q and what are your expectations for the drag from Industrial in 2016?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Shannon, this is John. Industrial markets are slowing down. That's the bad news. The good news is, it represents about 20% of our total business, 25% I guess with Industrial Hand Tools within Tools & Storage. But if I can kind of address, I'll say, the elephant in the room, you're very polite or diplomatic about it, but I think I can answer your question quite helpfully. We strive to grow at two times the rate of the market in our Tools & Storage business over the long term. And we've met or exceeded that objective over the past two years, as Jim just described, as the SFS 2.0 growth initiative started to gain traction. And this being said, I don't think it's realistic to plan such outsized growth each and every quarter from any global diversified industrial.", "So in the fourth quarter, organic growth was lower than we planned, but the shortfall was in areas you'd expect, and a lot of information from Jim and Don, but to try to summarize it, we did have lower industrial channel volumes in Tools & Storage and Stanley Engineered Fastening. That was a full point of organic growth relative to our expectations, and that's globally across the company. Another full point was lower customer-specific volumes and it's been well in the public domain from a large Consumer electronics customer for our Stanley Engineered Fastening business again within the Industrial segment. But that contributed almost a full point of slower organic growth than our expectations.", "Something that's not directly related to Industrial channels, emerging markets' softness, if you will, contributed about a point. So, relative to the 1% reported, that's about 300 more basis points. And then lastly, Don talked about the fiscal calendar phenomenon, which was another 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So, looking at it all that way, I think it's fairly straightforward. Without question, the biggest headwind being industrial markets in general and those markets in the U.S., in particular, because they've been so strong. Conversely, as Jim just talked about, Tools & Storage in the U.S., up mid- single digits; Europe, up 6%. But that's driven by construction in retail, even e-commerce, which was way up. Automotive is still strong. We grew 6% in the fourth quarter, which is well above the rate of light vehicle production. And Security Europe, our investments are paying off. It was up 3%.", "So, I think your question is spot on. Our biggest headwind on organic growth, obviously, that has nothing to do with FX, are the industrial markets. They represent 20% to 30% of our business. And if they're flat, we think \u2013 the markets are flat, we think that's probably as well as they're going to do. And I think you can do the math from there. So, I hope that helps.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And if I could just offer a little additional insight on the Industrial. It's an interesting situation, because you have very much a sector-specific series of issues with agriculture, mining, and oil and gas or energy. So there's a capital \u2013 a CapEx kind of contraction going on in those industries. And it's sort of spilled over to affect the overall MRO market as well. And then you have industrial markets such as automotive that are more driven by Consumer demand, and those are relatively healthy. So, within Industrial, you have a dichotomy of markets that are flat out on their back, and then you have other healthy markets. And fortunately for us, a good portion of our Industrial exposure happens to be in the automotive. And if that holds up, that will be a very good thing. And we'll just see what \u2013 how long it takes for this ag, mining, and energy, those segments to kind of play out and trough out. And then, at that point, I think we'll be back in good stead with Industrial.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Matt A. Bouley - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. This is Matt, on for Mike. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the Engineered Fastening business. Wanted to get your thoughts on the customer challenges you mentioned just on the electronics side, specifically. So, how you may be addressing that, how you think that dynamic plays out in 2016, and how that is embedded in your organic guidance.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Don will give you exactly how it's embedded in organic guidance, because it's pretty much arithmetic. But as you would expect, it's a large customer. We don't \u2013 we just have a policy not to mention customers names on our call. But I think it's quite clear who it is, and that's their choosing, not ours. That being said, strategically, it's to diversify our customer base just as we've done over the years in global Tools & Storage, where there was a point in time where the two largest North American big box retailers represented 40% of our business. Today, they're huge customers but they represent about half that amount.", "The same thing with Engineered Fastening, and then will turn it over to Don. Less than three years ago, OEM automotive was more than 70% of the business. So, it was a conscious decision to diversify the verticals we serve, particularly with a focus on electronics, to a lesser extent, aerospace. And we've done that and it's been pretty successful. So, we've had tremendous growth and then a step back relative to one customer's end market product sales being down.", "Simply said, within Consumer electronics, we need to diversify our customer base. We think we have as good a product offering as anyone to accomplish that. Of course, it doesn't happen overnight. And then continue the strategic push, as Jim and the business leaders talked about in May, to serve more verticals. But Don can talk to you about the specifics of the one issue in Consumer electronics as it relates to our guide.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So, our electronics business within Engineered Fastening, as John mentioned, was down substantially in the fourth quarter. They had about an impact of a full point across the entire company, which equates to about $25 million of revenue. And that was a percentage decline versus prior year of close to 30%, 40% with that particular piece of the Engineered Fastening business. We expect that type of pressure to continue into 2016, and we formulated that into our guidance. And that's clearly one of the pressure points that we are anticipating and it's a headwind against the organic growth of 3%. And so, it's one the reasons why the organic growth is at that number versus maybe original expectation, closer to 4%", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.", "Timothy R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess my question is just on construction. Curious what you're seeing in the market and kind of what you're embedding around non-res and residential construction in 2016.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I'll take that one. So, we obviously have a view that's positive related to construction overall and we think that is an appropriate perspective for 2016 at this stage. And when you look at point of sale information from some of our major customers, we're seeing rates that \u2013 we ended the year with very strong growth rates and what we're seeing and expect that to continue here in 2016. As far as the break between resi and non-res, I think the non-res market continues to show a little bit of life. We watch that closely in a portion of our Security business, in particular, our mechanical lock business is a good indicator of that.", "That business is demonstrating kind of mid- to high single-digit organic growth over the last year. We expect that type of trend to continue. So, we're not looking for a dramatic increase in that space, but it's a relatively small part of our company, roughly $250 million, 300 million of revenue annualized but it's a good indicator of the non-resi market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Hey, I want to come back to currency more from a strategic standpoint if you can kind of address kind of the question. Looking at what's going on, obviously, there could be a debate on whether this is now just a cyclical phenomenon or a secular phenomenon. And I just wonder where you stand on that. And really the essence of my question is if you believe it's more secular, what does the investment look like to further reposition the footprint of the company geographically to respond to that on a longer-term basis?", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll start, Jeff. You used the caveat, if you believe it's secular, and I'm not sure we do. We could have a long debate about it. But even if it \u2013 we're going to do the same thing irrespective of cyclical. On cyclical, Jim, Don and I have been doing this a long time. You want to talk about the euro; everybody worries about it being on parity. I've done business when it was at $0.85 and we've seen it approach $1.50. That's fairly cyclical. Irrespective whether it's cyclical or secular, what we can do the most, I think two things. We're not going to double down where the risks are high, but we're also not going to walk away from our investments.", "We're going to stay positioned particularly in emerging markets and 50% of our revenue is outside the U.S. in those markets which will continue to grow albeit slower from a lower base to be in a position to leverage our share and leverage our volume when and if it turns around. But the biggest thing affecting us and I think Don touched on it, we always talk about both translational and transactional. And as the transactional aspect grows to more than 50% of our foreign exchange headwind, what we're working very hard to do is move production and sourcing locally. We have a goal to produce 50% or more of what we do in countries where we sell it.", "And if you take that to the next step, obviously, everyone knows you can't build a plant overnight nor would you want to nor would you want to put bricks and mortar down if you believe it's secular. But what we can do is a much better job and we're working hard at it, qualifying local both raw materials and more important critical component suppliers. And if you're working in an emerging market, as I think you're aware, many of our components that are critical to quality are either U.S.-based or U.S.-produced or dollar-denominated. To the extent we can qualify local suppliers, protect our IP but produce those critical components locally to be processed locally, that's going to be a tremendous offset or hedge.", "Don may want to add something to that.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think that particular point, what John said is exactly correct. However, the reality is that at this stage in certain parts of the world, Canada and Brazil being the best example, there's not a great deal of suppliers that are available that we can do that with. So, that's something that we have to think about, is there an Asian company that we're currently working with that would \u2013 they could create a plant within Brazil and allow us to have a supplier locally, that is transacting locally. Those are all things that take time. These are not necessarily things that happen overnight.", "In the meantime, we're doing things as much as we can that make economic sense over the short-term and the long-term. But I think we do view this as very much a cyclical shift, and if that view changes over time, then obviously, our view of where we manufacture will have to shift as well. Because if you look at the history of Stanley and of course the history of Black & Decker separately, they're both known for pursuing the lowest cost possible and also maintaining the highest quality. And that's not going to change. So as dynamics shift in the markets around the world and costs shift with it, we have to be flexible and agile and make sure that we're doing the right thing from a supply chain perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions; one, John, what are your thoughts about asset prices now for potential acquisitions in terms of what you're seeing out there given some of the broader weakness in the global economies? And then second question, on Industrial margin, I think calling for relatively flat, Don, does that assume \u2013 how much of a decline does that assume in electronics? It sounds like you're assuming a pretty steep decline year-over-year within the guide. But I just want to get the puts and takes and the risks to upside or downside to the Industrial outlook for margin. Thanks.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll take the asset price. They're becoming more reasonable just as is Stanley Black & Decker. As I think Jim could not have been more clear in his pitch, Rich, that we are open for business in terms of growing this company by a thoughtful strategic acquisition that meets both our strategic goals and our financial hurdles as well as fits within our organizational capacity. And I'll simply say, as multiples come down, I think, and valuations come down, there's more out there that could be attractive to us both domestically and outside the U.S. I don't think \u2013 there's so many bargains out there as we speak that we need to rush to buy something because it's never going to be at a lower price. But our view is always to buy good companies at a fair price. We've had a hard time meeting or exceeding valuation expectations in the last six months, but we see that \u2013 we see it, I think, as you might expect coming more into line, which is that and the fact that we think we have our Security business on the right track, which is why Jim made the point in his piece of the presentation. We are open for business, looking at assets in the three strategic areas that we've previously identified.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And, Rich, on the Industrial question related to margins, certainly the impact from the electronics business within Engineered Fastening is pressuring margins as we expect significant top line pressure there. We also, within that business, within Engineered Fastening, we have a kind of a general industrial sector that's about at $0.5 billion in revenue on an annualized basis that has been feeling pressure as well similar to the Industrial Tool business within Tools & Storage. For example, in the fourth quarter, that business was down approximately 10%. And we expect that to continue at least into the first half.", "So those two things are definitely putting pressure on the top line and the margins. Now, offsetting that and going in the opposite direction is what Jim and both John had mentioned about the automotive production business within Engineered Fastening is offsetting that. We expect growth probably in the mid-single digits again within that business in 2016. And we also have cost actions and various other productivity actions we're taking across Engineered Fastening to make sure that the margins are flat and hopefully a little bit better than that as the year goes on.", "And then the two smaller pieces of Industrial, which is the oil and gas business and the hydraulic tool business, the combination that we call Infrastructure, we expect those to be relatively flat on the top line, maybe down slightly, and then margins flat as well as those markets are pretty slow at this stage. But we think we've gotten through the difficult comps as we go into 2016.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Robert Barry - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what's assumed for price in the outlook? And specifically, perhaps if you could unpack some of the moving pieces say price to offset currency, price to get paid for all the innovation versus maybe having to share some of the commodity deflation with the bigger customers. Thanks.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Fair question. Fairly complex to say the least.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I'm not sure I can give all that level of granularity for a variety of reasons, but I will give you a little bit of color on this area. We do expect a modest positive in price in 2016, and there's really a makeup within that number. We do see more positive price in emerging market actions. So as we deal with this currency pressure, in particular in Brazil and some of the other Latin countries, but then also in Canada as well, which is obviously not an emerging market, we expect some price increase there. So those are positives.", "Some of the negatives, we will see a little bit of price pressure in different parts of the mature markets, because we have dealt with some significant commodity deflation; that's been a benefit to us. We don't expect that to be significant, but those are very kind of surgical strategic decisions that our Tools & Storage team is very savvy at managing and working through as part of the overall offering to our customers.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I guess I'll just add to that. I think it is important because the very end of your question was more than fair in terms of getting paid for the innovation. We have a history of, if you will, protecting price or being paid by innovation just for that reason. Specifically, to bring the same product or a minor modest incremental improvement to a customer, even in a flat commodity situation and expect the price increases unrealistic to say the least. Real prices have been declining 2% to 3% a year or 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years, real prices.", "So the way to protect price, I think it's probably more important in understanding why Don has confidence that overall we'll see some modest price, is to bring in some cases meaningful incremental but meaningful and in other cases, to Jim's point, breakthrough innovation to the customers. If no one else has it, you can charge whatever \u2013 you can value price and charge what you believe is appropriate for it. So it's far easier to bring a product improvement at a 5% or 6% higher price point, that way you cover your inflation, your labor inflation, or anything else that there happens to be there, the incremental cost of that improvement and you and the customer both win. Because the customer can take his retail price up, you can take your wholesale price up, and thereby protecting margins, and everybody wins and it's a fair trade.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.", "John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, guys. It's John Coyle filling in for Steve. Can you maybe talk about the pace of activity over the course of the quarter? Did you see a deceleration as we got later into the year? And then maybe any thoughts on what you see now thus far in January?", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, this is Don. I would say that we didn't see anything that was really indicative of significant market trends. When it comes to our retail business in Tools & Storage, there's a lot of ebbs and flows in the quarter that are really dependent on when customers want products, refilling orders after the holiday season. So from a general market trend, we didn't see anything dramatic within the kind of consumer side of Tools & Storage.", "On the Industrial side, it was pretty much a consistent trend throughout the quarter, other than electronics. Obviously, electronics shifted to the negative dramatically in the month of November, and that held into December and is holding into the first quarter. So we're not necessarily taking anything as far as market trends in the fourth quarter as a big indicator to the first quarter and beyond, beyond some of the things that we've already discussed such as electronics and general industrial. But you know, I think the only thing that really shifted within the quarter would have been the electronics business with Engineered Fastening.", "John F. Lundgren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah and the other thing I'll add to that that I think most of us are aware of, as it relates to our retail customers and the retail business in general, one of the reasons Don said that between 18% and 19% of our earnings take place in the first quarter. January is always a very slow month. As I know you understand, and most people on the call do, our largest customers' fiscal years end in January. It's post-holiday season. They have a very appropriate objective of reducing or minimizing inventories as the year closes. So simply said, whatever happens in January, we don't ever think of it as a good predictor or indicator of how the year is going to start. We need pretty much a full first quarter, particularly on the retail side for that reason to get a flavor for where we are and where we're going. Importantly, Jim pointed out, I think, most important. POS was good in the fourth quarter, so inventories are in a good place. So nothing to suggest dire straits, but it's very early days.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group. Your line is open.", "Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Can you talk about the progress you made in North America Security margins related to the vertical markets' learning curve? And where are you maybe just give us an update on the evaluation of the overall Security portfolio within Stanley? Thanks.", "James M. Loree - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Okay. I'll answer the second question first, and nothing's changed since we communicated in May of last year at our investor meeting that we would be doing an evaluation that would take about a year. And that we would during that period of time we were going to evaluate the operational performance as well as the strategic issues and opportunities related to the Security business and then we would come out with some sort of a position in the middle of 2016. And that continues to hold. As far as the North American Security business, I mean, I think we're finding that in the verticals, the healthcare vertical is doing absolutely fabulously. It's achieved mid-double digit margins, mid-teens.", "And the issue with that now is how to grow it faster. So we'll be making some investments to grow it faster, and it could be a substantial contributor to organic growth. The retail vertical I think is still kind of in the early days in terms of trying to figure out exactly where the value proposition could be and how big we can make that, how profitable it can be. And so I'd say we're probably in about the third or fourth inning with the retail. But I would expect by mid to late 2016, we would make a lot of progress on that front as well. I think the other verticals \u2013 and those are the two verticals that we're going to be emphasizing this year, and really get them right, get the healthcare one growing, get the retail strategy fully engaged. And then at that point, we'll decide do we want to add another vertical to our main area of focus.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open.", "Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. And congrats on a very solid year. I wanted to ask you, Don, about the free cash flow. I mean, it's coming somewhat below initial expectations a year ago. And I wanted to understand what exactly drove the shortfall here. I suspect that forex trends were a significant contributing factor here, and so I'm wondering if we should expect even more of a headwind on cash flow in 2016 given the transactional effects that you called out earlier. Thanks.", "Donald Allan - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, the free cash flow for 2015 came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated. And it was primarily due to less working capital liquidation as a result of the lower organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. And it's interesting, the timing of how it played out is usually what happens in our Tools & Storage business in particular is that we have high levels of revenue in October and November preparing for the holiday season as well as doing kind of refill orders after Black Friday. And then we collect a lot of that by the end of December.", "Because we saw a different trend occur in that particular business and obviously a lower organic growth number than our expectation, the result was that we didn't get the working capital turn that we were anticipating. We were anticipating turns of 9.5 times to 9.7 times. It came in at 9.2 times which are actually fantastic. And at this stage, working capital turn improvement becomes harder and harder. The other dynamic is as we grow organically and you saw the significant organic growth we had in 2015, you have to improve your working capital turns even more to get a cash flow benefit. So even with if we had achieved an improvement to 9.5 times to 9.7 times, we still would have had a slight negative within our cash flow statement for working capital. We would have had to get it much closer to 10 times to see a positive.", "And that's just the reality of what we're going to deal with going forward that we won't see large working capital benefits in the cash flow statement, and we want to continue to improve working capital and get it over 10 turns over the next few years. And hopefully when we \u2013 as we do that, the amount of impact to cash flow will be modest. It likely will be modestly negative. As a result, our cash flow on a go forward basis will still be very strong. As I said for 2016, I expect the conversion rate to be about 100% which would mean it's going to be somewhere between $900 million to $925 million for 2016.", "We always look to improve our working capital more than beyond our goals and expectations, so obviously we'll be driving to try to outperform that. But right now based on where we are with our working capital turns, we can't expect large cash flow benefits from that area and really the cash flow is going to come from the earnings performance and operational performance.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Stephanie?", "Operator", "That concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Waybright for closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright - Vice President-Investor & Government Relations", "Great. Thanks, Stephanie.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Vice President of Investor and Government Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright", "Great, thank you, Kylie, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s first quarter 2016 conference call. On the call in addition to myself is John Lundgren, our Chairman and CEO; Jim Loree, our President and COO, and Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO.", "Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad apps. And a replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning John, Jim, and Don will review our first quarter 2016 results and various other matters followed by Q&A session.", "And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It\u2019s therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing.", "With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Lundgren.", "John Lundgren", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us, and for those of you who have had a chance to look at our earnings release, it should point out that we remain strongly focused on generating above-market organic growth, meaningful operating leverage, and strong free cash flow conversion. We\u2019ve really got a lot of really good news to report on the quarter, as well as some real excitement looking forward. So I\u2019m going to be very quick through some of the highlights, before turning it over to Jim and Don for more granularity and then of course we\u2019ll get on to the Q&A.", "Organically, we grew 5% total growth of 2%, the difference being currency. Really robust organic growth in Tools & Storage 8% with significant outperformance in the emerging markets which was nice to see that come back, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong global Tools & Storage performance in just a second. Industrial was down 3%, as we anticipated, and Security was up 1%, as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ve been very focused on and we\u2019re very pleased to see it carrying on the way it has.", "Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year, the overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure. Security industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points respectively, and Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds as most of you are aware the overwhelming majority of our FX does impacts our global Tools & Storage business.", "That led to diluted earnings per share up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year, solid operating performance combined with lower share count, lower restructuring costs, which more than offset the currency impact. So on the back of the first quarter performance \u2013 outperformancee, we\u2019re raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015, and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided. Concurrently, we\u2019re reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.", "Let\u2019s turn briefly to the sources of the growth, during the first quarter. Volume was up 4%, price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was a 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth, and a 5% currency driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter 2015, so very, very strong sequential quarterly trend.", "Turning to the regions, you can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%, Europe up 3%, total emerging market group was up 3%, which of course was led by global Tools & Storage, a very strong performance, and the rest of the world was up 1%. So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region, but let\u2019s let Jim get into some of the details on our three segments, there\u2019s a lot of really good news this morning.", "Jim Loree", "Okay, thanks, John. I\u2019ll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which as John indicated started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting an all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q 2015 comp of 10% growth. The Tools team continued to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world. This is being accomplished against a volatile macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unpredictable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth.", "Total Tools revenue growth was 4%, after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation resulting in a 40 basis point decline and the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9%, and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance.", "Regarding the global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines: professional, consumer, and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well growing 5% organically with NPD and healthy end-markets, fueling 10% growth in construction hand tools.", "Automotive repair and industrial was a mixed bag with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish fathom, more than offsetting anticipated, but slightly better than expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels. Skew placement success stories were widespread with our new Porter-Cable cordless Nailer gaining listings in multiple outlets, gains with our mechanics Tools and Mac, high access ratchets and continued momentum within the DEWALT DC brushless and pneumatic products.", "Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive construction and DIY markets, a mild winter, especially compared to 2015 and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in USA initiative. Targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac tool fair helped to offset aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels, which remained down albeit with sequential improvement in the quarter.", "Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically, the story continued with nearly all geographic markets again posting positive performances, share gains coupled with surgical pricing actions delivered above market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight as innovations in our consumer products group and the implementation of a broader and deeper go-to market approach generated significant year-over-year gains.", "Last but not least the emerging market team put together an outstanding quarter under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain. This progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches as part of our mid price point or MPP initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate.", "Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of extensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia combined with the LatAm performance more than offset country specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa. All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving tactical share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise, and at the same time, they\u2019re preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success, stay tuned.", "Now turning to Security, which continued to progress on multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth, made significant progress on profitability, and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically for the second quarter in a row, achieving its 6th consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues and multiple geographies highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics and Central Europe were the primary growth drivers.", "Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases. Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front positioned us to maintain this momentum. North American Security also made good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains, under the Stanley standard field operations initiative, drove the year-over-year profitability increase. While organic revenue declined, it was attributable primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q.", "The CSS business\u2019 top-line was flat year-over-year, and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q. And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security\u2019s trends and development.", "Moving on to industrial, results for the segment were in line with expectations as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening\u2019s industrial and electronics businesses combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales, led to an overall 3% organic sales decline for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as oil and gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity, offset continued pressure within hydraulics. Overall, industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points, as productivity and cost controls particularly within Engineered Fastening more than offset lower volumes.", "In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well notwithstanding the anticipated top-line pressures. Automotive fastener sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in five years. The infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results with oil and gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming online over the balance of the year and into 2017.", "Hydraulics on the other hand continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market and in total both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward, was a demonstration of the company\u2019s underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook.", "And before turning it over to Don I want to remind everyone that we\u2019re also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above market organic growth and margin expansion along with high asset efficiency. We\u2019re focusing our activities in 5 key areas: Commercial excellence, digital excellence, break through innovation, functional transformation, and core SFS.", "We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion and as I said on our January Earnings Call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from break through innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future, as we have capital to deploy and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons in the tools and industrial segments.", "These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead, and an ever present focus on margin expansion all contributing to the mix. With that I\u2019ll now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide the financial update.", "Don Allan", "Thank you, Jim, good morning. Let\u2019s begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year over year improvement was a stronger working capital performance, specifically within inventory and accounts receivable.", "As our working capital turns were up four turns finishing the quarter at seven turns. Higher income in the current year quarter served to offset the majority of increased capital expenditures as well as some negative cash outflows in the other line. The other line items, which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payments as compared to the prior year.", "As a reminder the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we\u2019re adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed market.", "As John mentioned earlier and as you can see here in the take away we\u2019re reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income. So let\u2019s turn to page 10 as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind.", "By this point all of you are likely very familiar with our currency trends chart which over the last two years has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar. For also the first time in what seems like quite a while we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies. Most notably the Canadian Dollar, the Brazilian Real and the Euro.", "While on a full year basis we\u2019re still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million. As we established that in late January time frame.", "As a reminder we assessed our currency headwinds on operating margin at the current spot rate. It\u2019s worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure, which pressures our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure, this is a shift from the two thirds one third split we discussed in January. And is driven by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures, which relate to our 2015 hedging activities.", "While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset the $140 million of headwinds it\u2019s important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions particularly in countries where currencies have rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth specifically in the second half of 2016.", "Finally you will notice that on the lower right hand side of the page we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements in the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin so for example a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis.", "Now let\u2019s turn to the next slide which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents an approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015.", "We\u2019re also reiterating our free cash flow as I previously mentioned. The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows. As you can see we\u2019re now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4%, versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption to mid single digits on the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction markets.", "However this strength is partially offset by revisions to industrials organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance. This revision is due primarily to lower than anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening\u2019s Electronics business. As volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continued to decline.", "Additionally we expect the timing shift around certain oil and gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017. Finally as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar.", "Accordingly we expect all these puts and takes around our organic growth assumptions to result still in a net increase to our EPS of approximately $0.05.", "The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in foreign exchange headwinds, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year. Then finally slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage product launch that Jim alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately $0.05 reduction to EPS, the majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016.", "These three assumptions changes result in a net increase of $0.20. Turning to the segment outlook to Tools & Storage and industrial segments organic growth outlook, change along the lines I just previously discussed. And Securities organic growth outlook remains low single digit.", "In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year over year, from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FX headwinds primarily.", "We continue to expect Security\u2019s margin to be modestly positive year over year as operational and field efficiency improvements continue to progress and in the industrials margin to be relatively flat with productivity gains and cost takeouts being able to offset the top line pressures we continue to see. The last point I\u2019d like to make is related to our EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016.", "As you can see we expect first half 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior-year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year, specifically first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015.", "So let\u2019s move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start to the year, with organic growth up 5%, and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance combined with the improved outlooks in the Tools & Storage business, and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for full-year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015.", "As we\u2019ve continued to progress through 2016 our focus remains on the following, driving organic growth across all businesses, and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives, maintaining the momentum behind Security\u2019s margin improvements and as always pushing ourselves to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible. That concludes the presentation portion of our call. Now let\u2019s move to Q&A.", "Greg Waybright", "Thanks, Don. Kylie, we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Your line is open.", "Jeremie Capron", "Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. Clearly there\u2019s a lot of excitement around new product introductions, I think, Jim, you talked about breakthrough innovation, and we should stay tuned for that hitting in the second half.", "Can you maybe give us a little more color around that in terms of the scale of those new product launches, and maybe come back to what happened in Q1. Because I think you called out new products as a major reason for the strong performance in Tools & Storage, as well. Thanks.", "Jim Loree", "Sure. This is Jim. The breakthrough innovation initiative is something that we started really started getting into in the early part of 2014, and the concept behind it is that we do a pretty good job in what we call core innovation, and we did this in both legacy Black & Decker and legacy Stanley, and those are the kind of things that are driving the, you know, the organic \u2013 big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions that I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like, in the hand tools business for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and pry bars and knives and blades, innovative line in one of our large retailers and another large retailer we introduced DEWALT pry bars and pocket knives. And then in professional power tools, compact generation tools DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DEWALT Pneumatics line, a Mac impact wrench but you get the idea here. This is sort of the day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course, but I would say the level of activity in this area, and the freshness of the company\u2019s product lines has never been greater in our recollection.", "So that goes on, and that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives, that you\u2019ve been witnessing now here along with a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets. But you can see the growth all over the world. So in Europe which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets we still are growing an average of about 6% to 7% over 2, 2.5 year period. And so there\u2019s something going on there. And it\u2019s really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence.", "So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside, a small group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range, we just said come up with the next major breakthrough innovation for Power Tools. And we gave them a timeframe and we gave them resources, and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time, they came up with something very, very interesting.", "What is that? You\u2019ll have to wait and see what that is, but from a scale point of view, we say with the breakthrough innovation \u2013 and this is not the only breakthrough innovation team in the company by the way this was just the first one. We have three more in oil and gas. We have one in hydraulics we have \u2013 extending one up in engineered fastening but we tell them that whatever you come up with it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. So I can\u2019t really get into how big this one could be because frankly we don\u2019t know but we know it\u2019s going to be at least $100 million over time and it could be far, far greater.", "So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the background and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly and you will see it in stores in a relatively short order.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "John Lundgren", "Good morning.", "Don Allan", "Good morning.", "Ken Zener", "Given the strength you have in, hand tools picking up, could you \u2013 in a very strong organic growth that you\u2019re seeing in the U.S., could you kind of talk about how the landscape because since it looks like you\u2019re going to be well over $6 this year. Currency is helping but I mean that was a long-term goal when you did the Black & Decker acquisition. Can you talk about how much that landscape has changed on the Power Tools relative to I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s third-party competitors but your high margins that you have are obviously a very different business versus 5 years ago. It seems like you\u2019re just gobbling up market share certainly on a dollar basis if not unit basis. Could you just talk about how that\u2019s really structurally changed again given how strong we were this quarter?", "Jim Loree", "Yes, it\u2019s Jim again. I think what\u2019s really going on here is that the Black & Decker and Stanley integration, the merger of the two companies and the successful integration, was a major home run. I think well beyond anybody\u2019s wildest expectations. I think the cost synergies were just the beginning and we \u2013 I think we signed up for $350 million six years ago and we cut off the analysis at about $550 million of cost synergies and there was a huge outperformance. But the thing we never really expected was the revenue synergies that we also beat what we expected to accomplish but they just keep on coming and it has to do with the fact that the cultures gelled so well and got so focused on innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera behind them, and focused on the customer, focused on the markets.", "And then the scale that we achieved by putting those two companies together and going to market with Power Tools and Hand Tools, and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have, just gave us tremendous flexibility and we just continued to benefit from that as time goes on.", "Don Allan", "And I would say a current example of those revenue synergies we touch on here and there is what we\u2019ve been doing in emerging markets where we\u2019ve been rolling out the mid price point products in particularly Power Tools that have the Stanley brand on it. So that\u2019s a great example of continued generation of revenue synergies six years after the merger.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Specifically just had a question on the security margins as you highlighted a very good first quarter result, best since 2012. Just was curious if you could help out with kind of getting a little more granular in terms of the margin improvement there, off of the revenues down 1%, and perhaps just giving us a sense of perhaps the bigger components of that, also North America versus Europe and how you see that playing out over the next year or two, and perhaps also you can kind of revisit on a more broad basis just the future of the segment overall as you called it out in your Analyst Day as being, the strategic direction being under review, given the solid progress here, how does that affect that? So sorry, a couple of questions but all around the security progress.", "John Lundgren", "Okay, Mike, this is John, I\u2019ll start. There was I think more than one question there but we\u2019ll try to do the best we can. Let me comment on two things. And then Don will give you a little bit more granularity.", "As it relates to our assessment of the segment, nothing\u2019s changed. We love this business, and the fact that it continues to grow and margins continue to improve we\u2019ve said on many occasions our single greatest self-help opportunity in terms of margin improvement and earnings growth is restoring security back to its historical levels. We continue that trend and that\u2019s why Jim, expressed the gratification, or encouragement, that that trend\u2019s continued for six consecutive quarters. As you know, margins in Europe in general are lower than the U.S. but the overwhelming majority of the improvement is coming from Europe, albeit from a low base.", "So we will not forecast margins by sub-segment because, A, it\u2019s very difficult. And B, there\u2019s not much in it for us if we get it right, and a lot of explaining to do if we don\u2019t. But in terms of the assessment of the category itself, we love the business. We review its status with our board every board meeting. That included yesterday and the day before. A year and a half ago, we said in the second half, some time during the second half of 2016, we would be very public in terms of what our plans were. We\u2019re sticking to that and we\u2019re not going to accelerate it. Beyond that, Don, if you want to add a little granularity, please feel free to do so.", "Don Allan", "Sure. So, when you look at the first quarter performance, Jim mentioned that we are very pleased with the profitability of the segments. And really the improvement that we saw was in all three regions of the world, so the big regions really are North America and Europe where emerging markets is relatively small. And then both \u2013 those two large regions we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability as we continue to execute on the initiatives that we\u2019ve been really discussing almost for two years now of improving field productivity in the electronic security business, in particular in both Europe and in North America.", "And then in Europe specifically looking at our, SG&A, our selling and general and administrative costs to making sure they\u2019re in line with the revenue of the business as well as the percentage of revenue, we discussed it as a business that probably should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A and it\u2019s above 30% today so we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses, and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that over the last two or three quarters in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve.", "And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we\u2019re expecting that trend to continue, as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year.", "Jim Loree", "Mike, and just one other point on the business in general, Jim has talked about it on past calls, but it just shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. There\u2019s been a lot of organizational changes, where we think \u2013 and we\u2019ve been talking about it for a while, but the majority of them have now been in place for about a year, where we think, to use Jim Collins\u2019 often-used term, we think not only we have the right people on the bus, we have them in the right seats on the bus.", "And it really matters. Everyone knows that, but the fact that we\u2019ve had a stable, capable, tested and proven team, in Europe and in the U.S. supplemented by a couple great new hires in the last six months or so, it\u2019s really, really helped, first of all, stabilize that business, and then ultimately keep both organic growth and margins moving in the direction we want it to.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Brett Linzey", "Hi, good morning, this is Brett Linzey on for Jeff. Hey, just want to come back to free cash flow. You guys had a strong working capital quarter and I suspect some of that was inventory drawdown on the industrial side to a line with weaker demand there. But could you just talk about where you guys feel you are relative to that 100% conversion for the year? I mean seemingly there\u2019s a path higher. Is that the case? And is there anything in terms of inventory ahead of this product launch that we should be thinking about?", "Don Allan", "Sure, this is Don. I\u2019ll take that. As I mentioned, we\u2019re very pleased with the start to the year related to working capital. Part of it was due to the fact that we did have a very strong month of March. And so our inventory levels were brought down in line with that performance which was great to see. And we also were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter so our accounts receivable was down at the right level, as well.", "So with our company we\u2019re going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year, because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But yet we really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objectives for the full year, and I think we\u2019ve done this. This is the best performance we\u2019ve had in Q1 in four years, related to Stanley Black & Decker and so as a result I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate, because we started the year in that regard.", "Now, your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans, as the year progresses, we would expect those inventory levels, vast majority of them, to be absorbed and shipped out to many of our major customers and so we don\u2019t expect that to be a challenge for us as the year ends. But it could be a little bit of additional inventory as we go through the second and the third quarter, which we would normally see anyways in our Tools & Storage business.", "So at this stage we feel good about our ability to hit our objective of 100%, and we\u2019ll continue to look at that to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Rich Kwas", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Jim Loree", "Hi, Rich. Good morning", "Don Allan", "Good morning.", "Rich Kwas", "Good I\u2019m going to speak on a couple questions here. John and Jim, just wanted to get your thoughts on the mechanical business in North America so from a growth standpoint that continues to underperform key competitors out there and curious, John your reference to how you got the people in the right spots. Want to get your level of confidence around getting the growth rate up and going there considering the cycles turning in the favor in terms of non-res.", "And then quick second question Don in terms of the hedging strategies. Thanks for the sensitivity on the various currencies, but last year you went, you got opportunistic when you had a lot of volatility and just curious if we got volatility over the next few months on currencies? Would you take the same approach and just curious around risk as it relates to the updated guidance with currency and your comfort level with that? Thank you.", "John Lundgren", "Yes, Rich, I\u2019ll take the mechanical piece. I guess in \u2013 excuse me \u2013 and three bytes, margins are good, growth is below what we had expected to be. To a large extent historically that\u2019s been a product issue where we have been behind our own expectations in some of the market.", "That being said, our sense is it\u2019s going to be offset by two things. One is the leadership in that business, we believe is quite capable. We have a tested and proven individual who actually came from the DEWALT professional industrial channel. Very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focus on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not least, recall we just really completed and embedded the change to third-party or independent distribution model versus the direct model.", "And Jim has talked about this often on past calls, years ago we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage, and it was for a time. We made the decision, and I think it was the right one, that what we gain \u2013 we lost more than we gained. As a result of that it was a two-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That\u2019s behind us it\u2019s beginning to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth-focused executive, and the right distribution model in place, product catching up, gives us cautious optimism that we\u2019ll get that growth back in mechanical because it\u2019s a great opportunity for us.", "Jim Loree", "And let me just supplement that by saying. So as John described the operational condition of the business is good and getting better and we\u2019re pleased with that. The question that we still have to answer is the one \u2013 is the strategic question, and, that we\u2019ll put on hold until we come out in the second half of the year with our Securities portfolio review. So that\u2019s, everything is fair game in security, including mechanical.", "Don Allan", "Yes and then I\u2019ll touch on your question related to currencies. Clearly we always look at opportunities for hedging when we see shifts in currency and we will continue to do that and we\u2019ve done that again this year. Sensitivities give you an indication of if currencies move in certain directions for the remainder of the year, what the impact could be to our operating margin. And we have thought through it, is there a potential for the $140 million to move back towards $180 million? There\u2019s a scenario where that could play out if the Fed starts talking about potential interest rate increases that could actually result in strengthening of the U.S. dollar and a weakening of some of these currencies. However, we also feel like we\u2019ve built contingency plans to address that scenario if that plays out.", "So we have certain actions that we would take up to $180 million that we believe would be capable of offsetting that, which is why we felt comfortable making this increase to our guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Tim Wojs", "Yes, hey, guys, nice job.", "Don Allan", "Thank you Tim.", "Tim Wojs", "I guess just on the Tools business, if we could go back to that for a second. So the full-year guidance is up mid single digits but you\u2019ve got 8% in the first quarter, and then as you go through the year, the comps get a little bit easier in the second half, and you have some new product rollouts. So can you just talk about some of the puts and takes and why maybe we should see decelerating growth in the Tools business this year?", "Don Allan", "Well I think you might want to think about the first quarter performance and just we\u2019ve mentioned some things about certainly the weather was an additional boost to us in Q1, in particular in North America, as we actually had a mild winter here for the first time in \u2013 well a long time for those of us in the northeast. And we benefited a point or two in our Tools & Storage business from that. So if you kind of regulate the growth, saying that\u2019s not going to necessarily repeat itself for the next three quarters, then you\u2019re down to something that\u2019s closer to 6% to 6.5%, roughly.", "And then we had a fantastic performance in emerging markets in the first quarter, up 9%. We haven\u2019t seen that type of performance in almost 2.5 years. And so we were pleased with that, feel very good about it, but at this stage we\u2019re not necessarily ready to say that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to repeat itself in the next three quarters.", "We\u2019re clearly focused on trying to maximize that opportunity, but to be able to project that and say for sure that\u2019s going to happen at this stage would probably be a little bit overly optimistic. And those two factors in itself kind of gets you down to a mid single-digit number for the full year, for organic growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, congrats on a good quarter and all the progress. There\u2019s a lot of data there right now including Bureau of Labor Statistics data just showing a clear shift in the United States of labour from energy and mining into construction. I\u2019m just wondering if you feel this is having a meaningful impact on tool growth and talk about the extent to which you see that as a factor going forward.", "Jim Loree", "Yes I\u2019ll take it, David. The interest, yes, to quantify it would be very difficult, because it is happening and one of the constraints that we would listen to, some of the homebuilders\u2019 calls as a good example was basically securing enough qualified, capable labor, because so much of it during the financial crisis shifted from construction into energy. As some of that variable labor pool, if I can call it that, shifts back, the answer is absolutely yes. The demand is there, but the qualified capable technically trained or properly trained workers aren\u2019t, it\u2019s going to be a governor on growth.", "So simply said, yes, it\u2019s having an impact. I think it\u2019s the early stages of that, but that\u2019s clearly helping the North American residential and we think ultimately commercial construction market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Company. Your line is open.", "Jeff Kessler", "Thank you. You\u2019ve been talking, after the limitation of SFS, you\u2019ve been talking, you mentioned it twice in the first, in your presentation. I\u2019m wondering, and you mentioned that the implication and the actual evidence of that is going to be shown somewhere this year perhaps some time in the second half. Could you be a little more specific as to how we\u2019re going to see SFS come out in the not so much in the numbers, but how it\u2019s going to come out in the operations that you\u2019re showing, which in turn affect the numbers.", "Don Allan", "Sure, well I talked about the five elements of SFS. We\u2019ll start with the core SFS which is basically the continuation of the SFS that we started in 2006 that got us to 9.2 working capital turns last year and got us customer-facing metrics, we\u2019re very, very strong in relation to competition and make most of our customers very happy.", "So that core SFS is at the heart of all this and that\u2019s much more of an operations related initiative and it continues to become deeply rooted ten years into its existence. And now what we\u2019re doing with core SFS is we are taking it to another level, largely through digitizing the supply chain, as well as implementing the smart factory across the company.", "That\u2019s kind of in the early stages, but nonetheless, it is under way. So if we were at nine turns at the end of the year, and we typically generate about 4%, 3% to 4%, productivity, well our cost productivity a year in our factories, and we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we\u2019re making in some of the things that I\u2019m talking about, as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards ten and maybe even someday north of ten. So that\u2019s the core SFS.", "Then there are three elements that are far more growth-oriented, those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talked about breakthrough innovation, I think at length and I think that\u2019s pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth. And so becoming world-class in some of these elements, like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence, and so on and there\u2019s a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have an ability to generate tactical share gains, and also margin expansion. So that\u2019s the commercial excellence.", "And then the digital excellence is one we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. They probably won\u2019t be dramatic revenue drivers, but will clearly be \u2013 ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depth of penetration in our company, and also just contemporize our value propositions, so that we are again leading the marketplace with technology on the digital front, as well as taking digital and permeating it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness.", "So that\u2019s kind of \u2013 those are the various elements. The one I didn\u2019t mention is functional transformation and that\u2019s a very extensive initiative led by our Finance and IT leaders, who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper, after having done 100, almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in Finance, IT, HR, Legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible.", "We already believe that they\u2019re quite effective, but we also believe there\u2019s a couple points of G&A that could come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That\u2019s a long-term initiative. We are not going to see a lot of overnight successes there, but it\u2019s one where we\u2019re making some investments and then over the course of a couple years, we\u2019re really going to start to see that SG&A percent come down as a percent of sales and we\u2019re going to take some of the money that comes out of that and reinvest it in some other growth initiatives.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Mike Dahl", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Say, a question around some of the M&A opportunities that you mentioned at the \u2013 in the initial commentary, looking at the bolt-ons in Tools and Industrials. Just curious with all of the market volatility in recent months, what\u2019s your take on how seller expectations have shifted, if at all? What types of sellers are you hearing from? And again if that has changed over the past six months or so, and then just remind us again of kind of what specific areas you think you\u2019re looking to fill some gaps in within Tools. Thanks.", "John Lundgren", "Yes, sure. This is John. We\u2019re not going to obviously talk specific targets. Never have, never will. And I know you understand and respect that. That being said, I think we\u2019ve been very transparent in terms of where we\u2019re going to grow, where we\u2019re going to acquire. We\u2019re going to continue to consolidate the global Tools & Storage industry, and we really, really like our position and our opportunity to grow our Engineered Fastening business.", "Having said that, I think importantly our pipeline is quite full and the reason being as you know we\u2019ve been on somewhat of a moratorium, self-imposed for the last 18-plus months. But it doesn\u2019t mean we stop looking at, assessing and in many cases keeping targets warm. So there\u2019s plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus.", "In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these \u2013 many of these are not public companies, number one, but, there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what\u2019s out there and competition for target, double-edged sword, not too much has changed. Interest rates with obviously very, very low, which would help financial sponsors as they seek to acquire offset by the fact that most financial sponsors and most of the targets that we\u2019re looking at have limited, if any, synergies.", "So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already, arguably the synergies that we could generate would more than offset. I\u2019ll say lack of leverage given our desire insistent tense on maintaining strong tier investment grade rating.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Robert Barry", "Hey, guys, good morning.", "Don Allan", "Good morning.", "John Lundgren", "Good morning.", "Robert Barry", "Wanted to actually touch on our follow-up on the strength in emerging market Tools. I think in your comments you referenced some pricing actions related to recouping currency. I was curious, were those materially higher in 1Q? And do you expect them to benefit future periods as well? And if you could also just remind us what the emerging market margins are tracking at in Tools versus in the developed markets. Thanks.", "Don Allan", "Yes. This is Don. I\u2019ll take your question. Yes, we certainly had a benefit from price in the first quarter, as we communicated early this year back in January. And then we have over the last couple of years as we see these types of movements, we take appropriate price actions where we can to offset that impact at least partially or in some cases close to 100%, and we did do that in the first quarter.", "And a significant portion of that organic growth we saw was related to price, which is also why, you know, we\u2019re not necessarily thinking this is a business that\u2019s going to grow 9% for the full year, because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies that just occurred over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks. So because of that our view is I think prudent, and it\u2019s more reflective of a different pricing market because of the currency shift.", "You asked about profitability margins in emerging markets for Tools. That\u2019s slightly below line average at this point for our Tools & Storage business, but it\u2019s an area as we continue to ramp up some of the mid-price point initiatives and we continue to grow with the markets and outpace them, most likely 1.5 to 2.5 times GDP growth, that we expect with the leverage opportunity that it will get very close to line average.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open.", "Liam Burke", "Yes. Thank you. Good morning. John, on the online strategy you have, especially in North America, are any brands doing particularly better or more geared towards online rather than your traditional distribution channels?", "John Lundgren", "Yes, I think you almost answered the question, as you asked it. Brands do well online, and with the two different groups or via e-commerce. The Black & Decker brand for DIY users is extremely popular, both DIY Power Tools, outdoor products, et cetera, but a real driver is DEWALT. It\u2019s the brand the pros go to. It\u2019s available, it\u2019s available online, and we\u2019re very thoughtful in terms of the extent to which we promote it, make it available, push it, because prior to the Stanley Black & Decker merger, DEWALT actually, other than via a retailer\u2019s own online opportunity, DEWALT wasn\u2019t offered online.", "It is now. It\u2019s doing well. But think of our three power brands, Stanley, DEWALT, Black & Decker, their specific end-user groups and to each and every one, they\u2019re all doing encouragingly well. The biggest single dollar percentage, though, would be DEWALT.", "Jim Loree", "It\u2019s Jim. I\u2019d also just add that very interestingly a couple years ago we did a complete refresh of the Black & Decker brand, and it had really gotten a little bit stale and it had lost a bit of its identity. And when we did the refresh, we tried to bring a millennial sort of focused element to it, and we added some lifestyle elements related to the millennial population, as well as the ECOSMART aspects, which is the sustainability of some of the products and packaging, and so on.", "And the Black & Decker brand has really made a lot of progress with the millennial population. It is definitely not your father\u2019s Oldsmobile. It\u2019s gone from sort of the mature demographic to the up and coming, so even though it\u2019s not the dollar leader in terms of what we sell in e-commerce, it is, for the medium to long-term, has tremendous potential as the generational shift continues.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman. Your line is open.", "Dennis McGill", "Hi. Good morning, thank you. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on down on the Security outlook where you\u2019re looking for the organic growth slide, the single-digit. The 3% to 4% in Europe seems to be pretty sustainable and consistent with what you guys have done, I assume that\u2019s sort of baked into the outlook.", "So from the North American side, how do you think about the potential through the year going from the modest declines so far as you progress through the year and the end channel opportunity in general? Are you optimistic that the non-res market is accelerating? Is it more just self-driven to close the gap with the non-res market? Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that.", "Don Allan", "Sure. I think as the year progresses, and you\u2019re right about Europe, I would imagine it would continue on this 3% trajectory we\u2019ve been seeing for the rest of the year. I think North America, we will see a positive performance in our mechanical businesses in the low single-digits. And then our convergent business continues to be focused on a lot of different activities. And as a result, I do think that they\u2019re behind the market pace a little bit, but as the year goes on, that will continue to improve, but we\u2019ll probably see a little bit of pressure in the organic growth throughout the year.", "And then the last thing I\u2019d mention is we will continue to see emerging market pressure within Security for organic growth. We definitely experienced that in Q1 although it\u2019s a small part of the total business, I do think that will be a bit of a pressure point, as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Waybright for closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright", "Kylie, thanks a lot. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. And obviously please contact me if you have any further questions.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2016 Stanley Black & Decker Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your operator for today\u2019s conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Greg Waybright. Mr. Waybright, you may begin.", "Greg Waybright", "Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings call. On the call, in addition to myself is Jim Loree, our President and CEO; and Don Allan, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app. A replay of this morning\u2019s call will also be available beginning at 2:00 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, Jim and Don will review our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. And consistent with prior calls, we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "As we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate, and as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 1934 Act filing.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.", "James Loree", "Okay. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance put a ribbon on a great 2016, during which the company continued its above market organic growth trajectory and delivered record operating results for EPS, cash flow, operating margin rate, and working capital turns.", "Before I cover the highlights for the quarter and the full-year, I want to take a moment and recap what turned out to be a tumultuous year in the external environment, characterized by some of the most profound geopolitical and economic developments around the world that we have seen in quite sometime. You might recall that, we entered 2016 in a low growth and slowing world, albeit with a relatively healthy U.S. construction market and a solid global auto market.", "The remaining U.S. industrial backdrop was negative. Europe was anemic, emerging markets were slowing, and increasingly volatile. We witnessed extreme government turmoil in Brazil, Venezuela, South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines among others, a failed coup attempt in Turkey, and increasingly hawkish Russia, people continued in the Middle East, the UK voted to leave the EU, and negative interest rates were experienced across a large part of the developed world.", "Global currency devaluation cycle persisted, where the U.S. dollar rising to the highest level we have seen in 14 years, not to mention a brutally divisive political season here at home, amazing, and that was the abbreviated list. Against this backdrop, we delivered a record-breaking year by almost all measures. From operating margin rate to EPS to free cash flow and working capital turns, this organization reached new heights in 2016.", "On top of that, we rolled out the largest and most successful product launch in tool industry history the DEWALT FlexVolt system. We executed a seamless CEO transition and significantly reshaped the business portfolio towards high growth and profit expansion opportunities through the pending acquisitions of Newell Tools and the Craftsman brand.", "Actions which will bring with them exciting prospects for the future, which I\u2019ll touch upon shortly. But first, I\u2019d like to thank every member of our management team for their outstanding contributions and performance, while navigating through these challenging times. It is our people to whom we attribute these accomplishments and successes. It is our extraordinary dedication, passion, teamwork, and sheer will to win that makes this company so special. We entered 2017 with a great deal of optimism for what lies ahead despite the obvious uncertainties and challenges that accompany these times.", "Now, I\u2019ll take a moment and provide a brief recap of our fourth quarter results. Revenues were $2.9 billion, up 3% with solid organic growth of 4%, partially offset by a point of currency pressure. Tools & Storage continued to lead the way posting 7% organic growth, with positive contributions from all major geographies and SBUs, as well as a healthy boost from the rollout of FlexVolt.", "Security wrapped up a solid year of overall performance improvement with another quarter of margin expansion. And finally, although industrial revenues were down 4%, this was slightly better than expectations, given that our Engineered Fastening business continues to be impacted by lower volumes associated with one major electronics customer.", "Excluding that impact, industrial organic revenues were flat. Don will provide you with a deeper dive into business level operating performance during his remarks. EPS for the quarter was a $1.71, down 4% versus a very strong 4Q 2015, and as anticipated, higher restructuring costs, growth investments, and currency pressure more than offset good organic growth, a strong operational performance and a lower tax rate.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to the full-year highlights. 2016 represented another year of progress toward our long-term strategic and financial objectives. Full-year revenues were $11.4 billion, up 2% and 4% organically. Our operating margin rate expanded 20 basis points to a record 14.4%, with a strong performance, which overcame $155 million of pre-tax FX headwinds.", "We achieve full-year EPS of $6.51, a 10% increase over 2015, and a new high watermark for Stanley Black & Decker. Our team delivered an outstanding free cash flow performance, generating $1.14 billion in 2016, with a record 10.6 working capital turns for a free cash flow conversion rate of 118% of net income. And for those of you who have followed us over the long-term, you know that double-digit working capital turns has been a stretch goal for, at least, a decade, with legacy Stanley Works, nearly hitting the mark prior to the Black & Decker merger, and after that, we redoubled our efforts and are pleased to have reached this goal in 2016.", "There\u2019s logic to our fanatical drive to increase working capital turns. I\u2019d make this observation. When we began the Stanley Fulfillment System or SFS in 2006, our trailing revenue was $3.3 billion and our working capital was $700 million. If our turns should remain constant over the ensuing years, we would have begun 2017 with $2.6 billion of working capital and $11.4 billion of trailing revenues. Instead, we had only $1.1 billion of actual working capital tied up at year-end 2016. Thus, through core SFS, we freed up approximately $1.5 billion of cash over the years, about half of which was returned to shareholders and half reinvested in productive growth assets.", "And finally, during 2016, SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system, which we introduced early in 2015 broke into full execution mode. Through SFS 2.0, we drove significant growth, cost efficiency, and digital transformation, the working capital performance I just mentioned and a successful global launch of FLEXVOLT, our first of its kind breakthrough innovation.", "The FLEXVOLT launch has been extremely well received by customers and end users, with revenues exceeding our initial plan and delivering slightly more than $100 million of revenue in just four months of 2016. We expect to more than double this in 2017 with a full-year of revenue as well as more FLEXVOLT tools to be introduced this year. And although, this is not a point forecast, we are capacitized to over $400 million in revenue.", "So you could expect us to be somewhere between 200 and 400. 2016 was a tremendous year for the company by almost all accounts, and 2017 is shaping up to be another one, particularly in light of SFS 2.0, as well as our recent portfolio announcements. It\u2019s been a brisk return to M&A since I took over, beginning with our acquisition of Newell Tools announced in October.", "We followed up in December with the announced sale of our Mechanical Locks business and then followed that a few weeks later with the agreement to purchase the Craftsman brand from Sears Holdings. I\u2019d like to take a moment now to review the acquisitions, highlight the outstanding opportunities for revenue growth and EPS accretion that this portfolio is reshaping and capital redeployment have created.", "The Newell Tools acquisition with its Irwin and Lenox brands and the Craftsman deal will result in the addition of three extraordinary brands to our already strong portfolio. It will extend our reach in the plumbing and electrical trades, as well as the auto mechanics channel, the power tools accessory space, and the outdoors products in garage storage markets.", "The net result will be a significant revenue growth opportunity through investing in the brands, innovating the products, and leveraging our global manufacturing footprint, and commercial capabilities. You can see the baseline financial impact on the chart in the lower right hand corner. We anticipate that these deals will drive a significant increase in EPS over the next 5-plus years, as they are fully integrated. They are accretive from the start and will contribute well over a $1 per share by year five.", "One point that I do want to address is around our current portfolio weightings and the reality that these deals increase our weighting in Tools & Storage. I stressed that from a strategic perspective, our intent is to continue to drive the overall company business model as a high-performing diversified industrial. And to that end, these transactions do not signal a deviation from that intent, but I\u2019m more reflective of the timing around when they came to market.", "The Newell Tools business and the Craftsman brand are highly attractive and we\u2019ve had our eyes on it for many years. And while we may have preferred that they came to market with a little more daylight between them, you played a hand that you don\u2019t when it comes to deal actionability. And accordingly, we tapped into our strong financial position to acquire these assets even if it meant being slightly overweight in Tools for a period of time.", "And when you think about it being overweight and a business performing on all cylinders is a kind of problem that you\u2019d like to have more of. These transactions and the exceptional growth and profit opportunities they represent, along with the existing strengths of our business, such as SFS 2.0 and FLEXVOLT, make it easy to get excited and bullish on the future here at Stanley Black & Decker.", "We have positioned the organization for success with a deep and seasoned leadership team, a long-standing strategic vision guiding the way, and an enhanced operating system SFS 2.0 driving improvements in organic growth and cost and asset efficiency. The combination of which leaves us poised to deliver differentiated performance in the future just as we have done in the past.", "And now, I will hand it over to Don Allan, who will walk you through segment performance, overall financials, and 2017 guidance. Don?", "Donald Allan", "Thank you, Jim. Let\u2019s transition to our segment performance for the fourth quarter. Tools & Storage delivered another stellar quarter posting organic growth of 7%, with all regions and SBUs contributing. North America led the way up 8% on the back of strong performances in the retail and commercial channels, primarily driven by the continued success for the DEWALT FlexVolt roll out, as well as other new product introductions.", "We also saw some upside in the industrial channels for the first time in a few quarters, with a group delivering low single-digit growth due to a solid performance by Proto and several meaningful wins within our storage business. Europe delivered another quarter of above market growth coming in at 4%, which is slightly below the high single-digit trend we have been seeing from the region, but still a very healthy performance for that part of the world.", "Almost all European markets contributed positive growth as the continued success from the DEWALT FlexVolt launch across the region, coupled with ongoing robust commercial excellent actions within the markets, such as the relaunch of the DEWALT brand in France. We also had continued key customer wins in the UK and enhanced e-commerce initiatives across the region, that contributed to this top line performance.", "The emerging markets team delivered a strong quarter as well, with 7% organic growth fueled by gains in Latin America and Asia, which more than offset continued pressure in the Middle East and North America \u2013 North Africa. The Asia team posted mid-teens growth in the quarter to wrap up a year of double-digit gains and outstanding performance, as commercial excellence actions and major wins with our Stanley branded MPP power tool offerings continue to drive growth in the region.", "Latin America finished the year strong up high single digits, as growth in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil more than offset the continuing pressure in Peru and Colombia. While it is probable that 2017 will bring continued volatility in emerging markets, we are encouraged by the team\u2019s performance on the ground, and their ability to execute actions quickly and effectively when presented with challenging macroeconomic conditions.", "We\u2019re also excited about our continued digital investments across the entire Tools & Storage business, which are well underway. As we leverage the digital excellence pillar within SFS 2.0 to enhance our connectivity to and experience with end users around the world. The Tools & Storage operating margin rate was down as expected about 40 basis points in the quarter, as currency mix and growth investments more than offset the favorable benefit of volume leverage, price, productivity and ongoing cost management.", "In summary, the Tools & Storage organization delivered an outstanding fourth quarter and full-year performance in 2016. We greatly appreciate their efforts and are pleased how they have positioned themselves well to maintain this momentum and repeat the success in 2017.", "Moving on to Security. Security wrapped up the year of meaningful forward progress, posting flat organic growth in the quarter, while continuing to improve its operating margin, up 30 basis points over the prior year quarter and up a 140 basis points for the full-year. This improvement in profitability as a result of a more disciplined approach to new commercial opportunities, coupled with continued progress and field efficiency and effectiveness.", "The North America and emerging market businesses grew organic revenue modestly by strong performance in emerging markets combined with solid performance in automatic doors more than offset lower commercial electronic security volumes. The business continued to improve field efficiency and profitability in the quarter and we are pleased with its continued positive trajectory.", "Security Europe\u2019s organic revenues were down slightly in the quarter, as installation volume declined in France and the UK, more than offset continued growth in the Nordics, Germany and Ireland. The UK continues to be impacted by a slow installation market in the financial services industry. 2016 was a year of strong operational performance for the Security segment, as a whole.", "The teams combined to increase the operating margin rate to approximately 13%, which was a 140 basis point improvement year-over-year. Additionally, the segment delivered a point of organic growth, as it continued to make progress towards becoming a consistent organic growth contributor. We also concluded our strategic review of this segment, paving the way for further progress toward our mid-term goals of delivering consistent low single-digit organic growth and mid-teens operating margin.", "Our industrial segment performed slightly ahead of expectations, down 4% organically in the quarter with our Engineered Fastening business down 2 points organically on the back of continued comp pressure from a major customer in the Electronics segment. However, absent that customer, the business was up a strong 4% in the quarter, as automotive remains healthy and the industrial business swung back to positive growth. The infrastructure platform was down 12% as pressure within our oil and gas business more than offset a solid organic performance within hydraulic tools. This is the first growth quarter in Hydraulic Tools that we\u2019ve seen in quite some time.", "In total, top line pressure in the industrial segment and the associated deleveraging led to an operating margin rate contraction in the quarter versus the prior year. However, the business did an admirable job of driving productivity and cost reductions to partially offset the top line declines throughout the year, bringing a healthy full year 16.5% operating margin rate despite the large macro and top line pressures experienced through 2016.", "All-in-all the segments wrapped 2016 in solid fashion with tools and storage exiting the year on a throughput, security reinvigorated to continue its forward progress, and the industrial segment is well poised to manage the likely lingering market and customer pressures in 2016. On top of this strong P&L performance, we were able to drive significant working capital improvement resulting in a record free cash flow performance for the year.", "Our full-year performance was excellent. And you can see that we generated a record $1.14 billion of free cash flow in 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in net income and working capital, which were up $83 million and $155 million respectively. With the positive impact from the timing of various other miscellaneous payments captured in the line referred to as other, more than offsetting an increase in CapEx spend.", "This performance resulted in a conversion rate of a 118%, well above our expectations for the year, underpinning this outperformance, for working capital turns of 10.6 times, up 1.4 turns year-over-year and a significant milestone accomplishment for the organization as we exceeded 10 turns for the first time in our company\u2019s history, a goal we had established almost a decade ago.", "We have a laser like approach to managing working capital within standby Stanley Black & Decker. It was a core component of our long-standing SFS operating system and it continues to be a key pillar of our enhanced SFS 2.0 operating system. On that note, we are very excited about the opportunity to drive working capital improvements within the pending Newell Tools acquisition. This will create additional cash flow benefit opportunities from working capital in the coming few years.", "Now let\u2019s move on to our outlook for 2017. We are targeting approximately 4% organic growth in 2017, very similar to what we experienced in 2016. And we expect our earnings per share to be from $6.85 up to $7.05, which is approximately a 7% increase versus the prior year at the midpoint. And we expect the free cash flow conversion to approximate a 100%. Note that these earnings estimates exclude the impact from our recent portfolio announcements. As these transactions closed during 2017, we will adjust our guidance accordingly.", "However, at this time, we believe the most appropriate view is the one we presented here today. You can see on the left hand side of the page that we expect the organic growth of 4% to generate approximately $0.45 to $0.55 of the EPS accretion. The next guidance factor is related to commodity inflation and currency headwinds. We estimate commodity inflation to be approximately $50 million to $55 million and currency headwinds will approximate $50 million based on current spot rates. These two headwinds combined are approximately $0.50 to $0.55 of EPS pressure.", "In terms of operating margin sensitivities for 2017 relating to our top key currency exposures, which are the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, Brazilian real, and the Argentinian peso, they are actually relatively consistent with those that we just published in mid-2016. And then finally, we expect the net impact of various cost and productivity actions, which will be partially offset by higher share count to result an accretion of $0.45 to $0.50 per share, rounding out the $6.85 to $7.05 guide.", "I would also like to review three miscellaneous guidance matters. First, we continue to anticipate approximately $50 million of core restructuring charges, which is very close to our running average for the last few years. Second item is we are forecasting approximately 151 million of shares outstanding for 2017, and finally we expect the first quarter earnings to be slightly below 17% of the full-year performance, which is below the prior year percentage, but that is due to higher level of restructuring in the first quarter, higher currency, and higher shares as well.", "So let\u2019s turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. We expect tools and storage to post mid-single-digit organic growth in 2017. This will be driven by strong geographic performance in most regions around the world with share gains expected to continue in the U.S., Europe, and Emerging Markets. We anticipate that the DEWALT FlexVolt battery system will continue to be highly successful in 2017 accounting for approximately 1.5 points for the incremental growth.", "As it relates to profitability, we expect the tools and storage business to deliver an improvement in its margin rate year-over-year in-spite of the previously mentioned commodity inflation and FX pressure that will predominantly impact this segment. The security segment will continue its positive performance trajectory in 2017 hosting low single digit organic growth, and driving its operating margin rate higher through operating leverage gains, cost containment, and productivity actions.", "With the strategic review concluded for this segment, the business teams are looking forward to continuing their performance momentum into 2017 and beyond. We expect to deliver profitability improvements in both Europe and the U.S., while also making solid progress on the organic growth front. Over time as we have previously stated, we believe that this business has the potential to be a solid and consistent organic grower, approaching the low end of our 4% to 6% total company target range, while delivering a mid-teens operating margin rate. 2017 should be another year of progress towards that goal.", "Finally, we expect the industrial segment to post a low single-digit organic decline for the year and to improve its operating margin rate through cost actions productivity and strategic SG&A management. While the overall automotive business within engineered fashion remains healthy, we still have some residual comp issues related to one major electronics customer, and we expect some continuing modest pressure within the industrial channel to content with.", "Within the infrastructure platform, we expect that slight improvements within the hydraulic tools business will be more than offset by top line pressures in oil and gas, which continues to see little to no new activity in the offshore space and limited projects onshore in 2017. We hope this deal of the business and improves based on some of the recent actions, which have occurred at the federal government level.", "In total, we expect the sum of these performances to translate into a slight top line decline with room to the upside should one or more of the underlying markets rebound in 2017. I want to spend a minute now going through some additional details related to the recent business development activities that Jim touched on earlier. As I stated earlier, the financial impact of these transactions is not included in the guidance I just provided.", "In October, we announced the acquisition of Newell Tools, including the highly priced Lenox and Irwin brands for a 1.95 billion purchase price. This deal marked the end of our nearly three-year M&A hiatus, during which time we significantly enhanced our operating model and organizational capacity, while driving meaningful improvements in organic growth and profitability.", "The Newell Tools transaction materially enhances our presence in the power tools accessories space, while also expanding our footprint in the plumbing and electronic trades. These areas are core adjacencies for Stanley Black & Decker and there is a rich opportunity to drive significant cost and revenue synergies in the near term by leveraging the same operating techniques that made the Black & Decker deal so incredibly valuable, albeit, this will be on a smaller scale.", "The transaction has cleared HSR review in the U.S. and is pending certain non-US regulatory approvals. It is expected to close within the first quarter. EPS accretion, excluding charges is expected to be approximately $0.20 to $0.25 in 2017 assuming this closing date occurs in the first quarter. In December, we announced the conclusion of our strategic review of the security segment.", "We decided to retain the commercial electronic and automatic door businesses and sell the majority of our mechanical lock business to dormakaba for $725 million. This reflects the healthy EBITDA multiple of approximately 14 times. The transaction will be extremely tax efficient with net proceeds expected to be approximately $700 million. As we noted at the time, we believe there is tremendous opportunity to grow and innovate within the commercial electronic and automatic door spaces.", "These businesses have a very natural and organic fit together with the latter providing an important vehicle to host certain technological innovations, which are a key component of our differentiated electronic monitoring value proposition. In addition to the otherwise attractive and under penetrated market it serves.", "However, given the suboptimal side and sale of our Mechanical Locks business the value it attracted in the market and the tremendous business development opportunities at hand it became fairly obvious to us that redeploying this capital was the best way to maximize value creation for our shareholders. Once we made that decision we went to work very quickly to ensure that successful achievement of that outcome. We expect the sale to close in the first quarter of 2017 and to be dilutive to 2017 earnings of approximately $0.15 to $0.20 EPS. Assuming Q1 closing for both of these transactions, on a combined basis they will be accreted by $0.05 to the 2017 EPS guidance I just communicated.", "Finally, we kicked off 2017 with the exciting news that we have reached an agreement with Sears Holdings to purchase the iconic Craftsman brand. This deal gives us the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and sell Craftsman brand of product in all non-Sears Holdings channel worldwide. The purchase price is comprised of two cash payments one at closing and one at year three a $525 million and $250 million respectively. Plus it has a series of annual payments from year 3 to year 15 for an estimated total present value of purchase price of approximately $900 million.", "We expect this transaction to drive approximately $100 million of average annual growth or between 50 basis points to 100 basis points of organic growth year end and year out for the next decade. The closing is expected to occur during 2017, EPS accretion will be approximately $0.10 to $0.15 in year one, excluding charges and then increasing to approximately $0.35 to $0.45 by year five and then eventually to approximately $0.70 to $0.80 by year 10.", "One final point on the Craftsman deal, we have received a number of questions regarding the limited lifetime warranty that customers of Craftsman products enjoy today. Our intent to keep this warranty intact assuming we are successful with our purchase of the Craftsman brand. So as you can see there\u2019s a lot to be excited about going into 2017 and beyond.", "And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Jim, for the summary.", "James Loree", "Thanks, Don. Yes warranty is a big part of the essence of the Craftsman brand and it will continue to do so as you point out in the future. So in summary, 2016 was a really good year for Stanley Black & Decker. Solid organic growth of 4% and a strong operating performance combined to deliver new records for EPS cash flow operating margin rate, and working capital turns. The DEWALT FlexVolt launch is a great story and it is still early days. All signs point to that momentum growing throughout 2017 and well into the future.", "In addition to the organic successes we reentered the M&A sphere in a decisive and exciting way announcing the acquisitions of Newell tools and Craftsman. We adhere to our strategic principles by objectively evaluating our security business ultimately deciding to divest Mechanical Locks. We executed a tax efficient transaction to do so at a great price enabling us to monetize the asset and redeploy the capital into higher growth profitability activities.", "Finally we\u2019ve established 2017 guidance for EPS within a range of $6.85 to $7.05, a 7% increase at the midpoint on a solid 4% organic growth outlook. And that is without any net accretion from the announced transactions, which will be significant and additive when the deals close later in the year. And I\u2019d like to make the point that much has been made of the FX and inflation headwinds that we are facing in 2017.", "Our view is that this is the best setup that we\u2019ve had in three to four years the time when we overcame $400 million to $500 million of FX headwinds. And during that period we have maintained a consistent record of meeting or beating expectations and we see that record continuing in 2017.", "We expect to maintain the momentum we built in 2016 as we carry forward into this year with a FlexVolt launch still in the early stages, the security business reenergized and moving forward SFS 2.0 in full swing and the anxiously awaited additions of Newell Tools and Craftsman. 2017 promises to be another inspiring and rewarding year for Stanley Black & Decker. We remain humble and committed to driving exceptional shareholder value again in 2017.", "Thank you for your support and Greg we\u2019re now ready for questions.", "Greg Waybright", "Great, thanks, Jim. Andrew we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen the question-and-answer queue is now open. [Operator Instructions] First question for the day will be coming from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.", "Timothy Wojs", "Hey, guys good morning. Nice job on a quarter.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan", "Good morning.", "James Loree", "Thank you.", "Timothy Wojs", "I guess just on the Tools business, could you start just by helping us a little bit with the teams through the year. I know you have a little tougher comparisons in the first-half versus the second-half. And how we should think about FX in the raw material inflation kind of hitting margins through the year?", "James Loree", "Sure. We\u2019ll start with the organic revenue kind of \u2013 if you prefer to do a cadence by quarter, I won\u2019t go quarter-by-quarter. But I think if you think about, kind of a mid single-digit organic growth for the full-year, we actually think that the first-half will be pretty strong and be slightly above that 5%, as we have things like positive momentum on FlexVolt and some other introductions and innovations that are occurring. And then as we get closer to the end of the year, fourth quarter, particular the number probably would be slightly below 5%, that\u2019s probably a directional trend that you can look at.", "As far as currency, we see a lot of that currency happening in the first-half and a much lesser amount occurring in the back-half of the year. And then the commodity side of things will be more evenly paid throughout the year. We\u2019ll have less lumpiness to it, because a lot of that is really things that are \u2013 trend that we\u2019ve seen emerge in the back-half of 2016 and then based on the way that a lot of our contracts are laid out that we\u2019re rolling off in the first-half of the year. So I would say more of an even facing of that, but maybe a little bit of a tick up in the back-half.", "Timothy Wojs", "Great. Well, good luck on 2017.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague", "Jim, I\u2019d like to pick up towards the end of your closing comments, which were kind of more strategic portfolio in nature. These tools assets obviously are in the sweets spot and that you wanted to think that makes them look so attractive here. And it sounds like some of your stuff was on your radar screen, as you think about what we said about diversifying the portfolio or kind of going down other portfolio vectors, do you have a good sense of where you want to go, not expecting to name assets. But are there things on a chess board somewhere in your office so to speak that are a little bit of a roadmap, or is this something that would be more opportunistic over time?", "James Loree", "Well, I\u2019d like to think it was as sophisticated as a chess board. But yes, we have some ideas. The first thrust is to continue to strengthen the franchises all three of the major franchises that we have, so security, industrial and tools. And that\u2019s \u2013 logically why we \u2013 these assets and tools came up, we pounced, because they do make tremendous sense as consolidating transactions for us, and in effect, particularly the Newell Tools been kind of a bolt-on type \u2013 and the Craftsman being more of an organic growth machine.", "So when \u2013 part of this is when transactions become available in the segments that we\u2019re in, we take serious looks. And so, for instance, in Engineered Fastening, we love to acquire something. We love that business. We don\u2019t particularly like the \u2013 how the electronics part of it has played out. But that\u2019s relatively small piece of it and that will be \u2013 and getting smaller as the days go on.", "But the automotive piece and then there\u2019s an Aerospace segment within Engineered Fastening that we are very underweight in. That \u2013 these types of businesses that are similar to Engineered Fastening same or similar to an Engineered Fastening.", "So a lot of application engineering upfront, good high value added for the customer base, recurring revenue stream, and in some cases even an after-market. That that type of a business model is something that we said that we like a lot. And so if something were to come up in Engineered Fastening or on the periphery, that would be quite interesting to us.", "In oil and gas, the \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see oil and gas as a large percentage of the company. But there are some assets in oil and gas that might be attractive, especially to the extent that they enable us to diversify using some of the technologies that we are in today to diversify outside to \u2013 into process industries and maybe repair and service for some of the infrastructure in oil and gas and related areas. So that could be interesting.", "I think other theme that you\u2019ll see over time is, as we develop that flexible technology, it\u2019s going to become obvious that there\u2019s some acquisitions that enable us to really as we go up the power curve to exploit that technology to its fullest potential So those are all things that we think about and we\u2019ll see. We have a pretty ambitious growth goal here to double the size of the company by 2022. And we\u2019re going to need something on the order of $5 plus-billion worth of acquisitions supplement to the organic growth to get there.", "And so I think you\u2019ll see not, not anything in the near-term, because we\u2019re in the process of digesting what we\u2019ve already done here. But as we get into 2018, 2019, and so on, you\u2019re liable to see something in one of those areas that I just touched upon or more.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Jason Rehaut", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice quarter.", "James Loree", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Michael Jason Rehaut", "My question is around Newell. I believe, you laid out in the presentation $0.20 to $0.25 of accretion in 2017 and that\u2019s assuming the first quarter closing, I\u2019m sorry, yes, first quarter closing. And I believe that\u2019s better than your initial guidance of $0.15 for the full first year. So I was wondering if you could talk about what was driving that, if I have those numbers right? And also if I could sneak in a clarification on how Mac Tools did growth wise during the quarter? Thanks.", "James Loree", "Sure. So, yes, there\u2019s a change in the Newell Tools estimate. It really has to do with the financing-related activities primarily. And we \u2013 in the initial estimates, we had assumed some longer-term debt that we would put in place, short-term debt as well. But given some of the things that have occurred and how strong our free cash flow performance was exiting the year and our view on cash flow for 2017, we don\u2019t see the need for the long-term financing right now. And therefore, the interest costs related to that transaction will be dramatically lower, not only in 2017, but on an ongoing basis.", "So it really kind of jumpstarts the accretion in year one and gives us an extra $0.05 to $0.10 related to that particular item. As far as Mac Tools goes, they had a solid quarter with mid single-digit organic growth, and was pretty much in line with our expectation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from UBS. Your line is open.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan", "Good morning, guys.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan", "Good morning.", "Shannon O\u2019Callaghan", "Hey, just on the industrial business, obviously, a lot of \u2013 on the top line a lot of moving parts there going into next year with, I guess, still a little bit of electronics drag, curious when that kind of finally ends. And then what are you assuming, I guess, in the plan for Dakota, given \u2013 how much of a drag have you baked in, and does it assuming it comes back at all? And then maybe just comment on the fourth quarter margins there \u2013 were down pretty sharply year-over-year? Thanks.", "James Loree", "Yes. So the \u2013 I would say, if you start with the Electronics business and Engineered Fastening, yes, we\u2019re probably going to see, it\u2019s about a $20 million drag here in 2017 on revenue from that business and specific that customer that we referred to get down to a number on an annual basis around $50 million, maybe $45 million in that kind of range.", "So, as Jim mentioned, it\u2019s becoming a much smaller component of that business on a go-forward basis, which from our perspective is a good thing. The other thing I would say a little bit and the other topic, your question you had on oil and gas in Dakota, we\u2019re pretty much done. We don\u2019t have any really any new revenue opportunity associated with that. We were part of the pipeline constructed leading up to what occurred over this summer and to the fall. And so there\u2019s really not a lot of new revenue opportunity for us on that particular pipeline.", "And then you meant, you also had a question of profitability of the overall segment. It was really impacted by what I touched on, which was clearly there\u2019s a deleveraging effect of the top line impacted, just we\u2019re not able to take enough actions to offset that impact and that\u2019s really the main driver of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Jeremie Capron", "Thanks and good morning, all.", "James Loree", "Good morning, Jeremie.", "Jeremie Capron", "I wanted to ask about your import situation in the U.S., we talked about that on the call following the announcement of the Newell acquisition that gives you a little more leeway there probably to shift some production into the U.S., but as we try to quantify your net importer situation into the U.S., can you help us understand what it amounts to today? Thank you.", "James Loree", "Yes we import a lot into the United States, there is no question about that. That\u2019s pretty much the standard model in the tool industry, which is an important model into developing countries for the most part. Now, we have differentiated ourselves over the past few years by ramping up our U.S. presence much more aggressively than our competition has.", "And so today we have 3,000 employees manufacturing tools in the United States and 11 plants and we\u2019ve always had a fairly significant manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S. selling into the U.S., but it is getting bigger and it\u2019s going to get even bigger because whether or not any of those proposed concepts are implemented or not, it\u2019s making more sense to have that U.S. presence because in the market the folks that are buying the tools, the end-users really like those tools that are made in the United States for US tradesmen and so on.", "So you\u2019ll see a continued growth in our U.S. manufacturing base with the Craftsman deal, we\u2019re going to open up a new plant in the United States location to be determined, it\u2019s going to be very highly technologically equipped so that it can produce the highest quality tools at the best cost in the world, and we\u2019re excited about that, it will become a showcase plan and when you look at the competition in the industry they are all going to play catch up. There is one other company, I mentioned this on the Craftsman call that is a competitor of ours, but not in the core of our business, but in the auto mechanics and industrial business, they compete with us. They also have a great U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. The rest of them are going to be playing catch up.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo, your line is open.", "Rich M. Kwas", "Hi good morning.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Rich M. Kwas", "Two quick questions. Jim strategic, kind of follow-up to Jeff\u2019s question as you think about M&A, a lot on your plate here, as we think about 2017 and 2018 what are the chances that we see kind of smaller bolt ons added as we get later in the year and early 2018, how would you couch that and then Don, question on productivity in terms of the savings from restructuring that have been done over the last couple of years are those included in that $0.45, $0.50 of savings for this year and then the other quick question is buyback, what\u2019s \u2013 the 1.51 is a little higher than you are looking for, I assume there is some incremental buy back that could occur over the course of this year, but any additional thoughts there? Thanks.", "James Loree", "Well let Don start with the two questions that you gave him and then I\u2019ll hit the acquisition question.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, we will start with the cost actions and productivity. And as I had mentioned in my comments, we have had about $50 million of restructuring charges per year for almost last three years now, and so yes there certainly is, when you look at the $0.55 and $0.60 of positive accretion from cost actions and productivity there is a carryover effect to that. I would say it\u2019s probably 10%, maybe of that number, 15% in that range, it\u2019s not a large part of it, but I would remind everybody that we have been very proactive in our cost reduction programs for quite some time and in particular over the last two years as we dealt with all this currency pressure, and Jim mentioned the number close to 400 million over the last two years.", "We certainly got some price benefits, offset to that, but it was only about a third of how much we are able to offset. So, we had two thirds of all that that we had to find a way to more than offset to grow our earnings and a lot of those where through cost actions that we\u2019ve done either through continued productivity actions in our supply chain and getting productivity levels up to 5%, 6% in some cases depending on the business and then just ongoing SG&A what I would call healthy restructuring that occurs. And then this year, we\u2019re going to continue that activity like we have been doing because we\u2019ve got nice momentum.", "We\u2019ve also got functional transformation occurring that will begin to reap some benefit benefits of that here in 2017, something we started talking about almost 2 years ago now. And so that is a positive, so, and the $50 million of restructuring that we\u2019re going to utilize in 2017 will help drive some of those benefits as well. So, I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves well over the next three years to be focused on balancing where we take cost out and then where we also implement cost to make investments to stimulate more growth and that\u2019s really what you\u2019re seeing here.", "On the second question related to shares outstanding, we have not assumed any type of buyback in our number at this point. The increase reflects the impact of the hybrid that matured in the fourth quarter of 2016 about 3 million of share impact year-over-year. We will see how the year progresses, as far as cash flow, but at this point we think our cash is pretty much focused on paying for the M&A activity and we don\u2019t have a lot of excess cash to focus on share repurchase, but if we do a little better than we expect there is certainly an opportunity for us to do that.", "James Loree", "Okay and then as it relates to bolt-ons, as Don said there isn\u2019t all lot of cash to start with left after the \u2013 capacity left after the deals that we\u2019ve announced, but I would say if we were to see some bolt-ons \u2013 smaller ones as you point out aggregating no more than 100 to 200, you know that might be a possibility that would be played against the buybacks so that\u2019s kind of where we are. We think our our culture as bold and agile, but yet thoughtful and disciplined and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated the bold and the agile part and the thoughtful part and the discipline part as it relates to the negotiation of these transactions and the deal execution and now we need to demonstrate that as it relates to the integration part of it.", "So, it will not make a whole lot of sense to do anything in addition to what we\u2019ve done this year in a large scale, and we\u2019ll get the integration is right, we\u2019ll get the Newell Tools safely assimilated into our company, and providing the accretion we will get Craftsman get that growth trajectory going that we\u2019ve committed to, and then in 2018, and thereabouts 2019 whatever the right time is we will be back with something bigger in all likelihood.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley, your line is open.", "Nigel Coe", "Thanks good morning guys. First of all, I want to say congratulations on getting the $0.10 that there aren\u2019t too many manufacturers at that kind of level, so really well done there.", "James Loree", "Thank you.", "Nigel Coe", "So, I guess I\u2019m asking this question on FlexVolt, sounds like from your guidance you gave on, we are on track for $100 million of incremental sell-in in 2017, can you maybe just mark us on what you achieved in 2016, and then maybe some commentary around where we are on the launch geographically and by products, and any early reads on how the launch is impacting the potential conversation of quarter products and pricing commentary would be helpful as well?", "James Loree", "Yes Nigel it is Jim. I\u2019ll take the bigger picture part of that and if Don wants to supplement it with some commentary that would be fine. The flexible initiative, so as you pointed out sold a $100 million in four months and a lot of that was selling, but there was a fair amount of sell-out to, and it\u2019s been extremely well received by the end user community and this is all about speed to establishing an install base as it relates to the competition because the tools, the batteries are backwards compatible in the DEWALT tools, so it\u2019s complementary to our installed base.", "And where we are really trying to attack is at the competitors install base. And so think of FlexVolt as a battery system that is establishing an install base as aggressively and quickly as possible that requires DEWALT tools to operate and then think of every year a wave of new tools skews coming in that will enhance the substitution of coated products and the ability for us to substitute coated products in the higher voltage, higher power requirements, higher duty cycle type skews.", "And if you think of it that way, I think it\u2019s helpful because then you will understand it really is, well there is going to be some cannibalization of our own coated tools, it really is a market share gain mechanism that has enormous potential event at the voltage levels we are at today. And we haven\u2019t even talked about going up the voltage curve or the power curve, which we have the capability to do as we develop this technology. And that breakthrough innovation that we\u2019re working on will have some more surprises I\u2019m sure, positive surprises in the future. Don?", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I would just add that related to 2017 your comment is correct Nigel, we do see another $100 million of incremental revenue that is included in our guidance. Jim however did discuss in his comments that we have capacity up to $400 million. So, in total we have $200 million in our numbers with incremental of a $100 million next year so there\u2019s capacity to take on another $200 million.", "The $100 million makes sense to us right now based on it\u2019s too early to really know what the cannibalization is going to be. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ll watch closely, but if the cannibalization is not as high then there\u2019s certainly a possibility that we\u2019re somewhere between that $200 million to $400 million number as the year progresses combined with some of the factors that that Jim just mentioned.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Robert Barry", "Hey, guys good morning.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Robert Barry", "So, I wanted to begin to the tools growth and the outlook, it feels like the growth outlook keeps creeping down a little bit. I think at 3Q it was a little below seven and a conference in December five to six that\u2019s now mid-single, which feels like five to me. So, I\u2019m curious what\u2019s driving that, what sounds like incremental caution. And maybe it helps to comment on 4Q and just clarify, if you sold a $100 million of FlexVolt in four months, I\u2019m assuming three quarters of that would be in a 4Q that\u2019s about four points of growth there. I think right I mean doesn\u2019t seem like it leaves a whole lot of room for organic ex-FlexVolt on what was a fairly easy comp, so maybe some color there on the growth outlook in tools. Thanks.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, I\u2019ll give you some color on the outlook, remember back in October earnings call, I gave a framework for 2017, which was total growth of 4% for the company. And I gave a little color by segment with, I indicated tools of mid-single digit. So that would be whatever you want to be somewhere between 4% and 6% that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been seeing for the last 100 plus days.", "And so I don\u2019t \u2013 not sure what you\u2019re referring to specifically other than the 7% was our performance in 2016. And so that\u2019s certainly, maybe there is a an aspect of that that I\u2019m just clarifying, but we feel pretty good about that and our view going into the year that\u2019s the right place to be at this stage.", "As far as FlexVolt, yes we had about $50 million, $60 million of FlexVolt in the fourth quarter. And as Jim said part of that was booked the continued loading, but part of it was also sell-through. And so there\u2019s the combination of factors there so that certainly contributed to the 7.3% organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter, but there\u2019s still a very strong underlying growth excluding that as well that\u2019s been driven by all the other activities that I mentioned in my comments related to Tools & Storage segment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joe Ritchie", "Thanks, good morning guys.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan", "Good morning.", "Joe Ritchie", "So meaning to sign a parse out 1Q a little bit more yes it\u2019s helpful to get the buckets. But can you quantify the year-over-year impact from higher restructuring in FX in 1Q. And then secondly if you realize commodities are going to be a headwind for a lot of industrial companies in 2017, but maybe talk a little bit about what type of pricing you think you can get as well as we progress through the year?", "Donald Allan", "Yes. So Q1 I would fear for your modeling purposes for restructuring I would say, I would use about half of the $50 million in Q1. So, we expect to move a fair amount of activity to get really to help drive some of the benefits that I talked about in guidance of the cost reduction and productivity action.", "So that\u2019s certainly is a large number that impacts the EPS in Q1 and why it\u2019s a lower percentage for the full-year. I would exclude that and kind of look at the underlying performance without that effect that\u2019s more just based on decisions they we\u2019re making and not operationally focused.", "The other thing is on a currency it\u2019s very close to $20 million incremental impact in Q1 and so those two items combined with a little bit of pressure from the shares, higher share count in the first quarter is why you\u2019re seeing that type of EPS number for Q1. And pricing actions, we are always looking for surgical pricing actions. We\u2019ve been doing that for over a decade now in our company. It take in our Tools & Storage business that team is very much focused on what they can do at a very specific level or at the product level or product family level depending on the situation and we make decisions on what the right pricing decisions are that are both price increases in some cases on occasion price decreases that might be necessary for certain products.", "But overall, looking how they get a price increase. Commodity inflation certainly offers up an opportunity to talk about price increases, but the reality is $50 million to our whole company in a full-year is really not large enough at this point to make a large case for a broad price increase. But it certainly is something that we utilize and we go through and do the surgical analysis of pricing by product to help make the decision of what is the right price point for a specific product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is open.", "David MacGregor", "Yes, good morning and congressional on a good progress.", "James Loree", "Thank you.", "David MacGregor", "The question is on Craftsman. And I wondered if you could just talk about the white space opportunity, and any reference you can make to sizing would be helpful? And also, how much control do you have over what Sears does with the brand with respect to pricing promotion?", "James Loree", "We have zero control over what Sears does with respect to pretty much anything. And that\u2019s part of the rationale for why we think this is a deal that is pro-competitive and should be able to pass through the competitive review. So as far as the growth trajectory, we start off with $100 million or thereabouts of business that we actually acquire as part of the transaction and then the rest is up to us.", "So there are \u2013 we have a tremendous commercial capability in this company that can span all the channels in the Tool business. And Craftsman is kind of a unique brand in the sense that it plays in the auto mechanics channel, the industrial channel, the professional tradesmen, the DIY type of user, it\u2019s \u2013 the \u2013 one of the broadest brands in Tools. And so, our approach is going to be to partner up with our big box customer \u2013 partners and make sure that we exploit that channel.", "We are going to try to partner up with a large e-commerce company and make it available broadly through e-commerce. And we think that\u2019s an exciting growth opportunity. It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s one customer that I\u2019m referring to will tell you that Craftsman power tools is the single biggest unfulfilled search that it has. And so, we\u2019re excited about that. And then we have our automotive repair channel nut tools that we would expect to carry the Craftsman brand on in some form at some point.", "So lots of different approaches what we\u2019ve committed to in the pro forma was $100 million a year of growth. So over a ten-year period, getting to pretty much a straight line \u2013 on a straight line basis getting to a $1 billion over that period and we hope that we can do better than that. But we think that\u2019s a very, very doable development curve.", "Donald Allan", "I would just enhance Jim\u2019s comment on what control we have, we did, is right, we have zero control. But they do need to meet certain quality standards for use of the brand. And so that is part of the band license, so it\u2019s not to say control, but it is a standard that we wanted to have in place to ensure the quality of the products are at the right level.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan", "Good morning.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "Just to pull the thread on FlexVolt a little bit more, I think you\u2019ve spoken many times about, getting over the curve in terms of factory utilization. And when should we think about the bridge to that being accretive to the total Tools margins versus, I would pursue still just based on the way you\u2019ve laid out the cadence for EPS probably still dilutive in the first-half of the year?", "James Loree", "Yes, it is. I mean, so based on our \u2013 what\u2019s in our guidance that would be dilutive in the first-half, gets \u2013in the back-half still probably marginally dilutive based on the current forecast. Now, if we start getting levels above $200 million, and we\u2019re approaching $400 million, that\u2019s going to change the margin picture dramatically. So that that\u2019s a factor that we have not assumed in our guidance.", "So it\u2019s a bit of a double positive that we get the extra revenue impact that we\u2019d also get the leverage impact of somewhere \u2013 going somewhere between $200 million to $400 million in revenue.", "Joshua Pokrzywinski", "And I guess related to that, what is the expectation for sell-in versus sell-through in that incremental $100 million this year?", "James Loree", "Well, the vast majority of it, we would expect it to be probably sell-through and \u2013 but we\u2019ll see as the year progress. We certainly have a little bit of a load in happening here in the first quarter. But where is the stage now, where we\u2019re restocking and we would hope that that a lot of that would be sell-through.", "Donald Allan", "Yes, the skews will be sell-in and some...", "James Loree", "That\u2019s a good point later in the year.", "Donald Allan", "But our new skews would be sell-in.", "James Loree", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Your line is open.", "Liam Burke", "Thank you. Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Don.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Donald Allan", "Good morning.", "Liam Burke", "Jim, you highlighted that in the hand Tools & Storage business, the industrial had a good quarter. You \u2013 in the Q&A, you discussed that Mac Tools was up single digits, mid single digits. Mac Tools though has been strong for the last several quarters. Is there anything else industrial that perform particularly well?", "James Loree", "Well, the industrial business itself showed \u2013 within Tools showed signs of life, really had a positive quarter in a long, long time, two years. So I think that that goes under the Proto and the FACOM brands. They did quite well. And so it does look like we potentially have hit an inflection point with the \u2013 with that kind of MRO type markets.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Waybright for closing remarks.", "Greg Waybright", "Andrew, thanks. We would like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call, and obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. This now concludes the program and you may all disconnect at this time.

My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being is being recorded.", "I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.", "Dennis Lange", "Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's second quarter 2017 conference call.", "On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Greg Waybright, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Our earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning, and the supplemental presentation, which we will refer to during the call, are available on the IR section of our website, as well as on our iPhone and iPad app.", "A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release.", "This morning, Jim and Don will review our second quarter 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller. And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call.", "Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today.", "We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our president and CEO, Jim Loree.", "James Loree", "Okay. Thank you, Dennis. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's news release, Stanley Black & Decker reported a strong second quarter and thus a solid first half as well.", "Each of our business segments contributed to robust organic growth, which was an impressive 7% for the quarter. Our team's continued focus on delivering top quartile financial performance, innovative products and solutions for our customers along with outstanding execution, resulted in a revenue increase of 10% to $3.2 billion.", "Results included a full-quarter contribution from the recent Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand acquisition, which supplemented our strong underlying organic growth.", "Tools & Storage led the way in total growth, up 17%. Up 8% organically. We believe about 2x the market with all regions once again contributing to the continued growth and share gain.", "The FlexVolt battery system continued its steady march to 300 million, making it the largest, fastest-growing cordless launch in our industry's history.", "Our tool business keeps delivering and exceeding expectations through commercial and operational excellence, including outstanding core and breakthrough innovation, while at the same time integrating two major transactions.", "2017 is shaping up to be another superb performance by the entire global Tools & Storage team.", "The Industrial segment also delivered a significant outperformance for the quarter. Organic growth accelerated to 9% on the heels of 4% growth in the first quarter.", "In Engineered Fastening, we continued to see strong automotive system sales, in addition to higher industrial volumes, which supported an impressive 6% organic growth for the quarter.", "Our other industrial businesses, oil and gas and hydraulic tools \u2013 or infrastructure \u2013 each delivered 19% organic growth, outstanding performances, as commercial actions plus positive underlying markets benefited both the project and inspection activity within oil and gas and expanded hydraulics tools volumes.", "And finally, our Security business grew 2% organically, slightly ahead of our expectations. North America Security generated 4% organic growth on stronger installation project activity within the commercial electronic security and automatic door businesses.", "It is rewarding to see the commercial and operational efforts from the North American Security team manifested in the results. It is noteworthy to point out that this is the highest quarterly growth performance for Security North America since the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Our overall company operating margin rate remained robust at 15.7% excluding M&A related charges, relatively flat to the post-merger record rate in the second quarter of 2016, and a nice step up of 150 basis points sequentially.", "The benefits of operating leverage and productivity enabled us to essentially offset modest inflation in price and currency, while we continue to make focused investments on our operating system, SFS 2.0. These investments will support future innovation, organic growth and margin expansion. ", "Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $2.01, which is a 9% expansion versus prior year. It was fueled by strong operational execution by our business teams.", "So, a really great quarter and an excellent first half of 2017. And I want to thank all of our teams around the globe for their energy, enthusiasm and engagement as well as their passion for high performance and results.", "Based on the company's first-half organic growth performance and our confidence in the outlook, we are raising our 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $7.18 to $7.38.", "Now, turning to an update on the recent acquisitions. Importantly, our progress on integrating the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands into our portfolio is progressing nicely.", "We remain on track to meet our expectations, both from a financial and integration execution perspective.", "Specific to Newell Tools, there were some notable accomplishments in the quarter as we continue to assimilate employees, suppliers and customers into our existing operations. In this regard, we are deploying core SFS principles into the production facilities and have begun moving order fulfillment into our Tools & Storage distribution centers, which included a major retail customer implementation in the second quarter.", "The Lennox and Irwin teams are embracing SFS and are energized now to be part of a larger, highly committed tool business. Our commercial teams are in the process of building plants to support revenue synergies and remain optimistic that a meaningful contribution in that area is ahead of us.", "In fact, during the second quarter, we have already begun realizing a modest amount of revenue synergy within the emerging markets.", "And finally, as always, the business teams are working diligently to plan and execute the cost synergies. In this case, $80 million to $90 million.", "Turning to Craftsman, we're hard at work developing commercial strategies for this iconic powerful brand and remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $100 million a year in incremental annual revenue growth for the foreseeable future.", "Our customer discussions are continuing and are going well as we plan for a mid-2018 Craftsman launch outside of Sears.", "From a supply chain perspective, we have started up a new distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and are aggressively moving supply and customer fulfillment into this facility to support the Craftsman business.", "As you can tell, there is a large amount of momentum and continued enthusiasm for both of these transactions as the theoretical strategic value of these assets becomes more tangible and more real with every passing day.", "One last item I'd like to call your attention to is last week's dividend announcement. We increased the quarterly dividend by approximately 9% to $0.63 a share. I\u2019m proud to say that this will be our 50th consecutive year of increasing the dividend and it is a reflection of our continued commitment to deploy approximately half of our excess capital to shareholders and half towards M&A over the long term.", "I\u2019ll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed assessment of the second quarter results.", "Donald Allan, Jr. ", "Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll now take a deeper dive into our business segments, which delivered another strong performance in the second quarter. ", "Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 17% in the quarter, due to 8% organic growth and an 11-point contribution from acquisitions which were partially offset by 2 points of pressure from the combined impact of currency and divestitures.", "The operating margin for this segment was robust at 18.1% as the benefits from volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by growth investments, price and inflation, resulting in a 70 basis point decline in rate versus last year's quarterly record rate.", "Once again, each Tools & Storage region and SPU posted positive organic growth in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America led the way, up 9%. This strong performance was broad-based as we saw high single-digit growth in our US industrial and commercial channels and low double-digit growth within US retail, which includes our e-commerce customers.", "Additionally, Canada posted solid organic growth of 7%. The growth continued to be supported by new product introductions, which includes contributions from FlexVolt. I will provide a bit more color on FlexVolt in a few minutes.", "North America POS data was up mid-single digits, which is very impressive as it comped against mid-teen POS growth rate from the prior year.", "Additionally, inventory within our major customers were at or slightly below prior year levels, which gives us confidence that our growth has been supported by strong sell-through in the channel.", "Europe delivered another above-market performance, with the region posting 8% organic growth. Nearly, all markets contributed with double-digit performances in the UK, Benelux, Iberia and Eastern Europe. The European team continues to be the model in our company for commercial excellence.", "The team has found ways to leverage our broad stable of brands and manufacturing footprint to deliver differentiated solutions for our customers.", "Finally, the emerging markets were supported by solid performances across Latin America and within Russia, India and Africa, which contributed to overall organic growth of 3% in the quarter.", "As noted last quarter, we have completed a transition to a direct model in Turkey, which in future periods should no longer be an inhibitor to growth. If we exclude the Turkey transition, organic growth would've been 6% for the emerging markets in Q2.", "Performance within Latin America varied as double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador more than offset declines in Colombia, Chile and Peru, a trend we have seen throughout most of 2017 and it's reflective of unique country market conditions.", "Diligent pricing actions as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets are continuing to drive growth.", "Additionally, we have seen the e-commerce channel increase its share of the market and become a larger contributor to our growth within emerging markets. As you know, we have what we believe to be leading positions in e-commerce and in developed markets and we are leveraging that know-how as our emerging markets teams work to develop this critical channel for the times.", "Within the Tools & Storage SBUs, all lines were positive in the quarter. The power tool and equipment group was up 10%, led by professional power tools as well as contributions from the outdoor and home products segment. This SBU also benefitted from new product innovation, including FlexVolt, and continued strong commercial execution.", "We had another strong quarter for the FlexVolt products, with approximately $60 million. Based on year-to-date results and planned second half FlexVolt product launches, we believe that we are on track to deliver revenue, approaching $300 million from FlexVolt in 2017. When factoring in cannibalization, however, this represents $200 million of SBD revenue or $100 million of growth versus the prior year.", "Our hand tools, accessories and storage organization delivered 5% growth on new product introductions and benefitted from a strong performance within the North American industrial end markets, led by our Mac Tools business.", "So, in summary, the Tools & Storage organization continued its momentum in the second quarter, delivering strong above-market organic growth along with robust operating margin of 18.1% as this is an acquisition execution around the Newell Tools and Craftsman Brand, as Jim referenced earlier.", "Now, moving to the Security segment, Security had a solid second quarter as well, posting 2% organic growth. North America organic growth was up 4%, led by higher installation volumes within the commercial electronic security and automatic door businesses. Europe was flat organically in the quarter as gains in the Nordics and the UK were offset by declines in France.", "In terms of profitability, the segment contracted 150 basis points year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. The sale of the mechanical locks business drove approximately 120 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 30 basis point decline was attributable to higher levels of installation growth within the quarter, country mix within Europe and a modest level of investment to support future growth.", "The Security team is maintaining its focus on commercial and operational effectiveness to position this business for future growth and margin expansion.", "Finally, the Industrial segment had an impressive quarter of outperformance as both the engineered fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered strong organic growth, well in excess of expectation.", "This topline performance contributed to a 240 basis point expansion in operating margin rate due to the benefits from volume leverage, productivity and previous cost actions.", "Engineered fastening posted 6% organic growth as the automotive business up low double-digits and a return to our growth in our Industrial business more than offset lower electronics volumes.", "From an automotive perspective, the growth was led by shipments of our self-piercing rivet and stud welding systems to support our customers' new model launches.", "Auto fastener sales outpaced light vehicle production by approximately 300 to 400 basis points, showing that we continue to deliver content gains.", "Finally, the Industrial business delivered approximately two points of organic growth, slightly more robust market growth and commercial actions executed within the business.", "As Jim mentioned, the infrastructure businesses posted an exceptional quarter, up 19% organically. Our hydraulic tools business is reaping the benefit from its revamped commercial structure and go-to-market strategies, with the backdrop of modestly higher prices in the scrap steel market, which does benefit our product lines. Hydraulics posted 18% organic growth in its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, with higher volumes in all regions.", "Meanwhile, oil and gas also generated 19% organic growth in the quarter, well ahead of expectations as the industry benefits from an acceleration of onshore pipeline construction activity within North America in the first half of this year. This is being offset by continued low offshore project activity.", "While the results of the oil and gas business are encouraging, our expectation is that without resumption of approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, also known as FERC, we will see a return to lower level of project activity in the second half of this year.", "We are pleased by the performances across the portfolio thus far in 2017. We will remain focused on driving outsized organic growth and operating leverage, while integrating the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands within our Tools & Storage franchise.", "Let's take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. For the second quarter, free cash flow was $134 million year-to-date performance to use of cash of $76 million.", "The quarterly and year-to-date declines versus the prior year are predominantly explained by carrying higher amounts of working capital relative to the outsized level of organic growth we are experiencing primarily within the Tools & Storage business.", "From a working capital turn perspective, we delivered 7.1 turns in the second quarter, which is a decrease of 1.1 turns versus the prior year. This decline is primarily due to the impact of our recent portfolio activities, specifically the acquisition of Newell Tools and the Craftsman Brand. Excluding these acquisitions, we were down 0.3 turns versus the prior year.", "We are confident that we will deliver strong cash flow generation in the second half of the year, given our core SFS processes and principles, combined with focused execution on reducing working capital levels in line with Q4 seasonal activity. In addition, we will continue to ensure that we maintain an adequate amount of working capital to support our growth expectation.", "As a reminder, in 2016, we improved our working capital turns from 8.2 times up to 10.6 times in the second half of the year. In 2017, we expect a similar working capital turn improvement within the second half, from 7.1 times up to approximately 9 times by the end of the year. Therefore, we are reiterating our commitment to deliver 100% free cash flow conversion, supported by this expected strong second half cash flow generation. As a reminder, this free cash flow conversion guidance excludes the impact of gains on divestitures. ", "So, turning to our 2017 guidance on slide seven. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are also raising our adjusted EPS outlook range for 2017 to $7.18 up to $7.38, which is an increase of 10% to 13% versus the prior year.", "On a GAAP basis, this results in $8.05 to $8.25 earnings per share range, which is inclusive of various one-time charges and the gains from the first quarter divestitures. The $0.10 increase to our outlook range is the result of higher organic growth than previously expected, about half of which was delivered by the businesses in the second quarter and the remaining half is expected to occur in the balance of the year.", "Additionally, we are maintaining our combined FX and commodity inflation headwind estimate of around $100 million to $105 million. While currency pressures have reduced since the first quarter, we are seeing increased pressures in commodities, namely steel and some purchase components.", "I would also like to point out that we expect third-quarter EPS to approximate 25$ to 26% of the full year 2017 EPS guidance.", "Now, turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page, organic growth within Tools & Storage is still expected to be mid-single digits, but modestly improved versus our last outlook.", "We see healthy construction markets in the US, combined with continued stable European environment and a modestly improving emerging markets set up to continue through the remainder of the year. This should provide the backdrop for share growth, when combined with our commercial actions. We continue to believe that top line growth will translate into an improved margin rate year-over-year.", "We are maintaining the organic growth view on Security, up low-single digits in 2017. Note that the marginal rate for the segment will be down year-over-year due to the divestiture of the mechanical locks business, which occurred during the first quarter. However, excluding that sale, the margin rate for the year will be flat to slightly down as we expect the impacts of mix and investments to support growth have the potential to be modestly dilutive to the full year rate.", "Now, finally, in the Industrial segment, we still expect organic growth be relatively flat, but modestly higher than our previous expectation. While we did see outperformance in both engineered fastening and infrastructure again in Q2, as I discussed in the April earnings call, there are market-related pressures which are expected to emerge in the second half.", "These pressures fall into three areas. One, North America light vehicle production is expected to soften; two, automotive systems which support customer new model rollouts will be lower in the second half of 2017; and three, expected lower project activity in North America for oil and gas, as I discussed earlier.", "We continue to expect operating margins to improve in this segment, driven by previously identified cost controls, as well as the impact from the first half performance. ", "We believe we have a solid path to deliver the full-year revised guidance and outperform the broader market from an organic growth and margin expansion perspective. We will remain focused and disciplined in our pursuit of that goal, in addition to successfully integrating our newly acquired tools businesses. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jim to summarize this morning's call.", "James Loree ", "Okay. Thanks, Don. So, to recap, the second quarter built upon the strong start to 2017. We continued to deliver above-market organic growth and robust operating performance. And as a result of the continued momentum, we increased the EPS guidance and continue to be excited about the opportunities to deliver value from the recent acquisitions, which are on track.", "And as we move into the second half now, our deep and agile leadership team is leveraging SFS 2.0 to deliver organic growth with operating leverage, continuing to integrate the Lennox, Irwin and Craftsman brands into our portfolio and generating that strong free cash flow. And we're encouraged by the results through the first half and we're encouraged by our ability to raise the outlook for the full year.", "We're also vigilant in the pursuit of our three overarching themes, to become known as one of the world's leading innovators, to deliver top quartile financial performance, and to elevate our commitment to corporate social responsibility, all of which supports the company in achieving our 2022 vision.", "Thank you. And we're now ready for Q&A.", "Dennis Lange", "We can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.", "Nigel Coe", "Good morning, Jim and Don. Interesting comment about the cannibalization on FlexVolt $3 million growth, $100 million of cannibalization. I\u2019m just wondering if you can just provide bit more color in terms of where you're seeing that cannibalization, what kind of margin mix you're seeing FlexVolt versus the products that are being cannibalized.", "And then maybe just second half this year and into 2018, how the product rollout [Indiscernible] rollout looks for FlexVolt?", "James Loree", "Sure. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we see a path now for FlexVolt to be approaching $300 million before cannibalization. And cannibalization impact will bring the number down closer to $200 million net overall for Stanley Black & Decker.", "What we're seeing is that, as we've been communicating probably now for three to four months, is that we started seeing cannibalization in the spring, early springtime related to certain products that we were replacing on the corded side with FlexVolt technology. So, we still offer those particular products. However, when someone goes in to make a decision about 120 volt product or a 60 volt product, that is now something that can get through FlexVolt, they have a choice to make between the FlexVolt technology or the corded D\u1d07WALT technology.", "And so, as we anticipated, we expect to have a little bit of cannibalization and that's what we're experiencing. And we hope, as we end the year, maybe the cannibalization won't be as large as what we projected, but right now that\u2019s kind of what we feel the trend will be at this stage.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may begin.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Good morning. Just a question on Tools & Storage margin and really kind of a two-part question. First, I was wondering if you could just decompose in a little bit more detail the drivers, product spending and promotions, et cetera, in the quarter.", "But then, bigger picture, Jim, I was also wondering, clearly, you\u2019ve got a balancing act between revenue growth and OP margin dollar versus margin rate. I was just wondering if you could put that in perspective for us, how you'd think you'd balance those two and maybe what is normalized margin trajectory for the Tools & Storage business?", "James Loree", "Yeah, I\u2019ll have Don tackle the first part of your question, which I\u2019m not sure he can add too much more color to, but we'll have him address that in a minute.", "I'll just take kind of a philosophically or from a big picture perspective. When we are pulling those levers on price promotion and margin optimization, trying to figure out where the sweet spot is, I would say, we tend to go in cycles sometimes. The needle will move from one side of the spectrum to the other a little bit. And I would say in the second quarter, in particular, we probably were a little bit more aggressive on price than normal, and so you saw the negative 1% price for the tools segment.", "That is not something that I necessarily see as a sustainable approach, but it was more of a \u2013 a bit of experimentation, especially since our regular promotional activity in the second quarter was a little bit lower.", "So, we had a fantastic margin performance in the tools business, 18.1%. Somebody was commenting early, before the call, that wow, it's down 70 basis points. Well, it's down 70 basis points versus our highest margin ever in the tools business. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned about it. We have the flexibility to do some experimentation we did. I think you'll see a little bit more of a shift as we get into the second half, particularly the third quarter where we have more traditional type promotions as opposed to price-related promotions. And all of that price activity, I would say, is driven more by us in the driver seat as opposed to responding to anything in the marketplace. Don?", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t dramatically add anything to what Jim just said about price. I think that was right on the mark. But I will reinforce that this is probably \u2013 if not the second or third highest profitability quarter tools has ever had \u2013 I think it\u2019s the second highest they have experienced after last year's second quarter of 18.8. And so \u2013 and we just have to keep that in mind and recognize that we're also experiencing some commodity inflation pressure as well, and yet we're still able to achieve that level of profitability. [Indiscernible] and that we don't turn it into something any more significant than what it is, which is relatively insignificant.", "I do want to make a comment \u2013 I didn\u2019t answer Nigel's second question about the profitability related to the shift of cannibalization in FlexVolt. And really, it's not much of a significant impact. It's a little bit of a negative initially here. As we have said before, the FlexVolt margins are a little bit lower than line average throughout this year. We expect as we go into next year for that dynamic to change as we've increased the volume and we also will likely have lower promotional activity as well.", "But the impact overall is relatively minor and you can see that in the overall operating profit rate of 18%.", "James Loree", "This is Jim. I'd also like to say that \u2013 congratulations to the operations team in Tools & Storage. They\u2019ve done a fabulous job with productivity. We had a series of years where we had design-to-value initiative going, which is now pretty mature. But at this point we're starting to get in pretty significantly into industry 4.0. And that basically involves creating smart factories and then embellishing them with robotics and 3D printing and these types of things. We're far from the robotics and 3D printing phase of it, but we're definitely making a lot of progress in making the factories more data-driven, more real-time in their execution. And what we're seeing is that we're getting above average, above historical average productivity out of this and we expect to continue that as we go forward. So, that's really helping boost the margins as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.", "Richard Kwas", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. ", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Richard Kwas", "How are you doing? A couple of quick ones for me. On Security, you talked about investments relative to the beginning of the year and the underlying margin. Was there any change in the underlying performance? I know most of the decrease is coming from elimination of mechanical locks, but if you provide some more color on what's changed since the beginning of the year in terms of incremental investments for future growth versus underlying performance organically?", "And then the other one real quick is, as you look at the second half of the year, you have a big industrial electronics customer that is coming out with a new product. How should we think about impact to the top line as we think exiting 2017 and into 2018? I know that business has been under pressure for some period of time. Thanks.", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yes. As it relates to Security initially, no major changes to our thought process around investments. As we said at the beginning of the year, we're investing a little bit of funds within our Security business to develop a more consistent organic growth profile over the long-term. And we think we are starting to feel a bit of the benefits of that as we saw a quarter with 2% organic growth here within the second quarter, but there's more work to be done in that regard. So, no major shift.", "I would say there was certainly a little bit of mix pressure this quarter that maybe had a tenths or two-tenths of pressure on the profitability in the segment as we saw a little bit higher mix of installation revenue in the United States and then the country mix over in Europe also was a little bit of a negative, but nothing major. So, I wouldn't say there was anything really underneath that was kind of causing a major shift that's something that\u2019s permanent or ongoing. It's just more of a unique second-quarter type of situation.", "As it relates to Industrial and electronics, that business for us has gotten down to a relatively small number here in 2017. So, in the second quarter, it was about $6 million of revenue. It's a very small component of that business at this stage for that particular customer. We don\u2019t expect to participate in a significant way in the launches in the back half. We have a minor role with that customer on an ongoing basis and we actually like that position, given the volatility and the profitability of the business.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. You may begin.", "Michael Rehaut", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Michael Rehaut", "Just a quick clarification and then my main question. The clarification is just on the Tools & Storage. I was just curious. On the growth investment in basis point impact on margins, just trying to get a little better sense of kind of like the underlying core margin, let's say, in that business as growth investments eventually will moderate as, I guess, you get other \u2013 FlexVolt and your other acquisitions more fully running.", "And then, just on the main question, though, on the \u2013 little bit more detail, hopefully, on the change in \u2013 what's driving the change in sales growth guidance. You mentioned Tools & Storage and Industrial a little bit better than the last time. Sorry if I missed it, but just a little bit more of where that's coming from in both segments?", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Sure. So, I mean, I think on the growth investment side for Tools, that's not a simple number to quantify because there's a lot of different investments across the tools business that are made to stimulate growth in the core business, to stimulate FlexVolt. So, it's difficult to really say how much new growth investments are.", "And what I would say is that there continues to be areas that we want to pursue, to make investments for future growth and to experience the type of growth that we've had in this business at high-single-digits \u2013 anywhere from mid to high-single-digit organic growth on a consistent basis, we have to be making some investments along the way to ensure that that type of trend continues, at least in the midterm. And that's really what you're seeing in the business. ", "Now, that being said, to all the points we made earlier, the profitability of the business continues to improve. And so, we would expect that when we look at the year-over-year performance of tools here in 2017 versus 2016, we will probably see 40 to 50 basis points of improvement in the margin rate year-over-year, while we're making investments, while we're making other decisions because of some of the things Jim mentioned around productivity, because of other cost management in different areas outside of growth investments, all those different things allow us to manage the business in a certain way and get to a certain result.", "James Loree", "That\u2019s a really important point, Don, because that's philosophically what we're trying to do, is that we're trying to achieve top quartile organic growth and fueling that with investments and at the same time driving margin expansion. And that's not easy to do, as Don points out, but that is really philosophically what we're trying to do.", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yes. The other question was related to change in the organic growth guidance assumption. Yes, we have tweaked our \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments in the call, we have tweaked our assumption for Tools & Storage up a little bit versus what we said in April. And the same thing would be for Industrial.", "Now, Industrial's reason is more because we saw a stronger performance in the second quarter than we were thinking in April. Tools is more of a continued trend of modest outperformance in their organic growth versus expectations and then slightly \u2013 certainly, as we get to July every year for our tools business, we get a really nice view of the back half of promotional activities, the beginning of the holiday season, and so that gives us something that we can get a better sense of what we think organic growth will look like. So, based on those various factors is why we tweak those numbers up.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may begin. ", "Tim Wojs", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job.", "James Loree", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Tim Wojs", "I guess my question is really on Craftsman. I was just wondering, Jim, if you could talk a little bit about maybe the scheduled launch in the middle 2018, a little bit of color on maybe which product, any sort of dialogue you're having with customers. And then maybe more broadly, any change to how you guys or your customers are thinking about e-commerce at this point?", "James Loree", "There's a lot of really good things going on relative to Craftsman. I don't want to get into too much detail because it is a competitive situation, but I will tell you that we are working on designing a complete comprehensive product line that spans all categories that it will be a high-quality product line that is high quality, high-value for the customer and will take some of the best attributes of our high-value products from across all our brands and incorporate them into the designs.", "The channel discussions, the customer discussions are going very well. The interest level is very high. We haven't really changed too much in terms of our strategy. There will be some decisions made in terms of how we expect to go to market from a channel perspective in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter. And then it will be all systems full speed ahead for a mid-2018 launch.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.", "Joe Ritchie", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Joe Ritchie", "So, maybe just kind of touching on the FX and commodity headwinds of $100 million to $105 million that you forecasted for the year, maybe if you could talk a little bit about whether the pressure you saw in 2Q was more or less what you anticipated. ", "And then, I'm just a little surprised that we are keeping that at the same number just given that FX has probably moved more positively for you as the years progress. So, any comment on that would be helpful.", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Sure. I will take that. Yes, so we started the year with an estimate of around $100 million in total for those two items as a headwind. And at that time, it was about 50-50. So, 50% for FX and 50% for commodity inflation. Back in April, it had shifted more to 60%/40%, 60% being commodity and 40% being the FX. ", "In the second quarter, that shift continued, where now we think based on current rates, we're probably around $25 million of that $100 million is currency. And the remaining $75 million is commodity inflation. And so, we've seen a continued trend of commodity inflation creeping up through the first six months of the year. We feel like, at this stage, for the remainder of the year, we have our arms around that with various contractual situations with key suppliers that we think we can manage that through the remainder of the year within a relatively small number. So, we don't expect that trend to continue. And if FX continues to go in the direction it has been, there might be a potential for that $100 million to be a little bit smaller by the end of the year, but we'll see how things progress at this stage. So, that gives you a little bit of the evolution and the history and where we are today.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. You may begin.", "Robert Barry", "Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Robert Barry", "Just I guess a couple of questions on tools volume and to reference your comment earlier on pricing experiments. How much volume do you think you picked up in tools this quarter with the price picking down one?", "And then, just a follow-up on the FlexVolt comments, it seems like the broader tools business is doing better and the momentum there is better. It seems like the outlook for FlexVolt should be kind of sharing in that, to the extent that end markets helping there. Any comments there on just how you're thinking about that outlook for FlexVolt versus the broader tools market?", "James Loree", "We haven\u2019t changed our outlook for FlexVolt pretty much all year. We've been consistent with that, $300 million minus the $100 million for cannibalization. And feel good about that. We have a whole family of new SKUs coming out here in the next couple of months that\u2019s going to support continued growth in FlexVolt against comps that begin to get tough as we start to get into the September, October, November, December time frame. So \u2013 and Don, I think, hit the cannibalization subject pretty hard earlier.", "So, I think FlexVolt is a good story. It's going to be really good. And it's going to be supportive of the $300 million number growth. And we'll see what happens when the new SKUs come out. If they're really successful, that will be \u2013 it will be great.", "And then we have the fact that we have no answer yet in the marketplace to FlexVolt and we're almost a year in now. So, this is about building an install base. A battery system is about an install base. And getting that install base built means that it creates the foundation for future growth and future expansion.", "And if you recall, the whole concept of FlexVolt is eliminate cords from the job site. And the more speeders [ph] we can come out with over time where people use that battery system will be a definite competitive advantage here as we go forward. So, we're very excited about FlexVolt. We're thankful that the innovation was protected well enough, so that it could not be leapfrogged in short order. And I think it would be foolish to think that, sooner or later, a competitor or competitors won't come out with an answer of some sort, but the answer we've seen so far, which is 9 amp hour, 18 volt clearly has not been the answer to FlexVolt.", "Going to the \u2013 how much did the 1 point of negative price drive volume in tools? I think the volume has been pretty steady in kind of that 5% to 7% range all year. And frankly, for quite some time. And I think it's probably safe to say that maybe we got a point out of it or something like that at most.", "And so, the conclusion we've drawn is that the business runs nicely at a 5% to 7% kind of threshold or range of growth. And when we start pushing it up into the 8% to 9% range in total, it starts to put strain on the factories and the supply chain and freight and cost and things like that. So, we're probably better off running it in the 5% to 7% range to the extent we are able to do that without any significant pricing kind of promotion in that regard.", "So, I think that's pretty much about what we can say about the experiment. We're excited about the third quarter promotional calendar, which is something that we normally do in the second quarter. So, stay tuned.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with UBS. You may begin.", "Chris Belfiore", "Good morning, guys. Yeah, I just kind of have a follow-up to that kind of comment there and question. I mean, in terms of just the back half for Tools & Storage, I mean, a little bit better than mid-single digits, just trying to figure out where \u2013 it seems like it needs to kind of slow down from a volume standpoint. But, like, you just said there's promotional things going on in the third quarter. So, kind of how like price and like volume kind of pare out in the second half, any color on that?", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yes. So, certainly, the comps are getting tougher as we get into the back half of the year. So, we've got to keep that in mind. But based on our current outlook, you're probably looking at a second half that\u2019s going to be around 6% organic growth for Tools & Storage. And so, it's kind of right in the middle of that \u2013 Jim just described, the sweet spot of the business currently today. Runs very well in that range of 5% to 7%. It might have a slight slam to 7%. We'll see how the year ends up, but it's kind of in that range of 6%, maybe up to 7%.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "Yeah. Not to beat FlexVolt to death, but, I guess, could you just, Jim, run us through some of the thoughts on cannibalization, just given that the dollar mix or I guess the price point is so much higher for FlexVolt versus corded. And I think even on the battery line, much higher as well. And maybe try to weave some of the commentary by inventory turns in that. I think a lot of what you saw last year and even in the early part of this year has been mostly channel fill versus turns. So, just how are those turning through the market and I guess, like I said before, how is that factoring into the price mix on FlexVolt relative to that cannibalization number?", "James Loree", "First of all, let there be no confusion that the sell-through on FlexVolt is excellent. And really, it's not about growing inventory in the channel. The early first month or two obviously was sell-in as a result of a startup of an initiative. But the sell-through has been excellent and continues to be very strong. So, let me just put that one to bed.", "I think the one point that you really \u2013 you hit it on the head with FlexVolt is this is about share of wallet when it comes to cannibalization. And you have two wallets. You have the end users' wallet and you have the channel wallet.", "And that\u2019s what makes it so difficult to really predict what the cannibalization will be because, at the end, there's only a finite demand for power tools and there are competitive power tools out there and then there are power tools and there's FlexVolt. And we can't really analyze at this stage and may never be able to fully analyze what the impact is on cannibalization because of those various share of wallet items.", "And I think that you hit on the head was FlexVolt is more expensive. So, to the extent that people are buying more units of FlexVolt, they are more challenged to buy 20 volt or 18 volt type products in the marketplace. So, I don't think there's any clear or easy answers to the question, but what we're to monitor this is we're actually looking at point-of-sale in the non-FlexVolt areas, corded and cordless.", "And we haven't seen any dramatic decreases at this point in time, but I think we do see some decreases at the margin, and that\u2019s all we can really quantify. So, we'll keep an eye on it. We'll report back as we learn more and more, we do more analysis over time. But it's going to take several quarters before we can really pin down exactly what the impact is.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. You may begin.", "Ken Zener", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "James Loree", "Hey, Ken.", "Ken Zener", "Taking that same line of questioning and adjusting a little bit, given your comments and that's a finite universe in terms of the SKUs, redefining the market is something Stanley has done very well and D\u1d07WALT in its history did very well. And ever since your analyst day, I\u2019ve been just constantly referencing back to Jeff Ansell's discussion around what FlexVolt is and where can it go.", "The idea that you're targeting small gas engines is something that is resonating with me. Not only because that\u2019s a new market for you, but also because of the savings you generated through the Black & Decker acquisition. Your margins today are nearly double a lot of your peers. So, are you too busy with Newell, with Craftsman to consider that proposition? What are your limits, I guess, because that's the real story behind Stanley is going into new categories, leveraging your operating platform versus others and acquiring a brand that\u2019s already established?", "James Loree", "First of all, I would say that Craftsman brought many positive elements to the table. One of them is that it's complementary to exactly what you're talking about because prior to Craftsman we did not have a large gas engine or small gas engine lawn equipment power initiative. We did have the string trimmers and those types of things, but they were electric.", "So, this gets us into gas. And we're learning a lot about lawn and garden, as we speak, and we are experimenting with the application of DC brushless electric motor technology to lawn equipment. And we do think that there is a big future. But there are some technological breakthroughs that will have to occur relative to the cost of doing that. And so, there's a lot of work going on there.", "And the answer to the question, are we too busy with Craftsman? Actually, this is part of our busyness with Craftsman.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates [ph]. You may begin.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good morning.", "James Loree", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I had two quick questions on the Tools & Storage segment. First, on the Newell side, I think you guys alluded to a retail load-in. And I just wanted to clarify that the prior guidance had no revenue synergies embedded in it.", "And then secondarily, your largest domestic customers, at least their stock prices have been impacted by some of the e-commerce plays that have unfolded in the home-improvement category. ", "Given that you guys sell to e-commerce as well as these large retailers, I was just curious to get your view on \u2013 if you think the pie in power tools as well as overall home-improvement is big enough for an e-commerce entrant as well as the legacy home centers to survive as you look out?", "James Loree", "I\u2019ll take part two. Don can figure out a little bit more about part one and probably ask one clarification on that.", "But let me cover part two. So, we as the largest tool company in the world, and as Don mentioned earlier, have taken a pretty aggressive stance in terms of making sure that we participate in the e-commerce opportunity and I\u2019ll call it a transformation. And, of course, e-commerce has its limitations. However, we would be foolish to think that it's not going to be a substantial part of the market in the years to come. It already is a substantial part of the market.", "And as was mentioned earlier, we, back in 2010, elected to enter the e-commerce market in the US and we did it not only with traditional e-commerce players or player, but also with our traditional customers, especially the home centers. And the traditional home centers are forces to be contended with as it relates to e-commerce.", "My guess \u2013 I would never ever comment upon the health or survival of our large customers, but I would say that both home centers embrace e-commerce. And I think they have certain advantages and certain advantages relative to the pure e-commerce players.", "And therefore, without getting too much into those, but you think about omni-channel and the advantages that brings, and you look at the recent purchase of Whole Foods, and you scratch your head and say why did that happen, I think if you start to envision how omni-channel could play an important role in e-commerce. You could see an unfolding scenario that says there can be successful pure players and successful omni-channel players. And maybe it all gravitates towards omni-channel at some point.", "So, I think there probably are going to be lots of changes as time goes on. We are really well-positioned, largest e-commerce player in the tool industry by an order of magnitude, probably as much as an order of magnitude. And have developed skills and capabilities that we share readily with all our customers that are interested and now, as Don mentioned earlier, also internationally into the developing countries in Europe and the other developed countries in the world and the developing countries.", "And I think in the developing countries, what's interesting about e-commerce is that it will enable us in certain areas, such as China, where we don't have number one market share to take a fresh look at how does one go to market in that type of \u2013 with that type of an opportunity to leapfrog maybe traditional distribution channels.", "So, very, very interesting space. We've done a lot of analysis and review of e-commerce in the last year or so. We're very comfortable with our strategy there. And we look forward to that being a major growth driver for us as we go forward across our customer base.", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yeah. So, the first question you had I think was around \u2013 Jim made a comment in his opening remarks about Newell and moving certain inventory from one DC to another, and that was really just part of the integration plan. There was no load into a customer. You might have misinterpreted those comments. It was really moving from one of our DCs to another to improve the service fill rate levels because when we initially acquired Newell, fill rates were much lower than what we would want them to be. And so, we've been aggressively \u2013 the Tools & Storage team has been aggressively working on this since the first day of acquisition and has made significant progress in that regard. But there hasn\u2019t been any load in or anything into our customers related to new products. It's simply part of the integration, something that we had on the plan before the closing occurred. If that doesn't answer your question, feel free to call Dennis and Greg and they can clarify anything else you had.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. You may begin.", "Michael Wood", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll just shift gears to Security. Now that you\u2019ve made your strategic decision there for the segment, just curious if there is opportunity to tweak any country by country exposure or are you with that portfolio now? And also, if you can just give some comment on the 2% of the acquired recurring business, if that was opportunistic or we should expect that to continue going forward?", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yes. So, I'll take that one initially and Jim can add new color on the first part of your question.", "Right now, we actually feel pretty good about the country makeup of the Security business. We don't see any countries that are major concerns for growth and profitability. We do watch that on an ongoing basis and evaluate it every year as part of our strategic update planning process. There are a few small countries in Europe that over time we have to decide, can we build a level of substance in infrastructure within those country that make them a player, whether either number one or number two in the marketplace, because we have a few smaller ones right now that are not in that position. If that didn\u2019t play out the way we wanted to, then that could be something we evaluate in the future.", "The second part of your question, yeah, we occasionally do these opportunistic RMR acquisitions in our security \u2013 electronic security business where we see them as nice additions to the portfolio, that integrate right into our infrastructure, and we will continue to look for those at the right price and the right financial returns.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin.", "Michael Wood", "Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the good quarter.", "James Loree", "Thank you.", "Michael Wood", "Just to pick up on the European \u2013 on the Security business, I was wondering if you can just talk about the European security business in particular. And you provided some outlook through 2017. ", "But looking further forward in 2018, can you just talk about your growth prospects and has perhaps something changed competitively?", "And then, if I could just add one quick one on \u2013 you called out Mac Tools as a source of strength. I know you added some storage product initially there. Was that what was driving the growth or you\u2019ve seen something else that\u2019s driving Mac's strength?", "James Loree", "Yeah. On Mac Tools, this has been an ongoing, multi-year, steady execution, improvement. We have a difficult relative market share position. So, it makes it that much more challenging. But we've added trucks. Our sales per truck, every year there, they're are improving dramatically. And it's just a kind of a more slugfest over time. A steady slugfest.", "And even with all that, we're getting kind of mid-single digit growth. We had a pretty good quarter this quarter, a little better than usual. But it's basically three yards and a cloud of dust in Mac Tools. That\u2019s the way that businesses is for us. We love it, but it's not going to be an 80-yard wide receiver touchdown in one quarter. So \u2013 and with that, I\u2019ll have to \u2013 Don, you can tackle the first part.", "Donald Allan, Jr.", "Yeah. So, Security Europe, specifically around organic growth, we had said for Security in general, and it applies to Europe, is that we believe it's a business that right now based on its current makeup, it can grow organically 2% to 3% on a consistent basis. And Europe had demonstrated that type of trend up until this year, where they\u2019ve seen a little bit of pressure in France, which is one of their larger markets that we think is just more market related and one time in history in the sense of \u2013 it's just really impacting this year. But we still think that\u2019s the right growth prospects for the business both in Europe and globally.", "But more importantly, as you\u2019ve heard at our investor day back in May, we have to continue to work on the next evolution of Security, which is getting into other areas that are very unique solutions that specialize touch to a customer at higher value and ultimately add to more positive mix to this business over the journey of the next three to five years plus.", "And so, we need to do both of those things. But I think that\u2019s the type of thing that maybe could move the business beyond 2% to 3% organic growth. But right now, that roadmap is not completely defined, but certainly well underway.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. ", "Dennis Lange ", "Shannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions.

My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.", "Dennis Lange", "Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's third quarter 2017 conference call.", "On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage.", "Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR section of the website.", "A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff will review our third quarter 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing.", "I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.", "Jim Loree", "Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As you saw from this morning's release, we delivered a strong third quarter continuing our track record of a solid execution. In fact this is the 16th consecutive quarter where we have met or exceeded expectations.", "Tools & Storage and Industrial led the way, once again contributing a robust organic growth performance which was 7% for the quarter. Total company revenue growth came in at 14%. Acquisitions delivered nine points of growth which includes the offset from the impact of the mechanical security divestiture.", "Tools & Storage delivered 22% total growth, including 9% organic. All regions contributed to the continued growth and share gains of this franchise. And of note was the acceleration within emerging markets which produced 16% organic growth in the quarter and mid-teens growth in all three regions Latin America, Asia, and the rest of the emerging world.", "The tools folks are executing superbly by leveraging our SFS 2.0 operating system to deliver core and breakthrough innovation with operating margin expansion, at the same time integrating the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands into our portfolio. This was an outstanding effort by Jeff Ansell and the entire Tools & Storage team. Jeff, as mentioned, he is with us today on the call and will be providing some more color. And looking forward, we expect to benefit from a series of growth catalyst in Tools, including DC brushless, FlexVolt, the Newell Tools acquisition, and beginning in mid-2018 the Craftsman brand.", "The Industrial segment delivered a significant outperformance for the quarter continuing its 2017 trend of strong results. Organic growth at 8% was impressive.", "And in Engineered Fastening, we continued to see robust automotive system sales in addition to higher industrial volumes which supported 6% organic growth for the quarter.", "Our infrastructure businesses delivered 15% organic growth, an outstanding performance as commercial actions, plus positive underlying markets benefited both project and inspection activity within oil and gas and expanded hydraulic tools volumes.", "Our total company operating margin rate remained healthy at 15.3%. Excluding M&A related charges, a 10 basis point expansion versus the third quarter of 2016, we continue to focus on investing in future growth, while generating meaningful operating leverage. In this thing, productivity execution and other cost actions enabled us to offset increasing commodity inflation, while expanding our gross margin rate by 60 basis points. The strong innovation fueled growth positioned us to continue to make a series of targeted investments to support future innovation, growth, and margin expansion.", "Diluted adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.95, 16% above prior year reflecting strong operational execution. So I want to thank our teams around the globe for their dedication and results driven work that produced this great quarter and year-to-date performance. And based on the above market organic growth and our confidence in the outlook for the balance of the year, we're once again rising the mid-point of our previous 2017 full-year adjusted EPS guidance this time by $0.10 with a new range of $7.33 to $7.43 or between 13% to 14% growth.", "And now I'll turn to an update on the acquisition of Lenox and Irwin businesses, as well as the Craftsman Brand. In a nutshell, we remain at or ahead of our expectations both from a financial and integration execution perspective.", "Specific to Newell Tools, we continue to execute on our plans to integrate employee, suppliers, and customers, into our existing operations. We remain focused on and confident in our ability to capture the $80 million to $90 million of cost synergies associated with this transaction. We're deploying core SFS principles into production facilities and are in the late stages of moving order fulfillment into our own distribution centers.", "We're happy to report that our actions to improve customer service levels across the Lenox and Irwin product lines have been successful and we are now experiencing fill rates commensurate with the strong performance of our legacy brands across the portfolio. In addition our commercial teams around the world are building detailed plans to support future revenue synergies. And we remain optimistic that a meaningful contribution in that area is achievable in 2018 and beyond.", "Now turning to Craftsman. We are hard at work bringing our vision for this great brand to life. We continue to make progress on Craftsman product development, supply chain deployment, and commercial strategy. We have now extracted all of our Craftsman supplier management activities from Sears and are fulfilling orders through a new distribution center in Charlotte. Importantly, in the last few weeks, we reached agreement with a major U.S. retailer on a program which features a 2018 rollout for the new brand. Jeff will provide more color on this in a few minutes.", "We are excited about the opportunity ahead as we re-Americanize this iconic brand and are looking forward to it coming to life beginning in mid-2018.", "So as you can tell there is a growing momentum and continued enthusiasm for both of these transactions as catalysts and we continue to find ways to deliver significant and sustained value to our customers and in turn our shareholders.", "And I'll now turn it over to Don for a more detailed review of the third quarter results.", "Don Allan", "Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. I'll now take a deeper dive into the results of our business segments which enabled the company to deliver another outstanding performance in the third quarter.", "Starting with Tools & Storage, revenues were up 22% in the quarter as 9% organic growth, 13 points of acquisitive growth, and one point of currency combined to more than offset one point impact from divestitures.", "Pricing was slightly positive for the quarter. The operating margin for this segment was robust at 17.8% as benefits of volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments and commodity inflation, yielding a 40 basis point rate expansion versus the prior year.", "Importantly, the organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and SBU. On a geographic basis, North America was up 9% organically with strong performances across all channels, U.S. commercial and retail channels posted high-single-digit growth, while our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single-digit growth. Additionally Canada contributes solid organic growth of 10%.", "North America's growth continued to be fueled by new product introductions across the portfolio and strong commercial execution. POS was up low-double-digits while inventory within our major customers was in line to slightly below prior year levels, giving us confidence that the strong selling was supported by strong underlying demand.", "Europe delivered another solid performance with 5% organic growth. Nine out of the 10 markets grew organically with double-digit performances in Iberia and Central Europe and solid mid-single-digit performances in the UK and France. The team continues to leverage our portfolio of brands and expand our retail relationships to produce sustained above market organic growth.", "Finally, as Jim mentioned, the emerging markets delivered an outstanding 16% organic growth. With mid-teen growth across all regions, diligent pricing actions as well as the ongoing MPP launch across the developing markets continued to support growth.", "We continue to see the e-commerce channel increase its share of the market and become a larger contributor to the business.", "Latin America was very strong headlined by double-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, and Peru, while Mexico and Chile delivered high-single-digit results.", "In emerging markets outside of Latin America, we experienced strong performances as well. For instance, our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia are now paying dividends as both delivered exceptional growth within the quarter. Also India and China posted double-digit growth in Q3. This emerging market performance is quite impressive considering the team overcame challenges relating to natural disasters and geopolitical events yet still delivered broad-based share gains in the quarter.", "Within the Tools & Storage SBUs, all lines demonstrated positive growth in the quarter. The power tool and equipment growth was up 10%, led by professional power tools as well as continued strength on the outdoor segment. This SBU also benefitted from new product introductions reflecting core innovation and FlexVolt and combined with strong commercial execution.", "Regarding FlexVolt, this breakthrough innovation continues to deliver growth aligned with our expectations.", "Based on year-to-date sales and new product launches, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenues approaching $300 million in 2017, as we discussed last quarter. We believe the impact of cannibalization on our corded products has been minimal and the program has carried positive benefits across the D\u1d07WALT brand. This is evidenced by above market growth on our corded products as well as our base 20 volt system. This bodes well for the Tools team's ability to deliver ongoing share gains.", "Our Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage organization generated 7% growth on new product introductions while benefiting from strong performances within the construction and industrial end markets. This team continues to deliver a stream of core innovation, while leading the integration activity for our Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands.", "So in summary, an outstanding quarter for the Tools & Storage organization continuing its momentum by delivering solid above market organic growth along with operating margin expansion of 40 basis points, an outstanding quarter.", "Turning to the Industrial segment which had another impressive quarter of outperformance as well as both the Engineered Fastening and infrastructure businesses delivered strong organic growth well in excess of our expectations. This top-line performance contributed to 120 basis points expansion and operating margin rate which was driven from volume leverage, productivity, and cost control. Engineered Fastening posted 6% organic growth during the quarter fueled by strong automotive and industrial results up low-double-digits and mid-single-digits respectively.", "Within automotive, growth was led by higher than expected system shipments to support new model launches primarily in Europe and Asia. Spare system orders were also stronger than expected driving the overall automotive outperformance.", "In auto fastener, sales delivered content gains and outpaced light vehicle production by approximately 500 basis points which was better than our long-term assumption of approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points of growth ahead of this type of production.", "Finally, industrial fastener growth reflected positive market conditions and enhanced commercial actions with our industrial focused customers.", "Moving to the infrastructure businesses, they posted a solid quarter up 15% organically. Hydraulic tools grew 37% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of a successful commercial action as well as an improved market environment. This performance reflects commercial excellence and in action as all regions contributed to the businesses fourth consecutive and highest quarter of organic growth.", "Meanwhile oil and gas generated 8% organic growth in the quarter driven by onshore pipeline project extensions in North America and increased global inspection activities. The inspection business continues to outperform as the team's commercial efforts have grown this business over 60% organically year-to-date. All of these activities more than offset a continued and expected decline in the offshore project activity.", "Finally, the Security segment delivered flat organic growth for the third quarter as gains in Europe were offset by a decline in North America. Europe organic growth was up 1%, as strength in the Nordics and UK were offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. North America organic growth was down 1% as strong healthcare related growth was more than offset by the impact of customer directed project delays and hurricane disruptions within the commercial electronic security business.", "The impact of these external headwinds approximated three points of organic growth for the North American business. Our expectation is that these are timing issues which will resolve themselves over the coming quarters.", "In terms of the profitability the segment declined 240 basis points year-over-year. The sale of the mechanical lock business drove approximately 100 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 140 basis points decline was attributable to the previously mentioned customer driven project delays and modest levels of investment to support long-term growth.", "The Security team remains focused on innovation along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for future revenue growth and margin expansion.", "Let's take a look at the quarter's free cash flow performance on the next page. For the third quarter free cash flow was $266 million which brings our year-to-date performance to $190 million. The lower year-to-date results compared to the prior year relate primarily to higher levels of working capital required to service the stronger organic growth we are experiencing particularly within the Tools & Storage business. From a working capital term perspective we delivered 6.4 turns in the third quarter, a decrease of 0.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline reflects the impact of our recent portfolio activity, specifically the acquisition of the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman Brands. Excluding acquisition and divestures turns were flat versus the prior year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong cash flow in the fourth quarter given our core SFS principles and focused execution on reducing working capital levels in line with Q4 seasonal activity.", "For those that have followed our business for the past several years, you know that the fourth quarter Tools & Storage seasonality dynamic is a regular occurrence, given the timing of the sales and the collections that occur within the quarter.", "We expect by the end of 2017 that we will deliver a 2.5 working capital turn improvement up from the 6.4 turns reported this quarter. This working capital result will generate $575 million of cash flow benefit in Q4 which will enable us to approximate and approach 100% free cash flow conversion. As a note this conversion rate excludes a net gain from divestitures.", "So now let's turn to our 2017 guidance on the next slide. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are raising the 2017 adjusted EPS midpoint by $0.10 and tightening the outlook range. Therefore our revised guidance range is $7.33 to $7.43, which is an increase of 13% to 14% versus prior year. On a GAAP basis this results an $8.20, $8.30 earnings per share which is inclusive of various one-time charges and the gains and losses on the sales of business.", "The increase to our outlook range is primarily the result of higher organic growth, now approaching 6% for the full-year, offset partially by increased other net expenses, primarily related to foreign exchange losses and certain balance sheet positions caused by the recent volatility in currency markets.", "Turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within Tools & Storage is now expected to be high-single-digits given the solid year-to-date performance and outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect healthy construction markets in the U.S. combined with continued stable European and emerging market environments to continue for the balance of the year. We believe the top-line growth will translate into an improved margin rates year-over-year as well.", "We're maintaining the organic growth view on Security of low-single-digits in 2017. The margin rates of this segment will be down year-over-year due to the divestiture of the mechanical locks business which occurred during the first quarter, along with the impacts of mix both geographic and customer mix as well as the growth investments.", "Finally in the Industrial segment we expect organic growth to be up mid-single-digits, modestly higher than our previous expectation.", "While we did see outperformance in both engineered fastening and infrastructure again in Q3 there are market related pressures which will impact the fourth quarter. These pressures fall into three primary categories. The first declining North America light vehicle production, second, less automotive system sales due to lower new model introductions, and three, expectations for lower North American oil and gas project activity in the fourth quarter.", "We continue to expect operating margins within the Industrial segment to improve for the entire year which will affect the solid year-to-date performance. So in summary we believe we have a solid path to deliver the full-year revised guidance which contemplates continued above market organic growth and margin expansion while our businesses remain focused on working capital turn improvement in Q4 and acquisition integration.", "We also believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for earnings growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow in 2018 consistent with our long-term financial objectives.", "With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff for a brief update on Tools & Storage and some exciting news related to Craftsman.", "Jeff Ansell", "Thank you, Don. 2017 is shaping up to be a strong year for global Tools & Storage. We delivered organic growth at every region, every strategic business unit, and with all of our top customers. In fact, we've received vendor awards for more than 10 of our largest customers this year.", "Our brands continued to perform well on a global basis. With brands like Black & Decker, Stanley, Porter-Cable, and Mac Tools, all up single-digits while brands like Proto, Vidmar, and D\u1d07WALT all grew double-digits. Innovation is a clear differentiator using D\u1d07WALT as an example; we've posted 3% growth this year in the declining corded power tool market simply based upon our Made in USA strategy. Add to this, over 20% year-to-date growth in our world's largest and best 20 volt cordless range, which continues to expand with our cord innovation focus. Finally add over 100% growth in our technologically superior flexible range. All in all it's a formidable share gain machine from top to bottom as demonstrated by at least two times market POS growth.", "All of this has occurred concurrent with the integration of the second and fourth largest acquisitions in our company's history namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman brands. With this as a backdrop, I'm pleased to provide an update on an initiative that will be a catalyst for further organic growth to Craftsman brand.", "Over the past six months, we built a completely dedicated team to bring our vision of a new re-Americanized Craftsman delight. This team is responsible for the development of a best ever craftsman product pipeline to reinvigorate the iconic Craftsman brand. As Jim mentioned earlier, we continue to make great progress on Craftsman product development, supply chain deployment, and commercial strategy which includes the full support of Ace Hardware through their 2,800 stores supporting Craftsman.", "Today, we're also pleased to announce that we will roll out the Craftsman brand in the second half of 2018 with Lowe's in the home center channel. We have been more than impressed with the level of commitment and support afforded by Lowe's for the Craftsman brand.", "We continue working with other channel partners to continue to provide them with successful programs to facilitate their growth as well.", "With this said, I would like to turn the call back over to Jim to wrap up today's presentation.", "Jim Loree", "Thank you, Jeff. Another extraordinarily strong quarter for Tools & Storage and an exciting development in connection with Craftsman brand.", "To recap for the total company, we delivered strong third quarter results maintaining our trend of above market organic growth and robust operating margin performance. Facilitated by our continued strong operating results, we increased EPS guidance for the year excluding charges and the gain on the sale of mechanical security we up guidance to $7.38 at the midpoint, a 13% increase over the prior year, and we continue to be excited about the opportunities to deliver value from our recent acquisitions.", "And as I mentioned earlier, both the Newell tools and Craftsman brand integrations remain on track and the experienced integration teams are energized to deliver our financial and customer commitments.", "Our deep and agile leadership team along with our entire employee base are focused on closing out 2017 with a good set up for 2018 leveraging our SFS 2.0 operating system to deliver strong free cash flow, organic growth with earnings leverage and continuing to successfully integrate the Lenox, Irwin, and Craftsman brands into our portfolio.", "We're encouraged by our results thus far in 2017 as we continue to position the company for a strong 2018. A little over one year into the role as CEO I could not be more pleased with the energy and enthusiasm from the team as we remain focused on delivering top quartile performance becoming known as one of the world's great innovators and demonstrating our commitment to social responsibility.", "These are all enablers to achieve our 22/22 vision and to be a great human centered diversified industrial company.", "And on a final note, I would like to thank Greg Waybright for his many years of dedicated service as our VP of IR. He is retiring at the end of this month to be succeeded by the very capable Dennis Lange. All the best Greg in your retirement and we're now ready for Q&A.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Dennis Lange", "We can now open the call for Q&A please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions].", "Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. You may begin.", "Jeff Sprague", "Good morning. Just looking for a little bit more detail on Craftsman if you could share it, if you have any preliminary thoughts on what channel fill or year one revenue could look like? And also I think you were planning on marrying this with the Craftsman specific e-commerce strategy and I wonder if you flush that out anymore yet? Thank you.", "Jim Loree", "So the advantage of being able to talk about Craftsman at the level we did is that it enables our partner loves to be able to report what could be a material item to their -- in connection with their releases and so forth.", "It really we would have preferred actually not to have to disclose as much as we actually did right now just from the standpoint of competitive intelligence, protection of our competitive strategy, and so forth. So it makes it very difficult to go into too much more detail. But with that I will turn it over to Jeff and he will give you whatever else he can.", "Jeff Ansell", "Thanks, Jim. I guess the view would be Craftsman is a broad-based brand across North America, plays across so many categories and channels. And given that we serve every geography well over 50,000 discrete customers, we're very proud to announce this partnership with Lowe's in the home center channel. We are concurrently working through the commercial process across other channels which includes e-commerce. We do well know that Craftsman is the number one search term in e-commerce -- in e-commerce space; it also is a great brand across MRO spaces et cetera.", "So a lot of good work to be done as Jim reported, we announced everything we could to this point but Craftsman continues to be a good opportunity across many different customers and channels.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.", "Nigel Coe", "Thanks, good morning. Greg congratulations. I just want to say Greg has been -- was one of the best IRs and big loss but Dennis is awesome, so I think you're good. So just want to clarify your FlexVolt conversation, you had previously said $3 million of growth, $2 million in that. Are we now closer to $300 million net for the year? So if you can just clarify that. My question is really on just a follow-up on Jeff's point on Craftsman; I think your original kind of plan was for 2020 sales of $300 million to $400 million for Craftsman. Given the conversations you've had with your e-commerce and big-box partner, where do we stand there now? I'm assuming it's higher than that but any sense there would be helpful?", "Jim Loree", "I'll start the FlexVolt and then kick over the Craftsman question to Jeff. But FlexVolt as I indicated we're approaching $300 million for the full-year of 2017. We do not believe we are seeing very much cannibalization I said minimal, probably minimal close to zero and therefore from that perspective, the net number would be $300 million. Jeff?", "Jeff Ansell", "In regard to Craftsman second question was I guess at this point there is still much work yet to be done. We build a dedicated team of well over 100 folks to do the really good work of building out as we call it a re-Americanized best ever Craftsman platform and what that means is we're starting with a parcel of land overlooking the ocean with no structure on it as an example.", "So much work to be done. But the great news is you take a 90-year emotionally charged brand like Craftsman, and you can build it from the ground up very rare that you have that opportunity. So there is so much to be done with thousands of products in development that I think that 2018 looks like really a labor of love to us at this point with much great work to be done. But we remain on track probably for the second half of next year and we feel really confident about the guidance we previously presented around Craftsman growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. You may begin.", "Ken Zener", "We've recently done a piece on the tool industry noting the consolidation of brands over the last 30-plus-years and obviously think you are well positioned within that environment. Given the success that Black & Decker merger ultimately provided you're high margins to hand drills indicate that's still an upward trajectory this year and now Craftsman and I walk into Ace Hardware it's pretty much just you all. And with Lenox and Irwin I mean you\u2019re now into that accessories business which is very well, it's been very okay now it's consolidating. What do you think your appetite for bringing in perhaps another power brand into your portfolio as you look to move into gas; I think that's probably that Jeff touched on at the Investor Day. You have the brands to get into gas today.", "Jim Loree", "Yes. So let me just sort of circle back and talk about what our strategy is from an M&A perspective and I think that will help put things in context.", "So the first element of our strategy is protect the core. And I think you've seen as assets have become available, quality assets in the tool business which is part of our -- significant really most significant part of our core, we had been agile and made some moves that have been designed to not only protect but also enhance the core.", "And I think one of the things that's hard for people to understand and I think maybe you got a little bit of it from listening to Jeff is the absolute amount of effort that goes into integrating something like even like a Lenox or a Irwin but when you talk about Craftsman starting from literally nothing more than a brand, a history, and three people which is what we got with that that is an enormous undertaking and we're so pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making along the way here to do the design work and the supply chain work and the commercialization and so forth. But it is very consuming for the organization and I have never seen including at the time that we integrated Black & Decker and Stanley, I have never seen the organization work so hard, so diligently, and produced so much and so right now it is almost impossible to imagine we get further on down the pike, probably another year, year-and-a-half something like that, when the organization has more bandwidth to think about doing something else in Tools whether the Lawn & Garden which has now become essentially part of the core as a result of the Craftsman acquisition or whether it be some other assets that might be out there available in the future.", "And then so the second part of our strategy is really to make sure that we continue our progress to invest in some other areas outside of Tools in -- that are also parts of our core, important parts of our core. So things areas such as Industrial and in Security and we fully intend to be feeding those segments or those businesses, franchises with capital and allocate the acquisition capital into those segments where it makes sense. And so one of the nice advantages of being a diversified industrial company is that enables us to direct capital in different parts of the portfolio based on availability of assets but also bandwidth of the organization and financial capacity of the company to absorb. So hope that's helpful but I think it basically says that it will be a while before we endeavor into something like Lawn & Garden or some other tool areas.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin.", "Rich Kwas", "And Dennis, look forward to continue to work with you. Just on Craftsman as we think about the next couple of years with limited detail around revenue contribution et cetera and no detail around revenue contribution but as we think big picture incremental for Tools & Storage, should we think about dampening effect at least in the initial years of the launch because of cost and integration, et cetera, and getting up to speed from a marketing standpoint? And just broad, Don or Jim, around how we should amount [ph] of incrementals over the next 12 to 18 months within the segment?", "Don Allan", "Sure, I will take that Rich. It's a very good question and a good point. The -- as Jeff and Jim both articulated very well, we're probably excited about this relationship and it's one of many steps as we continue to build out the plan for Craftsman. But as we enter into the execution of Craftsman, it will clearly be margins that will be below line average initially for various different reasons, we will not be manufacturing a lot of the product initially, we will be using sourcing model in the first year or two, then we will begin the ramp up manufacturing in that same timeframe. That will help margin and continue to improve them, we will also have launch cost like to do with all major initiatives that will pressure margins as well.", "So we don't think it will be major dampening impact in the Tools margin but it certainly will have a modest negative impact in 2018, and likely in at least the first half of 2019 if not the full-year of 2019.", "Difficult to quantify the impact at this stage as we're still working through as Jeff mentioned -- exactly how the launch and the timing and what products will go in with Lowe's and with other customers still to be determined. But over time we will provide more clarity as we get deeper into providing guidance for 2018 and then further into 2018 throughout the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin.", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "Just on the Lowe's launch, trying to dig in here on may be some of the opportunity set in ring-fencing that $300 million to $400 million target you have a couple of years out. Given that I think DIY U.S. for you guys and individual big box retailer would be something north of a billion, one would think that just given some of the limited overlap particularly on Lawn & Garden that you could have a pretty big number initially, just with channel sale, I mean is that an unfair way to think about it or is that the price point so much lower in Lawn & Garden versus Power Tools that it shifts the curve I guess I'm surprised that that number might not be bias to the upside, just given the magnitude of even one big DIY launch?", "Jim Loree", "I think Jeff said it all, it's early days here and the amount of specifics even as it relates to the Lowe's conversations, our TBD in terms of a lot of work still to be done, so it's hard to really come out and answer that question with anything specific other than say that when we put the $1 billion over 10 years out there on the -- when we announced the acquisition and when our board approved the acquisition on that basis, we really didn't really fully know how the customer conversations would evolve. So I think it's fair to say that we thought we were being conservative when we put those numbers on the table. But as it relates to the timeframe, the profitability, the ramp, all these types of things, it's just too early but we will keep you posted as we get more clarity as time goes on.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. You may begin.", "Saliq Khan", "Hi, Jim, kind of getting away from Craftsman looking at the Security business, could you provide us a bit more detail on what the free cash flow profile looks like and what are some of the efforts and progress that you have in place to help you drive this in new markets and new customer segments, so you can better leverage the channel partnerships particularly as you look into the next year?", "Jim Loree", "Well it's always; Security is always a great cash flow business for us because we're in the commercial security business and in commercial security the customer pays for the installation as opposed to residential security where historically the vendor, if you will, has paid for the CapEx upfront. So cash flow is a great stream and the recurring revenue is a dependable stream as well.", "So the existing business we will call it the core commercial security business, it's a good business but what's happening in the digital world and I think as everybody knows is the advent of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, I could go on we all are familiar with the laundry list of new technologies that are facilitating great value creation for customers be that commercial or otherwise, but in this case I think the fact that they would be commercial is relevant. And I think we have a really, really great asset that we can leverage to become an integrator for those types of technologies in specific applications, specific areas, and not only that but to also develop recurring revenue streams that are differentiated -- the value proposition are differentiated and recurring revenue streams will continue.", "So I think we will end up with a core commercial security business that we have today that will be enhanced through innovation and sustainable for a long period of time. And on top of that, I think we will start to see the emergence of a growth oriented higher technological content business that is scalable and will develop an ecosystem. That will take some time but we are doing everything on our power to accelerate that and to make sure that as the market unfolds that we have a position deployed in that market.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Belfiore with UBS. You may begin.", "Chris Belfiore", "Good morning guys. Greg, thanks for all your help, it's been a pleasure. And I look forward to working with Dennis again. So just kind of wanted you to kind of go talk a little bit on pricing especially in Tools and business -- in Tools & Storage business just lot of the other headwinds you're seeing out there some of the distributors that we cover but it's been relatively flat year-to-date you had commodity headwinds continues, so just kind of a little color on the pricing environment and then maybe kind of how we can expect that to the price cost equation to kind of see as we kind of move into next year?", "Don Allan", "Sure. I will start and then we will pass it over to Jeff to provide a little more color but we had a third quarter that was slightly positive for price in Tools & Storage. Within that if you kind of break it apart; you have a North American business that had kind of a normal promotional activities that occur in the quarter. So there was some negative price, a lot of close to a point in North America. And then outside of North America we had positive pricing actions that offset that due to various different things such as commodity inflation, currency movements et cetera. And so the net result was a slight positive. So that's just to give you a little more detail.", "As we go into next year, we actually see a fair amount of commodity inflation coming into the mix. As I've mentioned before we had about $100 million, it looks like, next year. Now the number looks to be closer to $150 million of commodity inflation. And we're in the process now of looking at what additional pricing actions we can take in response to that.", "If you look at our history we probably get anywhere from 60% to 70% of price recovery in year one but we're looking at how we can be more aggressive and make that number much closer to 100%. But as you all know it's a process that takes quite a bit of time working with our customers. Jeff any additional color?", "Jeff Ansell", "Maybe the only thing to add would be bit on the process. So when it comes to an inflationary environment from a commodity perspective, as Don just described, our first action is to do everything possible inside of our network to drive productivity to attack those costs and the things that we can cover we certainly pass along in the way of price. So we work with our customers in that regard.", "We also get smarter as time goes on. So clearly the second and fourth quarter are the biggest promotional periods for any tool company, but probably 25% of all the programming that we do annually is eliminated in one year and change for the next.", "So we learned what worked, what didn't work, where we'll spend money, whether we had a good payback on that. And at least a quarter of what we do every year changes as we get smarter get more experience et cetera and we will continue to work those things so that we get the best possible payback for the investment of price that you mentioned.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. You may begin.", "Rob Wertheimer", "Hi good morning. A lot of things happening that seem to be going quite well at once. Jim could you maybe give an overview of how you think about the process and progress in the breakthrough innovation centers, would you consider the staging whatever the next innovation it might be just given all the opportunities you have at Craftsman maybe there is something at Craftsman I don't know just maybe give us an update on that where I know that is lot percolating behind the scenes?", "Jim Loree", "Yes. Well I'm actually quite thrilled with the innovation that's come out of our breakthrough innovation teams obviously FlexVolt was pilot and it really was major homerun. Some of the other innovations, a good portion of the other innovations are a little bit more on the periphery of our core.", "So an example would be the connected job site that we have put together. We have the world's best tech connected job site which brings Wi-Fi to construction projects and then it brings Internet of Things to projects and then construction sites and then brings intelligent analytics and interfaces with architectural design systems and even integrate things like augmented reality and so forth. Very exciting innovation they had worked really hard on it, it\u2019s been piloted three times unsuccessfully on different major construction sites. And so now it's time to scale it. And that's where I would say our biggest challenge comes in and what we're needing to do with this to make sure that we scale it appropriately is to create a more exponential oriented organization. So in the traditional organization in this case just came out of the power tool business. So you have power tool commercial people who have a history of great success commercializing power tools and now we're trying to sell connected job sites.", "Well it's a different skillset, the customers are the same but it's a different skillset and so we need partners, we need different skillsets in our own organization and we also need to liberate them, so they can go spend more money to scale it faster to the extent that we can afford that in our very measured kind of investment management ways that enables us to both achieve operating leverage on one end at the same time, make investments.", "I know there were some people on the phone this morning before the call, some of the analysts were saying well why didn't you get more operating leverage in tools, while we spent more money on investments for the future in tools and that's one of the big reasons and so that's kind of the challenge is really gauging from a financial standpoint but getting them enough capital and expense to liberate them to go often and scale appropriately when they created a great thing like the connect job sites. And then just providing a little different organizational model which we will talk more and more about in the coming quarters but we're doing some work with breaking out some exponential organizations from the traditional organization and I think that's going to be one of the key elements of the success in commercializing the breakthrough innovations that are not let's say necessarily right in the middle of the fairway.", "The FlexVolt is a battery system, the power tool commercialization people know how to commercialize battery systems, and the digital marketing folks from the digital accelerator down at Atlanta were very helpful in enabling that digital marketing approach for that project and it was just a fabulous combination of leveraging our existing resources.", "And some of the other innovations and not all of them, probably two or three, four of them are really into core and you will see them coming out over time in the traditional organization, but I think some other ones probably see a little different approach more of a silicon valley like approach to commercializing.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. You may begin.", "Robert Barry", "Actually, just, first, had a quick follow-up on that prior question on price. I know last quarter you had talked about these pricing experiments switching price a little harder and then adjusting the volume impact. I'm just curious if that continued this quarter and then my question though was really on the core growth outlook, I mean last quarter you raised 50 bps that added $0.10 to EPS, I must say it was a little anti-climatic to see 150 basis points rise this quarter largely offset by this other net. Can you quantify and provide more color on what's going on there and then how did that line in the model track next year, would that be expected to step down materially in 2018? Thanks.", "Jim Loree", "Okay. I will answer the part related to your question about the experiments, the pricing experiments then I will turn it over to Don. So I have promised myself and actually I promised my team as well never to say the word experiment in connection with pricing again after the brouhaha it created after the last call. So pricing is an iterative process and I think Jeff kind of addressed it already that Jeff is there anything else you want to say about that before we turn it over to Don for the second part of the question.", "Jeff Ansell", "No, sir.", "Jim Loree", "Okay. Then Don?", "Don Allan", "Okay. So I will walk through a little of the detail. We had very good operating leverage in the quarter. So if there is a confusion on that we would be happy to walk through it after the call in more detail. But if you look at the revenue outperformance versus our operating margin outperformance we're pretty much in line with what we previously communicated if we have a point of revenue better than expected, what would drop through to O&M. So that conversion rate pretty -- which is pretty much in line with what we communicated which is anywhere between 25% and 35%.", "What happened in other net which is low operating margin is as I mentioned in my presentation was that we had some currency positions related to balance sheet items that sometimes as they get settled throughout the quarter based on currency movements you experience as gain or losses. In this case we had about $7 million to $10 million of losses in the third quarter from that activity. That put a little pressure on the additional EPS flow through but still $0.10 outperformance versus expectation versus may be $0.12 to $0.14 expectation, I still think that's an heck of an operating leverage performance.", "As far as what it means for next year, I continue to believe that we will grow in line with our long-term financial commitments and objectives, we have 4% to 6% organic growth, 10% to 12% EPS growth, and 100% free cash flow conversion. Those have been our long term financial objectives and I think next year at this stage even with $150 million of commodity inflation coming in to the mix next year with offsetting pricing actions of some magnitude I believe that we can hit those objectives.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. David MacGregor, your line is open. Please check your mute button.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates. You may begin.", "Scott Redner", "Wanting to go back to LatAm, our emerging market growth in Tools & Storage, I was hoping you guys give a little bit more color kind of what in terms of distribution change was it kind of a one-time bump versus what's it go-forward rate just realizing that that business saw such trend this quarter?", "Jim Loree", "Yes, it's more of an ongoing growth initiative than a one-time bump because the reason we made these changes is absolutely for the purpose of driving share gain and organic growth in Turkey and in Russia. So if you think about the approach that we used to have, we had a couple of major distributors and that was it. And I think it was one in Turkey and then a couple in Russia. And instead of blanketing the market with sales reps, end user demand stimulating activities and distribution, physical distribution centers. So we've gone from a kind of half baked approach to a full-frontal attack on those markets and so that it is a very sustainable approach and we should expect some pretty good growth out of those in regions notwithstanding any geopolitical turmoil that may occur in those very volatile regions in the years to come.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.", "Dennis Lange", "Shannon thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously, please contact me if you have any further questions.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange, you may begin.", "Dennis Lange", "Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call.", "On the call, in addition to myself, is Jim Loree, President and CEO; Don Allan, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Ansell, Executive Vice President and President of Global Tools & Storage.", "Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation, which we will refer to on the call, are available on the IR section of our website.", "A replay of this morning's call will also be available beginning at 2 PM today. The replay number and the access code are in our press release. This morning, Jim, Don, and Jeff will review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and various other matters, followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior calls, we're going to be sticking with just one question per caller.", "And as we normally do, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risk and uncertainty. It is therefore possible that actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we may make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8K that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 Act filing.", "I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Loree.", "Jim Loree", "Thanks Dennis and good morning everyone, thank you for joining us. As you saw in this morning\u2019s press release, we delivered a solid fourth quarter performance bringing closure to an impressive 2017. The company continued is above-market organic growth trajectory and developed operating margin rate expansion, strong EPS growth and very good free cash flow conversion. This solid performance highlight the power of coupling our very developed organic growth machine with a return to acquisitions. We are encouraged and we believe that this trend will continue in to 2018. ", "Moving to the fourth quarter numbers, revenues were 3.4 billion, up 17%, with organic growth of 8%. Acquisitions added 9 points of growth and currency contributed 3 points. These factors were partially offset by the mechanical security divestiture. Tools and storage continued its strong contribution accelerating to 11% organic growth and 26% total growth. ", "With strength in all major geographies and business units, this performance reflects a vibrant series of growth initiatives around the globe and a stream of innovations that we have brought to the market place including FlexVolt. ", "As expected, industrial decelerated in the quarter to a still positive 2% organic, just ahead of our expectations. All three industrial businesses delivered growth in the fourth quarter, which was enough to more than offset anticipated declines in engineered fastening electronics business, as well as lower self-piercing rivet system sales. ", "Security ended the year with 2% organic growth including modestly positive performances from both Europe and North America and Don will provide you with a deeper dive in to business level operating performance during his remarks. ", "Our total company operating margin rate excluding M&A related charges remained healthy and expanded 30 basis points versus prior year. EPS for the quarter was $2.18, a 27% expansion as strong operational execution was coupled with lower restructuring cost. Also noteworthy, we reached agreement in late December to purchase the industrial focused business of Nelson Fastener Systems for $440 million in cash. ", "The agreement excludes Nelson\u2019s automotive stud welding business and is a write down to fairway bolton for engineered fastening. Nelson increases our presence and the general and industrial end market expands our portfolio of highly engineered fastening solutions and will deliver significant cost synergies relative to its size. ", "Nelson\u2019s LTM revenues were approximately 200 million. The company employs about 700 people and operates 11 manufacturing sites. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2018 and look forward to integrating Nelson and adding scale and capabilities to engineered fastening. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to full year highlights, 2017 was a year of impressive financial performance, strong execution, and progress towards our strategic objectives our 2022 vision. Full year revenues were 12.7 billion, up 12% including a 7% contribution for organic growth, as well as a 7% contribution from acquisitions. ", "Our operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to a record 14.8%. Productivity and cost reduction initiatives supported a 40 basis point expansion in gross margin despite nearly a $100 million of currency and commodity headwinds. ", "2017 was a case study of SFS 2.0 in action, innovation, commercial excellence and digital excellence fueled above market growth and margin expansion. That growth along with cost and asset efficiency from functional transformation and fuller SFS enabled us to continue to make targeted investments to support future innovation, growth and margin expansion, all-in-all a highly virtuous circle. Ex charges, diluted EPS for the year was $7.45, a 14% increase and a new record for Stanley Black & Decker. Free cash flow remained robust at 976 million and cash conversion came in at our target of approximately 100%. ", "Turning to portfolio strategy, 2017 was a year in which we executed several significant portfolio moves. The year began with a $725 million tax efficient mechanical security divestiture which was followed by the acquisitions of the Craftsman Brand and Newell Tools, which combined, totaled approximately $2.9 billion.", "In doing so we added three iconic brands, Lenox, Irwin and Craftsman, with a far greater future growth potential. Specific to Newell Tools, we continue to execute plans to integrate employees, suppliers and customers in to operations. We remain focused on and confident in our ability to capture the $80 million to $90 of cost synergies. ", "Our commercial teams continue to refine plans to pursue revenue synergies as well. In that regard we will move to global execution mode this year and begin to drive meaningful results in that area. ", "And turning to Craftsman, we continue to make great progress on product development, supply chain deployment and commercial strategy. The Tools & Storage folks along with our customers are in full bore execution mode of internally and with our partners and are confident that the mid-2018 rollout will be a successful relaunch of this incredibly strong brand, and additionally we made further substantive progress on the commercial strategy. And Jeff Ansell will provide some more color on that in just a few moments. ", "So as you can see, we remain on or ahead of our plans, as it relates to the integrations. In summary, 2017 was a really great year for Stanley Black & Decker. What a special performance by our 57,000 employees around the globe. I thank them for their dedication, agility and a will to win. Because it is our people to whom we attribute these great accomplishments. They live our purpose everyday with incredible passion. ", "2018 looks to be shaping up to be another strong year, as we celebrate our 175th year in business on a high note. We have generally supportive market conditions, with a few minor exceptions with in industrial, a strong pipeline of acquisitions, and organic growth initiatives developed in accordance with SFS 2.0. ", "We have a cost and productivity focus that supports margin expansion and is the bedrock of our operating system as well as a host of new opportunities related to our innovation activities. And as always we have to navigate known headwinds such as commodity inflation and other unknown pressures that may arise. ", "We feel that we position the company for a successful 2018 nonetheless. And now I will hand it over to Don Allan, who\u2019ll walk you through segment performance, overall financials, and 2018 guidance. Don?", "Don Allan", "Thank you Jim and good morning everyone. I will now take a deeper dive in to our business segment results for the fourth quarter. Starting with Tools & Storage, revenue were up 26% in the quarter, with an impressive 11% organic growth, 13 points of acquisitive growth, and 2 points of currency. The operating margin rate for this segment was robust ta 16.7% as benefits of volume leverage and productivity more than offset growth investments, commodity inflation and price to support normal holiday promotion, yielding a 50 basis points expansion versus prior year. ", "A strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each Tools & Storage region and [SBUs]. On a geographic basis, North America was 8% organically, with strong performances across all channels. The US commercial market generated double-digit growth, US retail channels close to high single digit growth, and their industrial and auto repair markets generated mid-single digit growth. Additionally Canada contributed solid organic growth of 8%. ", "North America\u2019s growth continue to be fueled by strong commercial execution and product introduction across the portfolio, including contributions from FlexVolt. We continue to see very little cannibalization impacts from both FlexVolt launch, and are seeing more positive indication that this is stimulating incremental demand for our DeWalt 20 volt cordless power tool system, while also not competing growth in corded products.", "Our shipments continue to be supported by strong demand in that channel, as North America POS was up mid-single digits and inventories within our major customers were also in line with prior year levels. Europe delivered another outstanding performance with 17% organic growth. 10 out of 10 markets grew organically with double digits performances in eight of the markets including the UK, France, Siberia, and Central Europe. ", "The team continues to leverage our portfolio of brands and expand on our retail relationships to introduce sustained above market organic growth. This performance exceeded our recent trend in mid-to-high single digit performances, as the region benefited from a strong holiday season. ", "Finally, emerging markets delivered in other center an outstanding organic growth of 17%, with all regions delivering double digit performances. Diligent pricing actions, continued e-commerce strength, and the ongoing [NPG] launch across the developing markets continue to support growth. ", "Geographically, Latin America was very strong, headlined by double digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, while Peru and Chile delivered high single digit results. Our change to a direct selling model within Turkey and Russia continued to fuel exceptional growth for those countries. In addition, Korean, Japan, Indian and China posted notable double digit growth. ", "Within the Tools & Storage SPUs all lines showed high single to double digit growth in the quarter. The Power Tool and Equipment group was 13% organically, whereby professional Power and Tool at 15%. This SPU also benefited from new product introductions reflecting core innovations as well as (inaudible), along with continued strong commercial execution. ", "Our hand tools, accessories and storage organization generated 9% across our new product introductions and strong performances within the construction and industrial and markets. The accessories segment was up 14%, while hand tools and storage delivered 8% growth. Another nice performance from this team, while they are also successfully continuing to integrate Lenox, Irwin and the Craftsman brand. ", "So, in summary, truly an outstanding quarter and an outstanding year for the tools and storage organization. Jeff will provide some additional color on the full year in a few minutes. ", "Turning to industrial, this segment delivered 2% organic growth as Jim mentioned, slightly ahead of internal expectations. This topline performance contributed to an 80 basis points expansion in operating margin rate from volume leverage, productivity and cost control. Engineered fastening posted 1% organic growth during the quarter, with mid-single digit growth in automotive and industrial, which more than offset lower electronics volume. ", "Within automotive, growth was led by continued penetration gains within fasteners, enabling organic growth well in access of light vehicle production. This more than offset the expected impact of lower self-piercing rivet system sales due to lower model rollover activity at our automotive customers. ", "Finally, the growth within general industrial fastener market reflected supported market conditions and enhanced commercial actions, and they won share gain within our customer base. The infrastructure businesses posted a strong quarter of 8% organic growth, hydraulic tools grew 19% as they continue to see the benefits from the execution of successful commercial actions as well as the support of market environment. This team continues to raise the bar for commercial excellence as all regions contributed to growth. ", "Meanwhile, oil and gas generated 3% organic growth in the quarter, driven by North America auto wells and inspection projects activities which more than offset a continued and expected decline in offshore project activity. ", "The North American inspection business has been a relatively new driver for organic growth and our performance for oil and gas. The teams commercial have grown this business from approximately 15 million in 2016 to nearly 50 million this year. ", "Finally, the security segment delivered 2% organic growth during the quarter. North America organic growth was up 2% due to higher installation activity within conversion, security systems and higher product volumes within healthcare. Europe\u2019s organic growth was up 1% that strengthen the Nordic and UK was offset by anticipated ongoing weakness in France. ", "In terms of profitability the segment declined 200 basis points year-over-year. The sale of the mechanical lock business drove approximately 90 basis points of this contraction. The remaining 110 basis points decline was attributable to mix and modest levels of investment to support long term growth. The mix impact came about due to higher mix of installation revenues within CSS, lower software sales within healthcare and then [country mix] within Europe. ", "It is important note, that this operating margin was consistent with the performance of the business over the last two quarters. Security team remained focused on innovation along with commercial and operational effectiveness to position the business for revenue growth and margin expansion in 2018.", "Let\u2019s take a look at free cash flow performance on the next page. In addition to the strong P&L performance, we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter. Our full year cash flow performance was strong as we generated 967 million in 2016-17. ", "First in 2016, cash from operations declined 66 million, however this included a $261 million investment in working capital, which was $318 million higher than 2016 to support the strong, very strong level of organic growth, most notably within tools and storage. This impact was partially offset by higher cash earnings from the business. ", "In addition we saw our capital expenditures increase by 96 million in 2017, as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity, as well as investments to support acquisition integrations. This performance resulted in a free cash flow as a percentage of net income to be approximately a 100% when excluding the net gain on divestitures right in line with our stated financial objectives.", "On a working capital term perspective, we delivered 8.9 turns in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 1.7 turns versus the prior year. This decline reflects the impact of our recent portfolio activity, specifically the acquisition of both Lenox, Irwin and Craftsman brand. Excluding these acquisitions, turns were 10.6 times, consistent with our record 2016 performance. ", "Working capital management remains a key pillar SFS 2.0 operating system. We continue to drive working capital improvements across the company, with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions such as Newell Tools. We are confident in our ability to now bring our working capital turns back about 10 in the coming years. ", "I would now like to take a minute to provide some comments regarding the recently enacted US tax legislation and its respected impact to the fourth quarter 2017 and fully year of 2018. We expect these changes to deliver a positive impact for the US economy and are very supportive of the improved worldwide cash mobility that comes with the territorial tax system, and finally encouraged by the benefits that come from the lower effective tax rate. ", "In the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time $24 million net tax charge which is reflected in our GAAP EPS. This includes an estimated liability of $466 million to reflect the new territorial tool charge. As you know, this is payable over the course of eight years heavily weighted to 2022 and beyond. ", "Partially offsetting this is the positive impact from re-measuring our net deferred tax liability positions at these lower tax rates. Keep in mind the regulatory guidance surrounding this new tax bill continues to be refined and the fourth quarter charge is based on current estimates. We finalize the overall impact during 2018 as we receive refined guidance from the US Treasury Department. ", "Now turning to the impact of the 2018 effective tax rate. The full benefit of the decrease in the US tax rate from 35% to 21% is estimated to be approximately five points on our effective tax rate. This benefit however is mitigated by approximately three points of tax costs on certain new provisions in the tax law as well as reduced benefits from previously allowed deductions. ", "Our guidance for 2018 will be based on the tax rate of approximately 18%, which is a $0.20 EPS benefit versus 2017. Hence the overall estimated impact from the new legislation is a two point benefit to our effective tax rate in 2018. ", "Now let\u2019s move deeper in to our 2018 guidance. Before I start this outlook is based on the first quarter adoption of two new accounting standards with respect to revenue recognition and pension accounting. For financial modelling purposes, we released a supplementary 8K this morning to provide the impacts of operating results and business segment information for 2016 and 2017.", "The impacts from these changes has a modest negative impact on our operating margin rates and is relatively neutral to EPS. We are targeting approximately 5% organic growth in 2018 which will result in an adjusted earnings per share range of $8.30 up to $8.50, which is an increase of approximately 13% versus the prior year at the mid-point, and we expect our free cash flow conversion to approximate a 100% again in 2018.", "On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be $7.80 up to $8, inclusive of various one-time charges related to M&A. You can see on the left side of this chart, we expect the benefits from organic growth to generate $0.50 to $0.60 of EPS accretion. This will be partially offset from $0.25 to $0.30 of net commodity inflation which includes approximately 150 million of commodity pressure, which will be offset by the impact from pricing actions that will begin to be reflected in the P&L as we move in to later stages of the second quarter. Across the full year this reflects a 60% to 70% price recovery. ", "Next we expect the net impacts of cost and productivity actions, acquisition accretion and a higher share count year-over-year to deliver a positive $0.45 to $0.50 in EPS. As previously mentioned, we expect a tax rate of approximately 18% and 80% which will deliver as I mentioned $0.20 in EPS secretion. ", "A few other housekeeping items I\u2019d like to review that we referred to other miscellaneous guided matters. The first of which we continue to anticipate approximately 50 million of core restructuring charges, which is consistent with the last few years. Second, we are forecasting approximately 155 million share outstanding for 2018. Finally, we expect the first quarter\u2019s earnings to be approximately 16% of the full year performance. This is about 130 basis points lower than last year. ", "The primary factor driving a lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of commodity inflation particularly in tools, but do not expect to see the price recovery benefit until we get in to the later stages of the second quarter and beyond. The net priced cost headwind for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $50 million. This impact is somewhat mitigated by lower below the line expenses year-over-year, due to one-time environment and pension charges that were taken in the first quarter of last year. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. Organic growth within Tools & Storage is expected to be mid-single digit in 2018. There are multiple organic growth catalyst including core innovation, continued benefit from flex fold, the start of Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, emerging market growth and perhaps most exciting, the Craftsman Brand roll out in the second half of the year. ", "Another positive factor is that we are generally seeing supportive markets across most geographies that we serve. We believe the topline growth will translate in to margin rate year-over-year. As many of you know the rollout of the Craftsman brand will have somewhat of a governing factor on how far we can push margins forward in tools next year, as it will begin at the low line average profitability. This dynamic is due to heavily relying on our outsource providers as we ramp up in the market place and overtime we will improve profitability as we enforce production. ", "In the industrial segment, we expect low single digit decline in organic growth, with an easier fastening expect to see relatively flat organic performance. We will see above market growth within automotive and industrial fasteners, but that will be offset by lower automotive system sales due to a decline in model rollovers at our automotive customers, and the residual comp issues within electronics most notably in 1Q.", "In oil and gas we expect to see a double digit decline due to lower onshore project activity across the pipeline market. And then within hydraulic tools we expect to see continued growth from our successful commercial action. With the teams proactive cost and productivity focused, we expect industrial operating margins to improve in this segment for the year. ", "Finally in the security segment, we are expecting the organic to be up low single digits in 2018, as the team continues the commercial momentum from 2017. This should translate in to improved operating margins year-over-year, as we drive our cost and service productivity focus. ", "So in summary, we believe that we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company\u2019s earnings growth and margin expansion in 2018, which is consistent with our long term financial targets. We remain focused on free cash flow generation, acquisition, integrations and the rollout of the Craftsman Brand. So as you can see there\u2019s a lot to be excited about in 2018. ", "With that I would like to turn the call over to Jeff for a few key full year Tools & Storage highlights and then a brief update regarding (inaudible).", "Jeff Ansell", "Thank you Don. 2017 was a special year for our Tools & Storage business, including expansion of operating margins, while delivering 9% organic growth and 19% total growth. This translates to $1.4 billion in growth with approximately half coming from organic initiatives and half from acquisitions, an accomplishment that used to take years rather than months to achieve. ", "We delivered market leading innovation, quality, and commercial excellence, and as such we are recognized with vendor awards from the largest customers across every channel and every geography. We expanded our exclusive FlexVolt system which offers the user the power of corded with the freedom of cordless. This innovation spearheaded and accelerated dual growth across corded products, 20 volt cordless products and across the FlexVolt range itself. ", "The Volt was the only provider with growth across corded products as well as low and high voltage cordless products concurrently. Our stable of brands continued to perform well on a global basis. With Stanley Black & Decker, MAC Tools all up single digits, while [Turdo], Vidmar and DeWALT all expanded double digits. All of this occurred in consort with a successful integration of our second and fourth largest acquisition in our history, namely Irwin, Lenox, and Craftsman. ", "To close the book on 2017, we delivered growth across every region, every channel, every strategic business unit and with all of our top customers. We integrated a complex carve-out in dual tools and build Craftsman from the ground up, all concurrent with delivery of our largest organic growth year in history. ", "Looking to 2018 and as I Jim mentioned earlier, I\u2019m also pleased to provide an update on our plans for the Craftsman brand going forward. During our October earnings call, we provided an update on the development of our Craftsman distribution strategy. That update included confirmation that Ace, we\u2019d support Craftsman across the hardware channel, and Lowes would support Craftsman across the home center channel.", "As we continue to develop and fine tune the strategy, we are pleased to confirm that we will also make Craftsman available via Amazon. With support from leading companies like Lowes, Ace and Amazon, we expect to make Craftsman available to far more users than any time in its 90 year history. Overall the support of the iconic Craftsman brand today is overwhelming. ", "Now I will turn the call back to Jim to wrap up today\u2019s presentation. ", "Jim Loree", "Thanks Jeff and great year, lots of exciting news and for the total company in summary 2017 was another strong year of execution and financial performance. And just to reflect one last time, 7% organic growth, 7% contribution from acquisitions, a 40 basis points expansion in operating margin rate, a record 14.8% and 14% EPS expansion. ", "We reshaped the portfolio with divestiture with mechanical security, purchase of new tools and the Craftsman brand and these transaction as Jeff said are on track and some of the exciting benefits from them are just on the horizon. And \u201918 is shaping up to be another strong year with 5% organic growth, 11% to 14% EPS growth and we are encouraged by the many, many organic growth catalyst across the company catalyzed by SFS 2.0 and a great execution team and also arising through our recent acquisitions. ", "And I\u2019d like to thank my senior management team, our 57,000 associates and all our stakeholders including the investment community for your strong support as I reflect back on 2017, my first full year as CEO. Our deep and agile leadership team along with our entire employee base remains focused, committed and supportive as we tackle 2018 to deliver strong, above market organic growth, with operating leverage and continue to successfully integrate these acquisitions and generate strong free cash flow. ", "And additionally, we are energized, our team is energized by our company\u2019s purpose for those who make the world to achieve our 2022 vision and to strife to become known as one of the world\u2019s leading innovators to deliver top quartile financial performance and to elevate our commitment support with social responsibility. And Dennis we are now ready for Q&A.", "Dennis Lange", "Great. Thanks Jim. Shannon we can now open the call to Q&A please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may begin. ", "Rich Kwas", "Jim on Craftsman first of all, can you shed any light on timing. How we should think about this as the rollout in terms of timing. And then second, Don I didn\u2019t see anything with regards to FX assumptions within the guidance and then which are comfort level with commodity cost at 150 that\u2019s unchanged from what you talked about November and metals prices have gone up here recently, so just some additional thoughts there. Thanks. ", "Jim Loree", "On Craftsman there\u2019s a lot of variables on Craftsman. It\u2019s interesting when you think about Craftsman, we brought a brand and maybe like three people along with it, and the work that the team has been doing and consumed for the last year or so is an incredible execution project, multi-dimensional etcetera. The relationships as Jeff pointed out are going extremely well. On the commercial side, the supply chain is going extremely well and frankly we are super excited about it, as I am sure you can appreciate it. As for timing I\u2019m going ask Jeff to comment on that, because he\u2019s managing all these, juggling all these cause at the same time here. And I\u2019ll turn it over to you for a moment there Jeff on that one. ", "Jeff Ansell", "Thanks Jim. The answer to the question, we\u2019ve built a dedicated Craftsman team and split them up so that the core business continues to accelerate even while we build Craftsman from the ground up. So we are developing all the new products to go with the brand that we acquired, and until that is complete we really can\u2019t affectively do capacity planning, which is just beginning as we speak. ", "While we are committed to launching Craftsman in the second half of the year, customer roll-on plans will be dependent on completion of the customer demand plans along with our capacity plans to ensure supply. As stated earlier the support of this iconic brand is overwhelming, and our teams engage to support as much demand as soon as possible. However, we\u2019re just clear at this point that we will have greater demand than supply in 2018. ", "Jim Loree", "I\u2019ll take the second question that Rich tuck in there. On the commodity side of 150 million at this stage that would be representative of current prices. But our view is that would impact our P&L. We\u2019re like always we do contingency planning and we\u2019re focused on if another 30 million or 50 million of commodity inflation came our way, how would we react. So that is factored in to our top process and we are continuously planning. ", "The FX question for a long time it was a modest negative. It slipped to a modest positive in particular because of what\u2019s happened with the euro and the pound and it strengthened against the US dollar. So we have seen a little bit of an offset in emerging markets where the dollar has strengthened against some of the key emerging market currencies. But right now it\u2019s, day to day or week to week it\u2019s kind of swinging between the net positive and a net negative. So relatively minor impact at this stage and that\u2019s really something we\u2019re calling out as a major assumption or guidance. But clearly it\u2019s something we continue to focus on for contingency planning. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. You may begin. ", "Michael Rehaut", "I also just wanted to hit on a couple of short questions if possible. First in terms of the guidance, focusing on the share outstanding and the amount of free cash flow conversion, obviously you announced the acquisition which would take a portion of that. But I was wondering around your thoughts on share repurchase, is that something that you do on and off, and with the strong free cash flow in 2018 absent, any additional acquisitions. Is that something that we should be thinking about as you get in to the year end? And then just secondly on Craftsman, when should we expect sort of a shift towards insourcing some of the production that could cause a lift to the margins in that sales bucket. ", "Jim Loree", "Sure. It\u2019s Jim, I\u2019ll take the first question and I\u2019ll ask Don to tackle the second one, and you may get a little color from Jeff about that. So on repurchase; let\u2019s just jump a kind of a little more in altitude to capital allocation in general. And over the courses, as long as Don Allan, Jeff Ansell and I have been part of this company, we\u2019ve had a capital allocation strategy, and giving 50% of our excess capital back to shareholders and then taking the other 50% and reinvesting it. And when you look at the dividend today is running a little over $300 million. Again we\u2019re throwing off 1 billion and that\u2019s a growing number now. ", "So there\u2019s definitely, when you look at that long term framework, there\u2019s definitely room for repurchase and we historically have repurchased and we\u2019ve done at times when we thought the stock was severely undervalued in general and occasionally we\u2019ve also from time to time used it to manage the share count to kind of a neutral as employee benefit types of dilution occurred or also when we have significant stock price increases and that might create some additional share count. ", "So we\u2019ve done all of that, but I think right now, with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made and recently now another 440 million in the pipeline that is really, really strong in the acquisition area. In fact we\u2019re executing integrations as effectively and quickly as we can in order to begin to create some organizational bandwidth for bringing some more acquisitions on. ", "So with all that going on, repurchases are fairly low on our list of capital allocation priorities. But that could change. We think of that over the long term and then we operate tactically in the short term based on a myriad of different observations and considerations. And so with that I\u2019ll turn it over my colleagues here. ", "Don Allan", "I\u2019ll start and just remind people of what we\u2019ve said in that past about Craftsman and pulling that in to our supply chain and our manufacturing plants, and then I\u2019ll let Jeff give a little more color around what we\u2019re thinking over the next few years. But since what we\u2019ve said, that really would be kind of a three year program of insourcing a large amount of these Craftsman products in to our, not all of them, but a large amount of them in to our manufacturing and supply chain, and it would be something a bit of a gradual impact over that three year time horizon.", "Jeff commented this morning that we still have a lot of work to do around capacity planning and we\u2019re in the process of doing that. So we don\u2019t have all the answer to it, but we do believe it will be a multi-year transition period. But Jeff why don\u2019t you put out a little more color on that?", "Jeff Ansell", "So if you consider what we have to do in the core business, side by side with that we are doing concurrently in the fastening business, we\u2019ll launch about a thousand new products at our core business every year and we\u2019ll make about 85% of all those products that we sell around the world. So we are the most innovative tool company in the world and also we make the highest percentage of what we stock. ", "That won\u2019t change and it can\u2019t change because our core business have to continue to perform well. Concurrent with that we have to bring up several thousand Craftsman products. So imagine this, we launch a thousand products at our core, we have to launch 2000 Craftsman product around at the same time, and we\u2019re capable of doing that. ", "At the same time, we want to repatriate Craftsman manufacturing as much as possible for United States. So we made an acquisition in 2017 of the pre-eminent metal tool manufacturing Waterloo that is a dedicated Craftsman manufacturing facility which is one of the things we committed to. So we will bring up that manufacturing of Craftsman products. We will make more than half of those products in year one, and we\u2019ll make probably more than half of these products in United States year one. ", "But as Don said, it will take probably a 36 month period before we can get to the point where we are making the same percentage of the Craftsman product as we make in our core. But I think over a three year period we can certainly get there and we can repatriate much of that to the US to stand behind the Craftsman Brand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. You may begin. ", "Chris Belfiore", "This is Chris for Steve. Just kind of back to the Craftsman topic, originally you guys have said that it was going to generate a $100 million of incremental sales every year. I\u2019m just kind of curious, like with a lot that\u2019s going on in this year\u2019s brand, clothing stores, how do you guys think about that number now in terms of the expectations going forward?", "Jim Loree", "We still feel like the opportunity is very significant. It\u2019s very difficult to gauge at this stage any change that we should make to that assumption. That assumption was based on what we believe are very reasonable factors. As we get deeper in to this tiny process that Jeff just described a few minutes ago, things will come to life when we indicate how quickly this ramp will go. But we are at a very early stage of this process and so at this point we are not looking to change anything around those assumptions. But as we get deeper and as those roll up, and when Amazon goes online at some point at this stage, we\u2019ll probably provide an updated view on what we think the Craftsman brand will do. But it\u2019s far too early. We\u2019re sitting in January to really alter those assumptions. ", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may begin.", "Tim Wojs", "Nice job on Q4 and \u201917. I guess just turning may be to the margins a little bit. I was worried if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on just the cadence within the tools business just given the price cost headwinds maybe in the first quarter and then how should we think about tools margins as you go through the year thanks. ", "Don Allan", "Sure. The first quarter clearly would be pressure because of that 50 million of kind of net to price commodity cost segment I mentioned. So for the tools business you will see a rate decline year-over-year in the first quarter because of that. And we also had an outstanding first quarter last year from a rate perspective for tools, and so you have a difficult comp and then you have this dynamic I just described. So it will be down a little bit year-over-year because of that. ", "But as the year progresses, you\u2019ll see that get better and better and probably modestly down in the second quarter, and the it will start to show improvement year-over-year in the third and the fourth quarter. And it\u2019s really because of that dynamic of commodity, inflation, hitting us pretty hard in the first half without the price recovery not coming until the later stages of the second quarter and back half of the year. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Redner with Bellman & Associates. You may begin. ", "Scott Redner", "My question was on the mid-teens POS noted at your large retailers in Tools & Storage, so for everyone to answer that. It seems like that that\u2019s been a little slower than the prior quarters. So just curious if you guys could provide some context there, whether there was significant comp last year or kind of how you guys are thinking about that relative to the optimistic commentary. ", "Don Allan", "What I said was mid-single digit POS, not mid-teens, although we would love mid-teens, but it was mid-single digits. And I look at POS, you can\u2019t really go crazy analyzing it quarter-by-quarter, you have to look at it over a multi-quarter period of time. And if you look at the North American business because I was commenting about POS and North America for certain customers, it was a little bit lower than the performance in North America, a couple of points. However, when you look at it over the entire year, it\u2019s very much in line with the performance of our revenue performance for North America versus the POS for the year. ", "So that\u2019s the best way to look at. The other thing to remember is that we had really strong performance outside of some of our retailers in North America in the fourth quarter, low double digit performance in the commercial channel. So you have to keep that in mind as well, that\u2019s really pushing that number up in a positive way. ", "So truly those two factors, and again like we mentioned before, quarter-to-quarter POS is an important statistic to look at, but its more about the trend that you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re experiencing over multi quarters. And Jeff is going to answer on that. ", "Jeff Ansell", "In addition I would say we look at this, as Don said over a four quarter and time a rolling four quarter basis. And when looked at that way you can see clearly we\u2019ve outgrown the market 2x. And the other feedback that we\u2019ve received is from the customers the largest of our top 10 customers; we received Vendor of the Year Award because our POS would outpace their overall growth in the category. So what that would tell me is that POS is greater than the market, it\u2019s greater than our largest customers, and weeks of supply are in line with prior year. So that says the things that we\u2019re putting are going through the other end of the process in POS and we feel very good about global POS in total as much as we can gather. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. You may begin. ", "Josh Pokrzywinski", "On the Craftsman commentary and Don not really deviating off that $100 million of incremental revenue a year. I guess as I look at your organic growth guidance and the EPS associated with that it seems like incremental margins knowing that raw material are different line items are a little light versus where you\u2019d be historically. If I assume that 100 million comes in at virtually no profitability, it still seems like it\u2019s at league average or not. Is there an indication that as Craftsman ramps up this year that the launch cost chips away that profitability in a more material way or I guess just kind of help us bridge how that base incremental margin looks a little lighter than usual. ", "Don Allan", "I think the best way to think about it is that, the leverage that we put in our guidance has a couple of factors in it. Clearly one is, when you\u2019re describing there\u2019s a little bit of launch cost and the cost associated with Craftsman that has to be factored in in to that at lower profitability, and they certainly will be nice component of our organic growth in 2018. ", "The other thing to consider is that we have been on a steady program of investing for future growth in general as a company. And so as we get growth organically, we look at what investments we want to make in certain areas to continue to drive this growth over the mid-term and long term. And so therefore the leverage numbers you see are a little bit lower because of that as well. So it\u2019s really those two factors that are driving that dynamic that you\u2019re describing. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Wood with Nomura Instinet. You may begin. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Mason on for Mike. Can you give us an update on FlexVolt sales, how many FlexVolt skews have now been rolled out and what are the initial number of FlexVolt product expected in 2018?", "Jim Loree", "As I indicated in my presentation, I\u2019ll kick this over to Jeff for additional commentary. We were in line with our expectation for FlexVolt. FlexVolt will be a contributor to our guidance next year in our organic growth at 5% in the company, and it continues to be a very positive performer for us. I\u2019ll as Jeff to give a little more color on that. ", "Jeff Ansell", "Yes, we couldn\u2019t be happier with FlexVolt performance. If you look at the adoption rate, it\u2019s still running at about 10x in terms of speed of adoption versus key technologies like brushless, which are fantastic. So that\u2019s a great endorsement of what it does for the user. At this point we average about 4.9 stars on ratings around the world and that\u2019s 18 months or 15 months in to the process. That\u2019s the highest ratings we\u2019ve ever achieved. So tremendous reviews, and what we\u2019ve seen occur is as I kind of intimated in my remarks that we\u2019ve seen our coated product that we make where we sell, which is a differentiator for us. We\u2019ve seen that up mid-single digits, as the category was down about mid-single digits. ", "Our 20 volt range has grown faster than any time in history. At the same time, FlexVolt itself has grown dramatically. So if you add those three things together it says that there is a cannibalization to us there may be in the market, but its someone else\u2019s cannibalization. ", "We launched key new products in the fourth quarter and the second half of last year. Things like cordless FlexVolt compressor that is revolutionary, its doing incredibly well, our new FlexVolt worm drive style saw that is absolutely converting corded products for the first time in history to cordless, with more follow in 2018. ", "The point I would make there though is, as we continue to launch FlexVolt, we will launch more and more industrial products as we can get more and more output and capacitites from these products. But if you consider the fact that in the last year putting our FlexVolt batteries in to market to drive cross country a 150 times if it were an electric car, we are incredibly proud of what FlexVolt has done for us. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. You may begin. ", "Rob Wertheimer", "Question is on 4Q margin Tools & Storage, and obviously you guys have got a lot going on under the (inaudible). Sequentially maybe it was a little bit lighter that we might have thought and you got commodity, and I wanted to ask if commodity was the driver of that. If there\u2019s any excess freights, any production tangles or just inefficiencies some extreme growth here seen or whether it\u2019s just an investment?", "Jim Loree", "We were very pleased with the margin performance of Tools, as I mentioned 50 basis points improvement year-over-year, an incredibly strong organic growth. However, there\u2019s a little bit of pressure on the margins for some of those things you mentioned. Commodity inflation continues to be something that we experienced in the fourth quarter that rolled on to this year with really no price recovery in the fourth quarter. And then I would say that was modest rate increases associated with the high levels of organic growth, but nothing that really dramatically moved the needle in the business. But I think the major factor was more in the commodity (inaudible).", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Market. You may begin. ", "Ken Zener", "The cannibalization, I think that\u2019s the most incremental piece of information you\u2019ve communicated today beyond your execution, might I say that. Well FlexVolt, if you\u2019re growing to walk it almost means you are extending your brand awareness and your product is other people envelop your portfolio tools not someone else\u2019s. Why do you think and Jeff you gave us these numbers. But why do you think that\u2019s happening, why didn\u2019t you anticipate it, and most importantly what are the implications as you continue to kind of drive core battery in to what have been corded and/or what will be (inaudible) eventually. ", "Jim Loree", "The FlexVolt program has been a tremendous brand development and brand halo that had an effect on what was already an amazingly strong brand in the professional but guaranteed tough kind of segment, and plus it just takes it to another level. So that\u2019s one thing. I think the second thing is, and I\u2019ve said this before the installed base that we\u2019re developing of batteries that work on 60 volt to FlexVolt tools and 20 volt tools. ", "The FlexVolt battery obviously works on \u2013 is backwards compatible for the 20 volt. So when you start to develop this installed base of batteries and all of a sudden you have the functionality, the user has the functionality to be able to run the tool effectively three times longer of a 20 volt tool that is a real kind of value driver and value proposition advantage for FlexVolt. ", "So I think that was sort of one of the things that we wondered how effective that impact would be. And I think what we\u2019re finding out is it\u2019s probably very, very significant. That\u2019s my (inaudible) and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff and see if you have anything more you want to add to that. ", "Jeff Ansell", "If you back in time to when Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s came together, you would look at the volt which was a fantastic brand franchise that probably believe was in a period of decline given the technology change where it offered (inaudible) and the world had moved to lithium. ", "Fast forward to where we are today and a couple of stats for you. We now make the volt in the United States which the competitors cannot do in power tools. We expanded that the volt brand promise to tremendous hand tools to storage products, lasers, all great products. We introduced our lithium ion answer in 2011 and \u201912 and a stat that you wouldn\u2019t be aware of; we\u2019re now three times bigger than lithium that we ever were at our peak in [non-caths]. So that is an awesome statement. ", "We\u2019ve introduced brushless at the same time. Brushless is now bigger than [non-cath] ever was. And on top of that we\u2019ve improved our reliability, highest reliability in the industry, greatest number of innovations and excellence going on top of that, and you\u2019re seeing what happens. The user who always loved the volt now has so many more reasons to love, embrace and endorse it, and we\u2019re seeing the level commitment to the volt has never been higher and we\u2019re pleased with that. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. You may begin. ", "David MacGregor", "If I could just pick up for a clarification on Ken\u2019s question, I wanted to ask another question on FlexVolt. But regarding the cannibalization are we at a point where you can assume that the FlexVolt growing forward is largely incremental or is there a reason to believe that cannibalizations could be a future threat and emerge in some of the future points.", "And my question more on the margins was, the FlexVolt is running below tool segment average, is that due to launch cost and heavier promotional expense etcetera. And once we get beyond the large percentage margins on FlexVolt or expected to exceed the segment average or is this line expected to be at or below segment average margins for the foreseeable future. ", "Jim Loree", "I\u2019ll give the margins question to Don, but the way I\u2019m thinking about FlexVolt at this point, it\u2019s going to be a steady contributor to our organic growth as time goes on, and at this point it\u2019s hard to really understand FlexVolt, versus 20 volt, versus (inaudible) and what are all the dynamics other than we know what\u2019s already been said which is, it\u2019s a positive mix of effects and in that regard I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a real catalyst for above market organic growth for Stanley Black & Decker\u2019s and for (inaudible).", "Don Allan", "On the margin question on FlexVolt, I would say that we did have that period of time where we were below line average. It probably extended a little longer than originally projected because some of the investments we were making in our marketing in particular to really make sure that people understood the technology and how tactful it is and clearly some of the comments you\u2019re hearing from Jim and Jeff would indicate that added the chase. ", "So as we go in to 2018, we would expect it to be right around line average margins and it\u2019s not something that would be negative to the margin or a dramatic positive at this stage. ", "Operator", "This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks. ", "Dennis Lange", "Shannon thanks. We\u2019d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call. Obviously please contact me if you have any further questions.
