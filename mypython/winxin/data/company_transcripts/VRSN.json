And welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Just a reminder that this conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO and George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There you will also find our third quarter 2015 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow. We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million net new names ending with 135.2 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.", "Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million. As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs toward the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.", "I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year, as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations.", "In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.", "During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. Also due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter, as was seen in the last two years.", "Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names.", "As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $154 million, up 10.7% from $139 million in the third quarter of 2014.", "The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1%, compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $92 million, compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year, compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year.", "As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally.", "Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.", "I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014.", "Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014.", "Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on our weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on $138.1 million and $133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.", "Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million respectively for the third quarter last year.", "Also as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.055 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.", "Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given our last call.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means. I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performance since the completion of our divestures five years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation.", "Since then, revenue has grown sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $612 million over the trailing four quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter. Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period, and in that same timeframe, we returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders triggered by that special dividend.", "Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital. We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top line and bottom line, along with the consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure are what matter most to our shareholders.", "We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework: protect, grow and manage is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency.", "We'll now take your questions and Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, thanks very much. Would love to get some color on the acceleration that we saw in growth in domain names, 9.2 million new. That's a number \u2013 I don't know the last time we saw a number that high. And you mentioned Asia, but maybe you could give us a little bit more color on, maybe what might have drove that strength?", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "Sure, Steve. This is George Kilguss. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did see 1.68 million net additions to the domain name base and as you pointed out, there were 9.2 million gross additions in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we saw continued strength in additions coming out of international markets, particularly Asia. Now that region includes markets such as China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, et cetera, and all those regions we've seen good growth in those regions.", "We also mentioned that while we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we also believe that the pace of activity we saw in the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. We did give guidance of 1.1 million to 1.6 million. The midpoint of that is about 1.35 million. If you recall, last year we did about 700,000 names in Q4 2014. So we do expect to have good net adds in the fourth quarter.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And so there was not promotional activity by registrars or anything out of the norm during the period in the Asian markets?", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "When you say out of the norm, I mean registrars do run promotional activities. I believe there is a few registrars that do some around certain holidays. But in most of our marketing programs, we put those in place throughout the year. So we continue to have a consistent level of spend or activity in those markets, but nothing unusual that I'm aware of from a marketing perspective.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Sorry. I would just add to that that nothing extraordinary and I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't just underlie George's comments with the fact that com is just a strong brand and it typically performs well and we see it continue to do so.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And just my last question is on the renewal rates, you projecting them to maybe go down a little bit to 71.8% in the fourth quarter. What \u2013 can you give us some color on what might be causing that to go down a little bit?", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "Yeah. So it's relatively flat year-over-year, Steve. We had 72% last year at this time, 71.8%, so we're talking about 20 basis points. But really the renewal rate is speaking to the registrations that were registered a year ago. We are seeing a little lower tick in the first-time renewal rate, but again that's more as we shift geographies and sell more into what we've talked about emerging markets, international markets, some of those markets have lower first-time renewal rates. But which have improved during the year, but at least quarter \u2013 year-over-year, we expect it to go \u2013 to be flat. But it \u2013 seasonally it tends to go down a little bit in the third quarter based on our historical activity.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Moving on, we'll go next to Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. It's actually Mina Confit (17:07) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have two questions and I just got disconnected. So if you answered them in the meantime, I apologize. The first one is about the new domain name registrations. You had 9.2 million this quarter, which I think is the strongest in the recent quarters. So could you maybe talk a little bit about what might have been the driver for that? And also I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what kind of contribution we should see from the IDNs, if you have any updates on that. Thank you.", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "Sure. So, as far as the strong adds in the quarter. Again, we saw good activity coming out of international markets, primarily Asia, but those markets I talked about earlier, China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam. We've seen growth in all those markets. So, we're very pleased with that growth over there. It seems to accelerate in the quarter. We're having a good month-to-date as well over there. So, we'll monitor that activity, but we've been \u2013 we guided up for the fourth quarter versus last year. We're guiding 1.1 million to 1.6 million, but good demand out of the Asia region is what we're seeing over there.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Great. And this is Jim. If I can just answer the second part of your question or your second question about IDNs. So, the news this quarter is that we are on track to begin a rollout and launch before the end of the year. I think it's early at this point to speculate about how they'll perform or provide any sort of guidance or revenue forecasts.", "I will say that I think when we're talking to you a quarter from now, obviously the beginning of the rollout with the first IDN or IDNs at that time will give us some things to talk to you about and I'm sure when we're talking about Q1, 2015, by then, we'll actually have been in market. We'll be beyond rollout, we'll be in market and we'll certainly have more data for you or more to talk about then. So, early now, to speculate about any of those things. I think the important news is that we're on track and we're still tracking on our commitment of last quarter to begin our rollout before the end of the calendar year in 2015. That answered your questions?", "Unknown Speaker", "Yes. Okay. Thank you.", "David Atchley - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel at Topeka Capital Markets.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "Hi guys. So just a follow-up to the last question. When you say begin the roll out, do I take that to mean some will be out by the end of the year but not all? And as a follow-on to that question, how should we think about it in \u2013 or how do you guys think about it in terms of prioritizing the timing IDN by IDN?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Thanks, Fred. Yeah, so I think the first part of your question had an implicit assumption that is correct, that we are rolling them out in some sequence. I don't want to say that we're certainly not rolling them all out at the same time. And I don't want to say that we're going to roll them out one after the other individually and have 11 separate rollouts. There is going to be a phased rollout that's based on our preparations, market analysis, readiness, ICANN process, a lot of different factors that will go into that. What we do know for certain is that we will begin with the \u2013 with at least one IDN before the end of the year.", "So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There is a \u2013 an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into the store early, so to speak. But that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least one. I think that's the only thing I can say comfortably without speculating, in-market. So we will be selling and there should be activity and we should be learning and we'll have more to talk about when we do talk about Q1 certainly. More to talk about after Q4, but a lot more to talk about after Q1.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "Can you give us an update on what's going on with the .brand marketplace?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Well, I can give you a general high level update there. There were some delays associated with .brands in particular, as ICANN recognized that .brands had needs that were different beyond what ICANN had originally anticipated, different needs as opposed to those who are getting into the business of selling domain names. So, some contractual issues were worked on between the brand community and ICANN and additional time was given to the brands, I believe.", "I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engaged in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions, but we haven't seen a lot of them out in the market yet, but some of them have certainly announced their intentions to roll out their brand TLD. So, they're not visible. It's not that active, but there was some, quite a bit of activity, mostly contract signing with brands. So I would expect that next year you'll see some .brands in the market.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "And is it still your sense that they're likely to opt for .brand as a complement to dot.com, as opposed to a replacement?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "I certainly think so. I think there are a lot of different ways to think about this, but there's just so much investment in the brand in the .com registration for most of these large brands. I think to use a metaphor that may not be exactly perfect, but I think will give you the idea. If you had a telephone number that you had invested heavily for years extensively in creating awareness for people to \u2013 call you and order your product and you \u2013 a different number became available and you opted for that. If it costs you $7.85 a year to continue to forward your old number to your new one, you'd do that for as long as you have any number of people calling it. But there are in some cases of these global brands, an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So, it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it.", "So this is, I think you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people who get a .brand to abandon their .com. They're certainly not going to do that, it is their brand. It's inexpensive for them, and there is a heavy investment in branding and traffic. So, I expect it to be either an experiment or a complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But, I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .coms. I just don't think that's going to happen.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "Okay, last question from me. Can you give us an update on your initiatives with security services, most notably DNS firewalls and DDoS?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Well, DDoS is one of the products that has been around for a while and is a main contributor to the product sales in our security services unit. The DNS firewall is new, still a bit early to really talk at any level of detail or sort of any generalized trends that we see. The reception is certainly good in the market, I'll say that. And, overall, the security services unit continues to grow, not at the point where we're reporting it separately, of course, but it is growing. And, we'll have more to say about that when it gets to a point where we can.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Sure.", "Operator", "And, we'll go next to Priya Parasuraman with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you, this is for Gray Powell. Just a question on the operating margins, which are strong this quarter. Any color on that? And, do you have any increases baked in for the new IDN launch expenses in your guidance?", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "So Priya, your first question was on the operating margin. Again, our operating expense for the quarter was $99 million. And if you look year-ago, that was about $101 million. So it's not \u2013 it's been around $100 million for a while. When I look sequentially of changes, there is really nothing that jumps out at me, per se, in our core. We had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel. In our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially, if you look at the year-to-date nine-month period, it's relatively flat. There's really a timing of when we rolled expenses out. We rolled them out \u2013 those programs a little earlier this year than previous year. So you have some inter-quarter variances. But overall year-to-date from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track.", "R&D we're down a little bit. We've optimized some of our spend in our R&D area and we have a slight head count decrease. And then G&A, we had some legal expenses increase. But overall, if you read on our 10-Q, we expect those major categories to be consistent over the next quarter or so with what we've just rolled out there or just produced.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "And I would just add to that, with respect to the comments that I made earlier. There isn't a specific focus on the operating margin, per se, by itself. The operating margin is a fairly consistent trend line, if you draw it over the last five years or the 20 quarters, moving slowly and steadily in a positive direction. And it's \u2013 the real focus for us is that it allows us to move the important trend lines of top-line revenue and profit forward and pursue our long-term strategy. I think those are really the important issues. There are always gives and takes, as George said, but again, from a $102 million the year-ago quarter to $99 million this year, I think is roughly equivalent in our view and allows us to continue the trend lines that we're really focused on.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then one more, if I may. Any thoughts on seasonality for domain name growth? Looking out towards 2016, I know it's early but I was curious if you think the international growth might skew the seasonality somewhat for 2016?", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "Well, we'll give you guidance next quarter on our views on 2016, Priya. We can just tell you, if you look at this year, clearly Q1 was a strong quarter from a net adds perspective and Q3 clearly was \u2013 Q2 tends to be a little bit lower because of how the deletes come into the base with a lot of the strong adds in Q1 with a 45-day grace period. It tends to slightly increase deletes a little bit in the second quarter. And then the fourth quarter, December has a lot of holidays in the month and globally a lot of countries take holidays off. So, December tends to be a short month for us, and so we tend to see the fourth quarter seasonally be a little lower sequentially than third quarter. But we'll give you some more color on our views on 2016 next quarter.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Walter Pritchard at Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup", "Hi. Thanks. George, I'm wondering if you can talk about from a sales and marketing perspective on those expenses were probably the area that your OpEx was the lightest versus what we were looking for and I see you did have good strength in names. Did you make a trade-off there in terms of sort of marketing programs that you peeled back during the quarter as you saw the strength? And generally how should we think about the level of sales and marketing, especially marketing spend as we go into Q4 and into early next year?", "George E. Kilguss - CFO, Principal Accounting Officer & SVP", "Yeah. Thanks, Walter. So, there was no conscious effort to pull any programs. As I mentioned earlier to a caller, if you look at the nine-month year-to-date expense in sales and marketing, it's relatively flat. We did this year roll some expenses \u2013 I'm sorry, roll some programs out a little earlier in the year. So, a little bit frontloaded. If you look at it on a quarterly basis, we had slightly higher sales and marketing in Q1 and Q2. It's just kind of how it fell this year. We constantly evaluate our programs, but they seem to be performing well. As far as Q4, we expect the expense in sales and marketing to be consistent with what it was this quarter.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We have no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any concluding remarks. Sir?", "David Atchley - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference and again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on VeriSign's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm David Atchley, Corporate Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. I'm here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; and John Calys, Vice President, Interim CFO and Controller; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Naming Services.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.verisigninc.com.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we again saw a record number of new registrations at 8.9 million while adding 2.86 million net names, finishing the quarter with 116.7 million names in the domain name base. ", "In our NIA business, we again saw strong bookings growth. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.35 billion in cash. ", "During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $68.4 million. We have approximately $763 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization program, which have no expiration. ", "We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "While basic shares outstanding stayed essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, our diluted share count, which is used for our diluted EPS calculation, increased in the first quarter. The main driver of this increase was dilution from our convertible bonds. As in the first and second quarters of 2011, we see dilution from our convertible bonds when our average stock price for the quarter is over the current conversion price of $34.37. These shares represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued. John will provide more details on the share count and its impact during his comments.", "On March 27, ICANN posted for public comment on their website the renewal terms for the .com Registry Agreement negotiated between VeriSign and ICANN. The terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com Registry Agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, aligning it with the other 5 largest gTLD registry agreements including the .net agreement. Regarding ICANN's new gTLD program, VeriSign applied directly for 14 new gTLDs, 12 of these 14 are transliterations of .com and .net. ", "Also, applicants for approximately 220 new gTLDs selected VeriSign to provide back-end registry services. It is still early in the process to determine what impact these applications will have on our revenue.", "Depending on ICANN's pace for processing and approving these applications, revenue from new gTLDs is not expected before 2013 and is not expected to be material in 2013. We expect more details will be available when ICANN posts information regarding the new gTLDs for which applications were received. We expect that announcement in May.", "Also, as announced today, VeriSign named George E. Kilguss, III as CFO effective May 14. George brings over 25 years of solid financial experience to VeriSign. Most recently, he has been serving as CFO at Internap and has been CFO of 3 public companies. We look forward to introducing you to George on the next earnings call.", "Also, John will continue with the company as Vice President and Controller. I would like to thank John for his service as Interim CFO since last September.", "I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 116.7 million at the end of March. This represents an 8.1% increase year-over-year in the base and a 2.5% increase quarter-over-quarter.", "In the first quarter, we added 2.86 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 8.9 million new registrations, or a 7.7% increase in new registrations over the same period 1 year ago. The first quarter was a strong quarter on record for new registrations.", "Internet adoption, e-commerce and online advertising continued to be drivers of our Registry business growth. Some of the first quarter strength was driven by 2 favorable factors: first, we saw improvement in the economics for domain name monetization; secondly, we saw some of our registrar customers have more success with their marketing programs during the quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 renewal rate was 73.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2012 will be approximately 74.3%.", "We expect the second quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.2 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. ", "Our NIA business continues to perform well and exceeded its bookings target in the first quarter of 2012. With the NIA team in place, we're continuing to execute. More importantly, we continue to focus on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality revenue and stable growth.", "Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Calys", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jim explained, we're pleased to be announcing another solid quarter. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 51.9%. These results drove approximately $101 million in the first quarter of free cash flow. Of our total cash and investment balance, about $245 million was domestic as of March 31, 2012. ", "Let me recap our performance for the first quarter on our key operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.", "Revenue of $206 million for the first quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $783 million, a $55 million increase from year end. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 51.9% compared to 50.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. ", "Jim mentioned earlier that we applied directly for 14 new gTLDs. 13 of these applications occurred during the first quarter, which added $2.4 million of operating expense. The first quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and other ways to improve our operating margin. ", "Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $68 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2011. ", "With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 163 million shares in the first quarter, compared to 160 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 2.5 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings presentation detailing the dilution calculation related to the convertible debentures.", "Operating cash flow was $110 million for the first quarter compared to $90 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $101 million for the first quarter of 2012, given $4 million in excess tax benefits and $13 million in capital expenditures for the quarter. ", "We saw solid performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 will be in the range of $870 million to $890 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. We gave a range of $865 million to $890 million on the last call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be a net expense of approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are still expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business, in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. ", "I will now turn the call back to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, John. Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on our areas of focus for 2012. During the remainder of the year, we are focused on the following 5 areas: one, continue providing unparalleled Registry Services and network performance; two, continue to work with ICANN and the Department of Commerce towards a smooth renewal of our .com agreement; three, continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; four, as a post-restructuring next phase, focused on value creation for new services in our core business, factoring Q1, we've taken concrete steps to accelerate identification, testing and development of innovative new core services; five, and of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for the Internet infrastructure, which we operate. ", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "John, I'm wondering maybe on the guidance, the 1.8 million to 2.2 million. If I look at that versus your guidance 1 year ago, it's actually less than 1 year ago, and yet, the first quarter is running modestly ahead of what you're adds for next -- 1 year ago. So I'm just wondering, do you see something in the base or in the trends at the end of the quarter there that suggests that Q1 was more of an anomaly, and Q1 transact to a lower growth rate?", "John Calys", "That's a good question, Walter. I don't know that we see anything exiting the quarter that makes first quarter look like an anomaly to us. I know our guidance last year for the same quarter was higher. I think our actual performance for second quarter last year was 1.95 million net adds. So I think, really, what we have is the seasonality that we've talked about in the past. First quarter is always a little bit stronger based on activities that the registrars do with marketing, as well as just kind of seasonal patterns in the business. Pat, I don't know if you have anything to add?", "Patrick S. Kane", "No, I think that's about all.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just second question, Jim, on the -- it sounds like more of an emphasis on the [indiscernible] services and so forth. Can you talk about what role M&A may play at all in that process of looking a little bit -- get a little bit more aggressive about diversifying the business or expanding into adjacent areas?", "D. James Bidzos", "Sure. I don't expect M&A to play any substantial role at all in that growth. This is consistent with what we've been messaging for the last few quarters that we're very much focused inward on innovative opportunities in our core business. This company has a lot of talent, a lot of great ideas. And what we're doing is making sure that there's a way to rapidly exploit them. So the M&A is not part of that plan. As I've always said, we have a product roadmap that we like. And we see M&A as some way to get there quicker. We consider that, but there's nothing on our radar.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Steve Ashley at Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In terms of the domain name activity, I was going to ask about promotional activity and I realize that, that's in 2 buckets. One is, promotion activity that you yourselves, VeriSign, have worked onto revenues involved and then there's the amount of activity in the field. I'm just wondering if you could comment on either of those? How it related to maybe normal or last year?", "D. James Bidzos", "As far as the programs that we run that are contra-revenue programs, I think we've talked about that in the past that on a full year basis, they're not a significant amount, but we do some each quarter. And usually, they're a little more weighted towards the first part of the year, especially first quarter. So there is a little bit of the impact on the top line for the first quarter of this year in that. Pat, I don't know if you got comments about registrar activity?", "Patrick S. Kane", "So basically, on the contra programs, they're intended to be performance-based programs. And so the performance-based programs that we've put in there, we're actually augmenting the activity of the registrar. And so we've actually found programs incentives that are actually driving additional units that usually been more productive than in the past, and the performance has been better than in the past.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Terrific. And then could you just comment maybe at the high level of how international versus domestic domain name growth might have looked in the period?", "Patrick S. Kane", "So we still have strength coming out of international. Largely, we're seeing growth from India, we're seeing growth from China, as well as Southeast Asia and Australia from international standpoint. But it still looks to be about a 40%-60% split from international to domestic.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Phil Winslow at Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just got a question on just kind of spending from here, especially on the sort of non-domain name businesses. I mean how do you feel with sort of the OpEx level that you're at right now in terms of sort of growing the revenue from here. Are you comfortable with that or do you think this actually needs more investment over time?", "John Calys", "We certainly think there's an opportunity to always manage and get more efficient from an OpEx standpoint, Phil. I don't think we foresee some type of significant increase based on what we've guided to exit the year on. We're not expecting an increase in OpEx levels relative to revenue. In fact, we're still anticipating some improvement through the end of this year.", "D. James Bidzos", "Phil, this is Jim. I guess if you're referring at all specifically to some of the innovation efforts that are going on the company -- going on in the company, I think it's fair to say that given the operational efficiencies that we continue to find and exploit as the company sort of gets adjusted to its new size. Remember, we've gone from over 5,000 to just over 1,000 employees in 4 years. That and just some small reallocation of expenses throughout the company, we're pretty comfortable. Give us what we need to fuel the innovation engineer and do the kind of R&D that we need to do. So I think it's something from the outside of the -- essentially difficult to notice.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was wondering, is it too early for you to tell in the gTLD program if any of the ones that you applied for were also applied for by others. In other words, could there be an auction or a need for increased investments to land some of those that you've applied for?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. So it is too early to tell. At some points, I can/will reveal what the applications were, and they have a process for dealing with duplicate applications. As of right now, we can't tell you what that is. The process is being adjusted as we speak. And for an up-to-minute -- up-to-the-minute update, I'll ask Pat to comment on that.", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, in terms of finding out when -- what additional top-level domains have been applied for beyond the ones that we have done. There's a process now that where the application system itself has to reopen at ICANN. It's been closed for a few days. And then after that happens, they will have a final submission and then there'll probably be a couple of weeks after that before ICANN announces. So it's kind of a moving target right now as to when that will occur. But we will certainly analyze it as soon as it opens up and identify where there are exact conflicts, where there will be conflicts that may create some end-user confusion, and we'll take a look at those as well.", "D. James Bidzos", "I think the original so-called reveal date for what strings were applied for was April 30. We expect that there'll be some short period of time beyond that before the actual new date is announced, which as Pat said, we expect to hear in a few days or so. Sometime in early May, we expect to know what strings were applied for. And at that point, any conflicts would be obvious, and as mentioned, ICANN has a process including an auction process to deal with competing bids and then that will play out at that time.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And there was an earlier question, I'm asking about timeshare revenue. I'm going to ask it this way, given the number of net adds that you had in the quarter, given the base of names that you had through the quarter, I think there's some of us that felt that the revenue would've been a little bit higher. So wondering, is it contra revenue business outside of the Naming business or something else that may have dampened top line by $1 million or $2 million or $3 million?", "John Calys", "Actually, I think from our standpoint, the top line was right about where we expected it internally. As far as the contra programs, there were no significant changes for the full year plan in 2012 versus 2011. There might have been a little bit more waiting in the first quarter, this year than last. But I don't think we expected something significantly different than what we're reporting.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question, Jim. If you mentioned it, then I missed it, and I apologize. But in your prepared remarks, you talked about as one of the goals adding additional services to capitalize on the infrastructure and the position that you've got. Is there something specific that you can share with us now that you're looking to innovate beyond the stuff that's already in Naming and the other parts of the existing business?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, it's no different than what we've talked about before. As I mentioned, there's a lot of talent and also a lot of ideas. And in fact, quite a bit of intellectual property here in the company. And I don't think we've worked as hard as we could have in the past to exploit it. So what the concrete steps that I referred to involve putting structures and people in place to make sure that we rapidly maximize our ability to exploit those ideas that we think can result in productive new innovative core services. So they are very much core services. I've mentioned in the past that we think that security is a very good place for us to focus. I don't think there's anybody anywhere on this planet that doesn't appreciate the need for cyber security. So that's the general area where we're looking to enhance our offerings. And that's probably as much as I can say right now.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Rob Owens at Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit about some of the success you're seeing in NIA and maybe some of the -- a little bit of color on the bookings there. It seemed like the deferred categories group better than I was expecting this quarter?", "John Calys", "As far as the deferred category, certainly, it was very strong. The growth in that really relates to the 2.86 million net adds and 8.9 new registrations that's driving deferred much more than anything from an NIA standpoint.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "So on that -- specifically there, are you seeing an extension in duration then in terms of some of those renewals or new names? Or are you still about 5 quarters on average?", "D. James Bidzos", "The average term length is about 5 quarters right now when we see with renewals.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Actually a pretty big change, I think, in long-term deferred if I'm not taken. Historical numbers.", "John Calys", "For the first quarter, I think, seasonally is always a strong increase in deferred for us. So -- but certainly much more than sequential quarter was -- last quarter.", "D. James Bidzos", "As John said, that's attributable to areas outside of NIA. But with respect to NIA, we set some bookings goals for them for the quarter that were in excess of the goals that we set last year. And they're exceeding those goals. So we're pleased with the process. We're not breaking out those numbers separately.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "If it were to achieve 10% of bookings, would you break it out separately?", "John Calys", "If NIA were to achieve -- if their revenue were to achieve 10% of total revenue, we would break it out separately under SEC reporting requirements. Yes.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And then second, how many names are up for renewal in Q2?", "Patrick S. Kane", "24.4 million.", "Operator", "Next, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Jaimin Soni.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just got a couple of quick questions. First, I wanted to ask about operating margins. In your guidance, you have about 100 basis points ramp through the year. As we exit the year, and I guess as you continue to get more efficient, is that where we can see more of the listed margins going forward? Or do you think you have room to invest more in some of the opportunities that Jim outlined earlier?", "D. James Bidzos", "Certainly, we see margin improvement through the end of the year as we've guided in the 52% to 54% range. And as we -- as I commented earlier, and we've spoken many times before in kind of our post-restructuring era here, we continue to work hard daily at finding opportunities to grow our margin, to get more efficient, to do things smarter and better. Obviously, we'll see in the revenue -- on the revenue line, we'll see the impact of the price increases that we did in January. And as you know, that kind of bleeds into the revenue line over about a 5-quarter period. So that gives you some even natural margin growth as well, that comes about from that. Beyond that, we obviously haven't provided guidance beyond the end of 2012. But we take very seriously that it's our job to run the business very efficiently and find ways to do things better and smarter all the time.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. Another -- just another follow-up on the net domain name ads. If I look at what you guys have guided last quarter for the year, it's at about 6% to 8% unit growth rate for net new names. Looking at what you have -- at the midpoint, guided to about 2 million for next quarter. And seeing the first half total net new name growth at about 1% to 2%, implies that the second half should really accelerate. Is that what we should think about for the second half of the year in terms of net new name growth?", "Patrick S. Kane", "No, I mean, the 2.5% is quarter-over-quarter, right? And so year-over-year, right now, we're at 8.1%. So you should see some consistency in quarter-over-quarter growth.", "John Calys", "Yes, our revenue guidance of the $870 million to $890 million that I mentioned earlier is predicated on a 6% to 8% unit -- net unit growth for the year over the prior year. And at this point, we would say we're trending toward the upper half of that range.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Jim, there was a very nice increase in the expected renewal rate for Q1 versus what you've reported over the prior few quarters. Aside from perhaps getting some benefit from a renewal base that's becoming more mature, were there any other factors that might have contributed to the higher renewals that you expect to see this quarter?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, in Q1, we did have a higher early renewal. Early renewals were up in Q1, which helps explain the increase in deferred revenue. Other than that, I'm not aware of any changes that...", "Patrick S. Kane", "The behavior is as expected. So it's consistent. So what we'll is some variability in 1/10 percentage points based upon specific registrars and what they're doing with their customers and different programs that they may or may not run. So even though it's up by a couple of 1/10% in terms of where we thought we'd end up, it's well within expectations.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And that's great. You've gotten attached to a large number of back-end applicants. Frankly, you have more than I would've expected. Although a lot of these I would imagine would be relegated to somewhat of a niche type status assuming their applications are accepted. What I wanted to ask is -- and I know this is not a material 2013 impact, but just kind of wondering, on a longer-term basis, given what we know today and how you see this potentially unfolding, whether you see a greater opportunity directionally for VeriSign on the front end or the back end around new gTLDs?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. I think -- well, certainly 2013 is too early. And we don't think there'll be any material revenue in 2013. And I think it's just too early to speculate about what that revenue will look like beyond. We're certainly pleased that over 200 applicants have chosen us to be their back-end registry service provider. But how -- and we're -- we like the program. We think that it's going to, as ICANN, encourage creativity, and we hope it will grow the market globally for domain names. But how much of that will grow, what exactly what our participation will be, how these 220 applicants that have chosen us to provide services then will fare in that new market. I think it's just too early to speculate about that. We have said that we do see that as a growth area. I think that it's going to expand the market. And we're pleased to be participating in it, both through directly applying to operate gTLDs. And as you said, providing services for 220. But beyond that, I think it is just too early for us to speculate.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next, from CLSA, Ed Maguire.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I saw you had posted last month the RFC for the .com renewal contract. Are there any issues that you could anticipate that might come up, that might result in any changes to proposal? And any update on expected timing of finalizing that contract?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, there is -- this is Jim, there is a published timeline for that. I can't have a fixed duration comment period. They are -- I think, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on -- to comment while the comment period is still up. But there is a fixed process. And at some point, ICANN and VeriSign will complete that process. ICANN will receive the comments and respond to them and then the agreement will be turned over to the Commerce Department for its consent of the renewal. The agreement expires on November 30, so that's the timeline to complete this process by then. And our plan is to follow the timeline and work through it. I think, again, .com had a similar process. Of course, to accept it, it did require Commerce Department approval. But essentially it went through an open comment process. There were responses to those comments and then ICANN board voted to approve the contract. Our expectation is that there will be a similar process here.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just a follow-up on cash. Just currently, how much do you have offshore and whether you have any ability to move some of that onshore?", "John Calys", "We have about $1.1 billion offshore right now, $245 million domestically. No specific plans right now to move any of the offshore cash back at this point in time.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question today from Craig Nankervis with First Analysis.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "My questions have really basically been asked. Maybe just a little more on the 220 new gTLDs that you've been selected to provide back-end services. Have you had discussions with most of these entities? Or is that -- was that number basically entirely a surprise to you, and how do you think about that quantity?", "D. James Bidzos", "I'll let Pat weigh in, in more detail, but some of those applicants actually ran competitive bid processes to select the back-end services provider. And we were successful as a competitor in that process for many of them. We've certainly entered into agreements with all of them at this point. I don't know that I can comment on how that fell with expectations. I think, given that the ICANN has said nothing about the number of applicants, it's probably inappropriate to speculate about how many there were or how we did. Pat? I would like Pat to comment.", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, as you said, Jim, it's hard to tell where it falls into a total number of top level domains that have been applied for. But we are pleased with the number, and we are pleased with the quality of the partners that have chosen VeriSign to provide back-end services for their offerings, as they see it as a valuable asset in terms of how they move their businesses forward as well.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "So assuming -- so I guess, what has to happen, they have to all -- each of those have to get their gTLD approved and then assuming that's the case, it's very likely you would be -- you would operate for the back end for everyone on that, for all of that group, right? There wouldn't be a reason you'd be selective within the group, is there?", "Patrick S. Kane", "No, those 220 have already said that if they are awarded a TLD by ICANN, that VeriSign will act as the operator of back-end registry services for them. So that's the agreement we've already entered into.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, we've agreed to do that. So there's no reason that the number would change from our perspective. And as Pat mentioned, they have specified us in their application as the provider, so we assume that -- but that's our expectation. That if their applications are approved, we will be their back-end registry services provider.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "I see. And does that -- as this unfolds, does this have any implications for your infrastructure and build out thereof or really not? How does that -- how do you look at that?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, I think we have world-class infrastructure that can certainly handle the types of business that we've taken and put onto. So I'm -- and I think that it's well within our capabilities.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Well, yes, so capabilities. I guess -- so it doesn't -- it's not going to -- I don't know, necessitate a different pattern to your CapEx spending or something like that because of this new dynamic.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. I don't think we anticipate anything substantial on that sense. I think we really need to look at the nature and the use and the deployment of some of these TLDs. But for example, many of them are brands who are probably going to have a very small number of domain names associated with their TLDs that we'll operate for them. So I don't think of this as a major overhaul of our infrastructure in order to support it. I think they -- for them, even if it's a small number of domain names, if it's an important brand, I think security and stability and availability are really the important things which is why they chose us. And we're certainly going to continue to provide that. We'll make the normal investments that we make in our infrastructure to provide that security and stability, but I believe that's what appealed to most of them.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Sure, sure. And I wasn't trying to imply that you have to have a major overhaul to what you have. I was just curious if it changes the pattern of how you operate with incorporating these...", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, we operate multiple domains now, so we're -- we have for a long time. So we're structured to operate multiple domains. While this could change over time, I don't -- I wouldn't expect that given a circumstance as you'd expect to see a substantial increase in the overall number of domain names. Again, if these are brands, the number of new domain names within the gTLDs would be relatively small. But it will be important that they resolve reliably, and I think that's why we were chosen.", "Operator", "Now this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Atchley. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. With regards to events in the second quarter, please note that Jim, John and George will be presenting at the J.P. Morgan TNT Conference at 2:10 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, May 15 in Boston.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's fourth quarter 2006 earnings conference call. I'm here today with Stratton Sclavos, Chairman and CEO of VeriSign; and Dana Evan, our CFO. The Q4 of fiscal year 2006 press release is available on First Call Market Wire and on the VeriSign's website at www.verisign.com. Also at approximately 3 pm Pacific time, we will post slides to our website with additional information around our guidance comments today. A replay of this call will be available on your telephone at 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 for international callers. The pass code for both numbers is 257-2145. ", "Financial results in this press release are unaudited, and the matter we will be discussing today includes forward-looking statements and as such are subjected to the risk and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Specifically, the most recent report on Form 10K and 10Q and any applicable imminent, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Due to previously announced internal review of VeriSign's historical stock option grant being conducted by our Board of Directors, VeriSign is not providing detailed GAAP or non-GAAP financials for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. ", "Dan will provide additional details later in this call. In a moment Stratton will begin our fourth quarter review and he will provide some insight in to the performance of our businesses. Dana will then follow with the discussion of preliminary non-GAAP financial results for Q4. ", "Following Dana's remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. We anticipate the call will end at appropriately 3 pm. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Stratton. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Thanks Ken and good afternoon everyone. Let me add my welcome to all of you attending today's call. As our results for Q4 indicate, we saw overall performance for the company that was in line with our expectation. Particular items of note were the continued strong results in the naming business and good unit and subscriber growth in SSL and wireless billing respectively. This performance helped offset modest weakness at Jamba! and at VeriSign Japan. In terms of strategic execution, Q4 was by far the most productive quarter of the year as we executed on our companywide reorganization, acquired and integrated Income Wireless and its 350 employees, received approval of our new .com contract with ICANN and launched several new services including our intelligent content distribution network and our extended validation SSL certificate, and of course as we announced Justice Monday, we have now finalized our mobile content joint venture with news corporation. So as I said, it was a very busy quarter. I'm extremely thankful for the teamwork and commitment to execution that our people demonstrated during this time and believe that we have positioned the company to address the key opportunities in the market as we enter 2007. ", "I'll now quickly cover the Q4 and year-end business unit metrics before moving to a discussion of our 2007 strategy and goals. As a reminder, this will be the last time we report the metrics in the BU format. Let's begin with the Communications Services Group. We report the CSG group revenues in two categories. The first category is Communications and Commerce which includes our network, database, billing and messaging services. The second category is content which includes our B2C and B2B content services. The Communications and Commerce line of business achieved a $130 million in revenue during the quarter, down slightly from Q3 to $140 million and consistent with our expectation. A key driver in the legacy C&C business was a continued growth in wireless building at MetroPCS and Leap as we now support over $10.4 million wireless users with our billing and payment services, up 33% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. These gains were offset by the declining connectivity in database revenues from our traditional carrier base. ", "While volumes in the legacy business continue to grow, we do expect revenues to be somewhat choppy over the next 12 months as we deal with the consolidation and pricing pressure inherent in these lines of business. As we\u2019ve said before, we are executing to plan that offsets the domestic declines with revenues generated from international penetration, continued growth in billing services with our key customers, and cost optimization on our legacy platform. ", "We did see strong growth in messaging services during the quarter as we delivered over $13 billion SMS messages, up a 140% from the year ago period and 20% sequentially. Premium messaging and MMS volumes in the quarter were up 50% year-over-year to $88 million messages as we provided the interactive voting services for several of the fall TV shows including Deal or No Deal. For future reference, all messaging services have now been combined with the B2B content platform in order to offer end-to-end solutions for our media and entertainment industry customers. ", "Now, let's move to the Content line of business. Overall, we achieved revenues of $90 million in the Content business during the quarter. Jamba! revenues came in $72 million while B2B content revenues totaled $80 million. We also had a major announcement during the quarter with the introduction of our Intelligent Content Distribution Network or ICDN. The ICDN is designed to support the delivery of all forms of content including longer format high definition video and high fidelity audio. The service combines advance video streaming capability with our proprietary Kontiki peer-to-peer technology and our globally deployed secure infrastructure to provide for the highly efficient and economical delivery of rich media content. ", "With the market for Internet-based video-on-demand beginning to emerge, we're targeting our ICDN services at both traditional and new media and entertainment companies, as well as large distributed enterprises. Current customers for the ICDN and/or the Kontiki peer-to-peer system include BBC, BSkyB, Channel 4, AOL, [Axiom] Pictures, Coco Cola and GM. At the recent consumer electronic show, we also announced the strategic technology partnership with Adobe to utilize their Flash streaming servers within our ICDN and to integrate our peer-to-peer technologies in future versions of their media products. Our simple goal is to establish a ubiquitous platform for legitimate peer-assisted delivery of professional and user-generated content. I will talk more about this as we discuss our 2007 strategy. ", "So in summing up the Communications Services Group for Q4, I think it's fair to say that our results came in as planned and that we hope that greatly expanded portfolio of new services will help balance the revenue distribution in CSG in 2007. We remained optimistic about the growth opportunities that exist across the business including messaging, content services, and international signaling. ", "Let's now move to the Internet Services Group. The ISG group contains our information and Security Services businesses. During the fourth quarter, we processed approximately 6.2 million new registrations for .com and .net domain name. We also saw another 9 million names renewed or extended, adding up to 15.2 million domain name transactions in the quarter, up 30% from the year ago period. Renewal rates remained strong as well coming in it 77% for the quarter. VeriSign's adjusted base of active names at the end of the period stood at 65 million, up 6% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. Remarkably, our ATLAS infrastructure is now handling an average of 25 billion DNS requests per day. As expected, we also received Department of Commerce approval for our new .com contract with ICANN. Just to recap the facts, VeriSign and ICANN signed a new agreement which extends our contract for operating .com through 2012 and provides for much clearer processes for new product introductions, pricing changes and contract renewals. It also settles all disputes between our respective organization. Obviously, we are very pleased to have this contract process behind us and look forward to working with ICANN to maintain and improve the security and stability of the Internet addressing system. ", "We also continue to make progress in our real time publishing and supply chain business. Notable contract wins in the quarter came from Unilever, Shell, Kimberly Clark, Wyeth, and Johnson & Johnson. ", "Moving to our Security Services Business, we sold over 221,000 SSL certificates during the quarter. This brings our combined VeriSign active base to 807,000 units including all VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte Branded certificates. We were also the first company to introduce and issue extended validation or EV certificates that support new security features in Microsoft's Vista and IE7 products. Today, over 300 leading online retailers and financial service companies have upgraded to our EV certificates. The motto for ecommerce in 2007 is, green means go on the Internet. ", "On the enterprise side of security, we are starting to see much broader industry segmentation in our sales effort as risk management, compliance and business continuity become mainstream issues for corporations and government agencies. In fact, Q4 represented a record booking quarter in our enterprise sales team. Notable customer wins in the quarter included new or renewed contract with Merrill Lynch, US Bank, City Group, Verizon, Wal-Mart, Intuit, and Boeing. The ISG group in total had solid performance in Q4 and its lines of business are all seeing good demand as we enter 2007. ", "So in summing up 2006, I would say, will be remembered as an exciting transformational year for our company. First and foremost, we invested in and developed several new technology and infrastructure platform in support of the emerging trends in the marketplace. These included our VeriSign identity protection network launched in February with endorsement from PayPal, eBay, and Yahoo! We also acquired two wireless infrastructure platforms and combined them with our own to create a comprehensive state of solutions for carriers, media companies and enterprises. And the acquisition of Kontiki formed the foundation of our ICDN platform for rich media distribution. Of course, the divestiture of our controlling interest in Jamba!, which did in fact closed earlier today, provides a partnership with the world leading media and entertainment company for direct consumer content offerings while freeing VeriSign to focus on its core mission of delivering digital infrastructure services in the middle of the network. ", "And, finally, we are convinced that the acquisition of inCode and its 350 consultants along with our reorganization into a single sales and services group will allow us to better serve our customer base going forward. ", "So that brings us to our outlook and strategy for 2007 and beyond. To put everything in context, let me start by saying that we believe the any URA has arrived. The any URA is characterized by consumer demand for anytime, anywhere, any device access to information, entertainment, and community. With over one billion Internet users and two billion wireless users on a global basis, we're seeing the world's interactions going increasingly digital. We believe it\u2019s a complete transformation of the way we think about communication, commerce, and content, and that we're just at the beginning of this tectonic shift. ", "VeriSign simple mission is to provide the digital infrastructure that enables and protects the world's interactions in any URA. Sitting in the middle of the network, we can help our customers more quickly and economically deliver end-to-end solutions that have the necessary scale, trust and intelligence. So, we start 2007 with two core franchises that are healthy, growing, and relied upon on a daily basis by the Internet population at large. These of course are DNS and SSL businesses. We would expect both to grow at approximately 20% plus rates this year. We're also expecting our new platform initiatives in 2006, namely of VeriSign identity protection network, our end-to-end mobile services platform, and our intelligent content distribution network to begin to establish leadership positions in their respective market as the demand for greater identity protection and on- demand content delivery increases. ", "Additionally, we'll continue to judiciously grow and expand our offerings in real-time publishing, managed security, and supply chain services to meet the needs of our existing customers and financial services, healthcare, public sector and retail. We believe we have the technology, the infrastructure, and the people to make this happen. ", "Our new organization structure has been designed with three objectives in mind deeper customers relationship, faster product innovation, and better financial results. On the customers' front, we believe our new combined sales and consulting services organizations under the leadership of John Donovan, who position us as a top leader in end-to-end supplier for our key customers around the world. Our main goals are to execute on the obvious cross-sell and white space opportunities in our major accounts while also positioning our capabilities to provide comprehensive solutions for new initiatives that our customers are pursuing. Early feedback from the field would seem to validate that we are on the right track. ", "In terms of faster innovation, we now have more development and operations professionals within VeriSign than in any other time in our history. We believe the newly combined products organization under the leadership of Mark McLaughlin gives us the organic capability to create significant new intellectual property and to bring highly integrated services to market much more quickly. ", "And lastly, while we still need to make additional investments in our global infrastructure to meet volume, reliability and security requirements, we do believe that 2007 will be a year where we significantly increase our operating leverage across the company. As Dana will detail in a moment, we plan to increase operating margins throughout 2007 within an exit rate goal of no less than 25% as we finish Q4. ", "In summary, 2007 is shaping up to be an exciting year for VeriSign and with several for catalysts slated for 2008, we will work diligently to continue this momentum. With that, I want to thank you for your attention and now, I'll turn the call over to Dana. ", "Dana Evan", "Thanks Stratton and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Before discussing VeriSign's financial results, I would like to start with a quick update regarding our Board of Directors internal review of VeriSign's historical stock option grant. As you'll recall, in November, we publicly announced that the Board had reached the conclusion that our historical financial statement would be require restatement. This restatement will affect the years and interim period from 2002 to 2005, as well as the first quarter of 2006 and will drive additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to past stock grant. At the time of the announcement, we estimated that these non-cash charges would not exceed $250 million. As of this month, the Board's review has now been completed. This review did not find any intentional wrong doing by any current member of the senior management team. The restatement process is currently underway and we would expect to file our restated financial statement as soon as practically possible, but within the SEC 10-K filing guideline. ", "Additionally, at this point of time, we expect the non-cash charges for this restatement to be substantially less than the $250 million previously disclosed. In light of these activities, we will not be providing full GAAP or non-GAAP results at this time. We will provide you with as much financial information as possible including preliminary non-GAAP result and guidance. Please note though that these are preliminary numbers and represent what we believe the numbers would be without any impact or changes resulting from the stock option investigation and the complete restatement. ", "So, now let's turn to the financial results for the quarter and the year. Our results for the fourth quarter, cap off what was a solid year for VeriSign. During 2006, we delivered revenue of nearly $1.6 billion. Year-over-year, we certainly saw the effect of the challenges we faced during 2006 in our Jamba! business were quarterly and annual revenue were significantly lower than the prior year. Excluding Jamba! however, most of our core business grew steadily and at healthy rate throughout the year, particularly our naming, security, and messaging businesses. In addition to generating solid financial result, we also maintained a strong balance sheet throughout the year ending 2006 with cash balances approaching $750 million. This was after we made significant investments in operations and infrastructure. We purchased over $6 million shares of VeriSign stock and executed strategic acquisition to support future growth areas, such as digital media delivery, mobile media management, after sale market expansion and the building out of a world class professional services organization to better serve our customers. ", "So, now let's dive into the financial results for the fourth quarter. We ended the year with Q4 delivering revenues of $430 million, slightly below our previous guidance due in part to weaker than expected results from our Jamba! business and some delayed customers acceptances we experienced in the mobile services business over the holiday season. That being said, we continue to see sequential growth in all areas of our business during the quarter with the exception of the core Communications Services which were down marginally. ", "As we turn to revenue by reporting unit, I would like to point out that this will be the last time we will be reporting revenue under these segments, which reflect our historic business unit based organizational structure. So looking at revenue under these reporting units, the Internet Services Group grew 4% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. Sequential growth drew approximately $205 million of revenue in Q4, or 50% of total revenue, and was fueled by continued strength in domain name sales and solid traction in our Security Services business. The Communications Services Group grew approximately 2% sequentially and reported revenue of $208 million, representing the other 50% of revenue for Q4. ", "Within our core Communications and Commerce business, revenues were $113 million for the quarter, down $1 million from last quarter due to weakness in our Communications business, where we didn\u2019t see the volume of business in Asia turn up as quickly as we had expected. ", "Our Content Services business which includes Jamba!/Jamster! as well as our digital content services reported 90 million of revenue. Jamba! contributed $72 million of that and was down 4% sequentially, which was below our expectation for sequential growth. ", "Geographically, the percentage of revenue from our international customers' affiliates and subsidiaries was 29% for Q4 consistent with Q3. For the year, international revenue represented 30% of total revenue. Preliminary non-GAAP gross margin improved from last quarter and was slightly higher than guidance at 65%. Q4 operating expenses were in line with expectations, driving a 20% operating margin for the quarter. ", "As it relates to headcount, we ended the quarter with approximately 5330 employees, up from 4860 in Q3. The majority of this increase came through the inCode Wireless acquisition completed in November. ", "Moving now to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Cash equivalents in short-term investments at the end of Q4 were approximately $750 million. Cash balances were up 6% from Q3 and reflects strong cash flows in the quarter fueled in part by increased year end collection effort, particularly in the Communication Services Group. From the balance sheet perspective, we were pleased to end the year with these healthy cash balances, particularly after deploying approximately $135 million of cash for the repurchase of VeriSign's shares during the first half of 2006 and putting approximately $650 million to work for the strategic acquisitions you saw us execute throughout the course of the year. The strong collection, I just mentioned also, had the benefit of driving Q4 net DSOs down 2 days from the previous quarter to 48 days. ", "Total deferred revenue at the end of Q4 was $614 million, up $23 million from the previous quarter. The increase here was driven primarily by continued strong sales of new and renewed .com and .net name and solid bookings in our security business. For the year, deferred revenue grew over a $100 million. ", "Lastly, our capital expenditures for fourth quarter were approximately $40 million, bringing us to total capital expenditures for the year of a $142 million. These capital expenditures broke down approximately as follows; 44% in Communication Services Group, 21% in Internet Services, and 35% for corporate infrastructure purposes. ", "Let me now spend a couple of minutes updating you on some of the Q4 and post-quarter development starting with the companywide reorganization we\u2019ve undertaken to streamline our operations and better leverage VeriSign's broad services portfolio across industries and customer group. As Stratton discussed earlier, we have reorganized the company into a new functional organization, replacing the previous business unit structure with a new combined worldwide sales and services team and an integrated product organization. As a result of the reorganization, we would expect to run a onetime restructuring this quarter, incurring charges at the end of Q1 in a range of at least $35 to $45 million. This charge is comprised of approximately $15 million for workforce-related charges, $10 to $15 million for facilities-related charges, and $10 to $15 million for hardware-and software-related charges. Approximately, $20 to $25 million of these amounts are expected to be cash charges. We would expect to recognize this restructuring over the course of the next four quarters and would anticipate seeing material positive effects of such beginning in Q2, and building incrementally throughout the year as some of these initiatives are longer lead item. ", "As part of the restructuring, we would expect to exit approximately350 employees by the end of Q1. Prior to any additional strategic investment initiative and once the restructuring is fully realized, we anticipate annualized run rate savings in the $50 million range. As we move to complete our formal restructuring plans by the end of this quarter, we will update you in Q2 as to the full impact of our restructuring plan and the related savings for the rest of the year and beyond. ", "I will discuss the financial impact for the restructuring more in a moment when we discuss guidance. Additionally, as I mentioned before and as a result of the reorganization in Q2, we will be revising how we discuss our business externally. We will describe these changes in more details during our Q1 2007 Earnings Call. Another key event during the fourth quarter was our acquisition of inCode Wireless. As a result of this acquisition, we recognized approximately $5 million in revenue and a slight operating loss in Q4. The inCode acquisition brought approximately 350 new employees to our VeriSign workforce. As Stratton mentioned, inCode is a strategic services organization and as such, it comes to a different financial models than traditional VeriSign businesses. Revenues are recognized as completed and delivered and growth in operating margins are substantially lower, but not atypical for a services business. We expect the acquisition to be a penny dilutive in Q1, but breakeven for the remainder of the year. ", "And lastly, as Stratton mentioned earlier, we closed our joint venture transaction with News Corporation today. We discussed this in detail on our special call this past Monday, but I will touch on it again as part of our guidance. ", "So, let me now turn towards our future outlook as we begin fiscal 2007. Looking at the full year, we would expect organic top-line growth to be consistent with our prior guidance calling for revenue growth of 15%. Additionally, revenue will reflect a full year of the inCode business and one month of Jamba!, leading to an expectation for approximately $1.55 billion of revenue over the course of the year. ", "As you saw, we exited fiscal 2006 with operating margins of 20%. Entering 2007, we expect operating margins will tick down a bit in Q1, as we transition to the Jamba! joint venture and integrate inCode Wireless into our business. We do fully expect though to see operating margins expanding significantly throughout the year and reaching the lower end of our long-term operating margin goal of 25% to 30%, as we exit 2007. The revenue and margin guidance I just laid out would be expected to drive earnings growth in excess of 25% with non-GAAP earnings per share guidance in the $1.06 to $1.07 range. This 25% plus growth target reflects the earnings growth as compared to 2006 non-GAAP earnings per share, which as you know we are not able to provide today less the 51% share of Jamba!. I'd like to point out that this guidance does not reflect the full benefit of potential savings, which we believe should be realized as the restructuring efforts continue. We do believe it is prudent to be conservative in our initial guidance for 2007, but that being said as we complete the effort on our restructuring plan and look to incur the restructuring charge at the end of this quarter, we think it is reasonable to expect an additional $0.03 to $0.04 of earnings that\u2019s potential to be driven off from the restructuring benefit. ", "Now drilling down a bit into the current Q1 period, we anticipate we will drive revenue of approximately $380 million. This includes $22 million in revenue for the January month of Jamba! result and approximately $10 million in revenue for inCode. As a basis of pro forma comparison, Q4 revenue excluding Jamba! was $341 million. This guidance reflects organic revenue growth of approximately 3% to 4% driven mostly by all areas of our business. ", "Turning to margins for Q1, we would expect gross margins will decline to approximately 62%. This would suggest a decrease of approximately 300 basis points. Let me take a minute to walk you through the three primary reasons for this change going forward. First, as a Professional Services business, inCode gross margin is significantly below the VeriSign gross margin range. Therefore, as we integrate inCode into our business, we would expect on an ongoing basis the gross margins will be lower by approximately 150 basis points. Second, as we discussed on our call earlier this week, gross margins for Jamba! has been in excess of 70%. As a result, the disposition of the Jamba! business will result in an additional decline in gross margins of approximately 150 basis point. The 100 basis point decline in Q1 reflects the exclusion of Jamba! from operating results for the full two months. Third, as a part of the terms of our new contract with ICANN, which was approved by the Department of Commerce in November, we will pay an additional $10 million in fees to ICANN on an annualized basis. This will further reduce gross margin by approximately 70 basis point. In total, we would expect these three items will reduce gross margins in the aggregate by approximately 3% during Q1. ", "In terms of operating expenses, we will continue to execute on our strategic plans, investing for growth and next generation services while remaining focused on disciplined expense management in all areas across the company. As such, we would expect an operating margin for Q1 in the 19% range, reflecting the impact of the lower growth margins I just discussed. As discussed earlier this week, VeriSign's 49% minority interest will be reported in the financial statements as other income. For Q1, we would expect that other income will include an additional $1 to $2 million for VeriSign's portion of the joint ventures operations for the months of February and March. As mentioned earlier, operating results from Jamba! for the month of January will be included in our Q1 financial statement as the joint venture officially commences on February 1st. ", "As you know, we're currently precluded from stock repurchases due to our internal review of stock option practices and our current restatement effort. We would, however, anticipate a full resumption of our share repurchase program late in Q1 or early Q2. However, given the timing of these events, we expect this activity will have little-to-no effect on diluted shares for Q1, and we would expect that the share count for the quarter would be flat to slightly up from the 248 million in Q4. ", "Taking into account, the revenue, margin and other income in share count guidance I just laid out, we would expect preliminary pro forma earnings per share in Q1 of approximately $0.22 on an after-tax basis, using a 30% effective tax rate. ", "Additionally, as we said on Monday's call, the Jamba! joint venture delivers other income to us that is already taxed and thus should not be taxed again when applying the VeriSign pro forma rate to our income before taxes. Please note that this non-GAAP earnings per share guidance reflects a full penny's worth of dilution in Q1, stemming from the inCode Wireless acquisition. Also as the point of reference and comparison, Jamba! would have contributed approximately $0.03 to our Q4 EPS. ", "So to sum it all up, we are pleased with what we have accomplished during 2006. Our continued execution on strategic initiatives, the growth we delivered in our core businesses, and the investments we made in new strategic areas. As we enter 2007, we are optimistic about our new opportunities, the momentum we are seeing our core businesses and the resulting growth trajectories we anticipate for revenues, margins, and earnings. We continue to believe our strong financial position allows us to focus on profitable investment, expanding operational leverage, and delivering increased shareholder value. ", "And with that, I'd like to open this call for your questions. Operator, may we have the first question please? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We will go first to Todd Raker, Deutsche Bank. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys. Two questions; first, Stratton, can you just give some insight in terms of the EV search and how we should be thinking about the uptake of those on the base and the potential economic impact, especially kind of in the back half of the year? And then, secondly very similarly can you give us your most current thinking on .com price increase? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Todd, I missed the first part \u2013 the first question, what was that? ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Yeah, extended validation search, how you see uptake, any early expectations in terms of how you think the base will play out over the course of the year? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah. Certainly, we're pleased with what we are seeing right now, which there is some pent up demand. Obviously, a lot of retailers and financial service firms who wanted to be able to display that green address bar early on in this is launch year. So, right now about we will issue release I think on Monday of the 300 customers that have chosen to move over. Our goals are relatively modest early in the year since we don\u2019t really know what the penetration rate of Vista and IEE7 will be. I think, we\u2019d like to see at least 5% of the VeriSign retail search heading toward the EV up-sell in the second half of the year and maybe 10% of our larger enterprise customers that include most of the large financial service firms of that we\u2019ve already sold one firm over 2000 of them as they look to expand where they use us to sell within their property. So, I think early returns are good, a little bit of honeymoon period because of the pent up demand and obviously with Vista's launch just today, we will need to see what the adoption rate looks like, but so far so good. ", "As relate to .com, I think our expectation is that we'll have some action here in the first-half of the year. I don\u2019t want to be anymore specific than that as we're still working all the plans around that. As you know, that action will be precipitated with a notice period that takes a full six months. So, it is likely that the -- any benefit from a potential price action would really start to flow through no earlier than Q4 -- Q1 of next year. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Then, just one follow-up, we've kind of been limbo here in terms of the reporting structure going forward, any sense for how you're thinking about when we rebuild our models here, how we should be thinking about the business? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Well, fair question, and I think Dana, and Ken, and the team will certainly be reaching out over the next few weeks to talk with folks and get some input. I think, one way we're thinking about it at least is kind of a legacy voice services in one potential bucket and all the IP-based services, both for Internet as well as wireless data in another. So, we're really trying to separate, if you will, the traditional voice or legacy voice from what I would believe are more the next generation IP-based services that kind of play to the strategy we talked about. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We'll have our next question from Ed Maguire, Merrill Lynch. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. Do you have any update on when you might expect to renew the .net agreement? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Well, .net was renewed, Ed, earlier, I want to think towards the end of '05 I believe, or '06. So, we have -- or the beginning of '06. So that I believe is on a 4-year clock of its own and it has automatic renewal provisions in it. Similar, but actually even a little better than .com. That contract also came -- the new contract there also came with the ability to raise prices by up to 10% a year, I believe. So in essence that\u2019s already locked and loaded as well. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the timing of those increases would be synchronized with .com? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We were able to raise prices in .net as of January 1, 2007. So that clock is ticking as well. Again, we are in the final process of really determining the strategy there, but it's likely that would happen simultaneously. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And any granularity you can provide around the new sales organization in terms of comp? How you're structuring any overlay teams and whether the sales people have their -- headquarters are fully organized at this point? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yes. As it turns out, we have a special guest, John Donovan in the room. So, I'll let John talk a little bit about the structure of the teams and maybe what we did at the sales conference a week or so ago. ", "John Donovan", "Great, thanks Stratton. Just very briefly, we -- in our sales coverage model, one of the things that\u2019s been a big benefit of the reorganization is the opportunity to not only eliminate overlap at customers, which can be confusing for our customers, but also the opportunity to ensure that we remove the white space, as Stratton mentioned, in our coverage model. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Can you hear, John? ", "John Donovan", "I can, yes. Thank you. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "And so, in our coverage model, we have a much more coder base based system, where its not only an expectation, it\u2019s a requirement for, to really make your coders to go out and represent the full breadth of what the VeriSign portfolio of products would be into those customers. So, we've put a lot more leverage into the system higher expectations for the sales teams, and then we're going to provide them with the tools and education that they need to provide a much greater breadth and just very, very quickly, we're organizing with certain strategic accounts and deploying ourselves a lot more aggressively against our larger relationships and we're deploying -- where we're not deploying by named account, we still will have a geographic coverage model, but we will be far more efficient in all of the metrics that you would use whether that\u2019s bookings per head, revenue per head and then obviously the expense to deliver both those bookings and the revenue. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will have our next question from Rob Owens, Pacific Crest Securities. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Yeah, good afternoon. Relative to the inCode contribution in the quarter, where was it in revenue and did it dilute Q4 results? ", "Dana Evan", "It was $5 million of revenue, and there was a slight loss, but it was less than $1 million in the quarter because that was the short period. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. And relative to that historical view Dana, where did you put that, was that in B2B section of content? ", "Dana Evan", "That\u2019s right, in CSG. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "And then regarding the recent AT&T-BellSouth merger, can you give us a little color. Do you have much exposure there in terms of your database business or anything else? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Hold on Rob, I want to go back -- I am not sure when you said we put it into B2B content. ", "Dana Evan", "[Not as yet]. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "No, no. That\u2019s what he said; it's not in B2B content. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Right, it's in the overall CSG number. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "It's in the overall CSG. So, that would be down in the quarter? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We're looking at each other. I actually believe that through -- sorry. I think that\u2019s right. We will confirm that for you. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay, great. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Go ahead with the other question. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "AT&T-BellSouth exposure? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah. A little bit on signaling, right? And that will hit here as we expected in Q1 and in Q2, which is why the guidance in the legacy stuff is very modest. However, BellSouth being one of the more aggressive providers of data services, one of the more aggressive providers looking at on-demand video and one of the more aggressive providers in small and medium size businesses, Network Services and Security Services. We actually are looking at that as a positive for us in terms of aggressive things that we can work on with AT&T, which is the largest name to count in John strategic account model. So, between BellSouth coming in and now a single decision process around Cingular, we're pretty excited about the overall new AT&T structure and our touch points within it. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "We'll go next to Israel Hernandez, Lehman Brothers. ", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Good afternoon everyone. Question on buybacks, once the restatement is completed, do you have any plans on the accelerating the buyback above and beyond what you're expecting to do with the Jamba! proceeds? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think, as you saw in 2005, we have been pretty aggressive with our buyback programs. Then the Board in fact authorizing new $1 billion program last year, so I think you'll see us be aggressive including using those proceeds and continuing to use additional cash flow -- free cash flow to be pretty aggressive there, certainly around these price point. ", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Great, thanks. And I'm not sure if I heard this on the call or not. But did you give a cash flow from operations number? And what should our expectations be at high level in terms of cash flow growth in 2007? ", "Dana Evan", "No, because the cash flow statement will be impacted by many accounts they are part of the restatement, we are not able to actually report back to you, and thus we haven\u2019t actually given guidance on it for the '07 year either. ", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We'll have our next question from Robert Breza, RBC Capital Markets. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, good afternoon. One housekeeping items, Dana. Could you talk about the CapEx plan for 2007? ", "Dana Evan", "Right. So, we typically talk about CapEx for the company at about 10% to 12% of revenue, and we would expect for our core business, the CapEx again in '07 would be in the $160 - $165 million range. We are in the process of building out a new data center that Stratton talked about, on the last call, and that will add about another 30 million to that number just as a one-time expense in 2007. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Great, thank you. One follow-up question for you Stratton. You talked in your prepared remarks about Japan having some weakness and not getting the customers kind of turned on. Can you kind of just give us little more color there and maybe your outlook for that geographies specifically for '07? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah, I think '06 was a mixed year for Japan. We obviously had some FX issues there, but in addition the business did not perform up to plan. Most of that was centered around the SiteRock acquisition, that they had done in 2005 which was the small security operations and monitoring business that did not live up to its plans for certain reasons kind of unique to the Japanese market. The team have kind of factored that in as we go into \u201907, believe we\u2019ve got that well in hand and restructured and reorganized as well and then we -- moving forward on the more traditional VeriSign businesses in Japan, pretty excited about the security operations we\u2019ve in fact just signed the largest token customer ever is actually coming out of Japan and we\u2019ll be announcing that shortly who that is but that\u2019s were north of a million tokens to be deployed over the course of the next couple of years. So, the security business seems firm, and John and the team are looking at, using the same organizational model in Japan as we go forward. So, they will be bringing more of the VeriSign products to bear so, I think '07 will be a decent recovery year in Japan, and we will set them up for good growth in '08 and '09. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Just one last follow-up Dana did inCode have any effect on deferred revenue in the quarter? ", "Dana Evan", "No, it did not. And let me follow-up to Rob's previous question the $208 million for communication services that I talked about, actually the $5 million of inCode was not and either the 113 of core nor the 90 of content. It's an add-on to that. So, it's separate from those two buckets that we normally talked to you about. ", "Robert Breza - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Sarah Friar, Goldman Sachs. ", "Derek Pingle - Goldman Sachs", "Hi thank you. This is [Derek Pingle] on behalf of Sarah. Real quick on the options issue, its completed the Board review, but our understanding is also that the SEC and US Attorney are involved here, engaged in someway and is there anything you can tell us in terms of what they need to see or when their requirements are satisfied toward when the door shuts kind of out from their perspective. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Our process is like 140 other companies, the internal -- the SEC and US Attorney have tended to be the waiting for the Ad Hoc Committees Investigations to complete which is now done, they've been priced all along the way, of what's been found, and they'll continue to work with the companies outside council to respond to their increase, but there is really no definitive timeline for what they are looking at? ", "Derek Pingle - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. And then more on, any update on decisions on what you will do with the GeoTrust brand as well? What you might do or what you've may be have done already with pricing on the GeoTrust side? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "No definitive decisions here that team has a lots on its plate right now rolling out the EV Certificates across the different brands. And building in some new enterprise services so, as we talked about, we now have the three leading brands in the market space and we will continue to make pricing and packaging decisions based on what we are seeing in the market, but right now I think we are very comfortable being the price leader with the VeriSign brand, being the channel player with the GeoTrust brand and competing on the lower end of the price side with the top brand. And obviously, our unit counts are very strong right now, so we are pretty happy with where we are. ", "Derek Pingle - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We'll have our next question from Kevin Buttigieg, AG Edwards. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - AG Edwards", "Thank you, Stratton I heard you mentioned catalyst to 2008 results and I was just wondering if you could talk about that a little bit and perhaps in that context obviously the new ICANN agreement allows you to provide some ancillary services around domain name registration, I was wondering, if you had any plans or any thoughts about that at this point in time? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We certainly do, and we will be making some announcements on that here in the first half of the year. But the catalyst I was particularly speaking about are one, certainly what we now have the capabilities to put in the .com and .net structure of the contracts as it relates to new product introductions that are ancillary, and have a much quicker and systematic review process, as well as, any price changes we would made, that as I've said earlier would mostly impact the P&L starting in 2008. ", "Second, in the SSL business, because of having to write-down the deferred revenue our majority of the deferred revenue from the GeoTrust acquisition as that builds backup on the deferred revenue lines, you will actually see growth rates accelerate on the revenue side as we exit the year. And of course we would expect to see economies of scale and synergies there on the operating side, as we continue to integrate all the GeoTrust operation. Certainly, we've also got with the Intelligent Content Distribution Network in the mobile side, but we believe we will be improving margins and high growth rates in 2007 leading to hopefully pretty strong performances in 2008. So, you put all that together, and I think we like the portfolio we\u2019ve got and some of the opportunities we see for improving margins even more as we head out into the future. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - AG Edwards", "Okay. And then, as far as the restructuring is concerned you mentioned about the potential for $0.03 to $0.04 upside or actually Dana did. And I was wondering if you could address, if you receive that upside would you expect it to come more or so through the form of better revenues or more so through the form flow or cost? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "It would be cost savings from the operation. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - AG Edwards", "Okay. And then just finally our clean up item, Dana I noticed that there was a bit of restatement to the '05 numbers that there was a bit of restatement to the '05 numbers that were included in the package of slight reduction to revenues there, I believe. Could you mention what that was about? ", "Dana Evan", "That's all part of the ongoing restatement efforts. As you may or may not know, when you have an official restatement, you do have to go back and restate things that had in the past been passed in terms of restatement and prior audits. And so there is small amount here and there, but you will see that when we file the 10-K as well. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - AG Edwards", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Walter Pritchard, Cowen. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Hi, just a couple of questions on my end, just trying to highlight around the restatement, it's around the restructuring of the restatement, you're basically bringing on 350 sort of lower margin type employees relating to consulting and you are exiting 350 of your own employees in the restructuring. And you are looking for operating margins up about 6% between Q1 and Q4. I just wondering if you could maybe walk us through how you get to that with kind of similar mix of business and maybe give us some examples of large areas where cost are coming out and enable that happen? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Certainly. So, the numbers Dana talked about on the headcount side, Walter, are roughly 8% of the employee population at VeriSign, excluding the inCode bring over. But if you look at how the effected employee list was put together, it represents more about 16% to 18% within what we would call the management layers of the company, right, and less so at the bottom. So in essence, there is a higher cost component to the folks who have -- are leaving the business or being repositioned within the business. ", "Second, in terms of bringing on the consulting resource a lot of those heads are filling roles that we would believe, we would've had to add into our '07 plans to support revenue growth in some of these key areas, especially around implementation services on things like video, mobile and voice. So in essence, those heads are filling in critical heirs if you will in many locations, whereas the management infrastructure that's leaving is really the potential redundancies that come from having three sales organization fold into one, redundancies of three sales operations teams and the rest. ", "So I think we feel pretty comfortable around how this is all being done very, very effective teamwork across the management team in getting this done. So, the numbers we're showing, as we said, likely have a little bit of upside. As we get through the restructuring, we will be more comfortable talking about. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Okay. And then just on one of the domain name business. I know with some talk of price increases, although I know you haven\u2019t given any official notification there, are you starting to at all see as term length increases, maybe registrar has started to anticipate that the price, their cost are going to go up? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "No, not at all. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Okay. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We're actually seeing the registrars continue to do some of the same marketing programs that we were doing before, which is increasing volume. In fact last week is the highest volume week we've ever seen. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Okay. And then lastly, Stratton maybe you can talk little on your ICDN offering. How do you position that relative to somebody comes in the market maybe specifically optimize -- who sort of maybe a more traditional CDN, but just trying to get a sense for how it compares? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Well, I think what we're trying to do is really two-fold here. First of all, we're bringing the best of peer-to-peer and the best of streaming together underneath a VeriSign brand with our own global infrastructure. So, when we really go out and start talking to most of the media and entertainment companies, who are today delivering through streaming services, they will tell you it's their single largest cost and it continues to be unprofitable for them. ", "So by leveraging the peer-assisted technology and by putting it into VeriSign data centers that have massive network capacity due to our DNS services, we believe we can reduce by up to 40%, the cost of delivering high-definition quality video. And if you start talking about high-def films in long format, right? You are really looking at something that the market has not yet done yet and one of the barriers has been the efficiency of delivery. I can tell you I've met with several of our UK customers who are already using the peer-to-peer service and they are getting anywhere from 50% to 80% peering rates already, and in many respects seeing that bandwidth cost savings very dramatically. So you do all of that and we think we've got a very competitive offering in the market, but we'll really be targeting the high-end of rich media delivery, less of the more traditional FMI services around web pages and the rest. ", "The second thing then is our relationship with the Adobe where we like this to become a ubiquitous client technology deployed on somewhere near their 700 million Acrobat and Flash desktops around the world. As you know, obviously client downloads or client code downloads are a buried entry, but if you are riding along with the prevailing ubiquitous video technology in the marketplace, you have an opportunity to really create a standard. So I think 2007, we have to prove that out and execute with our partners at Adobe. But we are pretty excited about the opportunity and we do believe the market is going to be very large and will support several players. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Peter Kuper, Morgan Stanley. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered, but actually, Stratton, you picked my interest with that last comment on the video delivery. In particular, I mean how much of opportunity do you think this is near-term; this is kind of a long-term, that's already about a couple of years from now. I agree with you the opportunity in video growth is going to be massive, but you are well-positioned today versus -- let's say better positioned down the road? And then, the other question I had actually in line with that is on the margin side, total of 25% to 30% towards the end of this year going to '08, is that a sustainable target range, now our years going forward for modeling purposes? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think it's very much the ICDN will follow traditional kind of VeriSign infrastructure build up. The last year was the investment year, we built it, put it into the market. We've got it in four of our data centers plus the peer-assisted technology out. Now, we will be putting it into 8 to 12 of our data centers over the course for the next few quarters. So, we can deliver from the streaming prospective with our grid servers and then, obviously supported with our peer-to-peer assist. ", "I think, you will see revenues ramped there relatively nicely this year, but you'll still be in the low double-digit million here in terms of revenue. I think the marketplace itself is going to have a year of inflection here, and we are going to see a lot of decisions get made. So I think we are hitting the market at the right time, lots of announcements most likely this year, more and more revenue await in '09. As relates to going from our exit rate of 25% margins in Q4 of this year closer to our 30% margins, we do believe that's achievable in the new structure and we will continue to push for it, that's probably 6 to 8 quarters out, right, from the end of this year, but something that we can see within our sight. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "We'll have our next question from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just to spend a little bit more time on your core communications services side, Stratton you sort of mentioned slower ramp up in Asia then expected but I wonder if you can comment just on North America here it seems like you had a another sequential decline. And what would your expectation be for this business I guess Q1 and then sort of the growth in longer-term? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Phil, I think its kind of simple way to look at it. We've kind of projected internet 0% to 5% decline this year on the legacy services around the voice [stuff]. Yeah we hope we'll do better then that if we kick the international in, and if we can obviously raise the profile in our billing services a little bit with our key customers here who are experienced being pretty strong growth right now. I think we will be in relatively conservative and assuming 0% to 5% this year on core legacy telecom stuff, and if we do better than that it will be a bonus meanwhile we will continue to manage it for profitability. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "And then I guess when you do look at that one sort of a strategy that you laid out here focusing on IP. How do you see the legacy comp services side sort of fitting in your roadmap? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think we'll continue to evaluate as you've seen over the last few years we've been relatively disciplined and relatively candid around getting out of the businesses. We didn't believe we could be the best in the world that and it didn't fit the strategy. So we will continue to look at all the product line within VeriSign around that. And we'll take the same action at the right time on any of those, but again all these product business are profitable then our portfolio, and so it's not something that we're worry about on a minute-by-minute basis we look at it more long-term and making the right decisions at the right time. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hey then one last just asking, Dana what fully diluted share kind you're using for next year? ", "Dana Evan", "For Q1 we have 248 and because we will institute the share repurchase program we have that ticking down a bit each quarter throughout the year. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz, Susquehanna. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Yeah, thanks and good afternoon. Stratton, it sounds like you had pretty solid results in security services overall this quarter, I know there was some weakness in Q3 in Europe and Japan, can you just walk through how it performed this quarter across all major Geos? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Very, very strong performance in the US as I said during the call. Record bookings quarter in the enterprise team and security. They really had great performance and booked some very new, some big new deals for us and some key accounts. Japan as we've talked about was a little bit weak by a few million dollars, about half that tax related half performance related and then Europe was I would say on plan. No major surprises one way or the other. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Great, and Dana, in terms of the delayed customer acceptance that you saw on the mobile services side, can you just elaborate on that a little bit for us and what kind of effect that had in Q4? ", "Dana Evan", "Some of the services that we deliver, we actually need to receive some acceptance from our customers and with the holidays it just happened that the customer didn\u2019t get the acceptances done before the end of the quarter. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "That's related to some of our content services delivered for customers in Europe as a subcontractor. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "I kind of thought of in a few million dollar range if you had to kind of put a -- ", "Stratton Sclavos", "A few million dollars, yeah. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay, perfect and just one quick housekeeping since this was the first full quarter with GeoTrust, just wondering if you have any color in terms of what the revenue contribution was and or the amount of the deferred revenue write-down pertaining to the Q4? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We don't -- we didn't count it up that way, we actually roll them up all in the same way so. We don't have that at our fingertips Gregg, you'd be glad to get back with you on that. As I believe from the differed revenue write down, I want to say was something close $18 million or something. We will have to get that numbers for you as well. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "All right, thanks guys.

", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon, trying just to clarify another I think, the question has been asked couple of times, but existing 2007 Stratton and Dana your 25% operating margin and then the 30% is six to eight quarters after that? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "That\u2019s our goal Greg, I am sorry, that\u2019s our goal Gene. We believe we know how to get there but we are not pegging an exact date for that. But we do believe we can continue our progression towards this 30% level over the next couple of years. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Great, and then second is, the whole any, theme obviously that\u2019s a new theme and you touched on the beginning of the call, but obviously your two core businesses really tap into that and you touched on some other areas where you could be developing new products around that. Can you just, you conceptually touch on how that any of your team is going to involve from your two core business going forward? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think the product themes obviously putting together solution sets that really drive towards serving up interactions on these network. So, what we focused in communication in a broad tense as it relates to web based and wireless based communications, voice and data. We will also be focused on commerce and transaction support both of a wireless and broadband. So I think all the platform investments you saw as make in '06, we are strictly around as focus on the any IRA and being the key provider in the middle of the network to enable and protect those interaction. So that\u2019s one of the ways you will judge our portfolio going forward. Just ask yourself that this service enable or protect an interesting set of interactions that needs somebody in the middle handling billions of transaction today. Up kind how we gage it ourselves, so well it may be a new theme we did start talking about it last year, certainly within our analyst day presentation as received a very-very strong and if support in the customer bases we go in and talk about these end-to-end solutions that help them accelerate kind of their move into some of these service areas. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "So it sounds that you really have all the key pieces already in place for it. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I believe so, I mean would clearly are going to be building out more infrastructure in the constellation as we call it to support not only delivery of these services but obviously also the monitoring and the localization of them. So I did talk about some of the investment that we will make around volume, security and reliability or related to that but for the most part I don\u2019t see adventuring into a new service area in 2007 that we had to talk about. ", "Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray", "Great thank you. ", "Operator", "And that this time we have no further questions in the queue, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Bond for any additional or closing remark. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Thank you operator and thank you everyone for your time today as always we would look forward to speaking with you answer any additional questions you may have, thank you and good evening.

Edwards ", " Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co. ", " Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities ", "Operator", "Good day, and welcome to the VeriSign, Incorporated third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom McCallum. Please go ahead, sir. ", " Tom McCallum", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for VeriSign's third quarter 2006 results call. I'm here today with Stratton Sclavos, Chairman and CEO of VeriSign; and Dana Evan, our CFO. In a moment, Stratton will review Q3, and he will provide some insights into the performance of our businesses. Dana will then follow with a preliminary non-GAAP discussion of our Q3 financial results. ", "Due to the previously announced internal review of VeriSign's historical stock option grants being conducted by our Board of Directors, VeriSign is not providing detailed GAAP or non-GAAP financials for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. The Board currently anticipates completing its investigation before the end of the year. ", "In addition, facts may come to light once the internal review is complete that may require us to change our accounting treatment of stock options granted in prior periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our results for those periods or other periods. ", "Dana will also present preliminary forward-looking non-GAAP financial guidance for Q4 and 2007. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in our annual report and other reports filed with the SEC. ", "Following Dana's remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. We anticipate the call will end at approximately 3 pm. ", "With that, I would like to turn things over to Stratton. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Thanks, Thomas and good afternoon, everyone. Let me add my welcome to all of you attending today's call. As our results for Q3 indicate, we saw overall performance that was in line with our expectations across our lines of business. Particular items of note were the continued strong results in the naming business and a second consecutive quarter of stability in the mobile content space. We also saw the decline that we had anticipated in the core telecom revenues due to industry consolidation. ", "In terms of strategic execution, Q3 was a very productive quarter, as we launched updates to many of our current product lines and introduced new offerings in digital content and security. We also completed the acquisition of GeoTrust and announced our intention to form a joint venture with News Corp to combine our direct-to-consumer mobile content businesses. ", "All in all, we are satisfied with our results for Q3, and are looking forward to incremental growth across the business in Q4. With that, let me dive into the third quarter highlights for the business units, and then say a few words about our outlook for the rest of the year. ", "Let's begin with the Communications Services Group. We currently report the CSG group revenues in two categories. The first is Communications and Commerce Services, and the second is Mobile and Broadband Content Services. The Communications and Commerce line of business includes our network connectivity, database, billing and messaging services. The Content line of business includes our B2C and B2B efforts for mobile and broadband content distribution. ", "For Q3, the Communications and Commerce line of business achieved $114 million in revenue, consistent with our expectations, given the decline we projected in legacy voice services, as industry consolidation continued in North America. Key drivers in the C&C business included continued growth in wireless billing and MetroPCS and [Leap] as well as strong performance year over year in messaging volumes, as international traffic and new services for Internet portals and commerce sites began to ramp. These gains were offset by the decline in connectivity and database revenues from AT&T and others. ", "In terms of business metrics, we delivered over 17 billion database queries in Q3, up 19% year over year. We also processed billing and payment services for approximately 9.3 million wireless users, up 29% year over year. The 10 billion SMS messages we helped deliver in the quarter represents more than a 100% increase from the year-ago period. Premium messaging and MMS volumes were up significantly as well. ", "As we have discussed before, the consolidation and pricing pressures in our domestic carrier base have impacted our legacy business over the last 12 months. To combat this reality, we have focused on expanding our Communications and Commerce footprint internationally. We believe we have made solid progress towards this goal this year, as new relationships in Korea, Singapore and China should provide incremental growth in network and messaging services as we look towards 2007. ", "In short, while volumes in the C&C business continue to grow at healthy rates, we expect revenues will be somewhat choppy over the next 12 to 18 months as we deal with the consolidation and pricing pressure inherent in the business. ", "That being said, we are executing to a plan that offsets the domestic declines with new revenues generated from international penetration, new products such as intelligent analytics and VoIP services and, importantly, the refresh of our pre- and post-paid billing systems, which are rolling out as we speak. ", "Now, let's move to the Content line of business. Overall, we achieved revenues of $89 million in the Content business during the quarter. Direct-to-consumer B2C revenues came in at $73 million, slightly ahead of our forecast, while B2B revenues came in at $16 million. With the successful completion of the m-Qube acquisition, as well as continuing momentum in our other B2B initiatives, we successfully established new relationships during the quarter with several television networks, branded media players and consumer product companies. We expect these relationships to begin to contribute to our results as early as this quarter. ", "One area of particular note is the interactive TV space. There are at least ten television shows on the new fall schedule that feature home audience participation through the use of premium text messaging and voting over mobile phones. VeriSign is operating the end-to-end solution for the vast majority of these shows, using technology and infrastructure brought to us with the m-Qube and 3united acquisitions. The executive producers of these shows tell us that they are intrigued by the possibilities that our interactive services allow them to increase live viewership, promote new products and generate incremental revenue. ", "Of course, the biggest news in the Content group during Q3 was the announcement in early September of our intention to form a joint venture with News Corp for direct-to-consumer mobile entertainment services. We believe the joint venture brings together the world's leading media and entertainment company with the most successful mobile content company. By combining Jamba!'s technology platform and international customer base with News Corp's brands, network assets and global reach, we believe we will have the world's first vertically-integrated mobile entertainment company. ", "As we announced previously, News Corp and Fox will have a 51% controlling stake in the venture, while VeriSign will provide connectivity and other services to the JV. The joint venture will also become the m-commerce platform for the very popular MySpace properties. VeriSign will continue to focus independently on B2B services for both mobile and broadband content distribution. The final agreements and regulatory approvals are expected to be complete by year end. Once consummated, VeriSign will no longer consolidate Jamba!'s revenues into our P&L. Dana will provide some more detailed financial guidance on how to model this for 2007 purposes in a few minutes. ", "All in all, we are excited about our partnership with News Corp, and believe the transaction is clearly in the best interest of our shareholders. With a clear and renewed focus on providing intelligent infrastructure solutions to B2B customers, we believe we have now assembled a comprehensive portfolio of content services that carriers, media companies, Internet portals and consumer products brands can leverage to accelerate their go-to-market plans for interactive mobile and broadband services. There's a lot more to come here as we head into next year and roll out several new offerings in the space. ", "So, in summing up the Communications Services Group for Q3, I think it is fair to say that our results came in as planned, and that we hope that the greatly expanded portfolio of new services will help balance the revenue distribution in CSG for 2007. We remain optimistic about the growth opportunities that exist across the business, including messaging, international signaling and content services. ", "Now, let's move to the Internet Services Group. The ISG Group contains our Information Services business and our Security Services business. VeriSign Information Services provides the global infrastructure that enables intelligent network interactions for naming, supply chain and real-time publishing applications. While we are very excited about the longer-term potential to build $100 million plus businesses in the supply chain and real-time publishing market, the main driver in VIS continues to be the naming business for .com and .net. ", "During the third quarter, we processed approximately 6.1 million new registrations for .com and .net domain names. We also saw another 7.9 million names renewed or extended, adding up to 14 million domain name transactions in the quarter, up 28% from the year-ago period. Renewal rates remain strong as well, coming in at 77% for the quarter. VeriSign's adjusted base of active names at the end of the period stood at 61.4 million, up 7% sequentially and 31% year over year. ", "Remarkably, our ATLAS infrastructure is now handling, on average, more than 20 billion DNS requests per day. That's 20 times the rate of just five years ago. We have also over-provisioned the ATLAS constellation in order to handle peak loads and Internet attacks that drive performance and stability requirements several orders of magnitude higher than these rates. After four years of proven performance, ATLAS is living up to its promise as the most technologically advanced and scalable real-time directory in the world. ", "Many of you have asked about the status of our new contract with ICANN. Just to recap the facts, VeriSign and ICANN have mutually signed a new agreement which extends our contract for operating .com through 2012, and provides for much clearer processes for new product introductions and contract renewals. It also settles all disputes between our respective organizations. That signed contract is now in the hands of the Department of Commerce for approval, and stipulated in their memorandum of understanding with ICANN, which was recently extended for another three years. ", "Just to be clear, as of today, neither VeriSign nor ICANN have been asked by the Department to make any changes to the signed agreement. We still believe the new agreement is in the best interest of the Internet community, ICANN and VeriSign, and continue to have constructive dialogue with the Department. That's really all the news there is at the moment. However, we do expect to have a decision soon. ", "Moving on to our intelligent supply chain services, we also saw continued momentum in the quarter, with several new ones for our RFID consulting services and our retail point-of-sale services. In fact, we signed two major infrastructure partners for point-of-sale demand data, including one of the top 10 retailers in the US. ", "There was good momentum on the real-time publishing front as well. We believe we are now handling over 80% of all global ping traffic at over 7 million feeds per day, up 40% quarter over quarter. We are also serving over 220 million aggregate news articles on a daily basis. Additionally, we are now harvesting news from over 26,000 sources and tracking over 11 million blogs and RSS feeds. As the real-time web continues to flourish, we will look to become the authoritative source of information for enterprises, web portals and media companies. ", "So overall, the VIS team is executing well on the naming front, and beginning to establish a blue-chip list of customers in the supply chain and real-time publishing businesses, including L'Oreal, Cephalon, Yamaha and Lucent. ", "Moving to our Security Services unit, we sold over 136,000 SSL certificates during the quarter, up 11% year over year. This brings the VeriSign active base to 536,000 units. With the completion of the GeoTrust acquisition, we now bring their 245,000 active units into the family, for a grand total of 781,000 SSL certificates in service around the globe. ", "As we said when we announced the acquisition, GeoTrust's channel-focused products and well-established reseller base extend our capabilities in coverage in the SSL space. With high assurance, or as they are now officially being called, extended validation certificates, coming with the launch of Vista next year, the SSL businesses is poised for strong growth in 2007. ", "On the enterprise side of Security, we're starting to see much broader industry segmentation in our sales efforts as risk management, compliance and business continuity become mainstream issues for corporations and government agencies. During the quarter, we had a broad base of customer wins for our managed security, unified authentication and fraud detection services. Notable contract awards included Honeywell, JP Morgan, HSBC, Wal-Mart, American Express, MasterCard and BlackRock. ", "In the public sector, we continue to see strong adoption by civilian and DoD agencies of our iDefense Security Intelligence Services, and we also secured a strategic win with the Department of Education for PKI and smart card management services in support of the HSPD-12 mandate. We would expect additional HSPD-12 opportunities to heat up as we head into 2007. ", "As we projected on last quarter's call, revenues in the overall Security Services businesses were up 5% sequentially. We did see some weakness in Japan and Europe, which is not all that surprising in the summer season, but we are closely monitoring both regions this quarter to determine if there are other trends emerging. ", "Before summing up the Internet Services Group, I wanted to point out an important partnership announcement we made last week with Symantec. The companies have agreed to work together to integrate the VeriSign Identity Protection technology and network services with Symantec's ubiquitous Norton Desktop. We hope to eventually reach Symantec's installed base of over 50 million Norton users with easy-to-use consumer authentication and fraud detection services that can help prevent identity theft and reinforce consumer confidence in online transactions. ", "VeriSign and Symantec each have strong consumer brand awareness in our respective markets. By supporting the VIP network, Symantec now joins eBay, PayPal, Yahoo! and Schwab in promoting VeriSign's vision for strong authentication for consumers. So the ISG group in total had solid performance in Q3, and its lines of business are all seeing good demand as we finish the year. ", "Now, let me say a few words about Q4 and some other items before turning it over to Dana. The continuing momentum in the Internet Services Group, coupled with our new services for both mobile and broadband content, provides some momentum as we head into the final quarter of the year. We would expect growth across both the Internet and Communications Services Groups for Q4, as strong domain name, SSL and mobile messaging demand continue. ", "Like many companies in our space, we have also begun our strategic planning for 2007. While we are many weeks away from completing that work, some basic themes for next year are clear. Customer intimacy, product synergy and margin expansion will drive our 2007 plan. Let me drill down on each point, starting with customer intimacy. After talking with many of our largest customers over the last six months, it is very clear that they want to do business with fewer vendors who understand their specific opportunities and challenges, and who can offer more strategic end-to-end capabilities. We plan to be one of those vendors. ", "In terms of product synergy, we now have more development and operation professionals within VeriSign than at any other time in our history. This organic capability to create intellectual property and deliver integrated services is a unique competitive advantage that we believe we can now exploit to bring new services to market more quickly. ", "Lastly, in terms of margin expansion, we believe the platforms, people and processes of the Company are now well-positioned to allow us to accelerate our operating leverage as service volumes grow. ", "From an external perspective, this means we plan to enter 2007 with a single global sales and services organization and a unified products group combining all our product marketing and development resources. We believe these changes, coupled with continued volume growth on our core platforms and the divestiture of a controlling stake in the Jamba! business, will allow us to drive the margin expansion we are after. ", "In short, we are focused on serving our customers better, driving more innovation with our people and accelerating our operating margin expansion. ", "Our planning work will continue through the rest of the quarter. Dana will give you a high-level view of our financial goals for 2007 in the moment, but we won't be in a position to answer more detailed questions until a later date. One announcement we can make is that, given the Jamba! divestiture and the move to a single products organization, Vernon Irvin has decided to pursue opportunities outside of VeriSign. He will be transitioning his responsibilities to Mark McLaughlin, the current head of VIS, over the next few weeks. The Board and I want to thank Vernon for his numerous contributions over the last few years, and wish him well in the future. ", "So with that, I want to thank you for your attention. Now, I will turn the call over to Dana. ", "Dana Evan", "Thanks, Stratton, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Before discussing VeriSign's performance in Q3, I would like to start with a quick recap of our internal review and analysis related to VeriSign's historical stock option grants. As you'll recall, this review was initiated by our Board of Directors and is ongoing. The Board currently anticipates completing this process before the end of the year. As such, we will not be providing full GAAP or non-GAAP results at this time. We will provide you with as much financial information as possible, including preliminary non-GAAP results and guidance. ", "Please note, though, that these are preliminary numbers, and represent what we believe the numbers would be without any impact or changes resulting from the stock option investigation. So, now, let's turn to the financial results for the quarter, starting with revenue. ", "On a consolidated basis, VeriSign reported third quarter revenue of $400 million. The revenue results are consistent with our previous guidance, and demonstrate the continued strength we have seen throughout the year in our ISG business as well as the stabilization we are now experiencing in the Jamba!/Jamster! B2C business. ", "Looking at the detailed revenue for the quarter broken down by reporting unit, the Internet Services Group grew 5% sequentially, delivering approximately $197 million of revenue or 49% of the total. We saw equally consistent growth from both the VIS and the VSS segment. The GeoTrust acquisition, which closed late in the corner, contributed less than $1 million of revenue. ", "The Communications Services Group reported $203 million of revenue for Q3. As a percent of total revenue, the Communications Services Group represented 51% in the quarter. Within the core Communications and Commerce line of business, revenues were $114 million and in line with our expectations. ", "The Mobile Content business, which includes Jamba!/Jamster! as well as our Mobile and Broadband Infrastructure Services, delivered revenues of $89 million. Jamba!/Jamster! represented $73 million of this number, which was slightly higher than our expectations for revenues, in the $70 million range. Moving to our international operations, the percentage of revenue driven from our international customers, affiliates and subsidiaries was 29% for Q3. ", "Preliminary non-GAAP gross margin came in better than the 63% range we had previously guided to, at 64.6%. This was mainly the result of better than expected revenues in the Content business, which in turn drove gross margins up a bit. Q3 operating expenses were in line with our expectations, driving a 20% operating margin for the quarter. ", "As it relates to headcount, we ended the quarter with approximately 4,860 employees, up from 4,640 in Q2. The majority of this increase came through the GeoTrust acquisition and hiring in our Operations and Infrastructure Group. ", "Preliminary non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 were $0.24, in line with our expectations and consistent with our previous guidance for Q3. This earnings per share calculation uses a 30% tax rate and a diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 247 million shares for Q3. ", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items, cash balances decreased by $26 million in the quarter, translating into cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $709 million. Significant components contributing to cash balances at the end of the quarter included outflows related to the GeoTrust acquisition of $125 million and loan payments against the credit facility of $100 million, which occurred early in the quarter. These outflows were offset by increased borrowings in the credit facility, strong collection efforts and healthy operating cash flow. ", "As it relates to accounts receivable, net DSO for the third quarter was 50 days, down from the previous quarter's DSO of 52 days, due to the strong collections activity within the Communications Services Group. Total deferred revenue on the balance sheet was $590 million at the end of Q3, up $30 million from the previous quarter. While the GeoTrust acquisition added an additional $10 million in deferred revenues, core deferred revenue growth was solid, with a $20 million increase. This was driven primarily from strong bookings in the Security business and better-than-expected sales of new and renewed common net names. ", "Moving on to cash flow metrics, preliminary operating cash flow for Q3 came in consistent with our guidance at approximately $90 million, driven by strong net income and favorable balance sheet trends. Lastly, with Q3 capital expenditures of $36 million, free cash flow for the quarter was in the $50 million range before taking into account acquisitions. So, that concludes the financial review. ", "Let me now turn towards our outlook for Q4. As it relates to revenue guidance for the quarter, we anticipate revenues in the $415 million to $420 million range. This reflects the expectation that the Communications Services and Internet Services Groups each will represent approximately 50% of revenue in Q4. In the Communications Services Group, we are forecasting a modest uptick in the core Communications and Commerce revenue and sequential growth in the Content business, including Jamba!/Jamster!. This would represent the first sequential growth we have seen in this business over the last six quarters. This guidance also reflects the anticipation that the Internet Services Group experiences consistent growth in Q4. ", "Turning to margins for Q4, we would expect gross margins in the 64% range, and in terms of operating expenses, we will continue to execute our plans for investing in growth and next-generation services, while remaining focused on expense management in all areas across all businesses. This would suggest an operating margin for Q4 consistent with Q3, in the 20% range. I would also like to point out this margin guidance does include a full quarter's worth of expenses from the GeoTrust acquisition. ", "Taking into account our forecast for interest expense, which we net against our normal quarterly interest income, we would look for net other income of approximately $3 million in Q4. We are currently precluded from stock repurchases, due to our internal review of stock option practices. Therefore, we would forecast a diluted share account of approximately 247 million shares for the quarter. ", "Taking into account the revenue, margin and share count guidance that I just laid out, we would look for preliminary pro forma earnings per share in Q4 of $0.25 to $0.26 on an after-tax basis, using a 30% effective tax rate. This EPS guidance also reflects a full $0.01 worth of dilution in Q4 relating to the integration of the GeoTrust acquisition. ", "So, to sum it up, we were pleased with the financial results and business metrics delivered in this past quarter, and also with the continued execution on our strategic initiatives. As we head into Q4, we look for a strong finish to the year, driven by solid performance we expect from the Internet Services Group, continued growth in the Content business and modest growth in the core Communications and Commerce business. ", "Before we open up the call for questions, let's just talk briefly about a few items relating to 2007. As Stratton mentioned earlier, we are anticipating our joint venture with Fox/News Corp to close at the beginning of the new year. As a housekeeping matter, for those of you with 2007 financial models, we would recommend adjusting those models to reflect the concurrent divestiture of the Jamba!/Jamster! business and the formation of the new joint venture. VeriSign will hold a 49% minority ownership stake in this new JV. Therefore, in 2007, the Jamba!/Jamster! revenue will no longer be consolidated in our financials, nor will the related operating expenses and operating income be reflected in the P&L. ", "Our standalone internal Jamba! models for 2007 would have forecast approximately $300 million to $350 million in revenue and operating margins in the high teens to low 20% range. On a go-forward basis in 2007, we will begin reporting our 49% interest of the new JV's income as a component of the other income section on the P&L. After the JV closes and we complete the planning for the new entity, we will update guidance to reflect this 49% share of forecasted JV income. ", "So, as we think about the upcoming year and our business outlook for VeriSign, we would anticipate 2007 to be a year of solid growth in all financial areas: revenue, growth and operating margins and earnings. We would look for a year in which revenues are expected to grow by at least 15%, with margins continuing to expand on a quarterly basis over the course of the year. This should naturally drive an earnings growth rate that exceeds the anticipated revenue growth rate, consistent with our overarching financial strategy. We expect to be giving you a more detailed look at 2007 on the Q4 earnings call in January. ", "With that, I would like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, may we have first question, please? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. Is there any way to quantify what the contribution from GeoTrust was in the quarter? ", "Dana Evan", "It was less than $1 million and slightly dilutive to the EPS number. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. A question on the tax implications of the joint venture, Dana. Are you going to be reporting your interest actually post a different tax rate that would be applied to the JV? ", "Dana Evan", "I think we're going to have to update you on that once we get the final definitive agreement closed with the JV. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "All right, no worries. That is all for me now, thanks. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Just following up on Ed's question on GeoTrust, can you give us a feel for what you expect GeoTrust to do during the Q4 period? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "It's probably going to be a few million dollars. I think you have to remember that's an SSL business like our own that had a high component of deferred revenue, the majority of which you have to write down as you bring it in. So it will do a few million dollars. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Back to this Jamba! discussion, Dana. If we look at the implications for gross margin in \u201807, would you expect gross margin to go up or down with Jamba! separated out? ", "Dana Evan", "I think it's a little early to tell, because we're still doing our planning for the rest of the businesses, but I would not expect it to go down. If anything, it would be flat but with a slight uptick. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Any thoughts in terms of potential impact for CapEx as we look at 2007? ", "Dana Evan", "The CapEx that we spent on the Jamba! business is relatively small, so it shouldn't really have much effect. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think Todd, just on the margin question, on the operating margin side, it's likely to push margins up. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Right. But on gross margins, you think it is relatively stable with where we are now? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Right. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty \u2013 JP Morgan. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Thanks. Within the ISG Group, can you give us a sense of the split between the VeriSign Information Systems and the Security part of the business for the quarter? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We don't break those out, Sterling. I think both of them saw good growth, 5% plus in both cases. So they are growing more or less at the same rate, but obviously the naming business is throwing a lot more into deferred. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Is there any color you can give us in terms of the costs that are associated with the option investigation? ", "Dana Evan", "Yes. So, that was several million dollars in the quarter. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Should that be about the same for the fourth quarter, then? ", "Dana Evan", "Yes. It could be a little bit more. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks very much. Stratton and/or Dana, on the ISG, given the breakout for Q4 guidance, that would suggest yet another quarter of 20% plus growth. I know you don't want to break out certain things, Stratton, but is it possible to get a little more color on some of the drivers for next quarter and beyond? You talked a little bit about some authentication motivations there. Is eBay doing well? Or any kind of color we talked about before, just give us a little more clarity on where the growth is coming from. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Sure. Well, let's start on the naming side of the business. We're just continuing to see very strong volumes. The last four weeks have been highest volume rates of similar period all year. Obviously, the renewal rate kicked up a point again in that business during Q3. So we are continuing to see very, very strong performance. It's pretty clear that the overall business in naming will be more than 30% up this year. ", "I think in the supply chain and real-time websites, still small businesses, but in some cases we're seeing 40% and 50% growth rates year over year on a quarterly basis from what those same businesses would have done last year. So they are not big businesses, but as we had talked about earlier this year, we do see them as emerging businesses starting to hit their revenue ramps. ", "As we look to security, Peter, obviously SSL, especially with the contribution of GeoTrust, is going to continue to be the leading product in our Security space. But we did, with the Symantec announcement, I think nail another strong relationship there in terms of making the OTP and authentication technology of VeriSign Identity Protection ubiquitous. ", "eBay is, in fact, rolling out its pilot in the fourth quarter here and I have seen plans for them for worldwide rollouts beginning in Q1 of next year. So, good progress there. As I've talked about before, that's a very complex integration challenge, because they are trying to do it the throughout the entire set of eBay and Paypal properties. So, the fact that it's taking a long time is not to be unexpected. We are pretty excited about their rollout plans and the different types of authentication form factors they are looking to put into the marketplaces in 2007. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And it sounds like stability on CSG now is kind of a re-tweaking of the lineup; we are getting away from compression problems, or pricing pressure, rather. Is that stability there? Is that a good go-forward thought process? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "That's the right thought process. That's our goal, is to replace what is the low-margin eroding businesses with higher-margin revenue-producing businesses for the carriers, and for other now expanded customer sets that we can target, such as media companies and portals. So I think the transition is underway, and we're starting to see those newer businesses ramp. We're hoping, obviously, to balance that out on the other side. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Good afternoon, guys. Could you maybe give us a little bit of an update or some color on what average pricing looks like for GeoTrust? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I do not have the GeoTrust -- good question, Rob. I don't actually have that data at hand. Our average prices on the VeriSign stuff went up significantly, about 6% quarter over quarter, over $460 a retail unit. But I don't have the same data yet for GeoTrust. We will certainly provide that as we get to next quarter. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Then maybe an update on the VIP program. I know Symantec's joining the list of vendors, but when should we see rollout there? When should we see at least user accounts that you guys can talk about? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Well, we are signing several enterprise customers per quarter right now, some multi-thousand unit deals in Europe, some multi-thousand unit deals in Asia, and a few here in the US as well. So we're starting to see the traction on the enterprise side. The big consumer deployments are really staked to the eBay/Paypal rollout, which, as I said a bit earlier, pilots are starting this quarter with them and global rollouts for them beginning in Q1. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Great. Thanks, Stratton. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi guys. Just a couple of questions on the GeoTrust side. How much deferred revenue did you have to write down on the quarter? ", "Dana Evan", "We had to write down about 60% of what their balances were as we brought it over onto our books. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great. Also, when you think about just the contribution then in 2007 to your guidance, you talked about 15% overall. How much are you thinking GeoTrust is as part of that? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "It's a relatively small number on our base of overall revenues. I'm not sure we factored that in at any meaningful rate. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "When you also look at the margin structure of GeoTrust, as you start to earn back that deferred revenue, how should we think of that versus your, just the core search business? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Well, I think the combination of the two businesses is the way to think about it. It's likely that as that deferred starts coming back in, we gain efficiencies and economies of scale of delivery. You're going to see margins expand in the SSL business in \u201807 probably at a faster rate than they have in the last three to five years. ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard - Cowen. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "A couple of questions, one around the reorganization that you mentioned. It didn't sound like there was any headcount reductions or anything on that end. I just wanted to confirm that, as part of that plan. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "We are just in the early days of going through the \u201807 plan. So, as we talked about, we're going to go to a single distribution group. We're going to go to a single products group, single operations team. We're doing all the planning for that right now. So in reorienting the Company that way, we will probably have some redundant resources in some areas, and we will have other areas that will need new resources. So it's too early to tell, but certainly we always keep an eye on trying to be efficient. Hopefully, there will be some economies of scale in this as well. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "As a follow-up on Dana's comment around the next year's plan on Jamba! $300 million to $350 million. You are doing roughly $70 million, $73 million a quarter. Was that $300 million to $350 million just you, or does that include anything that Fox is contributing into that venture? If not, could you just comment on the overall revenue picture of that joint venture? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "That would have been our standalone revenue assumptions going into next year, from basically somewhere between zero to 20% growth, based on what we're seeing. Obviously, with the business having stabilized now and a little growth even expected this quarter, we probably would have projected some growth there and, as Dana said, margins in the high teens to low 20's. ", "That says nothing about what the joint venture program will be, as we put that together because you are bringing in their assets, and that team will then be responsible for building the revenue plan. So it's just too early to tell, and it's not appropriate for VeriSign to comment on what the revenue plan will be for that. ", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen", "Okay, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon. Stratton, since you were just touching on News Corp, can you talk a little bit about the other opportunities that it will bring to VeriSign, with the infrastructure that you are left behind with? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Well, sure. Certainly for the joint venture, we are going to be providing connectivity services and other application services. So there is a services agreement between the organizations where VeriSign will continue to benefit in that way. ", "Then there will be a, for lack of a better term, there will be a champion or two on the Fox side who will be the VeriSign champions within the organization to introduce us into some of their other 60 business units. Everything from Fox Interactive, which owns the broadband relationships and the broader MySpace properties, as well as some of their international operations such as STAR, operating in both China and India. ", "So, I am very excited about both the services agreement for the joint venture, but more broadly getting, hopefully a seat at the table and a right of first look at many other opportunities within Fox and News Corp. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Just a couple quick other things. On GeoTrust, just to come back to it briefly, is the goal there, as you go to market, GeoTrust tended to be a lower-priced competitor. Over time, will you try to effectively have a single VeriSign brand, or will it be like the Thawte acquisition where you very much keep separate brand names to effectively segment the market? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think it's a great question, just a little too early for us to tell. As we went through the Thawte acquisition, it became clear that keeping the brand separate was the right thing to do. So as we bring GeoTrust in and begin to market, and as we launch new services next year for things like extended validation search, we will probably refine the brand strategy, but I don't know whether that will mean fewer or more at this point. We're going to watch it pretty closely and try to see what different price segments in the market are we looking for. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just one final quick one. Thank you for the color you gave on the .com renewal. Given that it's gone to the Department of Commerce, obviously there's been Senate hearings on it. Do you feel less positive on the ability to sign the contract, or do you still feel just as confident as you did when you first signed it with ICANN? I know that's hard to gauge, but obviously there has been a lot of chatter that the Senate hearings were a little bit more negative tone, and so I just wondered what your take was on that. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think the simple thing is I feel as confident as I have from the day we signed it that will get approved, because it's the right thing for the Internet community and for ICANN and for us. I think that the Department generally agrees with that, and that's why we haven't been asked to change anything in the contract. ", "I think the longer this time period waits, you're likely to have folks who are willing to say and do anything, lobbying certain folks to try to get their positions across. But I don't think those people have much standing in the community, and I don't think they are necessarily being viewed as unbiased in their criticism. So we're very confident it will get signed. We just continue to wait for that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Hovis - Morgan Keegan. ", "Chris Hovis - Morgan Keegan ", "A quick question for you to make sure I understood a comment you made about realigning the sales force into a single unified group. Could you talk a little bit more about the rationale underlying that? Specifically, if I look at your disparate set of offerings, you're offering to a fairly diverse customer base with different needs. Where do you see the synergies there, and how will the sales force be structured or layered out? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "All great questions, Chris. First of all just to set the context, today, each of the business units has its own sales force. They go to market separately. We try to do some cross-selling, although there's no real incentives within the teams, nor are any of the particular reps targeted at cross-selling. ", "As we go to a single distribution force, basically, the sales representative and account executives will, in fact, be responsible for all the revenue done at a given customer site, and then there will be sales specialists that represent different product lines to help them get over the goal line on any of these products. ", "I guess fundamentally, what we have done over the last few years is we have gone and talked to, really, our top customers. These are the folks who generate $100 million of revenues a year with us, like the AT&T's of the world; to folks who are kind of on the Internet site of the shop, doing anywhere from $1 million to $5 million with us, like the Yahoo!'s and the Google's and the eBay's and the rest. ", "We asked them, who are your best vendors, and how do they serve you, and what do you like about it, and compare that to VeriSign and what could we be doing better? The reality is they are all coming back saying, look, the biggest thing VeriSign is challenged with is making sure we understand all the different things we could buy from you and work with you on. ", "So, you say that we are different segments, but the reality is enterprises are now looking for wireless services. Oracle has just embedded our technology in the database, so they can send SMS alerts. We have got media companies looking to do interactive marketing on broadband and mobile, not just carriers. We have got carriers now looking to try to do enterprise security services. ", "So at the end of the day, the portfolio is finally coming together in such a way that we think we can represent it to the customer set in a cohesive way, and create account executives that are really understanding the customer sets of problems and then applying the VeriSign portfolio to its best use. ", "So, yes, there are in some cases different buyers. But in many respects, customers have come back and told us, look, we want to work with you guys as a strategic vendor, and we would like to see the whole portfolio and show you all of our priorities for a year, not just keep it stovepiped. ", "So, a long-winded answer to say we're pretty confident this is what the customer set is looking for. ", "Chris Hovis - Morgan Keegan ", "No, great color, thanks for that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - JP Morgan. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Two follow-ups. Stratton, you mentioned the revenue ramp you are starting to see in some of the small but growing businesses, like e-pedigree, real-time publishing, maybe even the RFID. But can you talk about the investment that's needed to get it through that ramp? In other words, I'm sure you are in a net investment rather than a net profit situation. But when do we see the crossover point for those businesses? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Very fair question, although I would tell you we're almost at that point. Those businesses are in investment mode today, but they are measured in single-digit millions in terms of negative margin today, on a quarterly basis. So we are approaching and ramping through the breakeven point with all of those businesses, in particular, supply chain services and the real-time web stuff. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Then, can you give a little color on the B2B part of Mobile Content? Talk to us a little bit about what your experience so far now with the first full quarter of m-Qube, maybe some of the other side. Is it ramping as you thought it would? You talked about some of the agreements. How does that flow through to revenue as we move into the fourth quarter in \u201807? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Also a fair question. What you have to, I think, realize is we have gone from about a couple dozen people focused on B2B to over 700 focused on it in less than two quarters. So, there's a dramatic amount of internal work going on around integration and product roadmap, consolidation and centers of excellence development. ", "So, a lot of the work so far, as we expected it would be, has been internally focused on getting all the product roadmaps together. I think we've just come through a set of planning exercises with those teams, where we actually are getting pretty excited about where we're headed and which groups are going to develop which pieces of the platforms. ", "As you saw at CTIA, we rolled out kind of the portfolio there with something we call application services, portal services, mobile delivery and broadband delivery services. So we have the four layers now. Those architectures are set and being built out. So, I would say we have achieved on the internal side what we were hoping to achieve in getting those 700 folks focused on only building one type of product for each of those areas, and now, as we get through here into Q4, starting to ramp some of these new programs. ", "So, for example, the participatory TV or the interactive TV voting really has gone from nowhere, and bulk SMS message delivery for things like American Idol last year to where now we're looking at premium message delivery across eight or more shows, and seeing volumes ramp on a night-by-night basis on some of those networks. So, some of these things are starting to really kick in. I would say that is consistent with our expectation there. ", "Connecting into Verizon Wireless and getting other content providers through that has continued to be a slow road. We continue to work with them and the particular vendors to make sure they are bringing their content up on the platform. But we will continue to see that, I think, go slowly through the rest of this year and probably start ramping a little bit more in 2007. ", "Chris Hovis - Morgan Keegan ", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Laura Lederman - William Blair. ", "Laura Lederman - William Blair", "Just a few quick questions. Is there any risk of a potential sales disruption as you shift to a single organization in the short term? That is question one. ", "Question two, Can you talk a little bit about acquisition futures, how acquisitive you plan to be, what type of areas you would be looking in? I would assume they would be small, but if you could just talk about that a little bit. Thank you. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Good question on sales disruption, obviously one of the key things we have been looking at. So, that particular area has had a team focused on it for about the last six weeks. Our goal is to hit January 1 with a single team, all the comp plans out and the sales conference heading in the first few weeks of January, where they will be training on the different product portfolios and the reps. So, I think we're going to do all of the process-oriented things you would do. Obviously, you don't want to lose the sales force's momentum and kind of focus as they head into the new year. So, we're trying to make sure we have got all the tools and all the management, motivational tools together just to make that happen. ", "I guess one thing I would say, a little different than other companies, is because so much of our revenue comes from recurring services, what we really are focused on in the sales force every quarter is new bookings, not revenues, right? Because revenues are generally flowing through from business booked or already collected from previous quarters. ", "So, we do have a bit of a benefit there but it's unlikely we're going to come off that tracks on the revenue side because of this. But bookings are just as important to us, because that's the leading indicator of revenues for the future. So we want to make sure we do it right. ", "Laura Lederman - William Blair", "And then acquisitions? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Sure. We have been busy all year long integrating the different sets of acquisitions, especially on the mobile side. We are not, I wouldn't say, very active right now in the marketplace around these new ideas because, as I said, I think we have now got an R&D capability and an operations capability well in excess of anything we have ever had. So, we're pretty focused right now on organic development. We really don't have any particular areas of interest at the moment that we are feeling like we need to pursue. ", "Laura Lederman - William Blair", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Thanks. Since this was the first full quarter with m-Qube, I am wondering if you can provide what the revenue contribution was for Q3? Then, looking at the $16 million for B2B as a whole, how did that compare with your internal expectations? ", "Dana Evan", "The revenue contribution was about $9 million in the quarter from m-Qube. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "And the $16 million overall, Dana? Was that about what you were expecting? ", "Dana Evan", "It was a little bit light, but some of that came from Europe, which we were kind of thinking might happen, given the summertime. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Also, in terms of your strategic objectives for \u201807, you talked about accelerating operating margin expansion. I just wanted to confirm, is this acceleration above and beyond any margin benefit that you would get from the Jamba!/News Corp transaction? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yes, it is. ", "Dana Evan", "Definitely. ", "Gregg Moskowitz - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you and good afternoon. A quick question back to the domain name business, what about the international contribution? Does that continue to be strong? I don't know if you can break out, in terms of the numbers, that specific business. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think we're still seeing about a quarter of the business coming from international, which is as strong as it has been. That has been one of the key drivers over the last few years of the resurgent growth. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Have you seen any seasonality on that front? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yes. Right now, these volumes are so high, I think any seasonality is getting masked right now. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Got it. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Thank you. Just looking at the Jamba! joint venture for next year, obviously you would lose the operating income from your income statement. That would be offset by the share in the joint venture's net income that you would be reporting on your minority interest on the income statement now. It sounds like it could be dilutive to earnings, depending upon what numbers there are though, of course, it sounds like it's the right strategic move for you to make. Are there other financial aspects to that transaction that we should be aware of? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think and Dana can comment as well, that obviously there's $188 million when we close the transaction that will come onto our books. Likely uses of that are either interest income or share buybacks. I think, on the other side of it, there's just literally the opportunity then to provide services to the joint venture. You will see revenue contribution on the B2B side for VeriSign from that. But as we said, a little too early to tell exactly how to model that. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Okay. So, that would flow on your top line of the income statement, those additional services? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "That's correct. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Do you plan to restate the historical financial results to exclude Jamba! from it, from a top and bottom line basis, or will it just be reported on a going-forward basis as a joint venture? ", "Dana Evan", "The transaction doesn't qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment, so we won't be restating. ", "Kevin Buttigieg - A.G. Edwards", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co.", "I have one quick question about the options inquiry. It looks pretty clearly in your press release that you're still in the investigative phase. I'm wondering why, if that's true, you can't put out full financials? Does it mean that there's something in the investigation already that is going to compel you to restate? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "No, it doesn't mean that. It means that, on advice of counsel, we can't put out full statements because if we would have to change them, therefore we wouldn't be able to certify to investors they would be able to rely on those financials. So at this point, that's the advice of counsel. But, as Dana was saying, we are giving you preliminary results, which, if the investigation goes through and there is no restatement, these results would have been the results we would achieve. ", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Co.", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities. ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Just two final questions. First, on GeoTrust, what was the run rate before you acquired them on a quarterly basis? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "You know, that's a good question. Are you talking about revenue run rate? ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Yes, revenue run rate, just what to build back up to, to get to the deferred back. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think it was less than $4 million, $3 million to $4 million a quarter. But it had been growing obviously, over the course of the last few years. But again, it's a hard thing to, I think, model back, Scott. Because remember, most of the revenue in a given quarter from them was coming off the balance sheet from deferred. It's a little hard to go do and backwards-engineer that. ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Second question, just trying to get a little more clarity on this JV modeling. Are you guiding to try to make a stab at the minority interest contribution? Because we're going to definitely take the revenue and the operating income off, so that's going to take your earnings down. So is that what you are recommending for \u201807, is kind of guesstimate based on operating margin that the JV will have and your ownership, what the minority benefit will be? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think that's a reasonable assumption to put into a first model around that, is assuming it's that stand-alone model and the 49% of the income coming back. Again, that is not the JV's approved plan. That plan has not been developed or certified yet by either News Corp or VeriSign. So I just will caution everybody on that, but we're just trying to give you a roadmap as to what it would have been, stand-alone. ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "I appreciate it, thank you. ", "Operator", "That does conclude the question-and-answer session, Mr. McCallum. I'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. ", " Tom McCallum", "Great. Thank you, everyone for your time today. As always, we look forward to talking to you and answering any additional questions you may have. Thank you and good evening. ", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. ", "At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, Cynthia and good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's first quarter 2007 earnings conference call. I am here today with Stratton Sclavos, Chairman and CEO of VeriSign, and Dana Evan, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "The Q1 2007 press release is available on First Call Market Wire, as well as the VeriSign Investor Relations website at Investor.verisign.com. A replay of this call will be available beginning at 5 p.m. pacific time via telephone at 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 for interpret callers. The pass code for both phone numbers is 6843620. ", "For those of you joining us via webcast we invite to you view the slide presentation, which accompanies today's conference call and includes the summary of non-GAAP measures, used by VeriSign and a description of the items excluded in our non-GAAP financial information compared to gross GAAP. ", "All at approximately 3 p.m. pacific time we will post the same slides, as well as, some operational metrics to our website. Financial results in today's press release are unaudited, and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. ", "Specifically, the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. ", "Due to the previously announced restatement of prior period financial statements relating to the internal review of VeriSign's historical stock option grants, completed in January by our Board of Directors. VeriSign is not providing detailed GAAP or non-GAAP financials for the quarter ended March 31, 2007. Dana will provide additional detail later in this call. ", "In a moment Stratton will review our first quarter and he will provide some insights into the performance of our businesses. Dana will then follow with a discussion of preliminary non-GAAP financial results for Q1. Following Dana's remarks we will open the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted, and be anticipate this call will end at approximately 3 p.m. ", "With that I will like to turn the call over to Stratton. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me add my welcome to all of you attending today's call. As our results for Q1 indicate, we saw overall performance for the company that was in line with our expectations to start the year. Revenue for the quarter came in at $379 million. Revenue growth, excluding the contribution of Jamba! was 4% quarter-over-quarter and 20% year-over-year. ", "Other highlights in the quarter included the continuing momentum in our two core franchising of DNS and SSL and the announcement of our project Titan initiative to expand and fortify our global infrastructure. The Titan initiative will allow us to reliably service the continued growth in Internet usage and protect against increasing threats and cyber attacks. ", "On the strategic front, we continue to make progress and see strong interest in our content delivery services, especially for video-on-demand solutions. We're also making good progress in the consumer authentication market, as adoption of our VeriSign identity protection services through eBay's PayPal units has been strong since the February launch. ", "As we discussed on last quarter's call, we believe 2007 marked a new phase for VeriSign. We have reorganized the company with maniacal focus on customer success, rapid innovation and expanded operating leverage. While we're only a quarter into our new structure, I can say that we're pleased with the earlier results and committed to our full year plans. ", "Like many successful companies, one of VeriSign's core assets on our people. Their commitment and passion continue to drive our execution against our strategic goals. Over the last ten years, however, we have invested a significant amount of development and capital into another core asset, our globally deployed digital infrastructure. ", "While initially used only for our DNS business, our digital infrastructure is quickly becoming the foundation for critical components of almost all of our customer facing services. The VeriSign infrastructure has unique scope, with state-of-the-art capabilities and intelligent routing, ultra high performance directories, massively distributed storage, IP and SS7 signaling and real time monitoring. ", "It has unmatched scale with more than 70 global points of presence, 64 gigabit per second of network bandwidth, 15,000 computing nodes and over 1,000 technology professionals, all supporting over 400,000 customers every day. ", "And lastly, we believe it gives us a global advantage, with five nines reliability, instant scalability, network and protocol independence, and a global view into escalating online activity and threats. ", "Today, in addition to our global Internet services for DNS and SSL, this infrastructure is also providing key components for our emerging services in messaging, security, and content delivery. These capabilities are helping us deliver new industry focused solutions for customers in telecommunications, media and entertainment, financial services, and large scale enterprises. ", "With the emergence of consumer driven web services and the surge in web-ready wireless devices, the Internet we know today is radically different from the one that we knew just five years ago. Project Titan will take us beyond Atlas, our current infrastructure architecture and into a new realm of performance and scale. ", "By 2010 we'll have more than 100 points of presence, with an aggregate 200 gigabits per second of network bandwidth, capable of handling over 4 trillion interactions per day. Titan gives us the headroom we need to enable and protect the world's network interactions as we head into the next decade of Internet growth. ", "It also gives us the platform to maintain our leadership in existing services, while we develop new services that can leverage the same scope, scale and reach. We plan to more fully discuss our digital infrastructure capabilities and plans at our upcoming analyst day. ", "Moving now to the business metrics for the quarter, I want to start by reminding you that we're currently evaluating new reporting segment that is better aligned with the new organizational model and our key strategic objectives. We appreciate all the suggestions we have received from both the buy side and sell side and hope to have our thoughts finalized in the next few months. ", "That being said, we will report Q1's metrics in a consistent manner with last quarter. So, let's begin with the information and security product lines. The information and security services product line includes our core DNS and SSL services, as well as, managed security, real-time publishing and supply chain offerings. ", "We saw continued strength in our DNS registry business, as we processed approximately 7 million new registrations for .com and .net domain names. We also saw another 10 million names renewed or extended, adding up to a record 17 million domain name transactions in Q1. ", "Renewal rates remain strong as well, coming in at an estimated 76% for the quarter. VeriSign's adjusted base of active names at the end of the period stood at 69 million, up 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Growth came from all segments of the market, including traditional corporate and SMB, international, and pay-per-click. The pay-per-click size of the market remains a small, but consistent percentage within our new name sales and overall base. ", "With the continuing rise in internet users and usage, our digital infrastructure is now handling an average of 30 billion DNS requests per day, up almost 70% from year ago levels. ", "We also recently announced that effective October 15th, 2007, prices for .com and .net names would increase by 7% and 10% respectively to $6.42 and $3.85. Additionally, consistent with our new contract with ICANN, we received approval to launch a new real-time zone update service. ", "Through this new service accredited registrars and other potential customers we will be able to see changes to our zone files every five minutes. This type of data service is one of many we hope to launch in the coming years. While we do not expect the initial service to contribute materially to our results, it does pointed to the benefits inherent in our new contract with ICANN, as it relates to the rapid development and approval of new services. ", "Moving to our security services business, we'll start with the core SSL offerings. We sold over 202,000 SSL certificates during the quarter. This brings our combined VeriSign active base to 850,000 units, up 5% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. We're also the first company to introduce and issue extended validation certificates to support new security features in Microsoft's Vista and IE7 products. ", "Demand for EV certificates was solid in Q1 through both the retail and enterprise channels. To date we have sold over 1,000 EV certificates, which we believe establishes us as the number one provide in the market by a very wide margin. ", "We would expect the EV adoption cycle to be consistent with previous premium priced SSL products, and as such we're anticipating domestic up sell rates of 5% in the retail channel and 10% in the enterprise channel by the end of this year. Performance in Q1 would suggest we are on track to meet these targets. ", "In order to provide better transparency into the financial drivers of the SSL business, we are introducing two new metrics for Q1 '07. The first is annualized average selling price across the entire base of VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte Branded certificates. The second is average term. ", "The annualized ASP in Q1 was $290, up from $273 in Q4. The average term in Q1 was approximately 16 months. Moving forward, these new metrics, combined with the active base numbers, should give a very clear picture of the impact of the overall SSL business to the VeriSign P&L. ", "An exciting emerging business we've been developing over the last two years is our consumer authentication offering. VeriSign identity protection services and the VeriSign identity protection network, combined to provide a network based authentication paradigm for the Internet at large. ", "Hardware or software credentials that are VIP certified, such as the new display card from Innovative Card Technology that was introduce this week can be used acrossed all participating VIP partner sites, to provide strong authentication and protect against identity theft. ", "Leading e-commerce and online financial service companies such as eBay, PayPal, Yahoo and Charles Schwab have signed on the issue and/or accept VIP credentials at their site. With PayPal\u2019s official rollout in February, we've seen strong initial up take over the credentials by consumers and expect to see adoption continue to ramp throughout the summer. ", "The network component of VIP is a perfect example of an Internet scaled service that runs on our global infrastructure, providing the scalable and secure real-time validation capability that can support millions of online users. ", "Rounding out the security services portfolio is the MSS and iDefense services for network protection. We now actively manage and monitor over 5,000 network devices and provide advanced threat detection remediation services for leading enterprises around the world. Recent news coverage regarding A&I and DNS security threats highlight the importance of these services to our customers as we were able to proactively warn, isolate, and ultimately protect their networks from harm. ", "We believe our layered security approach to protecting end-users, websites and networks gives our customers the ability to exploit the opportunities in today\u2019s Any Era. We also believe we have the right portfolio of security services at the right time in the market. ", "Let's now move to our communications product lines. We're reporting the communications revenue in three categories for Q1. The first is communications in commerce, which includes our network database and billing services. ", "The second is content and messaging, which includes our wireless and broadband content services combined with our wireless messaging services. ", "And the third category is the professional services, which predominantly include our wireless consulting and implementation services. Dana will provide the revenue break down by product line. ", "Please note that the revenue associated with messaging services that was previously rolled out within communications of commerce is now in the content and messaging breakout. ", "A key driver in the legacy C&C business in Q1 was the continued growth in wireless billing at MetroPCS and Leap, as we now support over 11.4 million wireless users with our billing and payment services up 39% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. ", "These gains were offset by a decline in connectivity and database revenues as well as a lack of new demand for our prepaid services during the quarter. We would expect this dynamic to continue throughout the course of 2007. ", "Now let's move to the content and messaging product lines. We saw a strong growth in messaging volumes during the quarter as we delivered over 16 billion SMS messages, up 118% from the year ago period and 22% sequentially. Premium messaging and MMS volumes in the quarter were up 48% year-over-year to 93 million messages. ", "Important to point out, however, that we are seeing some challenge in the core messaging business both internal and external. On the internal front we've seen slower than planned integration of our technical platforms and some recurring service issues. These are being addressed very a aggressively by a senior cross-functional team and we believe we'll have the issues resolved in the next few months. ", "External issues include pricing pressures as competitors become more aggressive and or desperate. We would expect the market to stabilize later in the years as consolidation occurs and more advanced services take hold. ", "We remain optimistic about the messaging business becoming our next core franchise as market growth, customer interest and our ability to leverage our global infrastructure all look promising. ", "On the content delivery front we continued to see strong interest in our Intelligent Content Distribution Network or ICDN. The ICDN is designed to support the delivery of all forms of content including long format high definition video, high fidelity audio and large software applications. ", "The service combines advanced video streaming capability with our proprietary Kontiki peer-to-peer technology and our globally deployed digital infrastructure. As such the ICDN can provide unmatched scale and efficiency in delivery of rich media content. ", "With the market for Internet based video-on-demand beginning emerge, we are targeting our ICDN services as media and entertainment companies, network service providers and large distributed enterprises. Our simple goal is to establish ubiquitous platform for legitimate peer assisted delivery of professional and user generated content. ", "We believe the VeriSign ICDN solution positions us to be a market leader over the long-term. Our proven peer-to-peer technology is now in its sixth generation and is powering three of the four leading sites that is provide long form high resolution video services over the internet. ", "At the recent national association of broadcasters show, we announced the partnership with Lions Gate Entertainment to build and promote a showcase for rich media delivery. The online showcase uses Lions gate content and VeriSign technology and demonstrates an integrated offering of our three screen solutions. Please visit www.verisign.tv to get a pre view of the next generation of integrated entertainment services. ", "Moving on to the professional services area, we now have combined our all our consulting and implementation teams into a single group. As we discuss on last quarter's call, the inCode acquisition gives us a well respected consulting and implementation team to leverage as we begin to offer end-to-end solution to our largest customers. I would say that the early returns are very promising in terms of being able to raise the level of executive engagement and commitment on some of our most important projects. ", "So, in summing up Q1, I would say our new organization hit the ground running and delivered what we expected. Our goals for the year are very straightforward. We call it VeriSign 3D to drive, disrupt, and deliver. Using our unmatched digital infrastructure, we want to drive continued momentum in our core DNS and SSL franchise while we disrupt the new emerging markets such as video-on-demand and consumer authentication and deliver customer success, rapid innovation and operating leverage for our customers, employees and shareholders. ", "Thanks for your attention, and now let me turn the call over to Dana. ", "Dana Evan", "Thanks, Stratton, and thanks to all of you for joining us this afternoon. Before discussing VeriSign's financial results, let me start with a quick update regarding the restatement of our prior period financial statement. ", "As you recall in January we publicly announced that the ad hoc group of independent directors had substantially completed its review of VeriSign's historical stock option grants. We also announced that this review did not find any intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the senior management team. ", "On March 1st we filed a notice with the SEC disclosing that we would be unable to file our 2006 10-K because the audit of the restatement had not been completed and that we intend to do file this 10-K as promptly as practicable after completion of the restatement audit. ", "As a reminder, this restatement will affect the years and interim periods from 2002 to 2005 as well as the first quarter of 2006. This restatement will drive additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to past stock option grants within the financial statements for these periods. ", "In light of these ongoing activities, we will not be providing full GAAP or non-GAAP results at this time. We will provide you with as much financial information as possible including preliminary non-GAAP results and guidance. ", "Please note, however, that these are preliminary numbers and represent what we believe the numbers would be without any impact or changes resulting from the stock option review and restatement. ", "Now let's turn towards our first quarter financial results. Overall Q1 was a solid quarter for VeriSign. We delivered revenue and operating results in line with the business outlook we provided last quarter and saw continued strengthening in our balance sheet. ", "These financial results were delivered while we underwent significant change across the Company executing on our companywide reorganization and the restructuring associated with that, divesting our Jamba mobile content business and integrating our acquisition of inCode. ", "On a consolidated basis VeriSign delivered Q1 revenue of $379 million. We continue to see sequential growth in our core businesses with especially strong performance from our SSL and DNS franchises. ", "The revenue within professional services was a bit light, however, compared to what we had expected. As a reminder, the majority of revenue for professional services is recognized as projects are delivered and completed, and therefore is not as linear as our traditional recurring revenue businesses. ", "As we turn to revenue by reporting unit, I would like to point out that we will be modifying the way we report revenue in future periods. Having spent a great deal of time designing and implementing our new organizational and business structure as well as having discussed various reporting scenarios with investors we anticipate finalizing our new reporting structure shortly after completing the restatement process. ", "While not fully complete, we would expect the new reporting structure to break out professional services from our other product lines given the fundamental differences in the business model and margin structure for this business. ", "Of the remaining products and services, we will likely have a second revenue segment, which would include our core services such as naming, security, and content and messaging with a third segment representing our legacy communications and billing services. ", "We are still working through the finer points of the new reporting framework but as a rough approximation under this proposed segmentation we would have seen a Q1 revenue distribution as follows: 70% in core services, 25% in communication and billing, and 5% in professional services. ", "Now, turning to revenue under our existing reporting units, the Internet Services Group grew 4% sequentially and a healthy 20% year-over-year. This sequential growth drove approximately $212 million of revenue in Q1 or 56% of total revenue and was fueled by continued strength in domain names, sales and renewal rates along with solid traction in our Security Services business. ", "The Communications Services Group delivered revenue of $167 million or 44% of the total. CSG revenue included $25 million from Jamba! which represented one month of revenue prior to the formation of the joint venture on February 1st. Excluding this Jamba! revenue, CSG grew approximately 4% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. ", "Within our core Communications and Commerce business revenues were $90 million for the quarter excluding the messaging services. Our content services business, which includes one month of Jamba! for the quarter as well as our digital content and messaging services generated revenue of $63 million. After taking out the $25 million of revenue that Jamba! contributed content services was $38 million in Q1. ", "Geographically the percentage of revenue from our international customers, affiliates and subsidiaries was approximately 19% in the quarter as compared to 29% in Q4. This lower percentage reflects the initial effect of the Jamba! divesture, which was primarily international revenue. ", "As Q1 revenue only included one month of Jamba! results, we would expect the percentage of revenue from international customers to be lower again in Q2 reflecting a full quarter's effect of this divesture. ", "Preliminary non-GAAP gross margin reflects our anticipated decline in this metric and was slightly below our previous guidance. As you will recall, we discussed a forecast structural shift in our gross margin on last quarter's earnings call. This shift reflects the direct financial results of integrating inCode professional services into our business model, the transfer of Jamba!, which was at relatively high gross margins into the new Fox joint venture as well as an increase in fees paid to ICANN under our new agreement. ", "As we look at the gross margin mix for Q1, our professional services business had a more negative impact on gross margin than we had previously anticipated and in our core communications services revenue sharing payments made in conjunction with our C business were also higher than expected both of which caused gross margins to come in a bit light. ", "Turning to Q1 operating expenses, we saw better than anticipated expense synergies and savings which drove operating margins for the quarter that were consistent with our previous guidance of 19%. After the reduction of head count of approximately 200 people relating to our restructuring, and the transfer of another 575 people into the Jamba! joint venture, we ended the quarter with approximately 4,500 employees down from 5,330 in Q4. ", "We expect to eliminate approximately 350 positions in total throughout the year as part of our restructuring plan. For the remaining 150 restructured positions, we anticipate approximately 60% to exit the company in Q2, with the remainder occurring evenly throughout the remaining quarters of this year. ", "Moving now to the balance sheet, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of Q1 were approximately $740 million. As expected, we received approximately $188 million from news Corp during the quarter for the Jamba! business and also capitalized on the joint venture with a cash contribution in accordance with our agreement. ", "Additionally, we repaid the outstanding balance on our line of credit of $199 million. Our ability to generate positive cash flow remains consistently strong and healthy. Continued solid collection efforts in the removal of Jamba! accounts receivable from our balance sheet had the benefit of driving Q1 net DSOs down three days from the previous quarter to 45 days. ", "Deferred revenue growth is the highlight for the quarter with total deferred revenue coming in at $662 million up $48 million from the previous quarter. This record increase was driven primarily by the combination of strong sales generated in our naming business where we ended the quarter 6% higher with over 69 million names in the adjusted zone and solid bookings delivered in the SSL and authentication security businesses. ", "Our SSL business showed healthy growth adding almost $15 million to deferred revenue as our install base of certificates increased by $43,000 or 5% sequentially. Lastly, our capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $17 million, a bit lighter than we had planned as we got off to a slow spending start for the year. ", "This CapEx broke down approximately as follows: 42% in communications services group, 17% in Internet Services, and 41% for corporate and infrastructure purposes as we continue to build out our new data center and execute on project tightening. ", "Let me now spend a couple of minutes updating you on some of our Q1 and first quarter developments starting with the company wide reorganization. As you know, we reorganized the company into a new functional organization as of the beginning of the year, replacing the previous business unit structure with a new combined worldwide sales and services team and an integrated development and products organization. ", "As a result of the reorganization, we completed our formal restructuring plan in Q1 and recognized a one-time restructuring charge in the quarter of approximately $40 million. The restructuring is comprised of approximately $20 million for workforce related charges, $9 million for facilities, and $11 million for hardware, software and other miscellaneous charges. Approximately $10 million of these charges resulted in cash payments during the quarter. ", "We would expect this restructuring to drive benefits over the course of the next four quarters, and we anticipate seeing material, positive effects in Q2, which should build incrementally throughout the year as some of these initiatives are longer-lead items. As we discussed last quarter, once the restructuring is fully realized, we would anticipate annualized run rate savings in the $50 million range. ", "Our joint venture with John Corp began operations at the beginning of February. To date we are pleased with the JV's early progress and satisfied with pro forma results, which were in line with our expectations. We also announced Project Titan in February, a major initiative to expand and diversify our infrastructure ten fold by the year 2010. Project Titan is $100 million plus capital initiative spanning over the next three years. ", "As a reminder, the 2007 CapEx spending related specifically to Project Titan is reflected in our CapEx plan for the year indicating approximately $200 million of capital expenditures for 2007. Lastly in April we announced that we would be affecting price increases under our ICANN contract and that the registry fee for dot-com names were increased from $6 to $6.42 and the fee for dot-net domain names will increase from $3.50 to $3.85. ", "The increase will take effect October 15th, and due to our deferred revenue business model, we expect the increase to have less than $1 million effect on 2007 revenue, as the majority of the fee increase will impact 2008 results. ", "Let me now turn towards our business outlook for 2007. As a reminder, our guidance includes non-GAAP forward-looking statements and actual results may vary for a number of reasons including our financial restatement. ", "Drilling down a bit into current Q2 period, we anticipate we will drive revenue in a range of approximately $365 million to $370 million for the quarter representing organic revenue growth of approximately 3% to 5% relatively consistent with last quarter and driven by growth across most areas of our business. ", "As a basis of apples-to-apples comparison, Q1 revenue excluding Jamba was $354 million. As we look at anticipated margins for Q2, we would expect gross margins and operating margins will both be higher in Q2 reflecting early returns of the benefits from our restructuring effort. ", "We will continue to be focused on discipline around spending in all areas across the company as we execute on our strategic plan and invest for growth and next generation services. As it relates to other income for Q2, we would expect to see other income including VeriSign's portion of the Jamba joint venture to be approximately 6 to $7 million. ", "As it relates to the share repurchase plan, we are currently precluded from stock repurchases due to the restatement efforts. We would, however, anticipate the full re-assumption of our share repurchase program after completing the restatement of prior period financial statements. ", "That all being said, due to these factors we have not been able to execute the sizable stock repurchases that we had originally planned for Q2. That would lead to an expectation that share count for the quarter would be flat to slightly up from the 248 million in Q1 as compared to the reduced share count we had originally forecast for Q2. ", "This reduced forecast for share count also has the effect of reducing our own forecast for Q2 by approximately a penny or so of EPS. ", "Taking into account the components of the guidance I just laid out, we would expect preliminary pro forma earnings per share in Q2 to be approximately $0.25 on an after tax basis using 30% effective tax rate. As it relates to the full year, our outlook here remains unchanged. ", "We continue to expect organic top line growth to be consistent with prior guidance, calling for revenue growth of approximately 15% and leading to an expectation of approximately $1.55 billion of revenue for 2007. ", "We also continue to expect operating margins to expand significantly throughout the year exiting 2007 at 25%. These financial expectations translate into an EPS guidance range of $1.06 to $1.07 for the year. ", "In summary, we're pleased with our first quarter financial results and business accomplishments including our continued execution on strategic initiatives. As we enter the second quarter, we remain optimistic about our new opportunities, the momentum we are seeing in our core businesses and the resulting growth trajectories we anticipate for revenue, margins and earnings. ", "We continue to believe our strong financial position allows to us focus on profitable investments, expanding operational leverage, and delivering increased shareholder value. ", "And with that, we\u2019d like to open up the call for your questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "So, two quick questions, and you may have covered some of this, but in terms of the Jamba joint venture, you talked about kind of the cash contribution from an ongoing contractual perspective. Can you quantify that for us? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah, Todd. The joint venture structure has approximately 5% of the net revenues of the JV being paid to VeriSign for delivery of Gateway services. Now, there is a ramp-up period to that as we form the joint venture and get that rolling. So that's likely to be -- we\u2019ll probably kick that in fully starting in Q3. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then second question for you, just in terms of the telecom business, and I know there has been some slightly different definitions of segments here. But if I do an apples-to-apples comparison to the communications and commerce business unit in the December quarter, I kind of get a number here about 104 million down from 113. ", "Is that in the ballpark? Was that that substantial of a decline in the core business? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah, it was about 106 versus 113. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "In terms of your expectations going forward, would you expect that to stabilize or expect to continue the decline? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think we're going to still see, as we said last quarter, I think, we're expecting zero to minus 5% in kind of the legacy product lines there. Some are growing like the billing business with the wireless or the post-paid billing business is growing, whereas some of the database and network stuff is under the traditional price pressure only to be offset when we see the international volumes start to ramp, so I think you're going to still see the choppy year for the next quarter quarters and certainly as we get into the second half of the year we would like to see it\u2019s stabilize and begin to grow again. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks, Stratt. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yes. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ed Maguire with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could comment at least on some of the initial uptick you're seeing of the extended validation certificates? ", "I think providing the ASPs around the certificates is helpful, but where are you seeing initial traction and are the initial results meeting your expectations so far? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah. I think the initial up take, Ed, is more or less exactly where we thought it would be. Some of the larger brand sites and the financial service firms, as well as online merchants, who can qualify for this and see the green bar as aiding the process of getting someone to complete a sale. ", "I think we haven't really yet gotten strong deployment in the larger enterprises that have traditionally bought hundreds if not thousands of certificates. We're working many of those deals now, and we're not seeing as much international penetration yet simply because many of the guidelines that the CA form and Microsoft had worked with us on need to be tweaked a bit in order to get the international, especially the Asian markets to be conforming. ", "So I would say all-in we're seeing uptick from where we thought, and as I said, we are hoping for 5% domestic or retail up-sell domestically, 10% enterprise by the end of the year. The initial results in Q1 would say we will be at or better than those. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And you made some comments about some integration issues with your messaging platforms. What additional costs if any may be associated with that, and what would be your estimated time to resolve some of these issues? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think it\u2019s more time than it is money. We would really got the teams done and focused, and as you remember, we brought in three united MQ and our own platforms into this mix, and it\u2019s really a kind of stack of technology that has to get integrated and kind of best of breed chosen from the different architectures, so the architectural integration just took a little bit longer than we had hoped, but I don't think it is going to cost us any substantial more amount, not like another team that has to be deployed here. It\u2019s more the time and service of getting the platform stabilized and up and running. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Good afternoon, everyone. Stratton, could you talk a little about the registry? You know, $4 million is nearly a record quarter if not a record quarter for you guys there. Realistically what can we expect the year to finish out at? Can you continue this type of run rate and then on the registry front it look like renewal rates were down modestly. Any thoughts there? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Sure. The registry numbers, you're seeing a relatively consistent as we enter the year we talked about seeing some of the highest weekly new name ads that we had ever seen, and that continued throughout most of the quarter. ", "There is some seasonality month-over-month as you watch what happens in a typical Q1, Q2, Q3, but we would expect to see pretty strong numbers continue on a weekly basis here throughout the rest of the year, so my bet would be you're going to see absolute growth about the same as this in each of the quarters. ", "And as renewal rates hold steady, you know, it wouldn't surprise us to see I just saw the numbers yesterday, we certainly over 70 million names in the adjusted base now, would expect that number to probably go up by about 4 million a quarter exiting the year somewhere north of 80 million, so it\u2019s going to be a strong business again. ", "On renewal rates just to be clear, we have to estimate what those renewal rates are because people have a 45-day grace period to renew. So, the difference between 77 and 76 and the estimate we give may not be material in the end once all that flows through, and I think that's just the team's view of it heading into Q1. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Great. Fair enough. And then the second question, if I can to Dana on the gross margin front, realizing your not getting specifics but you were negatively surprised. And could you reconcile those comments given that telecom one of your weaker gross margin areas came in below plan, it looks like Jamba! maybe a little above plan and you commented it historically how that was a good gross margin area. Where did the surprise come from? ", "Dana Evan", "So, a couple of things. As it relates to your last point, Jamba!, not having two months of Jamba! at mid 60% margins certainly had it affect for the quarter overall, but we expected that, so we\u2019re really surprised as you put it. ", "We were surprised with the re-pricing in the CNM revenue agreement we hadn't anticipated that, so, that a big piece of it. And then the other piece was the revenue coming inline in professional services, I mean as you know, that's a business where the people are on Board and so if the revenue doesn't come in the gross margin is going to suffer, but we don't expect that to carry through to next quarter and view it as a one-time event. ", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Good afternoon, everyone. Dana, could you just talk a little about, or Dana or Stratton, the sales force reorganization, how is that proceeded. Are we at a point where everyone knows exactly what they're selling? ", "And then I know that the second part of that is your strategy is to lead with some consulting and services. So do you feel after the inCode acquisition that you have enough of those people in place or are there other partnerships and so on we should be looking to see you sign as milestones around that go to market strategy? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Hi, Sarah, I think the -- has really taken hold pretty much as we had hoped to it would. John and the team have kind of laid out fairly structured focus in key vertical in couple of major accounts. ", "They've done a tremendous amount of sales training of the product portfolios that we think fell into those verticals. And then the consulting teams as you say are leading in many of the situations where we're looking at very large highly integrated solutions that will require anywhere from 6 to 12 months of implementation services onsite with the customer as we roll them out. ", "From a pipeline perspective, I would tell you John and I are both very, very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of both the size of deals in the pipeline individually and the number of deals in the way it\u2019s building, but we've got to book and turn that business and implement these services. ", "So, as I said early returns on the sales force combination and the consulting add-on there are very, very good, but we're just 90 days into it. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. But you feel at this point we're kind of done in term of the actual transition and people know what it is there, is there probably like to sell on what vertical they\u2019re focused on etcetera? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah, I think -- if anything, once we see this kick in over the next one or two quarters we're likely to look for additional sales resource internationally because that will be where we now want to take kind of a second swing at this and begin to do the same thing in the international markets. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And Dana quick one for you on CapEx, it seemed kind of light this quarter. I think the lowest I have seen since going back to '05. Is there any reason why you held off? Is that a shape of things to come or is it just a light quarter and we'll see it go back to more normal levels over the next couple of quarters? ", "Dana Evan", "No, it really was. I mean you're right. It was a historically low first quarter of capital spending. I think, January everybody was focused on expecting the reorganization and making sure they had their new orders in place and had their strategies baked, and so there just wasn't any spending effectively in January. ", "And so, it will catch up here in this quarter and the next, and we still believe in that $200 million CapEx plan for the year. ", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Israel Hernandez with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. ", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Hi, good afternoon. Can you comment on the pricing environment in the messaging business, particularly in relation to what you're seeing with Sybase 365 now starting to ramp up as part of Sybase. And also with some of the small private guys that out there? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I don't think the Sybase guys are having any impact at all on us. It\u2019s really the small desperate guys who are all trying to sell themselves and in doing so they trying to show a book of business with customer names in it and probably sacrificing profitability. ", "This happened to me, MSS business three years ago on the securities side, and we saw it, and they all disappeared within a year or so. I am very confident that's likely to happen here in the messaging business and mean while many this particular business the volumes are so large we believe that there is going to be a flight to quality providers here over the course of the next twelve months, especially as large integrated meet media and entertainment companies start to rely on these types of services to do campaign marketing and integrated promotions, so long story short is I do believe this is a space that will become our next core franchise at VeriSign akin to the DNS and SSL models where we will be able to command or have a commanding market share and over time be able to have premium pricing because of the preferred brand. ", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "This is actually Terry Rice for Scott. Just a couple questions. You mentioned the telecom came in below plan and it seems like there has been a lot of competitive pricing in that area. Can you talk a little bit about how pricing was there, and then I have a couple of follow-up questions. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I think you got to be careful with this. As we said before there is six or seven different product lines there, there is post paid billing, prepaid billing, there is clearing, there is database and there is network, and they all have a little bit different set of dynamics in it. ", "In the network business that ones mostly pricing pressure, generally Syniverse and VeriSign and others kind of going at each other in various competitive bids. ", "We won Datsun during the quarter and saw some of our business not turn up that we were expecting as the incumbent went in and repriced to another customer much lower than we were willing to go. ", "So, that dynamic has been there for a few years and think it will continue in network. Database was better than we thought simply because we had predicted more roll off than we had seen. ", "Really, prepaid billing where we had expected to close some deals internationally as those were the largest prepaid market longer sales cycle than we thought, weren't able to close some of those deals, expect second half of the year we'll see some of that start to ramp. ", "So it is just a different dynamic in each of those little product lines and as I think as we go to the new reporting once we figure it out, it will be a will lot clear clearer where they all stand. But I would say we're fairly consistent with our commentary from earlier in the year we say 0% to minus 5% in the legacy qualm is a good estimate for the year and should we do better than that, it will be because things don't roll off as quickly and we see some international up take. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Okay. Great. And then related to the Jamba! JV, can you give us any quantitative amount and what that contributed to the quarter? ", "Dana Evan", "We had given guidance of $1million to $2 million, and it was in line with that guidance. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then what about how much inCode contributed? ", "Dana Evan", "Maybe the better way is, I know it is in professional services, so is that the vast majority of professional services? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yes. If you think about professional services, about $20 million for the quarter. Assume inCode is about three quarters of that, and the traditional VeriSign consulting is the other quarter. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. ", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. In the messaging business do you have any large customer concentration there, Stratton? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Not really. I think we have 10 to 12 companies that drive a significant amount of the revenue, and then lots and lots and dozens and dozens of small companies that are starting to ramp up. ", "I think what you'll see in that space is a shakeout as well on the customer front. It is really going to move to larger media companies or aggregators that are capable of licensing a broad catalog of products, so one of the things we're doing as part of our own internal work is actually refocusing to what we believe are either today's or tomorrow's larger volume customers, so I think we'll focus on fewer larger opportunities there, but today there is really not a concentration you would worry about. ", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "In terms of your B2B content services if you take Jamba! out, sequentially from $18 million to $38 million, very nice growth there, what were the driver there is, and number two am I correct in assuming that you are deriving very little revenue from Jamba! as a customer in that segment today? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yes. There is a switch in there that Dana pointed out. In going from $18 million to $38 million we've also moved the messaging revenues from what used to be commerce and communications and into this segment. So that was about $16 million in the quarter, so it really was up a few million dollars quarter over quarter as a whole. ", "We had predicted that business would be at about $160 million run rate by now. That is what it is at when you put those altogether, and we're hoping to see that continue to grow north of $200 million run rate by the end of the year. ", "So I think it is a good strong business. As you recall we just entered the B2B spaces here over the last 12 to 18 months. We're a little disappointed with our own internal execution and committed and focused on fixing that and as I said we think the market is still there to make this the next core franchise. ", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Just lastly, Dana, housekeeping question. CapEx this year still expected to get up towards $200 million with Project Titan running on for the following two years beyond that would you expect CapEx to remain up around that $200 million range maybe in 2008? ", "Dana Evan", "No. Actually the reason why it hopped up in 2007 was more due to the finalization of the build out of our new data center, and so we expect it to go back down to the $160, $170 million range for '08. ", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Perfect. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And we'll take a follow-up question from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "This is Carey Rice again. Can you talk a little about the GeoTrust certificate? You talked about the high end and now maybe about the low end a little bit? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "I am sorry, in what respect, Carey? The ASP that we gave is a blended ASP for all the brands. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Just maybe overall growth in those certificates? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "In the GeoTrust segment which was really targeted at the middle market and the reseller channel for us, we saw above plan growth there in both units and contributions, so very pleased with that performance, and continuing to leverage their presence in those markets, the VeriSign presence at the high-end and the thought presence at the low end to really cover all the spaces in the market and get better economies of scale out of the business, so we're pretty excited about the SSL business this year. It would be our favorite business and alongside DNS with its strong performance. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Okay. And then just one housekeeping. Telecommunications queries, did you give that number? You gave it generally, I think? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah, I didn't give it. I think the number was about $16.1 billion. ", "Terry Rice - Wedbush Morgan Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Dana Evan", "That's right. That's right. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Shaul Eyal with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you for that. Hi guys. Good afternoon. Certain quick question about your billing activities. Can you talk a little bit about the landscape as it relates to the post and prepaid billing activities? Are you running into the same competitors when kind of bidding for the RSPs on the pre and post paid or is it separate? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Yeah, I think in the post paid stage certainly domestically what we're really focused on is our two big customers, MetroPCS and Leap cricket both of whom themselves have developed fairly innovative payment models for their customers and targeted large Metro cities here in the U.S. including some very new buys with the latest spectrum auction. ", "So they are really driving what we are doing in post paid billing, the feature sets they need and the market coverage they need as well as converting them over the course of the rest of the year to our new billing platform. So we're really focus there and post paid this year and frankly our growth will come because of their subscriber growth, which as you saw was very healthy in Q1. ", "We would expect it to continue that way throughout the year. On the prepaid side, again mostly in the domestic space, we are where we are. Companies like U.S. cellular and the rest. Most of the growth in that space is coming from emerging markets such as India, China, and some places in Eastern Europe, where we really don't have a foot print for coverage today. ", "So it\u2019s one of the things we're looking at, but it is also why we believe some of the sales cycles for us have been a little bit longer in places like Latin America and the rest is, we're just not well represented in the markets where prepay is a hot item today. So that's one of the things we're looking at and why we backed off a little bit on our expectation for that business early in the year. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "That's helpful. Thank you. Is it also fair to assume that the post-paid gross margins are lower than the prepaid right now? ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Gross margins? ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Yes, on the post paid. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Post paid. I don't have that number in front of me. I don't know if that is a true statement or not in our model. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "All right. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We will take our last question from Scott Kessler with Standard & Poor's Equity. Please go ahead. ", "Scott Kessler - Standard & Poor's Equity", "Thanks a lot. I think you initially disclosed your stock option inquiries in late June of last year and then the company's related practices were actually mentioned in a report in mid-may of last year. ", "And I guess I am wondering why the restatements and filings haven't been completed at this point and was also wondering if you can indicate when you expect them to be completed, especially, given Dana's comments about not planning for buybacks for Q2? Thanks a lot. ", "Stratton Sclavos", "Sure, Scott. Just all we can do is really relay the facts again as the investigation started in May or early June was concluded I believe in January, February of this year. That's when the Ad Hoc Committee made its report to the Board and we made the announcement. Since that time the work has been going on with the restatement. ", "And the Committee and outside counsel believe now as we prepare the restatement that in fact we should be clear that information with the Securities & Exchange Commission. So we're in that process right now and again management really has no ability to control the dates there. We will go through the process, and we'll be done when we're done. ", "Scott Kessler - Standard & Poor's Equity", "Fair enough. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "This will conclude today's Question and Answer Session. Mr. Bond, I will turn the conference back over r over to you. ", "Ken Bond", "Thank you everyone for your time today. As always we look forward to talking with you and answering any additional questions you may have. Thank you and good evening.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, Dixie. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign\u2019s second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. I am Ken Bond, Director of Investor Relations, and I am here today with Bill Roper, President and CEO of VeriSign; and Bert Clement, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us remotely this afternoon are Mark McLaughlin and John Donovan, who will participate during the question-and-answer portion of the call. ", "The Q2 2007 press release is available on FirstCall, Market Wire, as well as the VeriSign Investor Relations website at investor.verisign.com. A replay of this call will be available beginning at 5 pm Pacific time via telephone at 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 for international callers. The pass code for both numbers is 6843620. ", "For those of you joining us via webcast, we invite you to view the slide presentation which accompanies today\u2019s conference call. These same slides will be available for download from our website after the call. ", "Financial results in today\u2019s press release are unaudited and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. ", "Specifically, the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Additionally, financial results in today\u2019s press release and the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. A description of items excluded in our non-GAAP financial information is located on our website. ", "In a moment, Bill and Bert will provide some prepared remarks and afterwards, we will open up the call to your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. We anticipate the call will end at approximately 3 p.m. ", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill. ", "Bill Roper", "Thanks, Ken. In this call we are going to modify the call format and content somewhat from past practice. Our aim is to reduce the time allocated to prepared remarks, allowing more time for your questions by focusing our discussion on key parts of our business. Further, going forward we will limit our formal guidance to next quarter revenue and operating margins. ", "My opening comments will be followed by Bert with a discussion of the financial results for the quarter and our limited guidance for the third quarter. Lastly, our shares and thoughts as they relate to the business outlook and what we believe to be the primary areas of investor interest, including our strategic business review and our capital structure, before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. This tighter format will be supplemented with more detailed information in the slides accompanying this webcast which are available for download now. ", "So with that, let\u2019s talk a bit about the second quarter. Q2 was a solid quarter as we reported total revenues of $368 million, which was consistent with our previous guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.25, also in line with the prior guidance. ", "The solid financial performance was driven by our core franchises of naming and SSL. We ended the quarter with over 73 million domain names in the adjusted zone for dot-com and dot-net compared with 69 million names at the end of the prior quarter. And our installed base of SSL certificates totaled 883,000 compared to 850,000 search at the end of the first quarter. ", "The reorganization that we announced earlier this year is continuing to bear fruit as operating margins for the quarter improved to 21.6%. ", "In addition to naming Bert as our Chief Financial Officer this quarter, we also announced that Rick Goshorn has joined our staff as General Counsel, bringing 26 years of international business and legal experience to VeriSign. Congratulations to Bert on his well-deserved promotion and welcome aboard, Rick. ", "I am also pleased that Rusty Lewis who formerly managed our Internet Domain Registry business from 2002 to 2004 has agreed to rejoin VeriSign on a full-time basis to assist us with our strategic development activities. Bert, Rick and Rusty provide a great complement to our already strong operational team of Mark McLaughlin, John Donovan, Ari Balogh and Bob Korzeniewski. ", "Finally, I am also pleased that John Roach has been appointed to the company\u2019s Board of Directors last week. John is the Chairman and CEO of Stonegate International, a private investment and advisory services company based in Dallas and was formerly Chairman, President and Chief Executive of Fiberboard Corporation. John will serve on the audit committee of the board and he brings a wealth of management experience to VeriSign. Welcome aboard, John. ", "I have been on the job for about two months now and I\u2019ve talked with a good number of our key constituencies including customers, employees, business partners and of course, our shareholders. Over this time talking with people and asking a lot of questions, I have learned much about our opportunities and our challenges and we\u2019ve begun to formulate some views on what we need to do to be successful going forward. ", "Now with that said, as my time here has been short, I will keep my comments fairly high level at this time with the commitment to you that we will provide more detail as part of our analyst day in November. ", "VeriSign is truly a great company with high-value products and services and very good positioning in the marketplace. Our core businesses have excellent brand identity and enjoy healthy economics, while our emerging businesses bring the company exciting opportunities for growth. As we look forward, we are optimistic about our third quarter and beyond, but of course we are not without our challenges. ", "Moving now to the business metrics for the second quarter, I\u2019d like to start with our information and security product lines, which include our naming and SSL services. As stated earlier, our naming business continues to show strength as the registered names for dot-com and dot-net now exceed 73 million names, an increase of 27% year over year. This growth was driven in part by the 7 million net new registrations that we processed during the quarter as well as the renewals which continue to show strength with over 10 million transactions during the quarter. So combined, we processed over 17 million new registrations and renewals this quarter, eclipsing the last quarter\u2019s record results. ", "Our renewal rate continues to remain strong, coming in at an estimated 76% for the second quarter which is consistent with prior periods. The underlying growth drivers are the same as we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters and growth came from all segments of the market including traditional corporate and small business, international and pay-per-click. The pay-per-click slice of the market remains a small but consistent part of our new name sales and overall base. Our digital infrastructure is now handling peak loads of 30 billion DNS requests per day, and that\u2019s up about 60% from year ago levels. ", "As a reminder, we announced in April that effective October 15th the registry fees for dot-com and dot-net names will increase by 7% and 10% respectively to $6.42 and $3.85 a year. ", "Moving to our security services, we\u2019ll start with our second core franchise SSL, which sold over 211,000 certificates during the quarter, bringing the installed base to 883,000. We are very pleased with this growth as it represents a 4% sequential growth in the base and a 13% year-over-year growth excluding GeoTrust. ", "We are also pleased with the results for our Extended Valuation or EV Certificates that we introduced last December. Demand for EV Certificates was solid in Q2 as bookings increased approximately 20% from the first quarter and our installed base of EV Certificates grew sharply. We are the number one provider of EV Certificates in the market at this time and we expect that the EV adoption cycle will be consistent with previous premium priced SSL products that we have had in the past. ", "The annualized average selling price across the entire base of VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte Branded certificates was $275, down from a seasonally strong first quarter which had an annualized ASP of $290. Now this decline really reflected a product mix shift as GeoTrust Branded certificates continued to grow faster than the overall portfolio and also the average term length increased to over 16 months, which contributed to the lower annualized ASP, but will also lower our future selling costs associated with obtaining renewals. ", "One of our primary emerging businesses is our identity services offering. The VeriSign Identity Protection program continues to be a great example of an Internet scaled service running on a global infrastructure to provide scalable and secure real-time validation capabilities that can support millions of online users. With PayPal\u2019s official rollout in February and recent announcement of global availability, we have seen strong initial uptake of these credentials-backed consumers and expect to see this adoption continue to ramp throughout the year. ", "I\u2019d now like to move to our Communication Services group where we report revenue in three categories. The first is digital content and messaging, which includes our wireless and broadband content services combined with our wireless messaging services. The second is communications and commerce, which includes our network, database and billing services. The third category is professional services, which is made up mostly of our wireless consulting and implementation capability. ", "Let\u2019s start with digital content and messaging. We continue to see strong growth in the core messaging volumes and the business remains a key initiative for the company. However, the pricing environment is still challenging and we really don\u2019t expect this to improve over the remainder of the year. In addition to the market pricing dynamics, last quarter we discussed some execution areas in this area as well. The good news here is that we are making progress on this front especially with our largest customers and we have aggressively focused resources on bringing stability to the technical platform. ", "We are also very pleased to have participated in the LiveEarth event earlier this month as we integrated our mobile messaging into the LiveEarth events around the globe to enable millions of participants to use their mobile phones to personally show their commitment to making a change for the environment. ", "On the content delivery front, we continue to see strong interest in our Intelligent Content Distribution Network or ICDN, which is based on our Kontiki peer-to-peer architecture. ", "Earlier this month, the BBC announced the launch of its iPlayer, which will be available to 26 million residents in the UK, making this one of the largest online video rollouts today. The BBC iPlayer which uses VeriSign\u2019s Kontiki platform for content delivery will provide users the chance to enjoy their favorite programs whenever they want. ", "We also noted the external market activity in this area highlighted by product announcements and press releases. Clearly, there is a good deal of market and investor interest here and while we are encouraged by the strong interest in our ICDN, and our propriety Kontiki peer-to-peer technology, we continued to see broader content delivery market for rich media content as a nascent opportunity, one which will take time to develop into meaningful financial results. ", "In our legacy communications and commerce business, we continue to see growth in wireless billings at MetroPCS and Leap and we now support nearly 12 million wireless users with our billing and payment services platforms. These gains were offset by a decline in connectivity and database revenues as well as continued customer defections in our prepaid services business. ", "In closing our business review, last quarter we combined our consulting and implementation teams into a single professional services organization and our results this quarter were consistent with last quarter. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Bert for a walk through of our financial results for the second quarter and guidance for the third quarter. ", "Albert Clement", "Thanks, Bill and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. As you can see from our results, we had a solid quarter with continued growth from both the Internet Services Group and Communications Services Group. Revenue and earnings per share were inline with our guidance. ", "Three noteworthy items occurred subsequent to the end of the quarter that I would like to call to your attention. The first is that over the last two weeks we filed both the 10-K for 2006 and the 10-Q for the first quarter 2007 bringing us current with the SEC. ", "The total non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to past stock option grants was $160 million, well below the $250 million we originally estimated. Additionally, we also received formal notification from the NASDAQ that the matter relating to the listing status of VeriSign on the NASDAQ marketplace has been closed. ", "Lastly, as part of the 10-Q filings for the first quarter, we disclosed our decision to sell Jamba services and as a result, Jamba services will be reported as discontinued operations until the final disposition which we expect to be in the third quarter. The non-GAAP results we will discuss throughout this call include continuing operations as well as Jamba services. For the second quarter, Jamba services generated revenue of $4 million and operating income of over $1.4 million. ", "So, let\u2019s now turn to the financial results for the second quarter. For the second quarter, we reported total revenue of $368 million, inline with guidance provided during our last conference call. Revenues excluding Jamba grew 4% sequentially. We continue to see growth in all areas with the exception of our core communications business. As in past quarters, we are reporting revenue based on our two business segments; ISG and CSG. ", "The Internet Services Group were approximately 6% sequentially and 22% year-over-year with revenues of $225 million or 61% of total revenue. This growth was fueled by strength in the registry and SSL businesses. ", "The Communication Services Group reported revenue of $143 million for Q2 or 39% of total revenue. Excluding Jamba, CSG revenue was essentially flat quarter over quarter. CSG revenue is comprised of digital content and messaging, communications and commerce and professional services revenues. Digital content and messaging services revenue for the quarter was approximately $39 million, essentially flat after excluding Jamba services. Communications and Commerce revenue was $90 million for the quarter, flat sequentially. ", "Moving to international operations, the percentage of revenue driven from international customers, affiliates and subsidiaries were 16% as compared to 21% last quarter. The decline in international revenue is primarily due to the de-consolidation of Jamba. Cost of revenue for the second quarter was $147 million with a gross margin of 60.1% as compared to 60.5% in Q1. The slight decline in gross margin was driven mainly by the removal of Jamba from operating results as discussed during our last two conference calls and contract renewals in the business. ", "Turning to operating margin. Total operating expenses for Q2 were $141 million or 38% of revenue down in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue. The decline was expected with the removal of expenses related to Jamba and from the benefit of the reorganization realized this quarter. We saw similar benefits in other operational areas as well, driving non-GAAP operating margin of 21.6% for Q2 as compared with an operating margin of 18.6% last quarter. ", "Interest and other income for the quarter was $9 million. While this was above previous guidance on the strength of interest income, we are nevertheless disappointed as we had anticipated a higher contribution from the Jamba JV. We would expect this negative trend to continue through the remainder of the year. ", "GAAP net loss for Q2 was $5 million, with GAAP net loss per share of $0.02. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $62 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 was $0.25, which was inline with guidance. The non-GAAP earnings per share calculation gives us a diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 249 million shares for Q2. ", "Now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Operating cash flow for the quarter came in at over $100 million and was positively impacted by continued strength in our core businesses of naming and SSL as well as prudent working capital management. Year to date, capital expenditures totaled $48 million with 19% attributable to ISG, 36% CSG and 45% for corporate infrastructure. ", "Our ability to consistently generate solid operating cash flow contributed to our already strong balance sheet with ending cash equivalents and short-term investments approaching $820 million, an increase of $80 million from last quarter. Net DSO for the second quarter came in at 44 days, an improvement of one day from the previous quarter. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $691 million up $29 million from the previous quarter. The solid growth in deferred revenue was driven by the strength in our registry and SSL businesses. ", "Restructuring related expenses for the second quarter were $10 million in total with approximately $1 million related to headcount, $3 million for facilities and other charges and $6 million for equipment. Cash expenses related for the restructuring were $7 million. ", "So far this year we have reduced headcount by approximately 250 positions and we expect to reduce headcount in other 100 positions during the second half of the year. We ended the quarter with 4,420 people. ", "Moving now to guidance for the third quarter. For the third quarter, we anticipate revenue will be approximately $370 million to $380 million, which reflects organic growth of 2% to 4% quarter over quarter, driven by most areas of the business. ", "Looking at our expectations for the Internet Services Group, we anticipate relatively consistent growth coming from our naming and SSL businesses. In the Communication Services Group, we expect slight growth reflecting continuing carrier consolidation in the communications business and challenging market dynamics in the messaging business. ", "Turning to operating margins for Q3, we expect operating margins for the third quarter will be approximately 23%, up from 21.6% this quarter. ", "So, in summary, we are pleased with the results this quarter. As we look to Q3, the solid performance we expect from the Internet Services Group and traction in some of our growth businesses as well as continued positive results from the restructuring provide us the base from which we can continue to grow revenue and profit in the second half of 2006. ", "Let me now pass it back to Bill for the business outlook. ", "Bill Roper ", "Thanks. As Bert just mentioned, we continued to see strength in our core businesses as both our registry and SSL business appear poised for another solid quarter. We are also focusing on the development of several emerging businesses which include content delivery, messaging and identity services. ", "As discussed earlier, pricing dynamics remained challenging in our messaging and our communications businesses. From an internal management perspective, our recent financial filings made clear the need for a higher level of discipline in our business processes and efforts are well underway on this front, but this is something that we will need to consistently strive to improve upon. ", "We also need to focus our resources on a more limited set of meaningful growth opportunities to improve our rate of success as a company. This focus does suggest some fine tuning of our strategic business portfolio. Now I realize that I have discussed our challenges a little more than our strengths, and this was somewhat deliberate as we wanted to emphasize our focus on managerial discipline. But, this in no way should overshadow the strengths in our core businesses and the growth opportunities that we have in our emerging businesses. Our financial position is strong, allowing us to invest in our core and emerging businesses to maintain our growth, to expand our operational leverage and at the same time to improve the efficiency of our capital structure. ", "On that note, I would like to turn the discussion to areas that I believe are of high interest to investors based on conversations we\u2019ve had to date with many of you since joining VeriSign eight weeks ago. These topics include the status of our strategic business review and our capital structure. ", "As a reminder, we initiated a company-wide reorganization in January when we essentially turned the organization chart 90 degrees on its side going from a business unit structure to a functional organizational structure. As a result, we expect that we will be able to realize annualized cost savings of approximately $50 million a year. This reorganization which started in January is ongoing with the majority of the headcount reductions having already occurred, but this is not the destination as much as it is the first step in our continual process of fine tuning. ", "As the next step, we began a product review in order to understand how each of our services and products fit into the company in terms of market position, financial performance, growth potential and customer relationships. I am sure that many of you will agree that this is a healthy practice for any company today and one that was already underway prior to my being named Chief Executive. While this product review is underway, I should stress that we are being thorough and disciplined in our approach. So until we complete this effort, it is premature to discuss any other specifics. That said, please be aware that we are addressing these matters with a healthy sense of urgency. ", "The second area that I suspect is on the minds of investors is our capital structure. This is an area where I have a fair amount of experience and we believe is an avenue to unlocking shareholder value over time. As Bert discussed earlier, our balance sheet continues to be strong with cash and equivalents in excess of $800 million and of course, we have the ongoing ability to generate healthy operating cash flows. ", "In total, we are in an excellent position to continue to invest with greater discipline in our businesses and to the extent that we do not see investment opportunities which meet our risk adjusted return threshold, we will seek effective and efficient means of returning cash to our shareholders through initiatives like our share repurchase program. ", "As a reminder, the board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program last year and we would expect to resume this program in the third quarter. ", "Earlier in the call, I mentioned the topic of financial guidance. Beginning this quarter we will provide guidance on next quarter revenue and operating margin, which we believe are the key metrics to measuring the progress of our efforts. In addition, we will continue to provide the high-level commentary about longer-term trends we expect to see in our business as we have done today. We recognize this is a change from prior practice, but after discussing this in detail, Bert and I decided that due to the ongoing review of our strategic business portfolio, this was the right time to make the change. We would encourage you not to read anything into the change other than we believe it will be prudent to limit our guidance to the two key metrics mentioned for the time being. ", "With that said, we do expect strong organic revenue growth accompanied by margin expansion and earnings acceleration as we go forward. ", "In summary, Q2 was a solid quarter in terms of key financial metrics. We are pleased with our future prospects, the strength of our executive team and our tremendously talented employee base. I would like to conclude my remarks by thanking our shareholders, our customers, our employees and our business partners for their continued support. ", "With that, we would like to open the call for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Ed Maguire from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon. Following up on your comments on capital structure, I was wondering if you could talk about your thoughts in terms of using debt to bolster the balance sheet, the appropriate timing and mix of share buy-backs, and also on CapEx in the re-filed K you mentioned potentially spending about $200 million in CapEx this year for the new data center. As we look forward, is this a level you believe is likely to be sustained or do you see leverage at least on these initial investments around product tighten? ", "Bill Roper", "Okay, Ed, a couple of questions there and I will try to cover both of them. We do believe the capital structure is inefficient, it\u2019s an avenue for unlocking shareholder value, as we said, and we do intend to resume our repurchase program this quarter. There is an authorized $1 billion out there. We only repurchased about $15 million worth of shares last year before we had to go dark so there is a lot of room there. ", "Regarding using debt, we might consider using debt at some time in the future. We have not ruled anything out there. We want to be efficient and effective in our repurchase program but we do think there is value to be unlocked. ", "I think your second question was basically on capital expenditures and somewhere in the materials, you\u2019ll see that so far this year, we\u2019ve spent around $50 million on capital expenditures, so you can see that it is actually unlikely we\u2019ll hit the $200 million this year. ", "We do have a new data center going in and a number of other things that are going on and would tell you that you shouldn\u2019t expect that level of capital expenditures on a go-forward basis that would be needed to sustain the enterprise. ", "We do feel that we are obligated to capitalize our business well and to be ahead of the growth curve in units and in terms of capabilities, of handling volumes on the global infrastructure, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll that level of CapEx going forward. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "And just a quick follow-up on the certificate business with the average yearly price declining quarter over quarter but term lengths extending, could you comment a little bit more granularly about where you are seeing the potential adoption of the extended validation certificates and where the growth in your product mix is maybe stronger? ", "Bill Roper", "I think there\u2019s two things going on there. The longer term gives a lower rate and therefore a lower annualized selling price but you know, we have much lower acquisition and renewal costs, so the benefit of the extended term is very clear. ", "What was the second part of your question? ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Really just wondering about, among the extended validation certificates and the standard and high-bit or 128-bit, where you might be seeing the greatest traction? ", "Bill Roper", "EZ is a product extender and a premium priced product and we are fortunate today we\u2019ve got Mark McLaughlin on the line, and if the technology works, I\u2019d love to ask Mark to provide you with a little color there. ", "Mark McLaughlin", "We continue to see strong traction in financial services and retail sites, web retail sites The go-to-market there hasn\u2019t change and the adoption hasn\u2019t change and where you\u2019d expect to see it there and both are getting good traction, and EZ has doubled from last quarter, so we are doing pretty well there. ", "Ed Maguire - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Thanks. Two questions, the first one, on the guidance you gave for next quarter for revenue, does that include or exclude the Jamba! services? ", "Albert Clement", "That excludes Jamba! services. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Okay, and then on the domain name business, the trajectory that you are seeing, you mentioned the three key drivers, is there any reason that should change? Are you expecting the momentum in that business to continue at this level for the foreseeable future? ", "Albert Clement", "We expect those levels to continue at this time. We don\u2019t have any other indicators in the marketplace to tell us otherwise for now. ", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Todd Raker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hi this is Bryan for Todd. I guess first, as you talk about fine-tuning your business portfolio and taking $50 million in cost-out, can you talk maybe more -- ", "Ken Bond", "Bryan, this is Ben Bonds. I apologize, but you are breaking up. We can\u2019t hear you. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Can you talk about -- let\u2019s talk about your $50 million in operating, in restructuring costs you can take out on an annualized basis. Can you talk about more strategically as you are going through the strategic review, how much you can take out in operating losses? Can you quantify that potentially for us over time? ", "Bill Roper", "Let me try to repeat the question. We still didn\u2019t get you with a lot of clarity. I think you asked in our strategic review that we are going through, were we going to remove businesses that were operating at a loss -- was that the question? ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, as you go through that, the unprofitable, unstrategic businesses, can you quantify what the impact of that might be over time? ", "Bill Roper", "No, we\u2019re not talking about that at this time. The review isn\u2019t complete and it would be premature to talk about it but we are looking at businesses to determine whether they really fit from a standpoint of market positioning, economics, our ability to create sustainable advantage and competitive barriers. If they fit within those categories, we are going to invest and build in them and if they don\u2019t, we\u2019re going to take a good hard look at them. But we are still, we\u2019re mid-process. It\u2019s too early to comment. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Fair enough. I guess on the DNS business, your first price increase goes through October 15th. Can you give us some insight when you potentially could push the second price increase through? Is that a year from October 15th or is that the beginning of next year? ", "Ken Bond", "Bryan, I apologize. We\u2019re having a very difficult time hearing you. ", "Bill Roper", "I think you asked when would we be able to have the next price increase. Why don\u2019t we turn that one over to Mark. ", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sure. On the price increases, contractually we can do the price increases four out of the next seven years, so we could announce a price increase at any time we thought it was need there. So it is not limited by anything other than the four out of seven years in the contract. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Are those calendar years? ", "Mark McLaughlin", "Those are calendar years. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Peter Kuper from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. Can you hear me okay? ", "Bill Roper", "Yes. ", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "At the risk of asking two questions like everyone else, one I think is an easy one that you are not going to answer but just in case, you talk about strategic review, the comms business is one that has been dragging on it. Is this a business though that is strategically too important to the overall VeriSign services model to just say well, it\u2019s not growing as fast, it\u2019s capital intensive to divest -- maybe that is an easy question, in a sense. ", "The other question is more on the longer term targets. I know we are not talking about guidance going forward but from the operating margin efficiency ratio, it sounds like operating margins are coming. They are getting better but a little bit lower than I was anticipating. Is this on track for 25% the way they old model used to talk about, or is that just up for review at this point? ", "Bill Roper", "You\u2019re right on the first one. We\u2019re not going to comment. It really is premature, so nice try. ", "On the op margins, as you noted I think Bert suggested that we expect to be around 23% in the third quarter. I know that there is an expectation out there that we will reach 25% in the fourth quarter or exiting the year or whatever. We\u2019re not -- let me say it like this; that is certainly doable. I just don\u2019t want to be hamstrung by an arbitrary number if the right kind of investments should come along and that we should make them. Other than that, we are on track, the right things are happening. You can see the impact of the reorg that we did at the beginning of the year and it is coming through. So that certainly is an achievable number. We want to make sure that we don\u2019t make arbitrary business decisions to hit a number that would not be the right answer for the business in the long run. ", "Albert Clement", "I think to add to that, the trend is definitely going in the right direction, from 18.6 in Q1 to 21.6 in Q2, 23% in Q3, and I think you can deduce it from there.

Is it at your discretion they can raise the prices in the next four years and leave the last three year for approval, so you can raise in any four years you want? ", "Bill Roper", "Mark, why don\u2019t we let you handle that one? ", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sure. So it is any four out of the next seven years. ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "The second question I had was on your commerce and communications segment. How would you categorize the operating margins versus the corporate average? ", "Albert Clement", "The operating margins in general are lower than the corporate average. ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Would you say mid, high teens? ", "Albert Clement", "In that range, yes. ", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Shaul Eyal from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Also two quick questions on my end; Billy, we\u2019re talking about some challenging market dynamics on the messaging front. Could you provide us with more color? Is it ASPs? Is it just going to be consolidation, a weakening telephone environment -- just one point? ", "Bill Roper", "You\u2019ve hit on several of them but again, we\u2019ll get Mark to provide a little bit of color. ", "John Donovan", "This is John. Maybe I can do that just from a customer perspective. I think that the dynamics in the marketplace are such that there\u2019s been heavy competition, a lot of privately funded firms and so we\u2019ve seen some sale price compression but more importantly, what we\u2019ve seen is a need to tighten down the process across the value chain, like in the carrier environment where there were a lot of failed attempts. And so it is really just a consolidation that is a combination of customers discriminating in the types of things they are buying, the entire value chain trying to tighten down and get higher quality, and then several companies that are trying to consolidate volume so that they can be well-positioned to capture the future. So I expect we\u2019ll bump along here for a little bit but feel very good about where we\u2019ve been positioned, the quality improvements that we\u2019ve made in the platform itself, and the effectiveness of our more broadly reaching sales channel than most of our competitors to get in and manage through this entire value chain in that messaging and content platform. ", "Shaul Eyal - CIBC World Markets", "Great. Thank you for that. That was very helpful. Second question, Bill; eight weeks into the review process, maybe a simple question yet a challenging one -- maybe in one line, two liners, can you define VeriSign to us? How do you see it? ", "Bill Roper", "Well, yes. I\u2019ll try again. We try to do that in remarks. We just finished what I would describe as a solid quarter. Our prospects going forward, especially in our core franchises, look very good. We\u2019ve got a great team. We\u2019ve got good products. We\u2019ve got good brand recognition and customer relationships. We are working on challenges such as our business processes. We are doing a lot of work in the area of execution, things like that. We\u2019ve strengthened the team with a couple of additions and promotions from within and I feel very good about where we are and where we are going.

", "Eric Kovensky - Jefferies & Company", "Hi, this is Eric [Kovensky] on for Katherine Egbert. My first question is on operating cash flow. You guys said you had over $100 million in the quarter. That number seemed a little volatile and I was wondering if you could provide some color on what would be a normalized basis. ", "Albert Clement", "Our current view on that, it should be in the $100 million range. Q1 is usually a low quarter for us with various things that happen around year-end and other things inside the company around bonuses and DNO insurance and those kinds of things, but I would expect about $100 million per quarter. ", "Eric Kovensky - Jefferies & Company", "Okay, great. Secondly, do you have any additional color on timing on how you are going to look at the $1 billion stock repurchase? ", "Bill Roper", "The what? ", "Eric Kovensky - Jefferies & Company", "I\u2019m sorry, the $1 billion you guys have in the stock repurchase. Do you have any color on timing and how you are looking at that? ", "Bill Roper", "We are looking at various ways, various initiative for efficiently and effectively dealing with the capital structure. We are not commenting on the specifics at this time. We are indicating that our intention will be to restart the program this quarter and other than that, we are really not talking a lot. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. ", " Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird", "I\u2019d actually just like to follow-up on a question that was just asked here recently and that has to do with how you define yourselves. As part of the strategic review, have you had to go back and look at your mission statement and kind of review who you think you are as a company, has there been any change to that? ", "Bill Roper", "I think the right way to think, obviously when you go through the company, you should start with what are your strengths, where do you have the right kind of capabilities, where do you have the right kind of customer relationships, where do you have the ability to build great businesses with competitive barriers and so forth, and you start from that. ", "The team has done a great job of going through the portfolio and looking at all of our businesses, looking at how they are positioned, who the competitors are, what the economics in the marketplace are and so forth. It\u2019s been very thorough, it\u2019s been very exhaustive. I mentioned we have a healthy sense of urgency, so this will not be analysis/paralysis, but we are going to do it right and maybe I would pass it to say John, and see if John has any insight on this as well. ", "John Donovan", "I think historically what we did is we looked for large end markets that were rapidly growing where there were third-party transactions and a managed service model could succeed and we expected that we could build the technology advantage over time. And then when you start to compound a lot of those on top of one another, you start to get a diseconomy of scale by losing some focus and getting spread a little too thin. ", "I think what we did is we narrowed the knot hole and just making sure that we get technology leverage and that Harry and his team can provide us a sustained advantage. As Bill talked about barriers, we are talking about specific franchise technology barriers. We\u2019ve also tied the knot hole a bit and looked more heavily at distribution to make sure that the market growth was occurring in geographies where we could effectively distribute. And then, we just re-looked at how we are distributing to make sure that we have feet on the street where we need it. ", "Once you go through that, you start to look for efficiency from end-to-end in the system. In your data centers, in your technology, in your product development and product management, and your go-to-market both direct and indirect, and then making sure your geographic alignment and you can expect the result of that is that you have a more efficient system in moving a customer dollar back through the system and taking it from order to cash. ", "So we\u2019ve taken a comprehensive view. As Bill said, I think we\u2019ve tightened the knot hole to look at the entire business system and then we\u2019ve put a really practical constraint in looking at how we could effectively go and win in these games and we are just taking a more aggressive approach towards winning on a sustained basis in areas that have all of those dimensions.

", " Bill Winslow - Credit Suisse", "I was wondering if you could just spend a minute on the core comps business, signaling and database. What trends are you seeing from a margin perspective there and also you previously have been talking about the international opportunity, particularly over in Asia. I was wondering if you could just discuss that and how you see that ramping as well? ", "Bill Roper", "Well, you asked a couple of questions there and I think we covered some of that in prepared remarks, but Mark may want to comment on your first question and John may want to comment on your second. ", "John Donovan", "I\u2019ll start on the second half and talk about Asia. I will generalize geographically and just say that we included in the reviews that we are doing not just the technology and product and business unit dimension, we are also looking internationally at the growth characteristics, the portfolio and our distribution strategy. We are certainly extremely enthused about the Asia Pacific region. We have, as you know, VeriSign Japan, as an entity. We have historical strength in Australia and New Zealand market and as inCode was brought in late in the fourth quarter, inCode had a reasonable foundation and operating history in China. ", "So, we have come back and really started in each geography to prioritize our countries. We think that we can do materially better in the Asia Pacific region as a percentage of revenue. We think that the portfolios that we will ultimately end up emphasizing when you look at the growth characteristics and when we complete this review, we will be very tightly aligned with the growth characteristics of the APAC region. ", "We\u2019ve been very focused in business development efforts and in our channel development as well as in both indirect channel partnerships and building direct sales and distribution capability throughout Asia Pacific in anticipation of this. We think that we will be heavily focused on Australia/New Zealand and will continue obviously, in Japan. But we are going to renew our emphasis in China and India and then selectively in South East Asia for certain products. ", "We are being laser focused about the combination of the product in the country to ensure that we are not wasting precious distribution resources and the reverse, that every good product we have that we are taking it globally to everywhere that the market have the growth characteristics.

", "John Donovan", "If you look at the market dynamic in the comps business, there are a number of the comps businesses that have either fragmentation of competition or historically have had heavy capital requirements and then much lower ongoing OpEx requirements. So it has the characteristic of the types of markets that would be heavily competed for. What we\u2019ve found is, I think over the last couple of quarters that we on average were measuring success historically by whether we could take our fair share of the market and measure what percentage of price decline we could avoid. ", "I think we\u2019ve re-looked at that business in a much more aggressive fashion to look at taking share and I think that the characteristics of that business is that margins are going to go with volume. So, I think that we are probably at the point now where we think the margins will be stabilized given where we are and we are very pleased with the performance of the sales team in the comp sector, particularly over the last couple of quarters.

I do want to get a little bit more clarity on that if you wouldn\u2019t mind giving it another shot. ", "I understand what you are talking about in terms of taking a look at the approach of VeriSign\u2019s various businesses on a business-by-business basis and sort of evaluating your position there, as well as the market characteristics and the economics. In my mind, it seems clear that there are probably some businesses that VeriSign is in that are probably losing money at this stage of the venture and probably aren\u2019t very strategic to you. On the other hand, there is probably some businesses that have poor market dynamics, but are positive contributors to earnings per share and to operating cash flows. Obviously I am thinking a bit about some of the businesses within the communications practice.

", "Secondarily to that, you talk about investments. What might be your policies surrounding acquisitions as a means to further shore up your position in chosen markets or perhaps expand into new ones? ", "Bill Roper", "I think that\u2019s an insightful question. We do have some businesses that fall into the two categories you name, as well as some businesses that don\u2019t fall in either one of those categories. Some of these are tough calls, but we are looking at them hard and the staging and the timing of that and who the business partners might be really is more of an art than a science and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have taken a little more time in all of this, because it relates to our talented work force, it relates to a number of other issues. ", "You also asked about acquisitions, we have the financial wherewithal and desire to invest in our business including M&A where we understand what we are requiring and we understand how it fits and how it helps us achieve a means to an end of building a business, both in some of the earlier stage businesses and some of the other. So, we will do that. We are going to be a little more judicious and a little more thoughtful maybe than in the past and we are going to be a lot more forceful on the execution and integration when and if we do make these choices.

", " Rob Sanderson - American Technology Research", "Great, thank you very much. A couple of quick ones. First, you\u2019ve just recently completed a very extensive review and audit. Can you give us a sense of magnitude of professional accounting and legal fees that may have been involved in that process?

Just how fragmented do you see that market? ", "John Donovan", "Right now we would view what we call core messaging, but our view is that we have about 50% share right now of the U.S. market, limited share outside the U.S. and we think that we are considerably larger than anybody in that portfolio. So, in any given carrier you could find as many as 15 direct connections and as many as a dozen physical aggregators and so there are a number of players out there that are bumping along with really no leverage of other products to sell nor other things to bundle in. So I feel good about how that market is coalescing. As I said, I believe it will bump along here for a little bit. ", "But the underlying messaging increases and the characteristics of that are outstanding and we think we have a very favorable position. Linking to one of the earlier questions, the big challenge is that we have to ensure that we are carrier grade in everything that we do, that we are providing high availability and so we are going through and ensuring that as we do this portfolio review, that we are keeping the things that are vital to customers that have been bundled up effectively together.

Thethird quarter was a solid quarter, as we reported total revenue of $377 millionincluding $374 million of revenue from continuing operations, which wasconsistent with our previous guidance.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.27. The solid financialperformance was again driven by our core franchises of Naming and SSL. We endedthe quarter with over 77 million domain names in our adjusted zone for .com and.net, compared to 73 million names last quarter.

As stated earlier, our Naming business continues toshow strength, as the adjusted zone for registered names in .com and .net nowexceeds 77 million names that's an increase of 25% year-over-year. This growthis driven by continued global [internetted] option with 7.5 million new domainname registrations for .com and .net during the quarter and as well as renewalof about 10 million names during the quarter combined we booked 17.5 millionnew domain name registrations and renewals during the quarter and this a recordeclipsing last quarters record results.", "The underlying growth drivers are consistent with priorquarters with solid growth in both US and international markets.

VeriSign's uniquecapability to operate global network at this scale and reliability isunparallel as the most active network on the pace of the globe.", "Moving to our Security Services, we'll start with our secondcore franchise, the SSL business, which sold over 217,000 certificates duringthe quarter, bringing the installed base to 912,000 certs. We are pleased withthis growth and it represents a 3% sequential growth in this base.", "We're also pleased with the results of our extendedvalidation or EV certificates as customers like, PayPal, Bank of the West,British Airways, Charles Schwab, Time Warner, Travelocity and many more havegone green with EV. And demand for the EV certificates was excellent in thethird quarter and even after excluding a major customer win sequential growthfor more then 25%.", "Now, this product is still in its infancy but we are thenumber one provider for EV certificates in the marketplace at this time. And wecontinue to expect that the EV adoption cycle will be consistent with previous premiumpriced SSL products that we've offered in the past. Microsoft's comments lastweek around Vista adoption further improve ourconfidence around the EV growth potentials.", "The annualized average selling price across the entire baseof VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte-branded certificates was $262, down from lastquarters $275. This decline reflects the continued trend of a product mix shiftas the GeoTrust branded certificates continue to grow faster than the overallportfolio.", "And additionally, the ASP for the VeriSign brandedcertificates has declined slightly during the quarter, as we had two major winswithin the past customers booked during the quarter.

We saw a growth in the wireless billing subscriberbase at MetroPCS and Leap, as we now support nearly 12 million wireless userswith our billing and payment services platforms. However, the gains for thesecustomers were offset by declines in our prepaid services business.", "And in closing our business review, the professionalservices results were flat from last quarter, as both revenue and expenses werelower on lower available headcount.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Bert for awalk-through of our financial results for the third quarter and guidance forthe fourth quarter.

Both revenue and earnings per share were consistent with ourguidance. The non GAAP results we'll discuss throughout this call, reflectcontinuing operations for the third quarter, comparisons with prior periodexcludes both Jamba and Jamba Service.", "You'll see Jamba Service classified as discontinuedoperations. In the third quarter price for sales, Jamba Service generatedrevenue of $3.1 million and operating income of over $1.8 million. VeriSignconsolidated revenue for the quarter was $377 million including $374 millionfrom continuing operation.", "Our non-GAAP operating margin was 23.4% in exceedingguidance by 40 basis points given continued benefits of the restructuringefforts initiated earlier this year as well as having grown the top line fasterthan expenses.", "In mid August, we completed $1.25 billion convertible debtoffering. The large majority of the proceeds from these transactions will beused for share repurchases and today we have repurchased 31.4 million shares atan average price $30.12. We also recognized $5 million in interest expensesquarter and the debt offering will be accretive to earnings per share.", "Let me now give you some additional detail on the financialresults of the third quarter.

The Internet Services Group grew approximately5% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, with revenues of $236 million or 63% oftotal revenue. This growth was fueled by strength in .com, SSL and IdentityProtection.", "The Communications Services Group reported revenue of $138million for Q3 or 37% of total revenue down 1% from last quarter and up 5% year-over-year.CSG revenue is comprised of digital content and messaging which was upslightly, communications and commerce which was flat sequentially, andprofessional services which was down over the last quarter.", "Moving to international operations, the percentage ofrevenue driven from international customers, affiliates and subsidiaries was16% as compared to 15% last quarter.", "Cost of revenue for the third quarter was $143 million,non-GAAP Q3 gross margin was 61.8% up from 60.3% last quarter.

Thepercentage decline was expected given our expectation to grow expenses at lowerrates than revenue. We saw similar benefits in other operational areas as well,driving a non-GAAP operating margin of 23.4% as compared with 21.5% lastquarter and exceeded our expectations by almost 40 basis points.", "Other income including minority interest was slightly morethan $5 million for the quarter. This includes six-week of interest expense onthe convertible debt transactions and no contribution to other income fromJamba.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect a one-time loss of $1million to $2 million from the Jamba JV, as a result of an unplanned one-timeexpenditure. We will be monitoring the situations very closely.

The diluted sharecount is in EPS was approximately 246 million shares.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items,operating cash flow for the quarter came in at a $109 million drivers for thepositive free cash flow were approximately 70 million net stock repurchasesfrom the debt deal, 13 million from the sale of Jamba Service, and 220 millionfrom stock option exercise.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $47 million with16% attributable to ISG, 48% to CSG, and 36% for corporate infrastructure, andbringing the year-to-date total to approximately $94 million. We do not expectcapital expenditures for the year will exceed $150-$160 million.", "Our ability to consistently generate solid operating cashflows resulted in our maintaining a strong balance sheet with ending cashequivalents and short-term investments approaching $1.2 billion an increase of$371 million from last quarter.", "Net DSO for the third quarter was up 6 days to 50 days, as aresult of our transitioning through a new CSG billing platform late lastquarter. During the transition, invoices were issued late, resulting in ahigher DSO. The issue was identified and addressed during the quarter, and weexpect DSO will decline next quarter, as we worked the impact through accountsreceivables.", "Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $711 million, up $26million from the previous quarter, and 21% year-over-year. The increase indeferred revenue was driven by strength in our registry and security services.We ended the quarter with 4,370 people.", "Moving now to guidance for the fourth quarter, and keepingwith our new guidance policy discussed last quarter, we're providing revenueand operating margin guidance for the following quarter as also providinghigh-level commentary about longer-term trends we expect to see in ourbusiness.", "We continue to expect organic revenue growth accompanied bymargin expansion and earnings acceleration. For the fourth quarter, weanticipate revenue will be approximately $375 million to $385 million which isflat to up 3% from the third quarter. We expect to solid and continued growthin our core businesses, partially offset by decline in our communicationsbusiness.", "Turning to operating margins for Q4, we expect operatingmargins will be approximately 25%, up from 23.5% this quarter. We will continueto execute on plans, while we are investment for growth in next generationservices as well as remaining focused on discipline, expense, management.

Theaccelerated share repurchases or ASR program will be ongoing through the end ofthe fourth quarter. At the conclusion of the ASR program, we planned tocontinue share repurchase activity over the following quarters using the $985million of authorization remaining under our $1 billion plan.", "So in summary, we are quite pleased with the results thisquarter. As we look to Q4, the continued strong performance we expect from ourcore services increasing contribution from emerging services as well as positiveresults from the restructuring provide us with positive momentum going into Q4as we approach 2008.", "We'll provide additional perspective on 2008 at our AnalystDay on November 14th with our strategy business review we'll have a significantimpact on current revenue and earnings estimates.", "Let me now pass it back to Bill, for the business outlook.", "Bill Roper", "Thanks. As Bert just mentioned, we continue to see strengthin our core businesses. And we are also focusing on the development of severalbusinesses, including content delivery, messaging and identity protection.Overtime, we expected our portfolio or emerging businesses well above as wecontinually access our opportunities in terms of our strategy, market positionand our ability to win.", "From an internal management perspective, we continue to worktoward a higher level of discipline in our business practices. Efforts are wellunderway on his front and our hiring of Grant Clark, who I mentioned earlier isindicative of our commitment to improve our performance over time.", "Our financial position is strong, allowing us to invest inour core and emerging businesses to maintain our growth, to expand ouroperational leverage and at the same time improve the efficiency of our capitalstructure.", "On that note, I would like to turn the discussion areas thatwe believe our particular interest based on conversations we've had withshareholders. These topics include status of our strategic business review andour capital structure.", "As a reminder, we initiated a company-wide reorganization inJanuary. This reorganization was not really a destination as much as it was ourfirst step and our continual process of adjusting and refining our overallstrategy to meet changing the market conditions.", "And as stated before, I'm a big believer and focused. Wesimply must focus our resources on a more limited set of meaningful growthopportunities to improve our success rate as a company. And to that end, weinitiated a business review to understand and asses how each businesses fits interms of our strategy, our market position and our ability to win.", "This business review is now substantially complete. Andwhile we won't into details on today's call, we do intend to discuss this infurther detail at our Analyst Day on November 14th. We hope that you'll be ableto attend in person or video of the webcast.", "The second area that I like to discuss is the capitalstructure. As we discussed earlier, we successfully completed our convertibledebt offerings raising $1.25 billion and we use a large majority of theproceeds to repurchase shares. In fact this quarter we repurchased over 31million shares accounting approximately 13% of the total shares outstanding.", "Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with cash andequivalents approaching $1.2 billion, and of course, we expect we will continueto generate healthy operating cash flows. So in total, we're in excellentposition to continue to invest with greater discipline in our businesses. Andto the extent that we do not see investment opportunities, which meet our riskadjusted return threshold, we will seek effective and efficient means ofreturning cash to our shareholders through initiatives like our sharerepurchase program.", "And we're not going to provide guidance on future sharerepurchases, but we do note that we still have approximately $985 million authorizedfor share repurchase. And we continue to believe that our capital structure isan avenue to unlocking shareholder value overtime.", "So in summary, the third quarter was a solid quarter, in termsof, key financial metrics. We are pleased with the performance of our corebusinesses and their future prospects, the strength of our management team, andthe commitment of our tremendously talented employee base.", "Looking forward, we except strong organic revenue growth inour core businesses, partially offset by the clients in our communicationbusinesses accompanied by margin expansion and earnings accelerations.", "I'd like to conclude my remarks by thanking ourshareholders, our business partners, our customers, and our employees for theircontinued support. And with that, we'd like to open the call for yourquestions.", "Operator, may we have the first question, please.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we'll go first to Rob Owens,Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - PacificCrest", "A couple of questions: First of all, could you give us asense of where the attach rate is for EV certs right now? And kind of how weshould think about that as we move forward? And in light of that, at what pointdo we see ASP start swing the other way?", "Bill Roper", "Would you repeat the question? You broke up a bit, and wedidn't hear the first part.", "Rob Owens - PacificCrest", "Question was regarding EV certs: Extended ValidationCertificates, and effectively what the attach rate looks like right now? Andwhat some expectations might be in terms of how that can drive overall ASPsmoving forward?", "John Donovan", "Hi, it's John Donovan. I'll take the question. Right now,we're seeing continued uptake. One of the things that we have done this yearis, we've augmented the channels to ensure that that up sale goes much moresmoothly. So, we were very pleased with the take rate.", "We haven't established yet metrics, which we think are goingto be consistent and sustainable for you to measure that performance. But themetrics that we're using right now internally, which were the root drivers ofthat are up rather smartly this quarter.", "So, I think, we will provide at Analyst Day a more detailview of some of the metrics of measurement in that business, but from thestandpoint of enterprise adoption, we're very pleased with where that's beenheaded.", "Rob Owens - PacificCrest", "Okay. And as we look at guidance for the fourth quarter,fairly flat sequentially modest uptake, any sense as to what comes out of ISGversus CSG, what type of declines quarter-over-quarter you're expecting in CSGthere?", "Bill Roper", "Yeah. We don't usually provide that level of detail but inline with what we have been seeing historically here.", "Rob Owens - PacificCrest", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - GoldmanSachs", "Good afternoon guys. Just on that question around guidance,I mean, you are being guiding than a little from where the street was, is therea concern that in some of the non-core businesses, particularly and now at theCSG area that you continue to see erosion because they've effectively becomenon-core, I mean, how are you dealing with that?", "John Donovan", "Yeah, this is John, what we have seen, we're obviously arelead indicators that are the customer activity indicators and that's the RFP'sthat we see the, the bookings that we get and the backlog and we watch thatvery closely not only by win rate and customers, but we look at it buy productas well and we actually have been having very strong quarters throughout thelast two quarters in the customer activity, in the bookings, in thecommunications.", "So, I would say that in general our sharing some of the morechallenging businesses is growing up and what we are dealing with there is abackdrop against a price decline. So, I'm very thrilled that what the channelhas been doing and the focus that we've been able to maintain through thisportfolio review.", "And I would say that those businesses as we start tocategorized them as non-core and mange them that we'll find that '08, Q4 in '08will be consistent with the guidance we've given you and we're dealing with theunderlying economics of our price decline and volume, but I think the win ratesare good and right now the pipeline is healthy.", "Sarah Friar - GoldmanSachs", "Okay, that's good to hear. And then, just maybe on morepositive note, on the registry side, obviously we have the price increasestarting to kick in now, but when we could we start to see maybe someadditional services coming out of that registry business and given that you cannow that, how they, I cannot be able set up?", "John Donovan", "Yeah, this is John, one of the things that we are going togo through extensively at Analyst Day, and Bill has been a big proponent, andwe talk a lot about focus and discipline, and we've done a great job of thathere over the last several quarters. One it maybe has been underserved its someof our dialogues with new folks, as just the innovation process itself. Andwe've been using the same focus and discipline into building how we gait inhurdle things in the investment portfolio.", "So, I would suspect that over the course for next, for thewhile here, as we talk about areas where we are going to invest and grow thatwe will, you will see a very logical path and plan for growth in all of ourcore services evolving the base product line. And also looking for adjacentmarkets, that we conserve that have either similar go to market and technologyor potentially the length of the businesses that we are in today.", "So, we don't have the answer that it will provide a lot ofclarity on Analyst Day for the things that we are doing there and I think thatyou'll see that we have a lot of great opportunities presented by the businessin both the SSL and the domain business as well. ", "Sarah Friar - GoldmanSachs", "Great, okay. We look forward to seeing at there. Thanks alot.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Israel Hernandez ofLehman Brothers.", "Israel Hernandez - Lehman Brothers", "Hello everyone. With respect to the ICDN, you indicated thatit was still in nascent stages and this is require some time and someinvestment, is that suggesting that perhaps ICDN might not be in VeriSignlong-term plans or are you going to committed its growing that business or isit just may not be worth it?", "Bill Roper", "Good question Israel, I hope you are coming toAnalyst Day. We'll spend a little time on that. We are constantly reassessingall of our investment periods. We are adding new ones, we are taking a hardlook at the fundamentals of these markets develop and the stream really is thetechnology and our capabilities, the market size, growth rate in economics thatthey deliver and our ability to win and have a meaningful market position. Andwe are constantly looking at all these opportunities against those streams.", "Israel Hernandaz - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks. That sounds like nice.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Hi, guys. Two questions for you. First, on the priceincrease for dot-com and dot-net, can you just give us an inside, in terms of,the current contracts links around the domain name? And how you feel with yourrenews cycle, kind of, looks like over the next, I think it's about 18 monthsfor that to roll in, how should we think about that? And then, from a pricingperspective, when would be the next opportunity, you guys can take pricing up asecond time?", "Bill Roper", "I think I got part of that question and I may have missedpart, can I start at the back and go forward. The current contract that we havegoes through 2012 and allows for a total of four price increases of up to 7%each in the case of dot-com. And they can be no more frequent then once a year.That was the part I remember. Can you repeat the first part of the question?", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Yeah. What is the average contract links for domain thesedays?", "Bill Roper", "It's a little over a year, it's about 1.2 years is theaverage term.", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Okay. And some renewals factor, they've been pretty smoothover the four quarters or should we see seasonality here around the end of theyear?", "Bill Roper", "I'm sorry we're just not hearing you're faded. Could yourepeat?", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Yeah. From the renewal perspective should we see seasonalityaround the end of the year or is it going to be pretty smooth over the fourquarters?", "Bill Roper", "Season's question, I see.", "Bert Clement", "I think it's in a range of where it's between historically,we are still analyzing where the actual rate is for Q3. Our view is that itwill be slightly lower than what it was in Q2, which turned out to be higherthan our initial estimate guess. The historical range on that's been about 73to 77, our second quarter, which is the sort of the higher end of the range,and we expected to drift back down towards nil?", "John Donovan", "Yeah. This is John. Just to add there. I mean there is aseasonality of who is doing renewing, and those sorts of things. But also inthe non-renewals you're dealing with business failures, and pay-per-clicks andwe had the price increase and the economics for the pay-per-clicks of how youget an ROI on a name.", "So, we think Q3 was a little unusual in the things that wesaw, but we don't see anything that would indicate that we're going to beoutside our traditional range, although, we believe Q3 will probably be on thelower end of that historical range.", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up on the SSLbusiness, you've mentioned that the VeriSign ASP was down, but you stated toolarge on prior transaction. If you have not had those two large deals with theASP around the VeriSign certs have been down?", "John Donovan", "Yeah. The ASP would have been slightly up at that point.", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Okay\u2026", "John Donovan", "If you have not had those two in.", "Todd Raker - DeutscheBank", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Peter Kuper from Morgan Stanley.", "Peter Kuper - MorganStanley", "Great, guys. Just maybe two simple questions as here, but Inoticed in your comments, you said about $220 million from stock optionexercising, perhaps you bought a lot of stock. One concern we have had those --given the ongoing stock option verification lot of employees had end-up stockin desire, shall we say, are you feeling comfortable now that, you know, wehave kind of passed a Russian stock selling on the insiders, and that you mightsee more normalized activity, enhance your buyback activity, maybe morenormalized going forward?", "Bert Clement", "Yes. I think we had pent-up demand. We were locked up forabout 15 months. The stock price also moved over 100% in that time period, sothere was definitely a big push there. We expected to go back to a normalizedrate at this point. We also did have a catch-up with our employee stockpurchase program as well. So we expect those numbers to level-off as we goforward. And we do expect to continue to buy stock regardless.", "Peter Kuper - MorganStanley", "Okay. And then thatmaybe 5 million, that's a share repurchase authorization that's remaining, isthere expiration on that?", "Bert Clement", "There is not. ", "Peter Kuper - MorganStanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction). We'll go next to Katherine Egbert ofJefferies and Company.", "Katherine Egbert -Jefferies & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick clarification on youroutlook for Q4. Does it include the loss of any lines of business or anyrevenue?", "Bert Clement", "What do you mean by the loss of\u2026", "Katherine Egbert -Jefferies & Company", "Does it include anything in terms of divest?", "Bert Clement", "No, we're given you number as if today, without anydivestiture numbers.", "Katherine Egbert -Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And then, I've a question for Bill, how are you doingversus you initially thought on kind of the strategic rational of the Company,especially, when the fact that there has been so many changes in the personnel?You feel like you are in track?", "Bill Roper", "Actually, I think we are little ahead of track. We are not\u201ccame on board\u201d, the team has done a fair amount of the work already. They wereready. They've turn to the task well. I actually think we're little ahead ofwhere I might have expected to be. I don't think I had a particular timeline inmind. You might note, we\u2019ve accomplished a number of things. We completed theoption review. We got our books in records up-to-date and we reopened our stocksystem.", "We did the share repurchase. We\u2019ve added some staff members.We\u2019ve substantially completed the strategic review of the business portfolioand we are now going into the action mode there. And we\u2019ve continue to operatethe Company pretty much on track for the first three quarters of this year. SoI\u2019m pretty pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished. I will tell you that we got alot of people working very hard. But I think very effectively and very dedicateand committed staff and team and overall talent base within the Company.", "So, if you are asking how I feel, I'm actually pleased withwhere we are.", "Katherine Egbert -Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And then, last one, just quickly. How much leverageare you comfortable with?", "Bill Roper", "We thought, we have really not talked about an optimalcapital structure or those type things but we will just note that we have astrong balance sheet. We have a very good stable, predictable cash flows, wehave good businesses that have a lot of visibility and so a company like thatshould be able to carry a reasonable amount of leverage and services withoutrunning into problems.", "Bert Clement", "And we also have a $500 million line of credit that isuntapped at this time.", "Katherine Egbert -Jefferies & Company", "Okay, thank you.", "Bill Roper", "Yeah.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - CreditSuisse", "Hi guys, I just wanted to insight of our deferred revenueportrait and just what your expectations are for next quarter? And then, whenyou do look longer-term when you start to making the effect of the priceincrease but also if you see improvement in terms of ASPs or the certs, justhow should we think about deferred revenue in the next quarter but potentiallynext year?", "Bert Clement", "Yes. We think deferred revenue is going to continue to growat the rate is being growing over the last couple of quarters. Obviously, Q1 isusually a very strong deferred revenue quarter for our registry business. Sothat will be again continued the time not as to the magnitude that has been inthe past as of as the new names have been running all year round, a record atthis point. So, we do think that the price increase will kick in to thedeferred revenue base here late in the fourth quarter and then going into thefirst half of next year before we see meaningful results on the revenue end. Welook pretty confidently as the deferred revenue is going to continue to grow.", "Phil Winslow - CreditSuisse", "Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Walter Pritchard of Cowen and Company.", "Walter Pritchard -Cowen and Company", "Hi guys, just one level of addition detail may be you couldgive us around professional services headcount, you talked about that and thebill of account being down. Could you maybe quantify that for us year-over-yearor are you see year-over-year might be the most meaningful in terms of how manyit is down?", "Bill Roper", "Yeah, without talking about the specific numbers, let metell you what the chart of professional services was for this year and that wasin addition to the professional services, which enabled some of the compsbusiness. We have professional services virtue an integral part in the earlystage of sales in the security side of the business in particular the MSSportfolio.", "So, we recharged them this year to move the big needle ofthe company looking for larger sales in increasing the average deal size thatwe had in those businesses, we've done a good job of doing that. Our averagedeal size is up both in the pipeline and in the things that we have booked.", "And we are starting to get out of some of the serviceoffering areas which are pure professional services, because the blendedmargins will obviously not be that acceptable. So that, moving the big needleis the objective that we have. So, we'll continue to have professional servicesas the tail on the dog. And I think right now we've recalibrated that portfolioto be in line where we think it can make a bigger difference.", "So I think we are on track for what it's designed to do andwe are on track with aligning it to the performance of the businesses thatsupporting. But I would expect that going forward that we will probably reducethe total numbers that we have in there consistent with the portfolio movesthat we make.", "Walter Pritchard -Cowen and Company", "Got you. And is that part of the guidance for Q4 or is thatsomething that's a longer-term move into 2008 and beyond?", "Bill Roper", "That's a longer-term move in the 2008.", "Walter Pritchard -Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then, just last question, around the executivechanges, is there a plan to bring somebody else in the external to fill some ofthe product marketing and customer service roles that Mark McLaughlin had or isthat, are you filling it around with internal personnel?", "Bill Roper", "There is no plan to bring in any additional executives inthat area. We've got a good team here, John Donovan is stepping up to somebroader responsibilities. Several other members of the team are accepting someadditional responsibilities. We've really got a pretty good team here.", "Walter Pritchard -Cowen and Company", "Thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll go next to Scott Kessler ofStandard and Poor's Equity Research.", "Scott Kessler -Standard & Poor's Equity Research", "Thanks a lot. I think most of my questions have been askedand answered, but can you just repeat the specifics about the executives whoare going to have, either have diminish roles of the company or leaving thecompany?", "Bill Roper", "No one is having a diminish role, Bob Korzeniewski, who hasbeen heading up our strategic development area for, I guess, since about 2000,and part of that was with network solutions and even before that with SAIC hasbeen desirous or slowing down for quite sometime now.", "We've continued to encourage Korzo to stay on Board, andhe's really come to the point where he'd like to spend a little more time onsome personal and charitable philanthropic-type activities. And so, inconjunction we're being able to bring Kevin Werner on Board, Korzo will beslowing down. He'll still be with us on a part-time basis. And we're lookingforward to continuing contributions from Korzo and Kevin is a great replacementand I think he'll do a super job there.", "We mentioned that Mark was leaving for personal reasons, weare sorry to see Mark go, but we respect his desire to spend some more timewith his family and to evaluate other opportunities that may come his way.", "Other than that, I'd say we've had people step up toadditional responsibilities including John that I just mentioned and there reallyaren\u2019t any other changes off significance. We\u2019ve some internal promotions. Ifyou go back to shortly after I joined, Bert Clement, our Chief FinancialOfficer, is an internal promotion and Marie Law, our Head of HR is an internalpromotion. And so we\u2019ve had a few things like that but we\u2019ve not -- therereally hasn\u2019t been that much movement.", "Scott Kessler -Standard and Poor's Equity Research", "Great. Okay. Thanks. And my second question involves, Iguess this is kind of been touched upon, but I wanted to explore it a littlebit more. I was surprised frankly, when I saw the news that you guys were doinga debt offering and an accelerated repurchase, largely because you already hada pretty strong cash position at that point, especially given the status of thecredit markets.", "I\u2019m wondering kind of what contributed to that activity,obviously, we all know that you were forced out from repurchasing stock forpretty extended period of time, but if you look at the outstanding shares,let\u2019s say, in Q2 versus this quarter, I think as it was alluded to it actuallywent up. Now, obviously, you are guiding for a notable decline but I\u2019m kind ofwondering, is it just a notion that you wanted to deploy your cash and youdidn't see any other internal or acquisition opportunities. Thanks a lot.", "Bill Roper", "Okay. This is Bill. Let me take up charge and then if Bretwants to jump in, he can. The several questions I think embedded, maybe, partof your question is, why didn't we use existing cash versus a debt offering. Wethought it was a unique window in the market and the structure of theparticular transaction that we used is very, very efficient, its very low costcapital. So the net-net of that transaction was to materially lower ourweighted average cost of capital. That was part of that.", "We use substantially all of the proceeds for repurchase thatwe made in conjunction with the transaction or co-link said that we fixed theprice, which we repay the shares. So there was a decent arbitrage there. We dostill have as noted excess cash. We have borrowing power. And we have greatcash flows.", "and so that should be taken as a signal that we willcontinue to take that money and either invest internally in new productdevelopment and so forth or make acquisitions that we can find meaningfulacquisitions and state our strategy. And we can be assured they will get a goodrisk adjusted return on them and debt cash or cash flow is left over afterthat. We intend to continue to employ message to return on debt to ourshareholders. Does that cover you question?", "Scott Kessler -Standard and Poor's Equity Research", "Yeah. I guess, I was wondering I think it was touched upon,but you saw sequential outstanding shares all increased?", "Bill Roper", "Let me touch that one too.", "Scott Kessler -Standard and Poor's Equity Research", "Yeah. ", "Bill Roper", "The third quarter is always the quarter of net shareissuance due to the -- that's the time of the year we do our equity round forour employees or large number of our employees participate in equity programs,both non qualify stock options as well as our issues. And so in the thirdquarter there is a fair amount of issuance typically in connection with that.And then we also in this particular third quarter as a factor that Bert alreadymentioned that was having been, sort of, out of business, if you will, forabout 15 months.", "There was this for backlog of employee stock optionexercises and the ESPP catch-up and so forth. So that would have happenedwhether we bought stock back or not in the third quarter, really the repurchasejust helped to minimize that and you'll see us return to being net purchaser, Ibelieve of own shares or you'll see shares outstanding going downquarter-to-quarter from this point forward.", "Scott Kessler -Standard and Poor's Equity Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. We'll take our last question from Shaul Eyal of CIBCWorld Markets.", "Shaul Eyal - CIBCWorld Markets", "Thank you. Hi, good afternoon, guys. One quick question onthe ISQ front, the growth that you have seen in the addition in new URL inwebsite, can you quantify for us kind of from a geographic perspective whereit's coming from mainly?", "Bill Roper", "Yeah. Well, I mean there are a number of geographies thatare doing well. But if you look at the international expansion we have rightnow, it's growing faster than the overall rate in Chinaand Germany,are two areas right now where we are getting substantial growth.", "Shaul Eyal - CIBCWorld Markets", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We have no additional questions at this time. I'd like toturn the call back over to, Mr. Ken Bond for any closing remarks.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, operator. We anticipate that our next quarterlyconference call, which will reflect our fourth quarter 2007 results will beheld on Thursday, January 31st, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time, 5:00 p.m. Easterntime.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond. Please go ahead sir.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you Ronnie. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. I am Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm here with Bill Roper, President and CEO, of VeriSign and Bert Clement, our Chief Financial Officer.", "A replay of this call will be available, beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, via telephone at 888-203-1112, or 719-457-0820 for international callers and will be available through February 6.

Specifically, the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q in any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, financial statements in today's press release and the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. Our non-GAAP income statement and a description of items excluded in our non-GAAP financial information are located on the VeriSign Investor Relations website.", "In a moment, Bill and Bert will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we'll open up the call to your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. We anticipate the call will end at approximately 3:00 p.m.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill?", "Bill Roper", "Thanks Ken. In this call, I would like start with some comments on our performance for the fourth quarter and from there, I will recap the year with few highlights, then touch on some areas that we believe are of particular interest to our investors based on conversations we have had with shareholders.", "These topics include how we are managing the business in this period of transition, how and what we plan to communicate with investors during the course of 2008, and an update on our progress since the Analyst Day in November. Bert will then discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and provide some limited guidance before we move to the Q&A portion of the call.", "So with that, let's talk a bit about fourth quarter and all of 2007. Q4 was a solid quarter and is driven by our core franchises of Naming and SSL. We reported total revenues of $386 million, which was slightly above the high end of our previous guidance.", "The reorganization that we begin implementing early in the year and the disciplined expense management that are continuing to bear fruit as our non-GAAP operating margins for the quarter improved 25.1%, an improvement of over 650 basis points from year ago levels. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.30 and that's a penny ahead of consensus estimate on strong revenue in operating margins and interest income.", "Moving now to the business metrics for the fourth quarter, I would like to talk a bit about our core businesses starting with Naming. The Naming business continues to show strength as the adjusted zone for registered names in .com and .net now total 80.4 million names, compared with 77 million names last quarter and that's an increase year-over-year of 24%. The growth is driven by continued global internet adoption with 7.5 million new domain name registrations for .com and .net that we processed during the quarter as well 10.5 million renewals, which continue to show strength.", "The underlying growth drivers this quarter consistent with prior quarter\u2019s solid growth in both U.S. and international, and while we see solid growth domestically we also continue to develop international opportunities, having accredited over 25 registrars in China, India, Latin America, regions that we see the possibility of showing significant growth potential for both .com and .net.", "We also saw continued growth from all our customer segments, corporate, SMB, consumer and online advertising. The online advertising activity remains a small, but consistent part of our new name sales in overall base.", "The renewal rate for the third quarter was 74% and we expect the actual renewal rate for the fourth quarter will be similar to last quarter, both within our historical range of mid-70, 73 or 77%.", "Then finally, the digital infrastructure structure is now handling peak loads of over 33 billion DNS request per day, 33 billion with the B. Our unique capability to operate global network at this scale and reliability remains unparalleled. Let me repeat, no one else operates global networks and infrastructure of this nature at this volume level or with a 100% uptime over the past decade, core strength and unique capability of our company.", "Moving to security services, I\u2019ll start with our second core franchise SSL. We sold over 233,000 certificates during the quarter and while Q4 has traditionally been a strong quarter for the SSL business, this year was no exception. We saw excellent sequential growth in orders. Our installed base has now grown to 938,000 certificates compared with 912,000 last quarter. We are pleased with this growth as it represents 3% sequential and 16% year-over-year growth in this business base.", "At the Analyst Day in November, we introduced an annualized average unit revenue metric for the installed base. We believe that this new metric provides investors an easier means of understanding revenue performance and trends in this business.", "For Q4, the AUR, annualized average unit revenue or AUR where the installed base of VeriSign GeoTrust and Thawte branded certificates was $273. And that is up from the prior quarter's $271, a small increase across all brands.", "We are also especially pleased with results of our EV or extended valuation certificate as we met our targets for 2007. More than 2000 of our customers have gone green with EV and the demand for the EV certificates continues to be strong in Q4. And while this pipeline is still in early stages, we are the number one provider of EV type certificate in this market at this time, and we continue to expect that the EV adoption cycle will be consistent with previous premium priced products in the past. Microsoft\u2019s comments last week about this adoption further give us confidence of the EV growth potential.", "I will now turn to share some comments on the progress of our identity and authentication services business. In the past, we have used different labels for this business including VIP, identity protection, identity services and other such names. Going forward, we are going to refer to this business as Identity and Authentication Services, IAS for short and it consists of our services such as the VIP program and a One-Time Password or OTP authentication services program as well as fraud detection services and our enterprise PKI business.", "The VIP and OTP program has continued to be a great example of an internet scaled service running on a global infrastructure that provide scaleable and secure real time validation capabilities that can support millions of online users. Across our VIP and OTP program, the strength continues as we have now sold over 1.3 million credentials and we continue to be pleased with the strong update of these credentials by consumers and we expect to see this adoption continue to ramp.", "This quarter, we are also to note that Yahoo announced its support of the OpenID 2.0 digital identity framework, joining companies like Google, Microsoft and IBM. Yahoo has 248 million registered users, all of them now have an OpenID identifier bringing the total number of OpenID accounts to over 350 million users worldwide. And we believe that this is a significant development for our identify authentication efforts as the aggregation of first factor authentication into an OpenID only increases the importance of second factor authentication services that VeriSign offers.", "I'll now take a quick look back at 2007 as a whole. We think it proved to be, to say the least, an eventful year for VeriSign, starting with a company wide restructuring, which began the changes leading to the non-GAAP operating margin improvement of over 650 basis points that we mentioned earlier. This is where we continue to focus on and we expect operating margins will be significantly higher yet again this year.", "As many of you may recall, we made several management changes starting in late May, when I was named Chief Executive, shortly thereafter, Bert was named Chief Financial Officer and, we have made some additional changes over the second half. More recently we name Ken Silva as our Chief Technology Officer. While we may to see more additions, I am very pleased with the team in place and their commitment to execute on the plans that we have developed and that we communicated to you in November.", "One of my initial objectives when taking over as CEO was to complete the stock option restatement process, align the company to become current in financial filings. We accomplished that in early July. And in November, we received confirmation from the SEC that its investigation of VeriSign has been closed. This is an important milestone and putting these matters behind us.", "Another early objective, we wanted address with our capital structure and in August we issued 1.25 billion in convertible debt and we used the majority of the proceeds to repurchase 38 million shares of common stock, reducing the shares outstanding by about 16% during the second half of 2007.", "Finally, and this is actually good safe way to the next topic. We completed a comprehensive strategic business review. And while there is much work ahead us, we are committed to the resulting strategy. So with that, I would like to talk about how we are managing business especially with all the myriad activities underway at this time.", "To start, because we are mindful that we must avoid the potential for distraction to our ongoing core businesses, we have taken a sort of dividing and conquer approach with the management team, so as company we can remain focused on continuing to develop and grow our core businesses, as well as maintain a continuity and optimize the eventual sale of the businesses being divested.", "The majority of our senior management team, including [Reynard Quist] who manages our Naming business and [Chris Bebo], who manages our SNL business, along with me, continues to spend the majority of our time focused on protecting and growing our core businesses.", "And the business is being divested; John Donovan and Grant Clark are focusing on managing these businesses to ensure continuity in their operations until each has been transitioned to a new owner.", "And finally, as we discussed at Analyst Day, Rusty Lewis and Kevin Werner are working on managing the sales process of the businesses we are targeting for divestment.", "So I guess in summary, by having a few of our senior leaders focus on the businesses being divested, we believe that we minimize the distractions to the rest of the team of who we are focused on protecting and growing our core business operations.", "As we discussed at our Analyst Day, 2008 is going to be a very interesting with a lot of moving parts, as we expect to work through a number of divestures over the course of the year.  Having taken steps to ensure that we maintain the right focus on our core businesses, I want to share with you how we intend to communicate to you our activities and results over the coming quarters.", "To start, during the first quarter, we intend to place all qualifying businesses into discontinued operations for accounting, reporting purposes. We believe this step will help investors better understand the financial performance of our core businesses, which we believe is the key to our long-term shareholder value.", "And as a reminder, our continuing operating results will include the lag effect for elements of indirect overhead G&A cost, which will be reduced overtime as we complete the divestment transactions and associated transition service agreements.", "However, we do believe that the discontinued operations accounting treatment for businesses being divested is a positive step and helping investors understand the operating performance of our core businesses.", "Our operating margins of the core businesses will also be impacted by increased investments in these businesses that we focus more intently on developing a broader product set and reinvigorate in the growth potential we see in these great businesses. We'll be providing revenue and operating margin guidance on our core businesses, which include Naming, SSL, and Identity Authentication Services including a majority ownership in VeriSign, Japan which is focused around these core businesses.", "And for the businesses being divested, we report on the status of the divestment activity as appropriate throughout the year.", "I'll like to now provide a brief update of our progress since Analyst Day November. As you recall, we discussed our strategic business review process wherein we evaluated each business in terms of whether it was a good fit with our core strength in internet infrastructure, as well as factors such as market size, growth rate, inherent economics, as well as competitive position in our ability to win in the market place.", "From this process, we identified three business clearly being good fits, Naming, SSL and Identity and Authentication services. As you know, Naming and SSL are just two great businesses, leading market share in growing markets. Each business also leverages our internet infrastructure, which as I stated earlier, remains unparalleled in terms of scale and reliability while providing us powerful economics.", "The Identity and Authentication Service business addresses a large market opportunity for VeriSign. The business is small today, but it is expected to grow rapidly and it also leverages our internet infrastructure as well.", "We've now completed the strategic business review and with the exception the core business is previously discussed again Naming, SSL and Identify and Authentication Services, we intend to divest each of the remaining business discussed during Analyst Day, including those noted as requiring additional time for decision.", "So having completed the strategic business review , I would like to update you on the status of our divestiture efforts. Overall, I described our progress as being on track and up to our expectations as discussed earlier. We expect that there will be a half dozen or more transactions over the course of 2008 and we have already started to market several of these businesses and expect to add a couple more shortly.", "We are pleased with the level of interest to-date, both solicited and unsolicited, it's been high and it's been from both strategic and financial buyers. We are really pleased with the quality of the potential buyers. And while we realize that interest alone does not a transaction make, we continue to be satisfied with our early progress and as we close transactions, will continue to keep you informed.", "I'll now turn the call over to Bert for a walk-through of our financial results for the fourth quarter and 2007, as well as guidance. Bert?", "Bert Clement", "Thanks Bill and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Before turning to the fourth quarter, I would like to briefly highlight the results for the year 2007. For the year consolidated revenue excluding Jamba! was $1.47 billion, up over 15% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the year again excluding Jamba! was 22.6%.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share for the year was a $1.03 an increase of nearly $0.30 a year-over- year after excluding Jamba! for both years. Cash flow from operations for the year was strong in excess of $450 million. Finally, our 2007 capital expenditures were $152 million, as we continue to build out our new Delaware data center.", "Turning now to fourth quarter highlights. Q4 was a solid quarter on multiple fronts, Having come in slightly above our revenue guidance at $386 million and 10 basis points higher than our non-GAAP operating margin guidance. Exiting Q4, at 25.1%, 670 basis points higher than Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 came in penny above consensus estimate, as operating income and interest income were both better than expected.", "On a GAAP basis we reported a net loss of $0.88 per share, due to an estimated non cash impairment charge of $210 million in Q4 as we prepared the Digital Content and Messaging business for sale. The actual evaluation has not yet been finalized.", "In Q4, we completed our accelerated share repurchase program earlier than originally expected as we repurchased 6.6 million shares at an average price of $30.17. Moving to the second half of 2007, we repurchased a total of 38 million shares at an average price $30.22, reducing basic share outstanding by 16% since June 30th. As an update, our Board recently authorized an additional 600 million share repurchase.", "I would now like to move to more detailed discussion of financial results for the fourth quarter. Q4 revenues at $286 million was up 14% year-over-year excluding Jamba! and as noted earlier slightly above the high end of our guidance. The growth was driven again by the continued strength in our core businesses.", "As in past quarters, we are reporting based on our two business segments ISG an CSG. The Internet Services Group, grew approximately 4% sequentially and 20% year-over-year with revenues of $244.7 million or 63% of total revenue. This growth was fueled by strength in Naming SSL and Security services.", "The Communication Services Group grew 1% quarter-over-quarter with revenue of $141.8 million or 37% of total revenue. Excluding Jamba!, CSG was revenue up 4% year-over-year.", "Moving to international operations, the percent of revenue driven from international customers, affiliates and subsidiaries was 15% as compared to 16% last quarter. Cost of revenue for Q4 was $142 million, down $1 million from last quarter and driving a non-GAAP Q4 gross margin of 63.3%, up a 150 basis points, sequentially. Factors contributing to the increase in gross margin included continued reductions in headcount and reduction of direct expenses.", "Turning to operating margins, total operating expenses for Q4 was $148 million or 38.2% of revenue, down from 38.4% last quarter. The percentage decline was expected, given our expectation to grow expenses at a lower rate than revenue. We ended the quarter with a non-GAAP operating margin of 25.1% compared with 23.4% last quarter, a 170 basis point improvement from last quarter and a 670 basis point increase from Q4 2006.", "Income below the line was better than expected contributing to our better than expected EPS. In particular, interest income was strong, as cash balances ended the quarter at $1.4 billion due in part to better working capital management and higher than normal employees stock option exercise.", "Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $70 million with the non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30, which is a penny above consensus estimates, due primarily to operating and interest income as previously discussed. The diluted share count on EPS calculation was slightly below 230 million shares.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow item, our ability to consistently generate solid operating cash flows resulted in our maintaining a strong balance sheet with ending cash equivalent and short term investment at $1.4 billion, an increase of $255 million from last quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $58 million with 21% attributable to CSG, 28% to ISG, and 51% for corporate infrastructure. The increase for corporate infrastructure this quarter is related to the construction of the Delaware operation center, expected to be completed in the first half of 2008.", "Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong, in excess of $180 million. There are multiple drivers to the positive free cash flow this quarter, including strong accounts receivable, collection stemming from the invoicing issue discussed last quarter, deferred revenue growth, employee stock option exercises and other favorable working capital items.", "Net DSO for the fourth quarter returned to historical level at 44 days, as invoicing issues discussed last quarter have been resolved. Our Q4 ending deferred revenue was $739 million, up $28 million from the previous quarter and a 22% year-over-year increase.", "This increase, in deferred revenue was driven by strong sales in Naming and SSL. We ended the quarter with 4,250 employees, 120 lower than last quarter and almost 1,100 less than where we began in the year.", "Moving now to guidance, as Bill mentioned earlier we intend to place all qualifying businesses into discontinued operations during Q1. As a result we are providing guidance for our core businesses, which include Naming, SSL and Identity and Authentication Services. For Q1, we expect revenue for our core businesses to be in the range of $215 million to $220 million.", "As a reminder, during our Analyst Day, we discussed the lag effect to operating margins, so 2008 margins will reflect the inclusion of the significant, indirect, overhead expenses, which will be reduced overtime. We remain confident that we'll substantially complete all divestitures during 2008 and that we will complete necessary overhead realignment shortly thereafter. However, we are not in a position to forecast exactly when divestitures will take place within the year.", "As a result, we are providing the following guidance around operating margins. We now expect that in light of our decision to focus fully on our three core businesses of Naming, SSL and IAS. We expect the Q4 2008 exit operating margin will be 35% or higher on a non-GAAP basis, approximately 1,000 basis points higher than our current operating margin and 500 basis points higher than estimates provided, as part of our Analyst Day. ", "This operating margin guidance also reflects increased investments we'll make in our core businesses as mentioned earlier by Bill. Additionally, we are reaffirming our commentary from Analyst Day as we expect that the Q4, 2008 year end fully diluted share count will be 200 million shares or less.", "In summary, we are pleased with our execution in 2007, particularly as it relates to revenue growth from our core businesses, as well operating margin expansion and we recognize the importance of executing our strategy in 2008 as the key to unlocking shareholder value in longer-term.", "We'd now like to open the call for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we will go first to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys. How are you?", "Bert Clement", "Doing well. Thanks.", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "So, Bert, on the guidance given that you are going to have your corporate overhead continuing to '08, can you give us any sense for where you think operating margins will be on the three core businesses as we look into '09 as you back the overhead out?", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. I think the way we are handling the guidance is the 35% number that we provided you as what we are targeting for the company as an exit rate 2008. And I think from there we would seek some improvement into 2009.", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And can you give us a sense within ISG, kind of quantify the amount of revenue being shown in discontinued ops, so we didn\u2019t get a sense with the $215 million to $220 million guidance? How that lines up versus ISG today?", "Bert Clement", "I didn\u2019t get that, we are breaking up on the call. You said something about ISG?", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "Yeah. I was trying to -- if you look at your guidance on a three core businesses, I am trying to correlate the 215 to 220 versus kind of what ISG is today. So, if you\u2019d give us a sense for kind of the magnitude of revenues that will be discontinued ops out of ISG?", "Bert Clement", "I don't have the exact details of that breakdown with us. I think what we are trying to do is focus everyone on the core business, knowing that the qualifying businesses for discontinuing operations in Q1 may be slightly different than that.", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then one general question for you guys. On the naming side two questions. One, can you talk about any negative impact of the price increase or is there anything out there that would indicate that the second price increase shouldn\u2019t be forthcoming? And then, can you comment on [what are] articles around the names have been and how I can potentially prevent free dipping going forward? Do you anticipate that having impact on your growth profile at all in the DNS business?", "Bill Roper", "Okay. Let me see if remember both parts of the question well. So catch me Todd if I don't completely answer. On the second part, you talked about dipping or pay-per-click and so forth. There are changes going on in the marketplace out there. We don't really comment on those changes, we just react to them. We think possibly at the margin there could a very small impact on us, that probably you won\u2019t be able to measure. The first question was around pricing.", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "Pricing, any\u2026", "Bill Roper", "Well, pricing, okay. As you know we implemented a price increase of 7% for .com and 10% for .net mid-October last year. We haven\u2019t seen any measurable impact of that price increase. We don't believe that at these prices, the market is very sensitive to that. You know the contract that we signed was a six-year contract and it provided up to four price increases, no more than one a year during the term. And we are constantly evaluating our product pricing policy throughout the company, but we don't comment on anything else.", "Todd Raker -- Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Yeah, good evening everyone. Focusing again on the registries, so if I look at the sequential increase, I think it was one of the slower increases you\u2019ve seen this year. Are we starting to see this become the large numbers or there is some seasonality baked in there? And I have a follow-up, too.", "Bill Roper", "Okay. Rob, the short answer is, there maybe some seasonality. If you go back to the fourth quarter of the prior year it was the similar type of increase in units quarter-over-quarter. So there may be a little seasonality in there. We\u2019re not really sure. I mean all indicators are, all the drivers in that business global, internet, usage and adoption rates remain very strong and we\u2019re very comfortable about the future growth of this business.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Okay and then along the SSL side, how should we think about pricing moving forward, especially with EVS also becomes a bigger portion of the portfolio? How much can that drive in terms of increase in that ASP you're giving?", "Bill Roper", "Hard to tell, but EV itself, which as you know is a premium price product, is doing very well. We\u2019re very pleased with it. It\u2019s on the lower part of the parabolic curve that we\u2019ve experienced with other or with the similar premium priced products in the past. So, it\u2019s not really having a material impact on the whole portfolio the AAUR, whatever we call it Rob, of the whole portfolio, yes. But certainly it will tend to start having an impact and we\u2019re continually getting orders and we feel good about the business and where its going. It's still small at this stage.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great and then last question -- any metrics you willing to share around the ID and Authentication Services, anything that can help us track that business? How many credentials have you got?", "Ken Bond", "Total credentials that we mentioned in the prepared commentary.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "That obviously was an annual number, correct?", "Bill Roper", "That\u2019s total out, I mean, that\u2019s the total number of [identity] sold and in place, is that right?", "Bert Clement", "Yeah, 1.3 million and last quarter 1 million.", "Bill Roper", "Yeah and I think it was a $1 million quarter ago so you can get an idea of sort of increment there. Again in the relative scheme of things that business is fairly small for us today but it is very, it\u2019s a niche market, it is growing. We think it has got huge growth potential. We are very excited about the business. We are investing in the business and we feel very good about it. It\u2019s small but we think it\u2019s a big part of our future.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) We go next to Peter Kuper with Morgan Stanley.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks guys. Actually, if I could turn back to the Todd's line of questioning there. That operating margin of 35% guys, that was not including the corporate overhead, did I hear that right?", "Bert Clement", "No, we are including corporate overhead in that rate and that's our target for year end.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I'm sorry, that's the exit rate Bert\u2026", "Bert Clement", "Exit rate at year end we are targeting to get the 35%.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Bill Roper", "Yeah, what we are trying to communicate is that as we make divestitures, some of the indirect cost which have to be charged to the continuing operations, don't just drop off instantaneously with the divestiture and you have to manage them down. And so there is a little bit of a lag effect there. And so, you won't see total benefit of that, so say maybe a quarter after a divestiture or something. We are going to manage it very tightly, but as Bert said, our pro forma op income margin, exit rate fourth quarter where we've now stepped up to attain, we think it will be a 35%.", "Bert Clement", "And Peter we'll keep you updated on that on a quarterly basis just to tell you our progress and hopefully as we go into this continued ops we'll be able to kind of show that on the P&L itself as the year progresses.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And then for Q1 guidance, so did you give the number of 215 to 220 for those core businesses, but no, did I miss this in any of our guidance around what -- do you have any margin for that business would be or anything color wise on discontinued ops? Because I think you said you have six deals or six transactions sometime in '08, but how is Q1 shaping up, just want this to get a better sense of the very near picture versus the end of the year picture?", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. So I think it\u2019s going to be an improvement quarter-to-quarter on the operating margin line and I think we will have hopefully the discontinued operation situation versus continuing cleared up pretty nicely by the end of Q2.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So that\u2019s definitely the first half of that so to speak.", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. That's definitely our target at this point for right now.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then last question on the renewal rate, I think it was around 74% for Q3, that rate is just 73% to 77%. Do you guys feel that\u2019s a comfortable go forward rate for next year as part of the guidance? Is that considered in that guidance filled up or do you want rates that\u2019s not going forward.", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. We have been in that range for a couple of year now. We believe that that's going to continue. Obviously, there are market factors they could have some impact but we still think we will be in that sweet spot range in the mid 70s.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan. ", "Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan", "Thanks, hi guys. ", "Bert Clement", "Hi Sterling.", "Sterling Auty -- J.P. Morgan", "I want to circle back, you guys kind of broke up, I am not sure if you answered it but so the guidance for the three core business is the 215 to 220 in the first quarter. Can you give us a sense what those three businesses generated revenue in the fourth quarter?", "Bert Clement", "We were not going to go back and try to prorate everything quarter-to-quarter from the past, but I think we are sticking with Q1 is 215 to 220 at this point.", "Bill Roper", "Sterling, and if you remember, mid year last year we told you that what we would do is we would give you end quarter revenue guidance, some kind of margin indication this year because of the murkiness of the factors we described, we decided we\u2019d give you an exit rate margin, up income margin for the year end. And then as necessary we will talk about shares outstanding.", "Bert Clement", "Now, Sterling, what I will do is reiterate that we do see growth in the high teens, so 18 to 20, potentially exceeding that is not an issue for that business.", "Sterling Auty - J P Morgan \u00a0", "Okay. And then maybe just \u2013 you mentioned the three core areas, as we think of ISG, just remind us the bucket or the things that come out from the businesses. In other words, you have IAS, but does that mean, security consulting, that gets sold? Now, what are the pieces out of ISG that are going out that were not formerly you outlined at the Analyst Day?", "Bill Roper", "Yeah. The larger elements of ISG that will leave are going to be the managed security services business. That will include the security consulting aspect to that. And then, there are a couple of smaller businesses in there like digital brand management. For example that would be in that bucket as well.", "Sterling Auty - J P Morgan \u00a0", "Okay. And then, last question. Any just high level kind of commentary about what you are hearing through your conservations with customers and inter-operations about how you see the overall macro-economy both domestic and internationally kind of impacting the three core businesses that you are keeping?", "Bill Roper", "Well, Sterling, you probably are better qualified than us to answer that question. We really don't view our \u2013 especially the two businesses, Naming and SSL as pretty much independent of the economic cycle. They are driven by internet usage and adoption rates globally. We have parts of the markets, especially internationally that we think we've under-absorbed or not invested in enough, that we are doing some very specific things starting early this year. We got a few new products [in froze] and product development things going on. So we feel that we'll have very attractive relative growth rates and we see the business continue to be solid and stable.", "Sterling Auty - J P Morgan \u00a0", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman-Sachs", "Sarah Friar - Goldman-Sachs", "Good afternoon guys. Kind of a derivative of Sterling\u2019s question about the environment. Bill, to what extent do you think that the environment is having an impact on your ability to quickly spin-off the other businesses that you don't want to keep? Have you seen change in the dialogue, you may be having with potential acquirers etc?", "Bill Roper", "Okay, that's good question, Sarah, and the answer is a good answer I think. As we said before, these really by and large are large very good businesses. We haven't necessarily managed in that that well. They don't necessarily fit. They don't fit that and that\u2019s the reason we made the decision to divest of them in our strategy or within our core competence in internet infrastructure. ", "That being said, they are good businesses, they are solid businesses and there are great additions for other companies. So, the interest, buyer interest has been, as I noted, strong, very encouraging, quality buyers both financially and strategically and kind of across the board. ", "The size of these transactions and the nature of the buyers especially on the strategic side, the current financial markets don't really have much impact, I mean at the margin, we may get a little bit less realization in total purchase price. But not anything significant there, and in many cases the level of bidding the price indication so far from the first round [stats] on two of the larger properties have been very good, and we are encouraged.", "We consider our sales is on track from a time frame and we're seeing nothing that indicates we won't get somewhere between good to very good realization for VeriSign, while at the same time placing these businesses and our employees and our customers in very good hands.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman-Sachs", "Great, okay, good. That was a good answer. Thank you Bill. Just one another question on the core registry business, there are really two parts. So, one, you've talked about reinvestment in the core business. When can we start to see some additional services rollout, now through the new icon agreement allows you lot of flexibility there?", "And then just part two, how you seen any impact on demand from the price increase today then kind of the core.com registry, that\u2019s just one thing that are come up a little during the quarter?", "Bill Roper", "Okay. Again I think, a good story, impact on demand is not measurable, we can\u2019t find it.  At the price levels we are talking, we are really pretty price insensitive. So, we just -- we don't see that being in this anything. So if it is there we can find it both in unit sales and real rates.", "If you go to a new products across the three core, we have a number of things in the pipeline primarily internally developed products, additions, improvement and those types of things that will help on the growth side and will help further building, strengthen and protect our position as market leaders. And we are announcing a number of things all alone that they are small and not noise level things like say EV or something like that, and specially on the Identity and Authentication Services business -- sorry I must get used to that acronym. VIP is so much easier to say, but probably not as descriptive. We\u2019ve got a lot going on and you'll start seeing these things. They are hitting the market shortly.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman-Sachs", "Great. Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. We go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Hi, good afternoon. Can you give us an estimate of what kind of domain growth you expect for this year? And then can you tell us the member of active domains versus those, that have been activated, not just bought?", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. I think we've seen a modeling growth in the high teens to 20% range on units. I think the active domain number, Ken has found it here right now, is in the 70% range may be even higher than that.", "Ken Bond", "I think it is more about 80 range.", "Bert Clement", "80 range, probably that\u2019s just..", "Ken Bond", "It\u2019s just less than 10% to 15% that domains don\u2019t resolve.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then can you -- I don't think you said can you tell us how close you are to selling off some of these bundles, meaning is the process still fairly so long?", "Bill Roper", " ", "Well, we didn\u2019t say but we have a lot of activity ongoing. We have a couple of bundles of businesses in the marketplace now. We like a said to very good initial interest. We are going into the second round. And it's very difficult to predict timing, there is aspects of that process we can control and certainly aspects of that process are totally outside of our control. I can just tell you we are on track from a time line and we are pleased with the early indications.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. And then last question. I don't know if you answered this, but can you talk how much cash do you expect to get from the sale of  these assets?", "", "Bill Roper", "We haven't talked about that. It's material...", "Bert Clement", "We are hoping to get about 10% of our market cap as cash received hopefully.", "", "Bill Roper", "Yeah. I mean the way you should think about it, you should think about these businesses as being 10% of the company from a value standpoint plus or minus or point or two.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Next we will go to Steve Ashley with Robert W Baird.", "Steve Ashley -- Robert W Baird", "Great. My first question is on differed revenue, how should we think about the divestitures when they are completed? How might that impact the differed revenue balances, maybe just qualitative?", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. Most of the deferred revenue is going to stay with us because it's tied into the Naming and SSL businesses. There are a couple of other businesses that have a little bit of deferred revenue but I would say at least 96% to 97% of that deferred one will stay with the company.", "Steve Ashley -- Robert W. Baird", "And did FX have much impact on the reported revenue this quarter?", "Bert Clement", "Pardon me, one more time?", "Steve Ashley -- Robert W Baird", "Currency exchange, did FX have much impact on the revenue you reported this quarter?", "Bert Clement", "I don't think it was very significant, no.", "Steve Ashley -- Robert W Baird", "Great, thank you.", "Bill Roper", "The bigger businesses are dollar based. ", "Steve Ashley -- Robert W Baird", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll go next to Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan Security.", "", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Security", "Well, thank you. Good afternoon. Really just had one follow-up and the question, maybe trying to get a start point and end point to the remaining segments not being discontinued. I might have missed it. But what kind of operating margins do you expect here in Q1 for the continued operations? And when you look at Q4, I know you were in corporate overheads, just over $20 million right now. To get that 35% operating margins I assume the assumption that stays around $20 million or you can bring it down to maybe $15 million to $20 million range and bring it down in \u201909 from there?", "", "Bert Clement", "I think the hard part for us is try and understand when these divestitures are going to actually happen. So we are confident that we can give you a decent number for operating margin for Q1. So what we have done is instead given you exit operating margin for the core business for year-end and we do hope to get that number overtime incrementally every quarter.", "", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Security", "Okay. So there is no range of corporate overhead that you guys have a near assumption that's 35% like $10 million to $20 million, I mean, knowing that it's a wide range?", "", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. We are still dissecting the corporate overhead right now in the sense of what is clearly direct versus indirect. There are some very accounting rules there on what you can apply in discontinued operations versus what has to stay in continuing. If you recall, we did go to a function of organization earlier in 2007, so we have to be very careful how we present that go forward. So I think the key is, we've taken a conservative approach on it, on what will probably remain and then we will be whacking at it every single quarter and especially as the businesses [lead] try to tighten up the overhead thereafter.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Security", "Maybe ignoring the discontinued operations and the corporate overhead, what kind of segment margin profile would we see if these remaining three segment in total?", "Bert Clement", "Yes, I think we\u2019ve told you exiting the year at least 35% and that some of the ongoing synergies would come in 2009. So, we would expect some incremental improvement from there.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan Security", "Okay, fair enough, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you we\u2019ll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys, just a follow up question to help us with the modeling aspects. In Q4, can you give us a sense ISG right now runs at 82% gross margin? You guys are going to pull the Managed Security Services business out of that which is a very low gross margin product. I would assume that the three core businesses should see a gross margin north of 82%. Can you frame it for us in terms of Q4, so we it can be triangulated in the apex run rate to get to the margin of 35%?", "Bert Clement", "You know Todd, I think what we\u2019re going to try and do is frame it to you on a go-forward basis. A lot of that has to do with, for example, if you look at our capital expenditures, we told you that the data center is sitting in corporate. While it really doesn\u2019t belong in corporate, it belongs in those businesses, and that\u2019s going to be some other important enhancements we\u2019re going to make in 2008.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Is it a fair assumption to assume that, since you are pulling the Managed Security Services business out that the gross margin associated with the three core business is higher than 82%?", "Bert Clement", "It\u2019s a fair assumption.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, on a consistent basis.", "Bill Roper", "On a consistent basis.", "Bert Clement", "Right, on a consistent basis. ", "Bill Roper", "It will be higher.", "Bert Clement", "Because we\u2019ll be making some investments, there will be increased depreciation for the data centers and other things that will - it won't be as high as you might think it is, but it's something that we\u2019ll share with you all during the year. ", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks. ", "Bill Roper", "Hey, Todd you don't get another deal. That is all you get.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great. So at this time given the guidance you laid at the Analyst Day, are you reiterating then the lower end of that earnings per share range to the $1.15 because I think you gave us a revenue range on the three core businesses of around $900 million? Thanks.", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. I think what we are really saying is on an exit rate basis; the 35% is really going to depend on a variety of things on how well we do to that and along with the share count at year-end. But remember that's an exit rate number that we are trying to portray at Analyst Day and we are hoping to do a little better in that.", "Ken Bond", "Just to confirm Rob, we did not provide earnings per share guidance today for the quarter or the year.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Okay. So you are not speaking to the Analyst Day of the $1.15 to $1.29?", "Bert Clement", "The number that we talked about today, you can use for modeling going forward.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. We go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "I have to ask a follow-up, since everyone else is doing it. So you said just a minute ago that the definition of discontinued op is pretty strict, and you lastly talked, I don't think you are going to put everything into this discontinued ops, so what changed?", "Bert Clement", "No, I think what we telling you as we're getting give you guidance based on a continuing businesses that are core to U.S. There maybe a few differences in between, but I don't think they are going to be significant. Our view is by the end of the first half, we ought to be fairly consistent at that point.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. So does that mean though that your revenue number for next quarter could actually include some of the businesses that you'll be divesting?", "Bert Clement", "No, what we gave you is a pure revenue number for just the three core businesses. We wanted to be very clear about that.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. But if a business doesn't go into discontinued op, it stays in your revenue line right?", "Bert Clement", " ", "That's correct. And we will reconcile for you when we get there.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bert Clement", " ", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have time for one final question. We will take that question from Peter Kuper with Morgan Stanley.", "Peter Kuper - Morgan Stanley", "", "Sorry, I [won't] go round about here. ", "Bill Roper", "Are there only about five guys on the call, is that what the problem is here?", "Peter Kuper -- Morgan Stanley", "We just love you so much. We just want to talk you more and more. ", "Bill Roper", "That works for us. ", "Peter Kuper -- Morgan Stanley", "Straight forward and I think whatever we are trying we are all talking about the same stuff here. Trying to figure out for Q1 just talking about the exit rate margins, what are you guys expecting from a consensus point of view? If there are models, obviously to be tossed upside down here with the three core model, three core business being a model, end of the exit year I get that. So we have a directional good idea where we are going. But for Q1 how are you guys feeling about what we should be modeling from an operating margin point of view there? ", "Bert Clement", "Yeah. I think the best advise I can give you from there is take our exit rate at Q4 and what we gave you as a exit rate for '08 at the end of the year, and kind of factor -- I wouldn\u2019t say factored in linearly, but factor in some improvement quarter-to-quarter to get to that 35% by the end of year, that's best advise I can give you.", "Peter Kuper -- Morgan Stanley", "Okay. All right, that's pretty sure. We will work with that. And then I guess on that, you guys I would hope obviously by then we will able to do year-over-year comparison with the three core business on a growth rate?", "Bert Clement", "As we get it all cleaned up that will be come very apparent. ", "Peter Kuper -- Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Ken Bond for any additional or closing comments.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you Ronnie. We anticipate that our next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our first quarter 2008 results will be held on Wednesday April 30 at 2:00 pm Pacific Time.

Please go ahead sir.", "Ken Bond \u2013 Vice President of Corporate Communications", "Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I am Ken Bond, Vice President of Corporate Communications and I'm here today with Bill Roper, President and CEO of VeriSign and Brian Robins our Acting Chief Financial Officer.", "A replay of this call will be available beginning at 5:00 pm Pacific Time via telephone at 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 for International callers.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. And we anticipate the call will end before 6 pm Eastern Time.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Bill. Bill?", "Bill Roper - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Ken. In this call, I would like to start with some comments on our key announcements we made during our quarter, followed by our view of our business and operating results for the first quarter, and from there I would like to touch on some areas that we believe are particular interest investor based on conversations we have had with shareholders including how we are managing the business overall and an update on our divestitures activities.", "Brian will then discuss the financial results for the first quarter and provide limited guidance before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. In February we announced the formation of our scientific advisory board which includes several highly distinguished members of the technology community, such as Vint Cerf, Marty Hellman, Glenn Adelman and our Board Chairman Jim Bidzos. This group will provide guidance to our Senior Management to ensure that VeriSign maintains and grows its technology leadership position.", "As many of you may be aware our board appointed Brian Robins as Acting Chief Financial Officer last month replacing Bert Clement. I realize that Brian will be a new voice to many of you so I would like to share with you how pleased I am that Brian has stepped up in this new role.", "At VeriSign Brian has been responsible for domestic and international finance. He has also been instrumental in developing our strategic plan in monitoring our progress and Brian conducts our monthly operating reviews and has implemented some key financial management processes.", "Last quarter we also made another key hire in Robynne Sisco who joined the company in February is our Chief Accounting Officer.  Prior to joining VeriSign Robynne was Assistant Corporate Controller at Oracle and she brings a wealth of accounting and financial experience to the company. Brian, Robynne, and I, all share a healthy sense of urgency and we are already seeing signs of how both of these fine folks are having a positive effect on the business.", "And then, finally I am also pleased to announce or to point out that Kathleen Cote was appointed the company\u2019s Board of Directors in February. Kathleen has more than 25 years of experience in Executive Management and leadership positions in both emerging technology companies and multi national organizations, most recently serving as CEO of World Port Communications so welcome aboard, Kath.", "Before beginning let me quickly mention that we expect to file our 10-Q early next week. And as a part of this report, you'll see our revenue segmentation as we have created a new segment for our core businesses of Naming, SSL, and IAS. This new segment is labeled Internet Infrastructure and Identity Services or 3IS for short but we will continue to use the term core businesses interchangeably with 3IS.", "So with that, let's take a look at first quarter.Q1 was a solid quarter driven by our core franchises of Naming and SSL. We reported core revenue of 223 million, which was above the high end of our 215 to 220 million guidance.", "Additionally, the businesses that we intend to best perform better than expected making for solid quarter all around and I would like to thank all of our employees for their focus and their continued commitment to VeriSign. This is the first quarter that we've reported non-GAAP operating margins for our core businesses and we are pleased this operating margin.", "For the first quarter was 30.3% putting us in a good position to achieve our Q4 exit rate target of 35% or higher. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the core businesses was $0.21 opinion ahead of consensus estimates on strong revenue growth and lower than expected operating expenses. We also repurchased over 31 million shares of common stock in the first quarter and since recommencing the share repurchases, we have now reduced the common shares outstanding by more than 28% since June of 2007.", "Moving now to business metrics for the first quarter I would like to talk a bit about our core businesses and I will start with Naming. Our Naming business continues to show strength as the adjusted zone or registered names in dot.com and dot.net totaled 84.4 million names at the end of quarter compared with 84.4 million names last quarter, that\u2019s a sequential increase of 5% and an increase of a 22% year-over-year. This growth is driven by continued global internet adoption. And we processed 7.8 million new domain name registrations for dot.com and dot.net during the quarter.", "The underlying growth drivers are consistent with prior quarters as we saw a solid growth in both US and international regions. And while we continued to see solid growth domestically we also continue to develop our international opportunities, regions that we see as having significant growth potential for both dot.com and dot.net.", "We also saw continued growth from all customer segments including corporate, small business, consumer and online adverting. And this growth reflects unit growth and the entrance of new registrars in key customers and growing international markets. The online adverting activity remains a small but consistent part of our new name sales and overall base.", "The renewal rate for Q4 was slightly affected by private litigation which Verisign is not a party to. Pending the outcome of the litigation the deletion of certain domain names has been prevented. So adjusting for these non-recurring factors the adjusted renewal rate for Q4 was 74% the unadjusted renewal rate was actually 1% higher.", "As a reminder we announced in March that effective October 1st registries fees for dot.com and dot.net names will increase by 7% and 10% respectively to $6.86 and $4.23 per year. Which at these prices we believe continues to be an outstanding value.", "And finally our internet infrastructure continues to operate at ever increasing levels and recently we've seen peak loads of over 50 billion DNS request per day. While the peak load increased dramatically this quarter our systems again demonstrated that Verisign's capability of being able to operate global networks at this scale and reliability remains unparalleled do in large part to our continued investment in infrastructure such as project type. As an example our global network now allows Versign to handle up to 2 trillion that\u2019s a trillion with a T DNS requests per day.", "This quarter we also announced our intention to locate new regional internet resolution site in India in one of the most rapidly growing internet markets in the region with more than 60 million internet users. Additionally we've located new resolution sites in Honk Kong, in Italy and other locations as we continue to build out our constellation system of more than a hundred resolution sites as well as expand the capacity of the existing sites.", "In summary no one else no one has operated a global network of this nature at this volume level with 100% uptime over the last 10 years.", "Moving on to security services we were honored last month as the best security company of the year by SC magazine. The award recognizes Verisign's outstanding achievement security including security services from our second core franchise SSL which now has an installed base of over 1 million certificates. This figure represents a significant increase from the last quarter reflecting continued strong organic growth as well as a refinement to the methodology for calculating the installed base for our stock multiyear certificates which were excluded from the installed base after each certificate pass the one year mark in the past.", "So as a result we refined the installed base in the AUR metrics with historical information for both measures included in the slide presentation that company is webcast. But to summarize the effect of this refinement, the installed base is increased; the AUR has decreased in their zero effect on revenue. The installed base for this quarter increased a $1, 24,000 certificates compared with a revised 987,000 last quarter and a revised 886,000 same quarter last year. We are very pleased as this represents a 4% sequential growth and a 16% year-over-year growth in the base.", "The Q1 revised annualized Average Unit Revenue or AUR for installed base of the VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte branded certificates was $261 this quarter, up from the revised $260 last quarter and the revised 251 same quarter last year.", "We also continue to be pleased with the results of our Extended Valuation or EV certificates as more than 3,000 internet domains have gone green with EV. And the demand for EV is continues to be strong in Q1.", "Now, all our EV product line is still in its early stages we are seeing growing stream of customers including both like HSBC, over 100 US credit unions and through our VeriSign deal with NTT Data another 80 bank in Japan covering with SEV.", "We remain the number one provider of the EV search in the market and we continue to expect that the EV adoption cycle will be consistent with previous premium product, premium price SSL products in the past.", "We continue to see early success as customer research confirms the strong value preposition or EV, as EV business are seeing higher click through rates as their customers recognized the green bar and VeriSign seal, which is now seen over a 150 million times a day. We are also continuing our marketing efforts to stimulate customer pull through. As example, we launched our bio marketing campaign our U2 platform to raise awareness of how the EV search enable secured e-commerce transactions, the card whisper video was broadly due laid into Google machine the VeriSign campaign on there earnings goal.", "Also, our necessary foundation explaining the green bar is having the proper operating system in browser searches Microsoft, Vista and IE7.  Microsoft\u2019s recent comment is data set NASA over 140 million is the licensees, further is our confidence around EV adaption and growth potential.", "Now, I would like to share some comments on the progress of our identity in authentication services business.  Within IAS the strength continues with VIP and a onetime cash work programs, as we now sold over a $1.8 million prudentials, and we continue to be pleased by the strong uptake of credentials by consumers as we expect to see this adoption continue to ramp.", "We believe that IAS has the potential to form the third core franchise for the company over the next few years and help to accelerate consumer adoption we recently announced two programs for parties issuing credentials. The VIP quick start and the VIP test drive for developers. Both programs are key investments and what we believe is a very promising market space which is well and our long-term strategy and matches our core DNA of global scale and trust. So I'd like to comment now on some areas that we believe are of interest to investors based on discussions we've had since our last call. Last quarter, we shared with you our divide and conquer approach to managing our businesses so that the company would continue to remain focussed on continuing to develop and grow our core businesses while at the same time maintaining the continuity and optimizing the eventual sale of the businesses being the best.", "The importance of executing on planned investments in an expedient manner is not lost on us and we continue to diligently pursue the timely sale of these businesses.  However, we periodically remind ourselves that while these events are important, the key to unlocking shareholder value will be driven by what happens in our core businesses more so than the sales proceeds from the non-core businesses.  And we are also mindful that in addition to executing on plan, we must also invest for growth in next generation products and services which fit our G&A around global scale and trust.", "As we've said before, 2008 is going to be an interesting year with a lot of moving parts, we expect that over the course of the year, not only we will complete most of our planned divestures but we will also reduce our indirect overhead counts.  And speaking about divestiture program, overall I\u2019ll describe the program is being essentially on track with our expectations.", "As discussed in the past we expect there will be a half dozen or more transactions over the course of 2008 and to date we\u2019ve closed three smaller transactions including the sale of our former content delivery network, digital brand, management business and the self care and analytics business in three separate transactions.", "The remaining businesses are in varying stages of the sale process with some business being further along and possibly ready for discussion in our next conference call.", "So overall we continue to be satisfied with our product risk and while we are aware of credit market conditions and we are seeing some affect at the margin as a few prospective buyers have dropped out, there continues to be good interest at this time from both strategic and financial buyers. Of course there is always a possibility that credit market conditions and expected valuations could further decline but at this time, we continue to believe that we will substantially complete all transactions this year yielding proceeds of approximately 10% of our market cap give or take a couple of moments.", "We will continue our practice of reporting transactions during these calls if not otherwise required.  And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian for a walkthrough of our financial results for the first quarter as well as guidance.  Brian?", "Brian Robins - Acting Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Bill and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Before turning to the first quarter, I would like to discuss how our reporting of the results will be somewhat challenging this year as we continue to work within accounting standards.  This quarter, we have begun to play some of the businesses we intent to divest into discontinued operations. In order for a business to qualify for discontinued operations, it must first meet several criteria including management having the sufficient authority to sell the business, the businesses available for immediate sale, and an active program to sell the business has been initiated, and its sale is probable within one year.", "Further, we must conclude that there is no significant continuing involvement in the operations of that business once it is sold. Utilizing these standards, we place enterprise security, digital brand management services, and communications consulting, as well as some smaller businesses into discontinued operations this quarter.", "Those businesses not included in discontinued operations in Q1 did not meet all the technical requirements for one reason or another. For example, the messaging business was not included in discontinued operations as we do not have an active program to sell the business as of March 31st.  We expect that messaging will be placed into discontinued operations in Q2 as we begin to actively market this business for sale within the next month.", "We expect that most of the other businesses targeted for disposition, will also be placed into discontinued operations by the end of the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, the reporting of results will be challenging this year as we work through this period of transition. With some businesses not yet qualifying for discontinued operations, continuing operations this quarter reflects the mix of core businesses and non-core businesses. We believe representing key operating results for core businesses provides greater transparency around the financial performance of those businesses, which we believe will drive long-term shareholder value. To this end, we have also included non-GAAP financial information around our core businesses, including operating income and earnings per share in addition to the GAAP results included in our press release.", "Additionally, accounting standards require us to include shared services cost and continuing operations. Unless this cost can be fully and directly associated with the discontinued business, as a result, the performance of core businesses may appear to be less favorable than what we believe it otherwise might be and conversely the financial performance of discontinued operations may appear to be more favorable.  As we complete divestitures, we expect core operating margins will continue to improve as we reduce shared services cost, which are currently included in the core businesses.", "Lastly, we also expect there will be a period of time whereby we provide transition services to the buyers and as we complete these transition services agreement we expect further improvements to the operating margins of our core businesses. Today discussing operating results for our core businesses, we will not be providing comparable figures for prior periods as it is not practical to do so. Next quarter we will begin providing comparative analysis and commentary on a sequential basis.", "In terms of day to day management, Bill shared our divide and conquer approach with you earlier. We remain focused on our core businesses, while at the same time optimizing the sale process of businesses being divested. As the results indicate, the efforts to-date have been largely successful.", "Moving now to a more detailed discussion of results for our core businesses. Q1 by all accounts was a solid quarter. Revenue of our core businesses came in above the high end of our guidance at 223 million, up 5% sequentially and up 23% year-over-year.  The growth was driven again by continued strength of all three core businesses, with Naming are having a good quarter. Additionally, we had one-time benefit to revenue of slightly over $1 million, which we do not expect will reoccur.", "Turning to operating margins. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are seeing operating leverage as reflected in non-GAAP core operating margins, a 30.3% for the quarter. This represents a significant improvement to last year and we are continuing to see the results of our focus and discipline. Non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expenses for the quarter were 155 million, down from last quarter primarily due to lower labor expenses from both our regular and contingent workforces.", "Below the operating income line, we incurred a loss of nearly 4 million as the interest expense related to our convertible bonds was then offset by interest income as it was last quarter.  With significant share repurchases during the quarter, our cash balance is lower and coupled with the decline in interest rates, interest income was significantly lower this quarter. We expect interest income will be lower for the remainder of the year.", "Non-GAAP core net income for the first quarter was 44 million resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21, above our internal plan due to solid revenue results and disciplined expense management. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21 includes the $4 million below the line loss related to interest expense, which negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02.  The diluted share count used in EPS calculations was slightly above 210 million shares, down from nearly 230 million shares last quarter.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Our ability to consistently generate solid operating cash flows resulted in our maintaining a strong balance sheet with ending cash equivalents and restricted cash of over 500 million, down nearly 900 million from last quarter as we repurchased over 1.1 billion of stock or approximately 14% of the shares outstanding at the end of last quarter.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were 26 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong, in excess of $74 million. There were multiple drivers to the positive operating cash flow this quarter including strong deferred revenue growth which was up on strong net registration this quarter as well as disciplined working capital management.", "As a reminder, Q1 is typically a seasonally weak quarter for operating cash flow as annual employee bonuses are paid in the first quarter. Net DSO for the first quarter was down 3 days to 41 days due to more disciplined collection efforts. Overtime, we expected DSOs will continue to decline as both Naming and SSL businesses have very favorable working capital requirements.", "Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $761 million, up 23 million from last quarter end. The increase in deferred revenue was driven by strong sales in Naming and SSL. Naming in articular have the strong quarter as average weekly additions for common net were above our expectations. We ended the quarter with 4050 employees, 200 lower than last quarter, as we began to transform the company with focus on the core and reduce shared services headcount. Headcount will continue to decline through the year with the sale of non-core businesses as well as further reduction in share services headcount.", "Moving now to guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to place most non-core businesses into discontinued operations during Q2. As a result, we are providing guidance for our core businesses which include Naming, SSL and IAS. We include VeriSign Japan in our core numbers given his focus on SSL and IAS services. For Q2, we expect revenue for the core businesses will be in the range of $228 million to $233 million reflecting sequential growth of 3% to 5%.", "As discussed last quarter it is not possible to forecast exactly when divestitures will take place within a year. We also continue to expect a lag effect to operating margin, standing from the inclusion of significant indirect operating expenses. For those reasons, our guidance around non-GAAP operating margins is for modest sequential improvement. As we believe we are on track to achieve Q4 2008 exit operating margins of 35% or higher.", "The non GAAP operating margin guidance is also reflects increase investments we are making in our core businesses such as project Titan and the SSL platform. For example, in SSL we are consolidating GeoTrust, Thawte, and VeriSign platforms into a single system which will help us allow our backend system cost while improving the user interface our ability to up sell the higher price brands.", "We also expect that either slower line will result in a larger loss than what we experience in Q1 for a number of reasons including our expectation that interest income will be lower this year.", "Finally, we now expect that the fully diluted share account will be below 200 million shares well before the year end as was originally expected, reflecting the rest of share repurchase activities today.", "In summary, we are pleased with our business execution in the first quarter particularly as it relates to revenue growth from the core businesses as well as non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We are keenly focused on executing our strategy in 2008 as we clearly see that there is a key to further unlocking shareholder values longer-term. We now like to open the call for your questions. Operator?", "Question-And-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll go first to Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Yeah, thanks. Hi guys.", "Bill Roper", "Hi Sterling.", "Brian Robins", "Hey Sterling.", "Sterling Auty", "So two questions, first, Bill, just picking up on some of the tone around the divestitures, you had talked about I think most of deals will get done by the end of the year and it seems like a little bit of a change, is that just based on the experience so far and giving the books out there and just execution as well as the talk of 10% couple of points in terms of proceeds versus 10% of market capital that just gives the stock price is higher?", "Bill Roper", "Okay, two questions there Sterling. I think we are essentially on track, we\u2019re seeing good interest, at the margin there is may be of few people who might out stay tune to the final round that are dropping out due to financing or something, while we\u2019ve got strategic and financial players at the table and at this stages we still feel pretty good, I think all along we said we would like to get them all completed this year, this calendar and I think we will do that or come close to it, and we think the procedure will be essentially what we would have expected maybe off a kicker too, the market cap with the company is a little higher, but I think we are in the same neighborhood.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. And one followup question on the naming business, we have all that the noise of our testing and ICAAN as well as the economy. Can you just kind of give some color as to how you feel about the results of the naming business, and more importantly, how you think the trajectory of that business will look for the remainder of the year?", "Brian Robins", "Okay, fair Sterling. We had a 5% sequential and a 23% year-over-year in naming, we\u2019re very pleased with that 4 million net ads for the quarter. The business is on the same trajectory essentially, we believe where it\u2019s been in the last few quarters, we feel good about it, we got a price increase coming up. There are issues with testing in online adverting and so forth, but there will be in work to the system and we\u2019ve analyzed the various scenarios and how they might impact us and we feel great about the business.", "Ken Bond", "Sterling its Ken, I will just add a comment in that, last quarter I think that people were looking at some of those number and it gave a little bit of pause and hopefully folks were picked up here that in this quarter we really want to underscore that naming had a very strong quarter, and then what we saw in Q4 was really as we can now talk a little bit about was a function this ligation and again it was not involving various line but a couple of other party. The naming business had a very strong quarter and we are very pleased to see, we think the trajectory is back on path.", "Brian Robins", "Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank. We will go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow", "Hi, guys. Just wanted to get some highlights from you, this is for as how you expect the operating margins in future and over the next couple of quarters ahead, obviously, you talked about exiting at least 35% just kind of in order to get feel for us some of these divestitures are made and there is expenses do you start to role off those continuing upside, do you expect to see a trend Q2, Q3 and then also just on the naming directory side, on the dominion front just curious what you would expect the naming growth look like for Q2 and also just for the full year?", "Brian Robins", "Okay Phil, this is Brian, I will take the first part of the question, Bill will take the second part of the question. You know, as we reported we had operating margin of 30.3% for the first quarter and we expect to see modest sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter with an exit run rate of 35% or higher.", "Bill Roper", "And then Phil on the naming business as I said before it was solid first quarter, we don\u2019t really see any change in the trend lines there, we\u2019re happy with the weak links which we monitor very carefully, and we think we\u2019re going to have a good year and we\u2019re short on that same growth sector of 20% 22, 23% that we\u2019ve been for sometime.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "", "Todd Raker", "", "Hi, guys. Nice quarter", "Brian Robins", "Thanks Todd ", "Bill Roper", "Thanks.", "Todd Raker", "Just wan to dig into there performance a little bit, first of all on the growth margins 76.7% growth margin ISG historically would run at around 82% if I remember correctly and clearly there are some share to overhead from this continued in that, as we think about that business longer term that where you kind of surviving businesses, should we be thinking about the gross margins trend in north of the 82% from ISG. And then, I have two follow-ups?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian, the gross margin is roughly 82% that you have referenced and was non allocated, and so the gross margin of approximately 77% as a fully allocated gross margin on the core business.", "Todd Raker", "Yes, but I expect some of that cost to come out even with the allocation is discontinued, some of other after sales on it. Is that a fair stable and is this 77% level kind of the baseline issue we see a growth from here on out?", "Brian Robins", "It is, as mentioned earlier we do have shared services and the number that get allocated to the core and as we sell the businesses we will manage the shared services out, and you will see 77 of the base moving up.", "Todd Raker", "Okay. And then, on the operating expense line items if I kind of look through sales and marketing R&D and G&A, one anomaly clearly SG&A running about 19%, is there any region as we look at that overtime that we shouldn\u2019t see this comedown to a more normalize run rate around 10% of the business going forward? ", "Brian Robins", "It will be more normalized, the reason why I have seen the business later is because you do have the shared services cost in there today that are supported to discontinue businesses as well.", "Todd Raker", "Okay. Thanks. And then, the last question for you, aggressive on the stock buyback I love to see that Bill, can you just comment in terms of capital structure of the company and your cash balance is now 500 million.  At what level do you continue to buy stock to and would you use debt going forward in addition to the convert that you have outstanding?", "Bill Roper", "Okay.  We, I think we -- the answer to that is really consistent with the past.  We are going to repurchase shares when it is advantageous to do so and we don\u2019t have better internal investment opportunities.  We are \u2013 we got a strong balance sheet.  We have got debt capacity, so we will use it as necessary.  I think we ended the quarter with 500 million in the bank and we generated cash regularly, so we got a healthy balance sheet, we are generating cash, we are looking for good internal risk adjusted returns on internal investments and otherwise and we will repurchase shares when it\u2019s advantageous to do so.", "Todd Raker", "Okay.  Thanks guys.", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Todd.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Fred", "Hi, guys.  This is Fred Grive (Ph) for Sarah Friar.  The annualized ASP has been slowly creeping up over the past year or so in the search business, is the main driver of that EV or is it sort of something else?", "Bill Roper", "It\u2019s a mix.  There is a mix shift between the three product lines.  There is a small but growing component of EV, but frankly at this stage it doesn\u2019t really by itself move the needle even though it has a very nice premium price to it, it\u2019s not really yet to the size that it moves the needle a lot.  But it relates to just mix shift, the GeoTrust is growing faster than the other two, but they're all growing.", "Brian Robins", "Yeah, I\u2019d only add to that Fred is that individually within those brands we\u2019ve seen generally pricing trends at the ASPs in those individual brands has been increasing over time.", "Fred", "Great, thanks.  And one follow-up.  Sort of any update on growing out additional services around the registry business?", "Bill Roper", "We have \u2013 this is Bill.  We have a number of products in the pipeline.  We are always upgrading, we are always making improvement to the products and we have several things that we will rollout over the years, but you should do these over the months or quarters, you should do these as small incremental things.  We are not ready to talk about any blockbusters or anything at this stage.", "Brian Robins", "No, I\u2019d add one Fred.  Just as an example, we\u2019ve got a service that we now use that\u2019s called data analyzer and it\u2019s the service that really is not a fee service, but it\u2019s something that we use with our registrar to help them evaluate potential domain name so that around the grace period you don\u2019t have an opportunity to evaluate the quality of names directly without having to use the grace period and that\u2019s the service that we\u2019ve been using with some of our registrars and we make freely available to them as a value added service.", "Fred", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Walter Pritchard with Cowen & Company.", "Bill Roper", "Walter, are you there?", "Operator", "Looks like Walter\u2019s phone just disconnected.  We will go on to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Robert Owens", "Yes, thanks.  Question around the EV search, and as you look at it on a per customer basis, can you talk a little bit any metrics around the uplift you might be seeing in total transaction value, is that purely a function of price you are accessing more units per customers as well.", "Ken Bond", "Hey, Roberts, Ken, as you know the list price on the ED search is quite a bit higher.  On a per unit basis, we generally are seeing premiums of at least 30% if not higher in terms of the unit price that we are garnering from ED versus the normal FCC search, but on the second half of that question in terms of the actual unit volume, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix there, and we are not seeing a decline.  But, what I think you are alluding to is something that we are watching carefully, and that is the potential for customers to be using EB certificates not around the back of other shops, but our normal payment gateways and that type of things, but the on front end, when we go the places like www.swap.com, or www.paypal.com.   We are definitely seeing some of that, but nothing overly material at this point.", "Robert Owens", "Great, and then, on the registry, with you guys having formerly inserts in the quarter, I think last year Q1 kind of represented the largest net sequential increase of new domains, sorry for inserts.  Do you think this year will follow the same seasonality where Q1 the $4 million in sequential net new domains will be the peak for the year or should we see different cycles buy out. ", "Bill Roper", "I don\u2019t know that we have a huge amount of seasonality in this business, this is Bill, and there is a lot of factors, and sometimes they relate to a little noise around the edges with the pay per click business, but I don\u2019t think we have a lot of seasonality in this business.", "Robert Owens", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "And then we will turn to Walter Pritchard with Cowen And Company.", "Ken Wong", "Hi guys, this is Ken Wong for Walter Pritchard.", "Bill Roper", "Hi, Ken, how are you?", "Ken Wong", "Good good, so you guys mentioned there was 7.8 new domains registered, did you guys give the number of renewals?", "Bill Roper", "It was slightly over 12 million, Ken.", "Ken Wong", "Okay, great, and then with the new structure of the business though, where do you guys see CapEx going?", "Brian Robins", "CapEx is, this is Brian, CapEx historically has ran between 12 to 14% and that\u2019s going to trend down.  We have some investment that we are making right now, Project Tighten and ED search, but you can expect that to trend down over time.  ", "Bill Roper", "For the core business, it was $17 million this quarter.", "Ken Wong", "Okay, great, that\u2019s -- those are all my questions, guys.", "Bill Roper", "Thanks, Ken.", "Operator", "And, we will take our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven Ashley", "I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the international business might have represented in the core business, and then secondly, if you could talk about general business trends, the pace of growth of domain names in the United States versus may be outside the United States, thanks.", "Brian Robins", "Okay, this is a difficult question to answer because we don\u2019t really have valid data, but we can give you trends.  The way we measure things, the international business is about 23 percent of the core.  But, for instance, in the naming business it really relates to where the registrar is.  That's how it's tagged, not necessarily where the customer is.  In the SSL business, it relates to the billing address of the enterprise and of course the servers, the server sit on could be anywhere around the globe.  So, actually, how you measure it to how you define it, you get different numbers.  Both segments, both domestic and international are growing, growing nicely.  International is growing a little faster than domestic, so you will see a slow mix shift over time there.  We are investing this year through the P&L fairly significantly, and building our international sales and marketing efforts, and those sort of things, and that's with an eye towards the fact that the non-North American markets are under-penetrated vis-a-vis the North American markets.", "Steven Ashley", "Great.  And Brian, you talked about the interest income and the fact that that could cascade a little lower here.  Could you provide us any guidance or color around what we should think about other net for the second quarter?  The loss was 1.8 million this period, what might we look for and what should we think about modeling the second quarter?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah, for the following quarters, especially for the second quarter, I would go about two acts around eightish.", "Bill Roper", "Okay, great.", "Company Representative", "He also asked about the ..", "Brian Robins", "Yeah, that's for other income and interest expense, that\u2019s the whole everything.", "Steven Ashley", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).  We\u2019ll go next to Katherine Egbert with Jeffries.", "Katherine Egbert", "Hi, good afternoon.  You said that there was a drop in overhead costs so far that weren\u2019t just related to the divestitures.  Can you tell us what that was and how you expect the organic cost structure to kind of flow through the rest of the year?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah, this is Brian, our \u2013 the overhead cost I referred to is in first quarter we actually, as the business continues to transform, we\u2019ve readjusted our cost structure and headcount.  So, we had lower headcount for the quarter, about 200 lower than the previous quarter.  Additionally, our contingent work force as we focus and be disciplined, our expense management has been reduced.", "Katherine Egbert", "Okay, can you put any numbers behind that?  I mean of the bulk ops in operating margin for the quarter, what percentage was related to that headcount reduction?", "Brain Robins", "I don\u2019t have the specific numbers.", "Katherine Egbert", "Okay, thanks and then --.", "Brian Robins", "Probably around 200 people.", "Katherine Egbert", "Okay, can we revisit some longer term guidance that you\u2019ve given out before you know for example like a 40 percent plus operating margin in the out years, is that still valid?", "Ken Bond", "Katherine, it\u2019s Ken.  Let me just clarify that the \u2013 at Analyst Day, we talked about 2008 guidance of out margins of 30 percent with a long term number of 35 percent.  And then in the last conference call, we upped the 2008 target from 30 to 35 percent.  We never did come back and make any formal changes on that 35 percent.  So, I can understand where this natural assumption that 35 would go to 40, but we have never formally said that.  Our long-term guidance is that, it\u2019s obviously going to be higher than 35 percent, but we haven\u2019t formalized it.", "Katherine Egbert", "Okay, not bad.  Thanks, Ken.", "Ken Bond", "Okay.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Rod Brettler with Sanford Group.", "Rod Brettler", "", "Thank you very much, nice quarter guys.", "Bill Roper", "", "Thank you.", "Rod Brettler", "Would you, most everything has been asked and answered, and I have only got one pair of eyes here, so it may have been in the prepared remarks, but did you say anything about the target revenue range for the core business for the end of the year?  If you did, I missed it, and I apologize.", "Brian Robins", "For next quarter it will 228 to 233 million and we expected to end the year at 900 million plus.", "Bill Roper", "With an underscore, Rod, on that plus part", "Rod Brettler", "", "Okay, thanks a lot for the clarification, again, I appreciate it.  That\u2019s all I have got, thanks.", "Brian Roper", "Okay thanks.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan Securities.", "Scott Sutherland", "Great, thank you.  A couple of questions, guys. First, I want to talk about your IAS.  I know this is an emerging market segment, you have good hopes for. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what the revenue ramp you are seeing there may be the margin structure and breakeven levels you could target there?", "Bill Roper", "This is Bill. There is really two parts to that business.  There is the existing PKI business.  It\u2019s a very sound, very stable business, generates good margins, good cash flow, and it\u2019s growing relatively slowly.  And then we have the new business that we are ramping up, the VIP business, that\u2019s ramping fairly quickly year-over-year, but that\u2019s on a fairly small base.  So -- but we are very pleased with the growth.  We are very pleased with the enterprise adoption and the customer take up rate.  So, we have got good, you know, we are getting good numbers out of there.  The growth is actually a little ahead of track for the year.  We are real pleased with this, but it\u2019s pretty small base.", "Scott Sutherland", "", "Okay, and on the navy side of business, it sounds like you have some other top level domains to bid on.  What\u2019s your activity there and what is your kind of belief of winning some of that?", "Bill Roper", "", "Well, we don\u2019t forecast what we might do in that area for obvious competitive reasons, but we intend to build and protect our core business and do whatever it takes.", "Operator", "And we will return to Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Yeah can you hear me?", "Company Rep", "No.", "Sterling Auty", "", "Two follow-ups, you talked about the advertising being staked.  Can you just give us an update in terms of what was advertising as percent of \u2013 may be as the new names or may be as the percent of the base at the end of the quarter?", "Company Rep", "Sterling, so you are talking about -- there is a quarterly activity.  So, as the percentage of the new registrations, it was a little bit lower in term of new registrations.  But, as it relates to the install base, it continues to be a very consistent part of our base, and that\u2019s about 8 to 10% of our install base is represented by online advertising.", "Sterling Auty", "And the other question is for Brian, I thought -- I caught part of what you were saying in terms I thought you mentioned one million of kind of one time type of revenue, was that in the core or the areas the discontinued operation?", "Brian Robins", "", "That was in core.", "Sterling Auty", "And what was that related to?", "Brian Robins", "It was revenue based on cash collection.", "Sterling Auty", "", "Okay.  Can you clarify that a little bit, I am not sure I understand that?", "Brian Robins", "There is one time services that were performed in prior periods that we didn\u2019t collect on where we were able to collect on that revenue in that quarter.", "Sterling Auty", "Got it.  All right.  Thanks, guys", "Brian Robins", "Thanks Sterling.", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction].  And we will return to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank..", "Todd Raker", "Hi, guys.  Just following-up, if I look at the deferred revenue line, do you expect that to be impacted at all as you divest some of these businesses going forward, or should we think about 100% in deferred revenue being associated with the three surviving businesses?", "Ken Bond", "", "It\u2019s \u2013 Todd, it\u2019s Ken, the deferred revenue is largely associated with the core businesses, but not a 100%.  If you were to look at the deferred revenue on a year-over-year basis, you can se it\u2019s pretty modest increase.  It\u2019s not going to be that much.  And it is important to keep in mind, we\u2019ve got a little bit of apples and oranges here where the prior periods was for all the operations and what you are seeing on the balance sheet now is the continuing operations and the discontinued operations piece has been stripped out.  So, it makes the year-over-year comps a little awkward.", "Todd Raker", "Could you guys give us kind of the normalized figure for this quarter?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Yeah, there was \u2013 there is a little less than $20 million in discontinued operations in deferred revenue, the balance of it would go to the core business.", "Todd Raker", "", "Okay.  So, sequentially, you should think about \u2013 what you reported is the right base line going forward?", "Brian Robins", "That\u2019s correct.", "Todd Raker", "Okay thanks guys.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow", "", "Hi, guys, just wanted to follow-up on the SSL Security platform.  I was wondering if you could give us what the base was in Q2 and Q3, but also the ASPs like in \u201907, if these numbers have changed, and also does that change at all the number of \u2013 the number you were giving out historically for the new and renewed search during the quarters?", "Bill Roper", "Well, while Brain is looking for that, there are \u2013 there is a graph in the presentation slides that will show you that.", "Phil Winslow", "I was just looking for the hard numbers.", "Bill Roper", "For the install base, what are you looking for, Q2 \u201907 and Q2 \u201901?", "", "Phil Winslow", "Q2 \u201907 and Q3 \u201907, you gave us Q4 and Q1.", "Bill Roper", "Sure, yeah, Q2 \u201907 was 923,000 and then Q3 \u201907 was 957,000.", "Phil Winslow", "And what were the ASPs?", "Bill Roper", "ASPs on that in Q2 \u201907 was $256 and in Q3 \u201907 was $258.", "Phil Winslow", "Great, thanks, guys.", "Brian Robins", "There is a little seasonality in the ASP of that because of the heavy commercial large enterprise purchases in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "And that does conclude our question-and-answer session.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to you, Mr. Bond, for any additional or closing remarks.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, Jamie, we anticipate that our next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our second quarter 2008 results, will be held on Wednesday, August 6, at 2 pm Pacific time, 5 pm Eastern time. Final confirmation of this date will be provided the first business day after the close of the quarter on July 1. I would also like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD VeriSign plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions on this call.  Thank you for your participation and your continued support. This concludes our call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Ken Bond - Vice President of Investor Relations", "Thank you Robby.  Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for VeriSign\u2019s second quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  I am Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and Interim President and CEO of VeriSign and Brian Robins, our acting Chief Financial Officer.", "A replay of this call will be available beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time via telephone at 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 for international callers and will be available through August 12.  The pass code for both numbers is 9794237.

For those of you joining us via webcast, we also invite you to view the slide presentation, which accompanies today\u2019s conference call.  These same slides will be available for download from our website after the call.", "Financial results in today\u2019s press release are unaudited and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, financial results in today\u2019s press release and matters we will be discussing today include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign.  Our non-GAAP income statement and a description of items excluded in our non-GAAP financial information is located on the VeriSign Investor Relations website.  Also let me quickly mention that we expect to file our 10-Q no later than next Monday.", "As an early reminder, our Analyst Day originally scheduled for September has been moved to November 12 in New York City at the Western Hotel near Times Square.", "In a moment, Jim and Brian will provide some prepared remarks and afterwards, we will open up the call to your questions.  Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.  We anticipate the call will end before 3 PM Pacific Time.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Bidzos - Executive Chairman, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Ken.  In this call, I would like to start with comments on key announcements we made during the quarter, followed by a review of our business and operating results for Q2.  From there, I would like to touch on some areas that we believe are of particular interest to investors based on conversations we\u2019ve had with shareholders including how we are managing the business overall and an update on our divestiture activities.", "Brian will then discuss the financial results for the second quarter and provide limited guidance before we move to the Q&A portion of the call.  As we announced in early July, we made a management change and I assumed the role of President and CEO on an interim basis in addition to being named Executive Chairman.", "Subsequent to that announcement, we spoke with a number of shareholders and analysts, and I would like to share with you some insights from those discussions.  Most important is that our strategy has not changed.  We remain focused on protecting and growing our core businesses, executing on the sale of non-core businesses, and rightsizing our business once the divestitures are complete.", "As we look to grow the core, we will continue to invest in those opportunities where we expect to see solid returns on a risk adjusted basis.  Let\u2019s be clear that these modest investments do not signal the return of an M&A growth-oriented strategy, nor do they signal any significant change to the improvements in operating margin that we expect to see.", "We\u2019ve also made very good strides in addressing our capital structure but we are not done and we believe the capital structure changes will remain an area where we can further unlock shareholder value.", "Q2 was a solid quarter driven primarily by our core franchises of Naming and SSL.  We reported core revenue of 233 million, which was at the high-end of our 228 to 233 million guidance.", "Additionally, businesses we intend to divest performed better than expected again making for a solid quarter all around and I would like to thank all of our employees for their focus and continued commitment to VeriSign.", "The non-GAAP operating margin for our core businesses during the second quarter was 34.2%.  We are pleased with this result as it puts us in a very good position to achieve our Q4 exit rate target of 35% or higher.  Non-GAAP earnings per share for the core businesses was $0.25, $0.02 ahead of consensus estimates due to strong revenue growth and lower than expected operating expenses.", "As announced in February, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $600 million of shares.  The ASR agreement was completed in July when we received an additional 1.4 million shares over and above the 15.1 million shares we received in Q1.", "Also in July, following completion of the ASR, we repurchased 3.5 million shares.  These shares as well as the incremental 1.4 million shares received as part of the ASR completion will be reflected in the Q3 share count which Brian will discuss later.", "This week, the Board of Directors approved an increase to the total amount authorized for share repurchases.  As of this week, we now have $1 billion authorized and available for share repurchases.  Since recommencing share repurchases last year, we\u2019ve reduced the common shares outstanding by more than 28% over the last four quarters.", "Moving now to business metrics for the second quarter, I would like to talk a bit about our core businesses starting with Naming.  Our Naming business continues to show good growth as the adjusted zone for registered names in dot-com and dot-net totaled 87.3 million names at the end of the quarter compared with 84.4 million names last quarter, a sequential increase of 3% and an increase of 20% year-over-year.", "Historically, the second quarter is seasonally weaker for adjusted zone growth and the net increase of 2.9 million names this quarter reflects that normal seasonality for traditional naming customers.  As discussed in the past, our Naming business includes domains registered by registrars who operate in many industry segments.  Traditional names represent 91% of the adjusted zone, while names registered for the purpose of online advertising represents 9%.", "This quarter\u2019s net increase reflects some weakness among a few online advertising customers largely resulting from changes in Google Smart pricing program with Adsense, especially with regard to less valued Adsense words.  Additionally, industry litigation around the use of certain domains in online advertising discussed in Q4 is affecting the space as well.", "A percentage of new name registrations represented by online advertising was 8.5% this quarter, down from a historical high of 12% in Q2 of last year.  We believe that the new policy implemented by ICANN in July with regard to the five day grace period will cost some lower valued names to not be registered.  However, a healthy portion of online advertising Naming customers are not solely reliant on the five-day grace period.  ", "Registrars with bifurcated models using their own tools or the daily analyzer tool we make available to all registrars continue to have active and healthy portfolios.  Over the remainder of this year, we are internally forecasting a slowing of growth related to names registered and renewed for the purpose of online advertising.  However we are also forecasting increased traditional name growth from international markets, especially those markets we\u2019ve targeted with distributor and end-user domain campaign.  To be clear the challenges being discussed today have been limited to our online advertising business.", "In total, we processed 7.5 million new domain name registrations during the quarter compared with 7.1 million names last year.  The underlying growth drivers are consistent with prior quarters as we saw a solid growth in both US and international regions.  While we continue to see solid growth domestically, we also continue to develop our international opportunities, regions that we see as showing significant growth potential for both dot.com and dot.net overtime.", "We also saw continued growth from most customer segments including traditional corporate, SMB and consumer.  This growth reflects unit growth and the entrance of new registrars in key customer segments and growing international markets.", "The renewal rate for Q1 was 74% consistent with Q4.  Renewal rates are not determinable until 45 days after the end of the quarter.  As a result, we report renewal rates on a one quarter lag.  As a reminder, we announced in March that effective October 1st, registry fees for dot-com and dot-net names will increase by 7% and 10% respectively to $6.86 and $4.23 per year, which at these prices we believe continues to be an outstanding value.", "Finally, our internet infrastructure continues to operate at ever increasing levels and recently we saw peak loads of over 48 billion DNS requests per day as our systems again demonstrated VeriSign\u2019s capability of being able to operate global networks at this scale and reliability remains unparalleled due in large part to our continued investment in infrastructure such as project Titan.  And my thanks to all the employees who work in our tech operations\u2019 facilities that keep uptime record for us.", "In summary, no one else, no one has operated a global network infrastructure of this nature, at this volume level or with 100% uptime over the last 10 years, even as we remain the most attacked global network on the planet", "Moving to our security services, our second core franchise, SSL saw the install base for the quarter increase to 1,056,000 certificates compared with 1,024,000 last quarter and 923,000 in the same quarter last year.  We are very pleased as this growth represents 3% sequential growth and 14% year-over-year growth in the base.  The Q2 annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the install base of VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte branded certificates was $258 this quarter, down from $261 last quarter and up from $256 the same quarter last year.", "The sequential decline in AUR was the result of continued shifts in product mix as GeoTrust continues to grow faster than the overall portfolio.  Looking forward, order shifts and product mix coupled with international expansion could result in further AUR decline; however continued strong growth in the number of certificates leave our revenue expectations for low double-digit growth intact.", "While still a small portion of our SSL business, we continue to be pleased with the results of our extended validation or EV certificates, as nearly 6000 internet domains have gone green with EV.  Q2 demand for EV certificates continued to be strong as we more than doubled the units sold a year ago.  We are seeing a growing stream of customers including Banc of America, Aetna, Buy.com, General Electric, Money Bank and JP Morgan Chase amongst others go green with EV.", "A necessary foundation to displaying the green bar and ramping our EV business, our EV-capable browser, such as Microsoft, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3, and Opera 9.5.  Currently, EV-capable browsers represent just over 50% of the market and as this continues to grow, this should only help further the growth of EV certificates.  We also continue to work with customers to document the benefits they are seeing with EV certificates including higher click-through rates and lower abandonment rates has got customers recognize the green bar and the VeriSign seal which is now seen approximately 150 million times a day.", "In summary, we are pleased with progress in this business as we remain the #1 provider of EV certificates with market share of 75% and growing as measured by a third party research firm.", "Coming into 2008, we set aggressive goals for our EV Certificate orders and while we are pleased with all the positive signs, this quarter we started seeing some effects of the economic slowdown.  EV adoption within large scale customers was less than what we had hoped for and we could see the order acceleration we expected for later this year being pushed out.", "Now I would like to share some comments on the progress of our identify and authentication services business.  Within IAS, the strength continues with VIP and one-time password programs as we have now distributed more than 1.9 million credentials and we continue to be pleased with the strong uptake of credentials by consumers and we expect to see this adoption continue to ramp.  We believe that IAS has the potential to form a third core franchise for the company over the next few years.", "This quarter we also announced that VeriSign was selected by Microsoft as an OpenID provider for users of HealthVault(NYSE:TM), a free service that enables consumers to store and manage their health information online.  In working with Microsoft on HealthVault(TM), we are able to combine the convenience of OpenID single sign-on with second factor authentication under the VeriSin VIP program.", "I would now like to comment on some areas that we believe are of interest to investors based on discussions we\u2019ve had over the last month since the management change.  After announcing our strategy to focus on core businesses, we organized our management team using a divided focus approach and have been pleased that as a company we remain focused on continuing to protect and grow our core businesses.", "We have also been able to maintain operating continuity for those businesses being divested which again performed above plan.  In addition to managing the businesses day-to-day and executing on plan, we are also investing for growth in next generation products and services which fit our D&A ground global scale and trust.  These investments are what I would describe as marginal with little to no effect on our operating margin expectations for continued improvement.", "Moving now to an update on our divestiture efforts, this is the primary area where we are feeling the effects of the economic downturn, as it has become clear over the last few weeks that the sale process will take longer and be more complicated than we originally anticipated.", "We\u2019ve expected and have seen a normal removal of potential buyers as we work our way through the sales process, but a longer timeframe for completing the divestitures is reflective of the broader economic environment.  As market conditions have worsened, buyers are taking more conservative postures, making it difficult to bring deals to closure, and it has become apparent that the approaches to deals we believe would work at the beginning of the sales process will not work today.", "As recently as late July, we were in very advanced discussions with potential buyers for two of our largest businesses, but these discussions have now been suspended.  As an example, one of the divestitures we expected to announce during Q2 was delayed by a very late-stage requirement calling for audited carve-out financial statements, even though the potential buyer had initially agreed no audit would be required.  In addition, we could not reach an agreement regarding certain key closing conditions.  As another example, the other divestiture stalled because the potential buyer decided the environment and timing are not right for them.", "As a result, we\u2019re adapting to the weaker economic environment and we\u2019ve already begun the process of ensuring that we have audited carve-out financial statements for each of the larger divest business units.  We have already completed the audit process for one of these businesses and are aggressively working to complete the process for the other two businesses as soon as practical.", "While recent events would suggest it will now take longer than our original expectation to complete the divestiture plan, our commitment to sell these and other non-core businesses has not changed.  And as recently as this week, the Board reaffirmed its commitment to the divestiture strategy.  We fully expect that these businesses will be sold.", "As Brian will discuss later, our disciplined management of non-core businesses again led to better than expected operating performance.  The importance of executing on planned divestments in an expedient manner remains a top priority.  But we remind ourselves that while these events are important, the key to unlocking shareholder value will be driven by what happens in our core businesses, more so than the timing or sales proceeds of non-core businesses.", "As we\u2019ve said before, 2008 is going to be a very interesting year with a lot of moving parts, but the end result that VeriSign will be smaller and a much better positioned company for the future is unchanged.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Brian for a walkthrough of our financial results for the second quarter as well as guidance.  Brian?", "Brian Robins - Acting Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon.  Before looking at the second quarter, let me mention that we expect to file our 10-Q no later than next Monday.  Also, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the financial reporting of the businesses we intend to divest and their placement into discontinued operations.", "As we have said previously, in order for a business to qualify for discontinued operations, it must first meet several criteria, including management having the sufficient authority to sell the business, the business being available for immediate sale, an active program to sell the business having been fully initiated, and its sale being probable within one year.  Further, we must conclude there is no significant continuing evolvement in the operations of the business once it is sold.", "This quarter, we placed the Communications Services business into discontinued operations.  Of the businesses being divested, Communications is the largest and most valuable.  Discontinued Operations now includes two of the three largest businesses, Communications and Enterprise Security.  The other two businesses currently included in discontinued operations are Communications Consulting and International Clearing.", "The Digital Brand Management Services and Content Delivery Network Services were sold during the second quarter.  The historical results of DBMS are reported in discontinued operations.  However, because of our equity ownership in Kontiki, the results of this business will remain in continuing operations.", "The businesses not yet qualified for discontinued operations are messaging, prepaid billing, real-time publishing and postpaid billing.  Let me briefly talk about each of these now.", "Messaging is the third of the three large businesses we are divesting.  We began marketing efforts in late May with feedback in early July, showing interest in both parts and the whole of the messaging business.  Based on the sales process and the accounting standards, we intend to place messaging into discontinued operations in the third quarter.", "During the second quarter, we settled litigation matters relating to our prepaid business have decided the best course of actions to wind down that business.  We\u2019ve already notified our customers as well as effective employees and the business will remain in continuing operations until it\u2019s completely shut down sometime during the first half of 2009.", "We expect to begin marketing the real-time publishing business this quarter and we continue to evaluate strategic alternatives for the postpaid billing business.  While we are hopeful that we will substantially complete the largest transactions this year, our recent experiences including the macroeconomic environment lead us to believe that some of the divestitures will close in 2009, as Jim alluded to earlier.", "Lastly, despite the macroeconomic challenges, we are pleased by the operational progress we have made with the variables we can control as we execute on our strategy and move toward our in-state organization.", "As discussed in our last earnings call, and as Jim mentioned earlier, we have adopted a divide-and-focus approach to run the business.  We continue to see the benefits of running core and non-core business as standalone operations, and this focus is reflected in our current financial results.", "We have taken a number of steps in the first half of 2008 to drive focus, transparency of results, and ownership in the non-core businesses.  For each business, we have monthly operating review meetings, cross-functional integrated capital meetings, have substantially completed the in-state org design and have lowered the number of overall people by having dedicated product teams.  We\u2019re very happy with our progress to-date.", "Moving now to a more detailed discussion of results for our core business, Q2 was another solid quarter.  Revenue of our core business came in at the high-end of our guidance at 233 million, up 4% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year.  The growth was driven again by the continued strength of our core businesses.", "Turning to operating margins, as we continue to execute our strategy, we are seeing operating leverage is reflected in non-GAAP core operating margins of 34.2% for the quarter.  This represents the significant incremental improvement of nearly 400 basis points.  These results reflect focused and disciplined expense management around labor and corporate overhead, and they also reflect approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to the deferral of depreciation as our Delaware data center is coming on line in Q3.", "Non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expense for the core business were 153 million, down 2 million from last quarter, primarily due to lower labor expenses from both regular and contingent workforces.", "Below the operating income line, we incurred a non-GAAP loss of approximately 7 million as the interest expense related to our convertible bonds more than offset the interest income.", "We continue to expect that other income will be negative over the remainder of this year due to lower interest income.  We continue to carry less cash in our balance sheet as we have aggressively repurchased shares over the last year.", "Non-GAAP core net income for the second quarter was 50 million, an increase of 14% over the prior quarter resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25, $0.02 above our internal plan due to solid revenue results and disciplined expense management.  The diluted share count used in EPS calculations was 203 million shares, down from approximately 210 million shares last quarter.", "Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet items.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was strong, $169 million.  There were multiple drivers for the strong operating cash flow this quarter, including continued strength in the core business.", "Our primary businesses of Naming and SSL have very favorable characteristics of receiving cash payments well before revenue has been fully recognized.  Over time, we expect we will increase our comments around cash flow measures in discussing our financial performance in addition to the current financial measures.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were 34 million.  Last month, we brought on line a new data center in Delaware.  This data center is a state-of-the-art and now provides the company with two fully hardened data centers with geographic diversity, while still maintaining real-time data replication between the two facilities.", "Our ability to consistently generate solid operating cash flows resulted in our maintaining a strong balance sheet with ending cash, equivalents and restricted cash of over $669 million, up nearly $137 million from last quarter.  In addition to the strong operating cash flow mentioned earlier, we also received nearly 50 million in sales proceeds from the sale of real estate.  Lastly on cash, we paid off the $140 million balance on the line of credit this quarter.", "Net DSO for the second quarter was 41 days, consistent with last quarter.  Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $780 million, up 19 million or 3% from last quarter.  The growth in deferred revenue stemming from core services continued to be strong as we saw year-over-year growth of 17%.", "We ended the quarter with approximately [1,300] employees, down 250 from last quarter largely due to completed divestitures and planned head count reductions.  Head count will continue to decline through the second half of the year with the sales of non-core businesses and further reductions in shared services head count.", "Moving now to guidance.  This quarter we will again provide guidance for our core businesses, which are Naming, SSL and IAS.  We also include VeriSign Japan in our core numbers given its focus on SSL and IAS services.", "For Q3, we expect revenue for the core businesses will be in the range of 236 to $241 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16 to 19%, leaving us in a very good position to meet our annual guidance calling for full year growth of 18 to 20%.", "We expect the Q3 non-GAAP operating margin will be similar to this quarter\u2019s 34.2%, give or take a percent.  Offsetting the expected continuing improvements in operating margin is the inclusion of depreciation expense not incurred last quarter.  Likewise, lease expenses associated with real estate previously owned will impact operating margins.", "Looking forward, even with likely delays in some of the divestitures, we continue to expect that we will exit 2008 with non-GAAP operating margins of 35% or higher as operating margins will benefit from the actions we have taken in our divide-and-focus approach.  We also expect to aggregate of items below the operating income line will be similar to this quarter\u2019s results due to continued expectations that interest income will be lower this year on both lower cash balances and interest rates.", "Finally, before considering the effect of our convertible debt offering, we now expect that the fully diluted share count will be approximately 198 million shares.  The convert could add another 3 to 5 million shares.", "In summary, we are very pleased with our business execution in the second quarter, particularly as it relates to revenue growth from the core businesses as well as non-GAAP operating margin expansion.  We remain focused on executing our strategy as we clearly see this as a key to further unlocking shareholder value longer term.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions.  Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.  [Operator Instructions].  And we\u2019ll go first to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Yeah, thanks.  Hi, guys.  So, on the divestiture timing, I just wanted to be clear, do you expect to get any of the big three divestitures done in \u201908 or do you think maybe you are going to have to break up the big three into smaller pieces?", "Jim Bidzos", "We would like to \u2013 of the large divestitures we hope that we get some completed this year.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay.  And then, as you look at on all three of the big divestitures, are there still strategic buyers that are interested or are you at a point where it\u2019s mainly just financial buyers?", "Jim Bidzos", "No, there are still strategic buyers at the table, and in the case of one of the large businesses, we have completed financials and we have a strategic buyer that we are in discussion with.  So there is \u2013 it is certainly possible that we could still achieve some of the goals we have set for ourselves in \u201908, but we are prepared for it to take longer.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay.  And then last question, you mentioned kind of what you\u2019ve done with the pacing impact in your own interim model you being a little bit more conservative, but can you quantify that to a certain extent, does the kind of 8% in the mix from online advertisers does that go to 5, 4, how far down does it go?", "Jim Bidzos", "Can you repeat the question?", "Sterling Auty", "Yeah.  So I am wondering, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that in your internal forecasting that you\u2019ve taken into account the impact from the new ICANN rules on online advertising and pacing and that you kind of assumed a smaller amount of online advertiser names.  I am just kind of curious how small do you think that can get in the mix in terms of the percentage?", "Jim Bidzos", "Got it.  So, traditionally Sterling it\u2019s been 8 to 10% of our adjustive zone and then on a new registrations on a quarterly basis it\u2019s been in a range of -- well last year we had a historical high of 12 or at about 8.5%.  We do think that it could come down a little from the 8.5% this quarter.  We kind of have to wait and see though.  To be really honest with you, there is a number of things that are going on here, the Google changes that Jim made reference to earlier, and then as well the ICANN policy change that took effect on July 1.  We did see some initial effects in the early part of the month of July, but subsequently since then in the weeks following, we\u2019ve seen it appears to be almost a near recovery of that.  So, we are still kind of working our way through to kind of understand what the impact on these changes is going to be.", "Sterling Auty", "Alright, thank you.", "Jim Bidzos", "Next question please?", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow", "Hi guys.  I just want to follow up on the domain name front.  You talked about sort of a deceleration there as far as expectations go, so bit of a drop off obviously year-over-year this quarter.  What do you think is the appropriate sort of growth of this year, but also when you do put your long-term thinking cap on for just the dot-com and dot-net basis?", "Jim Bidzos", "Phil I apologize.  I think we are having a hard time hearing here trying to make sure we get the gist of the question right before responding.", "Phil Winslow", "Yeah, it was just the -- what do you expect for growth as far as the second half in dot-com and dot-net in the base and then what is the appropriate long-term growth rate there from a unit perspective not dollar?", "Jim Bidzos", "Okay.  So, in this quarter we saw a net increase of 2.9 million names.  Over the last number of quarters, we\u2019ve seen growth rates more in the range of say 3 to 4 million on a quarterly basis, so clearly we are seeing some effect here as a result of the changes we talked about earlier.  I think that the results that you saw this quarter are probably indicative of what we might see in the next quarter and then at Q4 we will have to take that one as they come.", "Phil Winslow", "And then just finally on the SSL certificate side, also just maybe get a sense of the growth in that base there?", "Jim Bidzos", "The overall growth in SSL that we talked about in the past is we are looking for revenue growth in the low double-digit range, so in the 10 to 12% kind of range and that is indicative of the AUR trends that we talked about earlier, where we do think that due to product mix, there is a potential for the AUR to come down a little bit just due to product mix shift.  So what\u2019s that\u2019s telling you essentially is that the unit growth would be higher than the revenue growth.", "Phil Winslow", "Great.  Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you.  We\u2019ll go next to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Frederick Grieb", "Hey guys.  This is Fred Grieb for Sarah Friar.  One quick question on the EV certs.  You said you were thinking the uptick was going to push out a bit, should we be thinking middle of 2009 for that now, just kind of wondering when I should be ticking up my ASP for that business?", "Jim Bidzos", "I think it\u2019s difficult to say exactly when.  I mean the two factors that we can see that might be influencing this are; one that we were both quite frankly, we have minimal if any control over.  #1 is the general economic conditions.  I think there are some people who especially in the larger enterprises who may not be buying as many EV certs for their particular use as they may have.  That could change if they start to see success which we believe they are with the certificates that they do deploy.  And, the other issue there is the browser base that\u2019s capable of supporting them.  So, the trend there is likely to be good, but it\u2019s difficult to say exactly when it\u2019s going to happen.  Could be this year, might be past the end of the year.", "Frederick Grieb", "Okay.  And then, one follow-up on the margins.  Basically because you guys are kind of taking a little bit more of a growth stance, about how much of the margin expansion once we get to the 35% range do you think is going to come from revenue growth, fixed cost base and how much is going to come from additional cost cutting?", "Jim Bidzos", "It\u2019s going to be a combination of both.  This quarter we had a great quarter of 34.2%.  We expect next quarter to be roughly about the same.  There is a couple of things that are going to happen in the third quarter that did not happen in the second quarter such as we have an ICANN increase, the Delaware data center is coming on, so we have additional depreciation, also we have the leased expense related to the building sale.  So, we are committed to exiting the year at 35% or higher and on a go forward basis it's going to be a mix between the revenue growth and additional savings of the shared services.", "Ken Bond", "Fred, it\u2019s Ken.  Just one thing I want to make sure that does not get lost here is that when we first set out with these targets of 35% or higher, it was based on an expectation of the completion and execution of the divestiture plan that which allowed us to take cost out even with some of those divestitures now pushing out we still will make those targets.  I think that's important for folks to keep in mind.", "Jim Bidzos", "And another point I would like to add as well is that, we plan to make those margin targets while still being able to make these marginal investments that we talked about in growing the core businesses.  And so, we are able to do everything that we think represents good solid risk adjusted leveraged opportunities to add incremental revenue.", "Frederick Grieb", "Great.  Thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you.  We'll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker", "Hi, guys.  I wonder if you can just talk a little bit more broadly in terms of what you\u2019ve seen from a macro environment on the SSL business and the dot-com, dot-net business?  And then, how exposed do you think you guys are to potential slowdown and especially if you can talk about kind of July trends, I know you said you saw a little bit of a snap back, but if you look at the traditional side of dot-com, did you see a deceleration in July that was separate and distinct from the online ad?  Thanks.", "Jim Bidzos", "I couldn't hear any of that.", "Brian Robins", "Todd, we are having a problem on our side hearing.  We got the first part.  If I got it right, commentary around the macroeconomic environment and how that might be affecting SSL and the Naming business, is that fair?", "Todd Raker", "Yes, and if you can speak, you had some commentary on the July trends in the net ads around the online advertising, could you comment to the traditional side, the 91% of the basis not impacted here by tasting and did you see any deceleration in July in that portion of the base?", "Brian Robins", "No.  The growth that we saw in Q2 and then the early signs of what we have seen here in Q3 on the traditional name side of the business continue to be strong.  To kind of put some perspective on this, in Q2 for the traditional name we saw growth of 21% year-over-year.  To kind of put that in perspective, last quarter it was 22% and then a year back it was 23%.  So we've actually seen a very good holdup of the traditional naming business.", "Jim Bidzos", "I think just to put that in some perspective, we\u2019ve been developing a number of different charts here and as I study these and looked at the underlying data, what sort of -- makes an impression on me as I look at these is that we are actually looking at a curve that's a 12 or 13 year curve, essentially since the internet became the worldwide web in the early to mid 90s is when you saw obviously the growth of the web and domain names.  And there are lots of different things that have happened that had some impact in the growth of names at that time.  But if you are looking at a very very long-term curve, you would expect that by virtue of the absolute number of names that exists that the growth rate will start to slow.  And if you take out, eventually you might even refer it to as sort of many bubbles like for example, these advertising names, you see that that curve is actually quite smooth over a long period of time.  The market is very resilient.  The people who make money selling domain names are very creative.  We also have a number of different ways that we can manage that business and also a large number of opportunities to invest for growth and the international space is the best example that I can give you.  So, when you put all that together, I think in general that curve is much smoother than the near term data measured in weeks or months or even quarters might suggest.", "Todd Raker", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you.  We\u2019ll go next to Walter Pritchard with Cowen & Company.", "Walter Pritchard", "Hey, couple of questions, most of mine have been answered.  I guess just on G&A expense, that ticked up a bit this quarter, we were expecting that that may tick down as you just continue to take some of the fixed cost out of the base, what was the reason there?", "Brian Robins", "As we mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks that G&A also has some of the cost from the discontinued operations and so when you look at some of the cost ties in this sort of transitional period, it\u2019s tough to look at G&A quarter-to-quarter, sales and marketing quarter-to-quarter, cost of revenue quarter-to-quarter, overall operating margin is what you should look at holistically by the business.  As we get the businesses divested and get the shared services out, they will be much clear on a go-forward basis.", "Walter Pritchard", "And can you just give us a sense of how much of the discontinued ops cost is still embedded in G&A?  That sounds like the biggest category that that\u2019s still being influenced by?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah, we have -- it's a great question and as we go through our in-state organization in doing our planning, we currently try to assess that.  There is roughly about $300 million of undefined cost in the business that support both core and non-core and so we are in the process as you currently expect every quarter going through the contracts, the network, the technology and the people and trying dedicate as possible to specific products.", "Walter Pritchard", "Okay.  And then just as it relates to the CEO search, I know maybe pretty early in the process and Jim we just -- many of us just met with you maybe in the last few weeks.  But, any update on candidates there or that process in general?", "Jim Bidzos", "Any update on \u2026", "Walter Pritchard", "Sorry, CEO search?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah.  So, basically I have over the last month during July, I have interviewed the number of search firms.  We had a Board meeting this week and I believe we have selected one I would like to tell that myself and not do it on this call.  So, the immediate progress report is the selection of the search firm to work with.", "Walter Pritchard", "And then just last question on the EV, somebody ask similar to this but just as a clarification, it just seems like that most of the EV search have been sold into large customers and it seems like it\u2019s still not a very big line item and you are talking at most a couple of thousand dollars.  I am just wondering why you are seeing economic impact there, if you just elaborate a little bit more on that?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah, economic impact that we are seeing is actually the largest enterprise customers and the financial institutions are going through a lot of turmoil right now and so really it\u2019s more of a focused issues.  You know, with the results are on track, the curve that we are talking about is getting pushed back a quarter, two quarters, but we are happy with the progress that we are making on that.", "Walter Pritchard", "Yeah, don\u2019t underestimate also how many certificates some of these large organization have.  So, upgrading them all at once might actually be a number that\u2019s significant enough for them to have their attention drawn to?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah, that\u2019s the point I was going to hit that it\u2019s not that we are seeing any kind of disappointment here Walter I mean, the 100% year-over-year growth.  But as Jim kind of points out what you might expect enterprises might take larger volume of EV certificates, they are just slowing down a little bit on the adoption on EV.  They are taking in total the same numbers certs, just a little bit less on the EV is kind of distract with other issues.", "Walter Pritchard", "Great.  Thanks a lot.", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah, okay.", "Operator", "Thank you.  [Operator Instructions].  We will go next to Rob Sanderson with American Technology.", "Rob Sanderson", "Yeah, thank you and good afternoon.  First, a question for Brian.  For the third quarter you mentioned incremental depreciation expense and lease expense on properties you previously owned.  Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the total incremental that we should be thinking about for the third quarter?", "Brian Robins ", "Just in this category it\u2019s about 4 to $6 million.", "Rob Sanderson", "Terrific, thanks.  And then, second question on the PPC online advertising customers, you said 8.5% of the base.  How do you know what names are pay-per-click driven?  Is it really best guess or do you somehow know with certainty what kind of customer type that registers what names?", "Brian Robins ", "One more time please.", "Rob Sanderson", "Sure, the online advertising customers 8.5% of the base.  How do you know what names are pay-per-click driven and is there some way that you know with certainty or is just a best guess estimate?", "Brian Robins ", "We have a proprietary index that we use in determination that basically we use consistently over time to measure what portion of the base is paper-click driven or online advertiser oriented.  It's a consistent measure and approach that we use to determine that and so this quarter it's 8.5% it\u2019s been as high as historical high, a little over 10% of the adjusted zone in total.", "Rob Sanderson", "Okay, thank you gentlemen.", "Operator", "Thank you.  We\u2019ll go next to Israel Hernandez with Lehman Brothers.", "Israel Hernandez", "Hey guys.  You talked about rolling out the new services around the core DNS and SSL business, can you give us an update as to where we stand with those and how long before we start seeing some services out of VeriSign.  We are talking about sometime 2009, 2010 what's the timeline there?  Thanks.", "Jim Bidzos", "Israel, look for those new services probably coming in the later part of this year.  Some of these are actually out in beta data form already with customer.  I think we are at those near stages where we are getting ready to go with them live.  We are pretty close there.  Next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you.  We\u2019ll go next to Manish Hemrajani with Oppenheimer.", "Manish Hemrajani", "Hi, guys.  You mentioned that you had about 7.5 million new domain names in the quarter.  Could you give out the number of renewals?", "Brian Robins", "The renewal was little over 12 million.", "Manish Hemrajani", "Little over 12.  On the SSL side, on the ASPs, could you give some color on the sequential decline in AURs.  Is there more of a GeoTrust mix in play here?", "Brian Robins", "That\u2019s exactly.  VeriSign was up, Thawte was flat quarter-to-quarter and within GeoTrust there is two brands rapid SSL.  We made a concerted effort this quarter to actually go after the low end of the market and we are successful in that, so we had more units at less cost per unit which lowered AUR.", "Manish Hemrajani", "Got it.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  We will go next to Garrett Becker with Merrill Lynch.", "Garrett Becker", "Hi, good afternoon.  Excuse me, I think most of mine have been answered.  But I was wondering, I know it\u2019s a little bit early, but perhaps you could talk about some of the new initiatives that Icon has put forward in terms of opening up the global top level domains and just how you think that may impact your business going forward?", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure.  I am certainly talking about the GTLDs that they have announced that they will open up in the future.  So, first of all, we think that\u2019s good that creates a larger space, it creates more names, it\u2019s good for the internet.  The internet is good for us.  In the short-term, we find it difficult to assess the negative, any negative impact.  I would say it\u2019s more neutral to positive.  First of all, ICANN has announced that they will be publishing a process by which parties can apply for new GTLDs that looks like it will not be a direct and simple process, it will \u2013 your application will have to be accompanied by a seven figure application fee, a million dollars that comes along with it.  So, after that happens at some point in time there will be new GTLDs that are available.  So I am assuming that some people actually get into that business.  I think that it\u2019s probably a safe bet that not all of them will be entirely successful in it that may end up benefiting us.  I believe there are people who will go into that business with the intention from the beginning of contracting VeriSign to provide that service on their behalf, so that could be good for us.", "In terms of the domain names themselves, it\u2019s hard to see any short-term negative impact.  An example I would give you is if somebody acquired and begin operating dot-hotel and let\u2019s say that marriott.hotel, I really don\u2019t think anybody believes that they are going to abandon marriott.com because they did that or fail to revenue marriott.com because they bought marriott.hotel.  So, again in the near-term, it seems neutral to positive from where we sit.", "Garrett Becker", "Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful.  And then just one small one, could you -- can you give us an update on maybe dotTV within the base how that\u2019s been trending and any chance you can give us an update on the number?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah, actually dotTV is doing pretty well, still fairly small numbers, its\u2019 below a million names, but it is actually growing faster from a unit basis than the overall adjusted zone.  The other thing I would add there is to keep in mind that the price put on dotTV is quite a bit higher than dot-net or dot-com name at the price over $20 per name.  So, it\u2019s moving along very nicely as well as we get better price points on it.", "Garrett Becker", "Great.  Thanks, that\u2019s all I have.", "Jim Bidzos", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  We will go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert", "Hi, good afternoon.  Can you just \u2013 again, you know, I am going to ask this Ken, your operating margin on a long-term basis, you had said a while ago would be above 35%.  Can you tell us actually to where it might be in the out years?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian.  We have reconfirmed today that we\u2019ll exit the year at 35% or higher.  This year is a bit tricky from an accounting standpoint.  We are making good progress in setting up the in-state organization and bifurcating the costs between the discontinued business and the continued businesses.  But at this point, I can\u2019t give you any further information.", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah, just a little directional Katherine, no numbers here of course.  But the comments that we made today said that we believe we are going to make 35% or higher by the exit of this year and that is with some pushing out some of the divestitures.  As Brian talked to you many times in the past, the cost come out relating to those divestiture that would give you directionally that, those numbers wouldn\u2019t continue to increase in the next year as well.", "Katherine Egbert", "Okay.  That\u2019s helpful.  And then, last one, can you just remind us of what it takes to put something into discontinued operation, meaning is there a timeframe that the divestiture had to take place in order to come or qualified for desktop?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah, well, there is two different things that you got do.  One is you got to qualify for being held for sale and then one that meets that criteria, you got to \u2013 meet an additional criteria to put in discontinued operation.  There is one-time requirement and the time requirement is that it has the sale that\u2019s probable within one year.  Also, you have to have an active program to sell the product, that so it has to be available for immediate sale and you have to have authority from the board to sell that asset.  And so, once those were met, you can\u2019t have any continuing influence in the operations of the business.  So those are the five criteria to qualify for held for sale and then discontinued operations.", "James Bidzos", "Yeah, Katherine this is Jim.  If I can just comment on your first question about where our margins might go in the future, I think it\u2019s helpful to just step back and sort of see the big picture, I mean one of the things that this quarter does in my opinion is that it confirms that we are -- to us that we are on the right strategy.  If you look at the financial performances of the core businesses, if you look at the revenue, if you look at the margins, and you consider that we are going slower on the divestitures that we planned.  We really think that\u2019s due primarily to the larger economic conditionis that prevail right now.  And you consider that we are able to make the marginal investments for revenue growth where ever we feel we need to and we start to consider that the N state company, which we should arrive at with clean financials hopefully by the end of 2009 where we will have the divestitures done.  We will have those other costs taken out.  We will have start to seeing -- we will start seeing the benefits of the marginal investments that we are making in new revenue opportunities.  I think, we are convinced, if you sort of project and imagine that scenario, I think you can see why we think this is the right strategy.", "Katherine Egbert", "Okay.  That\u2019s fair.  Thanks Jim.", "Operator", "Thank you.  [Operating Instructions].  We will go next to Fred Ziegel with Soleil Securities.", "Fred Ziegel", "Hi, guys.  I guess a question for Jim surrounding this DNS vulnerability has \u2013 is that having any impact on anything and where does that stand in terms of\u2026.?", "Brian Robins", "I am sorry, we can\u2019t hear you.  You got to speak up.", "Jim Bidzos", "Fred, I am sorry, we can\u2019t get a word.  But I don\u2019t know if you are on a speaker phone, if you can get closer maybe or\u2026", "Fred Ziegel", "Can you hear me now?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah.", "Brian Robins", "That\u2019s better.", "Fred Ziegel", "Okay.  So question was around DNS and the vulnerability and is that having any impact since it\u2019s been discovered and secondly where are we in kind of cleaning that problem up?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah.  Certainly talking about DNS caching, that\u2019s well understood problem.  There a well developed available fixed for it.  The only surprise which actually isn\u2019t a surprise for people in this business is the slow rate in which people are actually applying the patch?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah.  Only thing I would add to that to Fred is that, the applicability of that particular problem is to what they call recursive server.  And it\u2019s really important understand that our DNS network is based on authoritative servers.  And so, hence this is not even anything that would affect us, therefore DNS cache poisoning issue, but it does affect a number of recursive servers out there.  Typically, those types of servers are on enterprise environments where they do it for speed of operations of their internal networks.  But externally as it release to our networks, zero vulnerability to this problem.", "Fred Ziegel", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.  And we have one final question.  We will take that question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Thanks.  On the gross margin front, gross margins obviously had a nice improvement in the quarter.  Can you going to a little bit more detail, is that revenue makes, is that headcount, what is the kind of keys to see specifically the improvement in gross margin?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah.  We don\u2019t report gross margin.  Gross margin for the quarter is approximately 79%.  I think the operating margins are more complete meaningful measure.  Once we complete, the divestitures and we get the discontinued costs out, you\u2019ll be able to see the operating margins from a trend perspective.  The increase in operating margin you saw was really twofold: one, it was increase in revenue from the prior quarter coupled with the tax that we had.  Headcount attrition, we are able to take out from additional shared services and the divide and focus strategy that we alluded to during the script.  We are really starting to see a lot of benefits from that.  And so, we are doing things much more efficient.  There is greater transparency and accountability and those results are paying-off.", "Sterling Auty", "All right.  Thank you.", "Brian Robins", "I think and also just worth mentioning that the parts of our business that we can control.  The management team is doing an excellent job of controlling those costs, managing the business and obviously bringing in the revenue where we can.  We haven\u2019t had success with the divestitures that we\u2019d hope for, but there are many, many parts of the business where we exercised direct control and careful management, I think I was being a bit modest.  We have done a very good job there I believe.", "Sterling Auty", "All right.  Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  And with no further questions, I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Bond for any additional closing comments.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, Robby.  We anticipate that our next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our third quarter 2008 results will be held on Thursday, November 6, at 2 p.m. Pacific Time.  Final confirmation of this date will be provided the first business day after the close of the quarter on October 1.  I would also like to remind you that in light of Regulation FD, VeriSign plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it does so through a public disclosure.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ken Bond", "", "Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign\u2019s third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I am Ken Bond, Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications and I am here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and Interim President and CEO of VeriSign along with Brian Robins, our acting Chief Financial Officer.", "A replay of this call will be available beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time via telephone at 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 for international callers and will be available through November 12. The pass code for both numbers is 3410716.", "The press release and financial information discussed on today\u2019s conference call is available on the Investor Relations website at investor.verisign.com. The Q3 2008 press release is also available on FirstCall, MarketWire, as well as our website.", "For those of you joining us via webcast, we also invite you to view the slide presentation, which accompanies today\u2019s conference call. These same slides will be available for download from our website after the call.", "Financial results in today\u2019s press release are unaudited and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, financial results in today\u2019s press release and the matters we will be discussing today include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. Our non-GAAP income statement and a description of items excluded in our non-GAAP financial information is located on the VeriSign Investor Relations website as well.", "Also let me quickly mention that we expect to file our 10-Q no later than next Monday. And as a reminder, our Analyst Day originally scheduled for November 12th has been deferred to 2009.", "In a moment, Jim and Brian will provide some prepared remarks and afterwards, we will open up the call to your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks Ken. I am pleased to report that our core businesses had a very solid quarter in what are certainly extraordinary times like most we never would have predicted that the markets and our own stock would have turned down as much as they have. However even with the heightened uncertainty around global market conditions I feel very good about our business, which I will discuss in more detail later on the call.", "I would like to start with a brief overview of our financial results, which Brian will discuss later in greater detail followed by a review of our business and operating results for the third quarter. From there, I would like to touch on some areas that we believe are particular interest to investors based on conversations we've had with shareholders including how the current economic environment has the potential to impact our core businesses and update on our divesture activities as well as our executive search currently underway. Brian will then discuss the financial results for the third quarter and provide limited guidance before we move to the Q&A portion of the call.", "I am pleased to report that our core businesses had a very solid quarter. Revenue for core businesses was $240 million, which was at the higher end of our revenue guidance of $236 to $241 million. We also saw continued improvements in our core operating margins, which came in at 35.5%.", "Last November, we set the goal of improving our operating margins to 35% or higher by the end of the year. So, we're very pleased to have achieved this goal a quarter ahead of schedule. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.25 and includes a three penny charge to EPS for a write-down related to investments affected by the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Excluding this charge, EPS would have been $0.28 compared with the consensus estimate of $0.26. Brian will discuss this further during his comments.", "Q3 was also a solid quarter for businesses we intend to divest as these businesses delivered bottom line results as we expected making for a solid quarter all around. I would like to thank all of our employees for their focus and continued commitment to VeriSign.", "And while not technically a part of Q3 results, last month we closed the sale of our remaining 49% interest in the Jamba joint venture to News Corporation for approximately $200 million", "Moving now to a business review of our core businesses for the third quarter, I would like to start with naming. Our naming business continued to show good growth with the adjusted zone for registered names and .com and. net totaling 89.4 million names at the end of the quarter, an increase of 16% year-over-year.", "In total, we processed 6.9 million new domain name registrations during the quarter compared with 7.5 million names during the same quarter last year. The decline was largely expected as new name registrations and renewals for online advertising were down sharply from year ago levels largely reflecting changes in Google's AdSense program.", "As a result, online advertising now represents 8% of the adjusted zone down from 9% last quarter. As a reminder, Google modified the smart pricing feature of its AdSense program in June, which impacted the profitability of web pages in the program. We now expect that the renewal rate for names related to online advertising will be lower well into 2009 as the impact of Google's program changes fully working through the adjusted zone.", "At the same time, we're also feeling the effects of lowering internet advertising spending in general. While the specific data points vary among research reports, the theme that internet advertising growth has slowed dramatically this year and will likely slow again next year is consistent and this affects our naming business. As a result, the percentage of new name registrations represented by online advertising was 6% this quarter down from 9% last quarter and down from historical highs last year.", "Turning to traditional names, which now represent 92% of the adjusted zone. New name registrations during the third quarter were approximately $6.4 million, 2% lower than the same quarter last year. We monitor registry activity on a continuous basis and the October registration activity for North America in particular has also been a little lower than what we would expect to see.", "On a net basis, we added 2.1 million names to the adjusted zone this quarter including a net increase of 2.7 million traditional names and a decline of 600,000 online advertising names as we expected. As registrars forecast that economic conditions will contribute to lower than expected growth rates coupled with continued weakness in online advertising, we are internally forecasting the adjusted zone will increase 1 to 2 million names during the fourth quarter.", "Even as we're seeing declines in online advertising, and some signs of possible slowing in traditional names within North America, we're also seeing continued growth in international markets, markets where we focused our efforts to develop regions for growth potential in both .com and .net overtime.", "While overall growth may be slowing, we note that the growth of the adjusted zone is consistent with all other TLD on a combined basis excluding China which is offering domain names at heavily subsidized prices. The renewal rate for Q2 was 73% down from 74% in Q1 due to the transition currently underway in online advertising.", "While renewal rates are not fully determinable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe the renewal rate for Q3 will be 1% to 2% lower almost entirely attributable to the transition in online advertising and the exit of a few large online advertisers some in response to industry litigation.", "As a reminder, on October 1st registry fees for .com and .net names increased by 7% and 10% respectively to $6.86 and $4.23 per year which at these prices, we believe continues to be an outstanding value.", "Finally, our internet infrastructure continues to operate at ever increasing levels and recently we saw peak loads of over 50 billion DNS requests per day, as our systems again demonstrated VeriSign's capability of operating global networks at this scale and reliability remains unparalleled due in large part to our continued investment in infrastructure such as Project Titan.", "As a reminder, no one else has operated a global network infrastructure of this nature at this volume level with 100% uptime over the last ten years even as we remain the most attacked global network on the planet.", "Moving to our security services. Our second core franchise SSL saw the installed base for his quarter increased to 195,000 certificates compared with 156,000 last quarter and 957,000 the same quarter last year. We're very pleased that this growth represents 4% sequential unit growth and 14% year-over-year growth in the base.", "Third quarter SSL revenue increased 12% year-over-year and the annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the installed base of VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte branded certificate was down slightly to $253 from $258 last quarter. The lower AUR reflects the continuation of product mix shifts, which we discussed last quarter as GeoTrust continues to grow faster than the overall portfolio.", "Looking forward, we expect that GeoTrust will continue to grow faster meaning we expect to see further AUR declines as unit volumes grow faster than revenues. While still a small portion of our SSL business, extended validation or EV certificate sales continued to be strong as we more than doubled the units sold a year ago and we remain the number one provider of EV certificate with market share of over 75%", "However, as discussed last quarter, we continue to see the effect of the economic slowdown on EV adoption as large scale customers again ordered less than what we expected. We will likely see the mainstream adoption of EV certificates pushed out until we see improvements in the broader economy.", "This quarter we also began to observe a subtle shift in buying patterns within some large scale customers as we're seeing smaller, but more frequent orders than we have in the past periods. While this does not appear to have directly affected the overall usage of certificates, it does suggest that our customers are managing their certificate requirements carefully.", "And it\u2019s another example of how the weakening economy has the potential to affect our business. Should this trend continues, the net effect is that some portion of certificate sales to these customers is being deferred, which could cause SSL revenue growth to be slightly lower than the double digit revenue growth, we discussed in the past. Again, should this trend continue?", "Now I would like to share some comments on the progress of our identity and authentication services business. Within IAS, we have now distributed more than 2 million credentials as part of the VIP and onetime password programs. While we're optimizing our market approach to reflect current economic conditions, we believe that are many strengths provide the potential for IAS to become our third core franchise.", "I would now like to comment on some areas that we believe are of interest to investors including how the current economic environment is affecting our core businesses and update on our divesture activities as well as our executive search currently underway. Over the last 90 days, we have been observing the financial crisis as is unfolds and we're constantly assessing how VeriSign is being affected.", "I want to be clear and acknowledge the obvious. Our businesses along with virtually every business is being affected by broader market conditions. The divesture sales process has been slowed, mainstream adoption of EV certificates has been pushed out, and we've seen some effects to our naming and SSL businesses, which I will discuss in a moment.", "In helping investors better understand how the changing markets could affect VeriSign, I would like to share some insight on what we see as being risks and opportunities, while we do not see each and every risks materializing into reality. We do recognize that given the current environment investors want to understand the range of possibilities.", "Before discussing what we see as some of the general risks, I would like to comment on what we see as opportunities. Our strategy, as we shared it with you in the past remains unchanged as we're focusing the company to grow businesses, while exiting a number of good but non-strategic businesses.", "We believe this strategy along with the focus on improving our capital structure will provide for better shareholder value overtime. Our core businesses are growing with revenue growth of 18% year-over-year this quarter. Operating margins are expanding in this quarter, we achieved our year end target of a 35% operating margin a quarter ahead of schedule.", "The balance sheet is strong with over $650 million in cash and investments plus another $200 million from the Jamba sale. We have a proven ability to generate positive cash flow with cash flow from operations of $115 million this quarter. We recognize these are difficult times and while many companies will struggle to weather the downturn, we expect to strengthen our competitive position.", "We will be aggressive and leverage our financial strength to compete vigorously in our core markets and we expect we will make investments to stimulate growth in our core businesses and adjacencies. Let me be clear that I am not signaling a return of active M&A as it means to bring growth.", "Likewise, I am not suggesting these investments have any serious or detrimental effects to our commitment to improving operating margins. In the past we've discussed marginal investments to further grow in our core businesses and adjacencies. This is what I am talking about.", "In summary, what I am saying is, is that the strength of our balance sheet and consistent cash flow should allow us to continue investing in our core and adjacent markets even where there maybe no capital available. Not all companies are in the same position of strength, including some of our competitors and are being forced to cut people and investments just to survive. As a result, we're in a position to do what others cannot do especially should we see an extended downturn.", "Moving now to a discussion of areas, which we see has potential risks. As we have previously said, the weakening economy has impacted the divesture process as well as having some effect on EV adoption. With the further weakening of the economy, it should come as no surprise that we continue to feel these effects.", "Looking further into our core businesses, we also see some risks that the growth of the traditional name portion of our naming business could flow. During the month of October we observed some softness in new name registrations of traditional names in North America. While we're working this issue actively with registrars, we should be clear that this is only one month of activity for one region in which we operate our registry business.", "As discussed earlier, the online advertising portion of the naming business, which accounts for 8% of the adjusted zone, is seeing pronounced weakness due in part to changes in Google's AdSense program and lower spending trends in internet advertising.", "Our naming business also has opportunities which we're continuing to develop including the extension of.com and .net to international markets such as India, china and Latina America. Additionally the next couple of quarters, we expect to bring to market new services which leverage our existing capabilities and experience.", "Returning to our SSL business the main effects of the economic slowdown is a slowing of EV adoption and more recently the emergence of a subtle shift in buying patterns with some large scale customers which I mentioned earlier. While there is some risks around the uptake of EV certificates, we believe that mainstream adoption is just a matter of time, as customer feedback has been consistent and clear about the benefits of EV certificates.", "One area of risk that we believe is given too much of credit is whether we're seeing any signs of cannibalization to our VeriSign branded certificate in light of the declining AUR. The reality is that we're seeing good unit growth across all brands and the AUR decline is simply a matter of lower priced certificates selling faster than high end certificates.", "Our market share with high-end VersiSign certificate is very strong and growth here is a function of segment growth as well as our ability to up sell from Thawte and GeoTrust brands to VeriSign more so than market share gains. Thawte and GeoTrust brands are targeted to mid and low end segments of the market, where our market share is not as strong providing what we believe are good growth opportunities, as these markets are growing faster than the high end market and it also leave room for market share gains.", "Finally on SSL, we continue to see good growth opportunities for all certificate brands in international markets. Our IAS business is still in the early stages of growth making it difficult to know what effects if any the economic environment is having on this business beyond the general market trends.", "In summary, while it is difficult to know with certainty, how the current deteriorating economic conditions will affect our core business on an absolute basis, I feel very good about the opportunities; we have as well as our performance on a relative basis.", "I would like to now turn to the current status of our divesture efforts. As we discussed last quarter, our divesture effort is the primary area, where we're feeling the effects of the economic downturn. While there continues to be good interest and the remaining businesses being divested, the sale process is taking longer and proving to be more complicated than we originally anticipated.", "Consistent with comments from last quarter, buyers are taking more conservative postures and more recently credit market issues are impacting some deals making it difficult to bring deals to closure. The good news is that we have already sold five smaller businesses including content delivery services, retail data solutions, digital brand management services, self care and analytics, communications consulting, plus the remaining interest in the Jamba joint venture collectively the net proceeds from these sales has been approximately $275 million.", "While, we have not yet sold any of the major bundles, we are making progress in focusing the company on our core businesses. There remains some possibility that we maybe able to complete a transaction on one of the major bundles this year, but our experience last quarter reminded us we are getting close to completion is not what matters. As a result, we continue to actively work with potential buyers and remain cautious in our expectations around timing.", "With that in mind, I would like to reaffirm for you all that our strategy to divest non-core businesses and focus on core businesses built on internet infrastructure services is the right course of action. In these difficult times it would be easy for us to second guess ourselves, but when the going gets tough the tough keep going and we will keep going until we completed the restructuring we setout to do including the divesture of all non-core businesses and reducing the shared services costs to fit the new smaller size of the company.", "As Brian will discuss later, our disciplined management of non-core businesses again led to solid operating performance. We will continue to maintain our disciplined management approach through the current transition and beyond.", "Finally, I would like to provide a quick update on the search for a permanent CEO. Since last quarter, we retained a search firm and I have spoken with a number of candidates. In general we've been pleased with the quality of candidates. However, the search process has confirmed what we knew, as we began the process. The nature of our business requires a diverse set of skills as the naming and security businesses have striking differences between them.", "Additionally, the challenge in managing businesses on each side of the country has become even clearer. As we started this process in August, we decided it was most important that we find the right candidate. We believe that given the complexity of our businesses, our priority is the right one. I am actively engaged in the management of our business and I am committed to staying here as long as it takes to find the right candidate.", "In light of the executive turnover, we are seeing over the last year, I can appreciate the desire to see a new permanent CEO named. However, in addition to us waiting to find the right candidate, I think it is important to keep a couple of points in mind. First is that we're on our way to becoming a much smaller company. While we have seen a number of management departures over the last year, it has not been our intent to fill all those vacancies, as they're not needed as part of the company's smaller footprint.", "Second is that the leadership of our three core businesses continues to be very capably managed by leaders, who collectively have almost 30 years of experience with VeriSign and each having been here at least nine years. Between I, these core leaders and the remainder of our senior leadership team, we continue to drive the company forward in the execution of our strategic plan.", "As we said before, 2008 is going to be a very interesting year with a lot of moving parts. Obviously with the markets as they are we're seeing the divesture timeline extended somewhat but our belief that VeriSign will be a leaner, meaner, more profitable as well as better positioned company for future success remains unchanged.", "We remain focused on protecting and growing our core businesses, executing on the sale of non-core businesses and rightsizing our business once the divestures are complete. The importance of executing on planned investments in an expedient manner remains the top priority and we remind ourselves that while these events are important, the key to unlocking shareholder value will be driven by what happens in our core businesses more so than the timing or sales proceeds of non-core businesses.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Brian for a walkthrough of our financial results for the third quarter as well as guidance. Brian.", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Jim. And thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Before we dig into the results for the core businesses, I would like to provide a few comments on those businesses we intend to divest especially in light of the current macroeconomic environment.", "As Jim discussed, we remain committed to our strategy to focus the company on internet infrastructure services and to divest of non-core assets. However, as discussed last quarter it will take more time than we originally anticipated due in large part to the broader market conditions. Likewise, the completion of transition services will be further out than we originally anticipated.", "In the meantime, we continue to manage these businesses with great diligence under our divide and focus management strategy. While there has been some slowing in the non-core businesses, our disciplined management approach has led to the bottom line resulting being on track with plans.", "From a reporting perspective, we continue to move those businesses, we intend to divest into discontinued operations. This quarter the messaging and postpaid billing businesses were moved into discontinued operations. As a result, only a couple of small businesses that we intend to exit or divest now remain in continuing operations and in aggregate these businesses accounted for approximately $6 million in revenue this quarter.", "Last quarter, we discussed our intention to obtain audit carve-out financial statements for the enterprise security services and messaging bundles. In addition to the previously completed audit of the communications bundle. We have now completed the audit for enterprise security services, and we expect to have the messaging audit complete in the first quarter of 2009.", "Moving now to a more detailed discussion of results for our core businesses. Q3 was another solid quarter. Revenue of our core businesses came in near the high end of our guidance at $240 million up 3% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Growth was largely driven by continued strength in our core businesses with naming up in excess of 20% year-over-year and SSL up 12% year-over-year.", "Turning now to operating margins. As we continue to exercise financial discipline in managing our business, we're seeing the operating margin improvements as reflected in non-GAAP core operating margins of 35.5% for the quarter achieving our year end target of 35% or higher operating margins a quarter ahead of schedule. This represents an incremental improvement of 130 basis points from last quarter and improvement of 520 basis points from the first quarter.", "Non-GAAP cost of revenue and operating expense for the core business were $155 million, up slightly over $1 million on an absolute basis. We continue to grow revenue faster than expenses and in this quarter we again benefited from lower labor costs both direct and contingent workforce consistent with the continuing trend of headcount reductions.", "Additionally, equipment and software expenses were lower this quarter due to favorable contract renewals. As expected, we saw an increase in depreciation and operational expense associated with the startup of Delaware data center and leased expenses associated with the leaseback of buildings here on our Mountain View campus.", "Below the operating income line, we incurred a non-GAAP loss of approximately $15 million, which represents a significant increase over prior quarters. As Jim discussed earlier, we incurred a charge of approximately $8 million or $0.03 earnings per share due to the investments in the reserve money market funds, whose net asset value fell below $1 per share due to Lehman Brothers Holdings.", "The impairment charge represents less than 2% of VeriSign's cash and investments as of September 30th, 2008. While the ultimate amount of this loss may change, we currently expect to recover the very large majority of our investment in the reserve funds and we expect we will have more than sufficient liquidity to fund our operations in the near term.", "Non-GAAP core net income for the third quarter was $48 million resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25. Excluding the impact from the charge to other income, we would have reported earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.28. This is $0.02 above consensus as a result of solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management.", "The diluted share count used in EPS calculations was 196 million shares down from approximately 203 million shares last quarter. The decline in shares is due to 4.9 million shares being repurchased with the remainder of shares being fewer common stock equivalents included in the diluted share count.", "Moving onto the cash flow and balance sheet items both consolidated operating cash flow and free cash flow were strong this quarter coming in at $115 million and $96 million respectively. There were multiple drivers this quarter including continued strength in our core businesses and favorable working capital trends.", "Consolidated capital expenditures this quarter were $19 million as compared to $34 million in Q2 and $26 million in Q1or roughly $79 million year-to-date. As we noted last quarter, in July we brought online the new data center in Delaware. Our ability to consistently generate solid operating cash flows resulted in our maintaining a strong balance sheet with ending cash, equivalents and restricted cash of over $654 million down approximately $14 million from last quarter. The decline in cash was due in part to the share repurchases of $120 million.", "Also, early in the quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares, additionally as the ASR was completed in July; we also received an additional 1.4 million shares as part of the final settlement. In total since resuming the share repurchases, we have repurchased nearly 74 million shares and reduced the common shares outstanding by 30%.", "Net DSO for the third quarter was 35 days, down from 41 days last quarter, as a result of the increased collections from certain telecommunications customers. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $798 million, up $17 million or 2% from last quarter. The growth in deferred revenue stemming from our core services continues to be strong. We saw year-over-year growth of 18%.", "We ended the quarter with approximately 3,650 employees, down 150 from last quarter largely due to planned headcount reductions and divestitures. As we've indicated previously, we would expect headcount to continue to decline with the sale of non-core businesses and further reductions in shared services headcount.", "Moving now to guidance. This quarter, we will again provide guidance for our core businesses which are naming, SSL and IAS. And as a reminder, our guidance includes VeriSign Japan given its focus on SSL and IAS services. However, before providing guidance for Q4, I would like to share with you how we're managing our business in these challenging economic times.", "While the final outcome of the current economic environment is beyond our control, there are several actions we have and will continue to take towards the goal of continuing the expansion of our operating margins. As a part of the restructuring of the company, we've already taken steps to reduce overhead and shared services costs.", "We're being aggressive on a number of fronts with particular focus on our headcount, which is at the core is the single largest cost factor in running the company. Since the beginning of the year we've already reduced headcount by 640 people and by continuing to aggressively manage headcount, we are in a position to align our cost outlook with revenue projections.", "Likewise, we're able to take similar actions around project expenses given us a good degree of confidence in our ability to meet our objective of improving operating margins overtime. Jim discussed the financial strength of VeriSign earlier, as here where the strengths matter most as we work to make the investments, we need to further future growth yet still meet near term objectives.", "Moving now to guidance for the fourth quarter. For Q4, we expect revenue for the core businesses will be in the range of $242 to $247 million reflecting year-over-year growth of 14% to 16%. As discussed for sometime we expect that Q4 non-GAAP operating margin will be 35% or higher. We also expect that aggregate of items for the operating income line will be similar to this quarter's result excluding the $8 million charge discussed earlier due to continued expectations that interest income will be lower this year on both lower cash balances and interest rates.", "Finally, we now expect that the fourth quarter fully diluted share count will be approximately 196 million shares. Looking further into our Q4 guidance, we expect, we will meet our full year revenue guidance calling for growth of 18% to 20%. This quarter we've already met guidance calling for 2008 exit rate operating margins of 35% or higher then we expect to repeat this performance in Q4. And we've already reduced the share count below 200 million shares as projected.", "In total, we're pleased as we met are appeared to be on track to meet all the full year financial targets discussed last November. And we're achieving these results in the midst of a weakening economy and without the benefit of having a completed for sale of any of the major bundles.", "We remain committed to the sale of the non-core businesses and we look forward to the time, where we will see the benefits of these sales in our operating results. As a reminder, our normal practice is to provide guidance one quarter at a time. However, given the macroeconomic uncertainties and heightened investor concerns, we think it makes sense for us to provide some initial comments to bracket revenue growth for 2009.", "In general we feel good about our business. We also recognize that we've already seen some effect to our business from the weakening economy as discussed earlier. And it is not clear whether we'll see more. As a result, we believe that 2009 revenue growth will be lower than this year, but still in double digit range.", "In summary, we're very pleased with our business execution in the third quarter particularly as it relates to revenue growth from the core business as well as non-GAAP operating margin expansions. We remain focused on executing our strategy, as we clearly see this is the key to further unlocking shareholder value longer term.", "We now like to open the call for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, how are you?", "Jim Bidzos", "Good, Todd. How are you?", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Good. Two questions for you. One, if you could talk about your appetite for stock buyback with the stock here versus conservatism in the markets we face? And then secondly on the DNS side with the pretty broad guidance range hereof $1 to $2 million net adds this quarter, if we look into '09, what's the likelihood that you could see net adds go below a million in a quarter in '09? Do you think that's a pretty good baseline given what you've seen here in the October month?", "Brian Robins", "Todd, this is Brian. I will take the buyback. As you know, we currently have $1 billion authorized. Also the process of buying back shares can be limited when we're in possession of material nonpublic information. So, for example, we had the Jamba JV last quarter, which is a good example. Overtime we're extremely committed to improving our capital structure and we're taking a conservative view to cash management in light of the liquidity crisis now the macro economy.", "Ken Bond", "Todd, it is Ken. I will jump in on that second part of that question talking about the possibility of $1 million names or lower going. To be really honest with you that's really hard for us to call. What we really want to do here in this call was kind of give you a good view of what we're seeing not only for Q3, but you heard some of the comments that Jim and Brian made about the early part of the quarter, specifically October, seeing a little bit of softness there in North America specifically.", "We want to be very careful here to not try and extrapolate; one data point does not make a trend. So this is some of the background behind why we've got that guidance range of $1 to $2 for next quarter. I think what we really need to do is just see a little bit more time unfold here try to get a sense here as to whether or not these macro effect is coming in or whether or not this is just a one quarter blip. Jim, any further?", "Jim Bidzos", "Hi, Todd, it is Jim. I would add to that, there is a couple of different moving parts here. One is of course the advertising names, which we know are being essentially flushed out of the system, which will take a few more quarters.", "So we can expect to see some advertising name decline. The small decline the 2% decline that we had in the so called normal names is much smaller and I think that business is obviously that part of the business is nowhere near as volatile and it\u2019s much more predictable and stable.", "So, how those two wash out is really hard to predict. I think we need a little bit more data before we can say that. Obviously anything is possible, but I think once these advertising names wash out, the ability to forecast and predict the business will improve dramatically.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi. I want to focus on the expense front for a little bit, especially when you start to think about next year. You mentioned growth coming in a little bit slower than this year. But how should we think about operating expenses in light of just the macro uncertainty, especially as you do just continue to grow the high profit margin businesses?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian. On the expense side as I alluded to in my prepared comments, we have the ability to control our expenses, and what we've done internally is, we make sure that we have revenue attainment before we actually spend the dollar.", "So we're actually trending below on headcount now on wait and see mode on the macroeconomics and then as we invest in new projects, we'll do milestone based spending. So from a margin perspective, we recommitted to ending this year at 35% or higher and you can expect that or higher next year.", " ", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Garrett Becker with Merrill Lynch.", "Garrett Becker - Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I just wonder if you can drill down a little bit into the operating margins. There is a number of moving parts in there. You had the lease expenses and the ICANN fees, wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on how you got to that and how we should think about that going forward?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian. Similar to the prior comment, we've been able to achieve the 35% operating margins a quarter early and that was really when we originally planned that the assumption was that we would have some of the divestitures completed by now. And so the divide and focus strategy that we put in place about three quarters ago has really been paying dividends.", "Each of the individual businesses has been performing at or better than planned and we've been able to extract more costs out of the business quicker than we originally anticipated. As I also discussed in my prepared comments, there was a couple things that came on line this quarter that were new expenses that weren't in prior quarters.", "One is the Delaware Data Center came on line and that was an increase of approximately $1.5 to $2 million at quarter and you can expect that on an ongoing basis. Additionally, we reported last quarter that we sold two buildings here in the Mountain View campus and so we have about $1 million quarterly increase for the sale of those buildings because we did a two and a half year leaseback.", "Also last call I mentioned that the ICANN fees have gone up slightly. So, there are a number of new fees coming on line, but we're managing the variable costs to really deliver the margins that we delivered this quarter.", "Garrett Becker - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Then we'll take our next question from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for taking my question. Can I come back to the guidance because it still leaves a lot of room for us to go off and interpret differently for 2009? So, you say growing double digits but less than what you grew this year that would still be a range from 10 to 18. Could you help put your arms around a little bit if the environment stays like October, so call that kind of base case or perhaps base to worst case is that 10% type growth? And then if we start to see some improvements that's where we would get up into more than mid-teens. I would love to get a little bit more color about how you're thinking about that.", "Jim Bidzos", "Hi, Sarah. This is Jim. Let me take a shot at it. First of all, October I think is not enough data for a number of reasons. You have to realize and I think you do realize there are a lot of different factors at work here, a lot of unparallel major influences. Even if we assume that the economic slowdown sort of stayed at the rate that it is at, it really depends on a number of other factors besides that.", "For example, advertising names play a very, very large role in this. The impact of that we can't quite see yet. The financial sector is a very, very large part of the market for our certificate business. How they continue to do will make a very large difference in how that particular business performs.", "Last quarter I talked at great length about these marginal investments that we were going to make in the core and core adjacencies. We have made those. We continue to make them and we expect that they're going to help us to continue as we talked about last quarter to add the sprinkle growth into those core businesses that we want to do because they're so profitable.", "So, it\u2019s until all of that comes together, a month's worth of data is just isn't enough for us to feel comfortable giving you anything more. It\u2019s essentially be a projection even based on the assumption that the economic conditions continue just as they are.", "Brian Robins", "And Sara just to add a little bit of color on that, however, given the environment we had a choice either to provide some element of discussion or just stay quiet on this. We felt that given the circumstance and the environment it would be more appropriate for just to give you a little bit of color, it is a wide range.", "We recognized that and that's reflective of the environment. But again the bracketing here is just so that people don't get nervous and start calling for things to be maybe lower than they really should be. Last quarter as an example we talked about domain name growth and we thought that, that might be in the same range or a little bit lower.", "We want to make sure by bracketing domain name growth this quarter we said $1 to $2 million we don't want people running after it for example saying that the domain name growth might be only a half a million names.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then, when you look out into '09 from a margin perspective clearly you're seeing expansion. How much of that is, you actually able to kind of almost frontline costs keep taking heads out of the organization and so on versus getting the fact that you will see double digit growth, you will get some leverage of the top-line. Is it 50/50? I'm trying to get a sense for a slower growth. How much more margin we would still get versus higher growth?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian. 50/50 is a good split. There is a number of things that you will do take costs out of the business. As we alluded to in the past as we complete the divestitures due to accounting standards there are some costs that are shared currently today that will go away, and as we continue to look to streamline the smaller footprint of the company. Also, as you alluded to the revenue growth, we will also provide increased margin", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Good afternoon, everyone. As you talk about the advertising related names washing out over the next year, is it going to take all of 2009 or should we see a more pure base in the back half of 2009 and that being said, what are your thoughts on retention? Should you see half or little less than half of the names of the 8%?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yeah. This is Jim. So, first of all, at the time that Google made their change in June, the effects were almost immediate. They started to roll in July. We started to feel them then. But basically pushing that out twelve months, I think the answer to your question is that the later is more true that we should start to see a more advertising name free adjusted zone towards the later half of 2009.", "We won't have to wait until the end of the calendar year in order to see how that shakes out. Based on some analytics that we do which we think are fairly comprehensive and accurate at this point we have identified about $8 million names that we think are advertising names. Last quarter when we talked to you we made, what we thought was a conservative estimate that roughly half of those names, $4 million would wash through the system over the following four quarters putting us roughly just past the midpoint of next year and we haven't changed our thinking on that.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great. So, most of those names are one year in duration to begin with?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, as the nonperforming names, essentially the changes in the AdSense program incentivized domainers to basically remove the nonperforming names from their portfolio, which translates into don't renew them and so it will take roughly four quarters to wash all of them out.", "Brian Robins", "", "That's correct.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "", "Right.", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks, Rob. Anything else?", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Nope. Thank you.", "Jim Bidzos", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Cowen & Co.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Co", "Two questions. One, just on the CEO search, Jim, are you finding it easier or harder versus three months ago just given the environment to attract the kind of candidate you're looking for?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, I will give you maybe a more detailed answer to that question that you maybe look for. It was a little bit easy at first. We had some initial candidates and then it slowed down as the economic impact was felt. I think people settled in and said, \"well, I need to see what happens and where things go\".", "And I suspect that as it does settle down and if it is a prolonged downturn, people will come to understand that and I think that VeriSign is a company with a very, very strong balance sheet, good strong core businesses will be a very attractive place for the very best candidate. So kind of slowed down a little bit, but I expect it to get much easier.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Co", "And then just on the naming side of the business, you mentioned you're seeing some starting-ness and softness in the new names on the core side. Are you seeing any change in the renewal rate of those core .com, .net names?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, we mentioned that we expect the renewal rate to come down a point or two.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Co", "But that sounds like it is related to advertising, right?", "Jim Bidzos", "I think that's the majority of the impact. But we have to remember too that the change in new names for the so called normal name is nowhere near as dramatic as it is for advertising. So given what we see in advertising, I think you can see the changes in the renewal rates should be very small.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen & Co", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "A couple of questions. First of all, Brian, at the end of the year you were hoping to realize about $40 million of shared service expense benefit. Was all of that realized in the third quarter or is there still some incremental element of that $40 million to still be realized in the fourth quarter?", "Jim Bidzos", "Most of that has been realized quarterly and taking it out on quarterly basis, we will continue to remove shared services costs throughout the year. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're down over 500 headcount for the year, and as we continue to sell off businesses and consolidate the shared services, we'll continue to extract that out.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. And can you tell us what the revenue was from the discontinued operations in the period?", "Brian Robins", "Yes. So, the core operations, was $240 million. The continuing operations, that was in the core was $6 million. And then the discontinued operations let me pull it up real quickly.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rob Sanderson with American Technology.", "Rob Sanderson - American Technology", "Hi, thank you. I guess, we will have to get back to the answer on the other one there. But my question was stock repurchase. Brian I think you mentioned 3.5 that we repurchased in October after the close of the quarter and another 1.4 from the ASR. First, did I get that right and if so what was the average price on that?", "Jim Bidzos", "That is correct. Before I answer that the $143 million was from discontinued operations Steve, we got cut off. So, you are correct, $3.5 million was from the share repurchase and then we had an additional $1.4 million shares from the ASR. The price on that was--", "Brian Robins", "34.91", "Jim Bidzos", "The average price on that was 34.91.", "Rob Sanderson - American Technology", "Thanks. And then I think you mentioned your appetite and the balance was increased cash discipline given the current environment. I think $650 million on the balance sheet and generated about $150 from operations in the quarter. Would you see any reason why you would want to carry a greater cash balance than you have now or what are we talking about with respect to cash discipline here?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah. Just quickly correct, it\u2019s $650 million in cash now plus the $200 million that we received from Jamba and it was actually $115 million in cash flow for the quarter.", "Rob Sanderson - American Technology", "Right. So 850 plus 150 in ops, but what is the right cash balance to carry given the current environment?", "Brian Robins", "That\u2019s a great question. I think you see a lot of companies going right now viewing cash as king just because the liquidity crisis out there and folks are being a little bit more conservative. I think I would probably turn back to our business model. We accrete a lot of cash on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis and so there is not a need to carry that much cash.", "When we look to deploy our cash, first and foremost, we look to do it on a risk adjusted basis as Jim said and investing back into our core products and leveraging the vast infrastructure that we currently have today. As we have done in the past and we continue to evaluate returning cash to shareholders as well through stock repurchases.", "Rob Sanderson - American Technology", "Great. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Hi. When do you expect to have a new CEO? You previous said by the end of the year. It sounds like it may take longer now. Could you give any new information there?", "Jim Bidzos", "", "Yeah. We were hopeful that we could do it by the end of the year. We didn't commit to do that and it doesn't look like we're going to get there. So, I am not going to make a prediction, but we're working on it.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. And then Brian, it looks like payables and accrued expenses are way down in the quarter. How much was payables down during the quarter?", "Brian Robins", "Accounts payable?", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Yes.", "Brian Robins", "Is that in the press release? I am just curious, Katherine. I apologize for asking. But it seems so obvious we don't have that right here.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "It is combined payables and accrued expenses. I am wondering what the payables piece, how much that is down, if there was significant impact on the cash flow?", "Brian Robins", "Okay. So, let\u2019s go now and I\u2019ll pull that up and then get back to you later on the call.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co", "Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. I had two quick questions. On the restructuring process, if you can provide us with slightly more color, apparently what appears to be more of the market right now do you find that for some of the efforts you're trying to sell there is a number of competing properties out there that kind of any way make your life a little more problematic in trying to sell those? Is that the case or is it just capital markets conditions?", "Jim Bidzos", "This is Jim. No, that's not the case. There aren't competing properties; that isn't the issue. As we mentioned, we did sell five smaller businesses and we sold our share in the Jamba joint venture. But of the remaining bundles that we have, I can give you a little bit of detail there.", "We have one bundle that we think we're essentially at the end of the process. The issue there is credit. This is a buyer, who requires financing. And it\u2019s essentially the price of money today, the interest rates that are the difference and when that deal gets done.", "The other two are in negotiations with buyers. As far as I know there are no competing properties that those buyers are looking at and those buyers don't need to finance their purchases. So we've done many different things. We didn't get into all of the detail but obviously one of the things that we've done is focused on buyers who do not need financing, where it was possible for to us do that. No competitive issues.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co", "And that's quite helpful. And maybe one more general question already two years into contract with ICANN since extended back I believe in November '06. What is the next time or with respect to the process that you go back to ICANN and  start the renegotiation process?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well the contract for .com renews in 2012. So, there are performance criteria that we meet of course and we are meeting, and we do have a presumptive right of renewals. But that's four years from now.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co", "And I would imagine the renegotiations start probably ahead of that, is it a year, is it eighteen months, or --", "Jim Bidzos", "I think last year that the process began in under a year prior to the actual renewals.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Great. Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Jim Bidzos", "Hi, Scott.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "A couple questions here. First of all I'm trying to understand a little better the margins and the potential and the operating margins. Have you given a thought of how many basis points the shared costs are currently pressuring margins, another way of asking is if all the discontinued ops were out of the business, how much margin improvement do you think would happen just from shared costs?", "Jim Bidzos", "That's a good question. We reorganized our headcount this year to be more direct towards the product. So, we could actually have more accountability and transparency within the business. And so it\u2019s changing overtime, you're starting to see that come out.", "We're able to achieve our 35% exit rate a quarter earlier and you are actually seeing that earlier in time. We haven't committed to 2009 operating margin at this point. But we do have great visibility into the expense and with slightly lower revenue growth for next year, we'll be able to maintain and expand those margins.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Okay. So you're committing to expand the margins to some degree next year?", "Jim Bidzos", "Correct.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "A couple more questions. Can you give the base domain names international or the growth rates you're seeing in international? It\u2019s just a small base and you are seeing good growth and are you putting more resources towards that?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, we are. We actually see international as one of our strong growth areas. We've been doing some campaigns down in Brazil. We see India and China as other areas, all be at a smaller number. Those growth rates are much higher than the North American growth rates.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Okay. Last question I had is there any update on the impact or the opportunities in the new TLDs?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, I can give you a brief update. This is Jim. You may have seen an article in the online Wall Street journal yesterday that talked about this. And this just shows you how complicated the process is. According to this article some pushback from intellectual property holders, who are very concerned about the added expense that unlimited gTLDs might cause for them and their efforts to protect their intellectual property.", "So, they gave some very good examples about Marriott as the hotel maybe getting Marriott .hotel, Marriott .vacation, et cetera. But if you have to go out and essentially protect your IP in a vast wilderness of unlimited gTLDs, that would impose a very high cost for you to do that, a very large investment for which there is no guaranteed return. And the article concluded that .com was the powerful brand and probably would continue into the future that way.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Just a follow-up on that. Is that causing any slowdown in people doing current .com and .net sign ups or is that necessarily having no impact there?", "Jim Bidzos", "None that we can measure.", "Scott Sutherland - Wedbush Morgan", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question-and-answer session today. At this time Mr. Bond, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing comments.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, Jennifer. We anticipate that our next quarterly conference call will reflect our fourth quarter 2008 results and will be held on Thursday, February 5th, at 2 PM Pacific time. Final confirmation of the date will be provided on January 2nd the first business day after the close of quarter.", "I would also like to remind you that in light of regulation FD, VeriSign plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on the financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through public disclosure.", "Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes the call. Thank you and good evening.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Today's call is being recorded. ", "At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. I'm Ken Bond, Vice President for Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, and I'm here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, Interim CEO of VeriSign; along with President and Chief Operating Officer, Mark McLaughlin; and Brian Robins our acting Chief Financial Officer.", "A replay of this call will be available beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time via telephone at 888-676-8776 or 913-312-1457 for international callers and will be available through February 11. The pass code for both numbers is 6496729. The fourth quarter 2008 earnings press release is available on FirstCall and Marketwire.", "The press release and the financial information discussed on today's conference call and a reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to GAAP is available on the VeriSign Investor Relations website at investor.verisign.com.", "For those of you joining us via webcast, we invite you to view the slide presentation, which accompanies today's conference call. These same slides will be available for download from our website after the call.", "Financial results in today's press release are unaudited and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we disclose in detail in our documents filed with the SEC.", "Specifically, the most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Additionally, financial results in today\u2019s press release and the matters we will be discussing today include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. Our non-GAAP income statement and a description of items excluded from our non-GAAP financial information is located on the VeriSign Investor Relations website.", "Also let me mention that we expect to file our 10-K no later than March 2nd. Our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 14, and will be held here in Mountain View, California. We look forward to the event and hope to see many of you here then.", "In a moment, Jim, Mark and Brian will provide some prepared remarks and afterwards, we will open up the call to your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?", "Jim Bidzos", "", "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon to those of you joining us today. As many of you already know Mark McLaughlin, recently rejoined the company and was named President and Chief Operating Officer. I'm very pleased to welcome Mark back to the company, as he and I have a great working relationship and as knowledge of the company and our industry will allow him to hit the ground running like no one from the outside could.", "Mark, would you like to say a few words before we start.", "", "Mark McLaughlin", "Good afternoon, I just want to say it's great to be back at the company. I've always known the company has tremendous talent and business strengths and we're excited to be back as part of the team to help take it to the next level. My transition into the company has been smooth. I've worked with this team before and understand where we're going as a company, having played a key roll in the development of our strategy.", "Looking forward, Jim and I remain focused on protecting and growing our core businesses and divesting those businesses we have discussed as being non-core. I'm committed to seeing this strategy through to success and I'm glad to be back as part of the team.", "With that, Jim let me turn it back to you.", "Jim Bidzos", "Again, welcome back. And what a truly extraordinary economic time, I'm pleased to report that VeriSign delivered a very solid quarter that capped off a very solid year. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis we delivered revenue of $245 million, earnings per share of $0.28 and we exited 2008 with operating margins slightly above 35%, and with nearly $800 million in cash.", "It's noteworthy that we also repurchased more of our shares in 2008 than we did in 2007 and we were buying during Q4. I believe these results demonstrate several things. First, that our strategy of focusing on our core businesses is the right one. Divesting non-core businesses while protecting and growing our core businesses is the right thing for VeriSign to do.", "Second, the financial results show that our business unit realignment has allowed us to identify inefficiencies and control costs despite our not having completed divestures. We believe we have the financial focus and discipline to manage the businesses successfully including discontinued operations.", "Third, these results show that while we did not have as much success as we had hoped for in selling non-core businesses, we still managed to have a stronger balance sheet that positions us to pursue opportunities in the downturn where many companies may struggle just to survive.", "Despite the weak economy and frozen credit markets, we still managed to sell 7 of 12 businesses, as well as our interest in the Jamba joint venture, raising over $300 million in a recession long and deep enough to cause unemployment to dramatically rise and to have the government proposing and implementing very significant stimulus and bailout plans.", "I'm grateful to the VeriSign employees, including those in discontinued operations, who worked hard and delivered for the company. Now let's go into a more detailed review of the quarter.", "Like many of you, we are increasingly realizing that the broader downturn is going to be deeper and longer than originally expected. More importantly, we are seeing definite signs that our core businesses are being affected as well.", "Last quarter we discussed how the macroeconomic environment could potentially affect us. This quarter, many of the possible effects we discussed materialized, resulting in a slowing of our core businesses, impacting our naming business in particular.", "I would like to start with a brief overview of our financial results, which Brian will discuss later in greater detail, followed by review of our business and operating results for the fourth quarter.", "From there, I would like to touch on areas that we believe are of particular interest to investors, based on conversations we've had with shareholders, including how the weakening economic environment is impacting our core businesses, and an update on our divesture activities.", "Starting with the business review; I'm pleased to report that our core businesses had a solid quarter, and I would like to again thank all of our employees for their continued focus and commitment to VeriSign. Revenue for core businesses was $245 million, which was at the higher end of our revenue guidance of $242 million to $247 million.", "Brian, will discuss this in more detail, but there were a couple of items effecting core revenue this quarter in ways that we did not anticipate. The net effect of these items is that core revenue was $1 million lower.", "Despite the revenue adjustment, non-GAAP core operating margins were 35.1% for the quarter, slightly above our guidance of 35%. In November of 2007, we set the goal of improving our operating margins to 35% or higher by the end of 2008, and we're pleased to have achieved results in line with this goal last quarter as well as this quarter.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.28. Our press release will note that the GAAP tax provision is preliminary, which Brian will discuss later. However, this has no direct effect on the non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28.", "Before moving to the business review, I would like to mention that we're beginning to realign our three core businesses into two business units, with SSL and IAS being consolidated into a newly formed business unit, we will be calling Authentication Services.", "In addition the marketing and development synergies, we believe the realignment will provide an important benefit of allowing us to reduce a portion of the shared service cost prior to the completion of the divesture process.", "Moving now to our Naming business, we saw growth of 12% year-over-year as we adjusted zone for registered names and .com and .net grew to 90.4 million names at the end of the quarter. In total, we processed 6.3 million new domain name registrations during the quarter, compared with 7.5 million names during Q4 2007.", "The decline in new name registrations was expected and reflects the continuation of weakness in names, registered for the purpose of participating in online advertising networks as the Earnings Per Click or EPC or domain name holders continues to weaken.", "As discussed in the past, we expect that online advertising will increasingly become a smaller part of our Naming business. Currently these names make up 7% of the adjusted zone. As a result we plan to discontinue the reporting of metrics for online advertising after this quarter. As appropriate, we will continue to discuss meaningful events and trends with respect to online advertising or other relevant areas of the adjusted zone.", "Last quarter, we noted seeing possible signs of softness in new name registration or traditional names. Unfortunately, the broader economic downturn has impacted traditional names as well and what we saw in October continued over the remainder of the fourth quarter.", "New name registrations or traditional names during the fourth quarter were approximately 5.9 million, 12% lower than the same quarter Q4 2007. On a net basis, we added one million names to the adjusted zone this quarter, including a net increase of two million traditional names, which now represents 93% of the adjusted zone and a decline of one million online advertising names as we expected.", "We expect that weakening economic conditions will contribute to slowing growth rates in 2009 for the total worldwide domain zone, as well as for our dot.com and dot.net zones. As a result, we're not providing formal guidance for the first quarter net editions to the adjusted zone expect to say we're not forecasting a decline in the adjusted zone in Q1.", "Typically, Q1 is our strongest quarter for new name registrations and we expect that this will be the case this year as well, however, given the composition of the expiring name base, we also expect that Q1 will also see the highest number of non-renewals.", "Our expectation is based on what we can observe and project about the current environment. Should there be significant changes in the broader market, our outlook could change as well. Even as we're seeing declines in online advertising and slowing in traditional names within North America, we're also seeing continued growth in international markets; markets where we have focused efforts to develop regions for growth potential in both .com and .net overtime. While overall growth of the adjusted zone maybe slowing, we know that the growth rate is similar to the growth rate of all other gTLDs on a combined basis.", "The renewal rate for Q3 rounded up to 72%, but was down from 73% in Q2. While the Q3 renewal rate decline was most obviously affected by domain names registered for the purpose of monetizing online advertising traffic, the renewal rate for traditional names also came down in Q3.", "While renewal rates are not fully determinable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that for Q4 it may decline slightly more than 1%, with the Q4 renewal rate rounding down to 70%.", "Finally, our internet infrastructure continues to operate at peak loads of nearly 50 billion DNS requests per day, as our systems again demonstrated that VeriSign's capability of being able to operate global networks at this scale and reliability remains unparalleled due in large part to our continued investment and infrastructure such as Project Titan.", "As a reminder, no one else has operated a global network infrastructure of this nature at this volume level or with 100% uptime over the last 11 years, even as we remain one of the most attacked global networks on the planet.", "The SSL business saw the installed base increase to 1,118,000 certificates compared with 1,095,000 last quarter and 987,000 in Q4 of '07. We're pleased that this growth represents 13% year-over-year growth in the base.", "Fourth quarter SSL revenue increased 9% year-over-year and the annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the installed base of VeriSign, GeoTrust and thawte branded certificates was $248, down from an adjusted AUR of $251 last quarter.", "As discussed in prior quarters, the lower AUR also reflects the continuation of product mix shift as GeoTrust continues to grow faster than the overall portfolio. Looking forward, we expect that GeoTrust will continue to grow faster, meaning, we expect to see further AUR declines as unit volumes grow faster than revenue.", "While still a small portion of our SSL business, extended validation or EV certificate sales continue to be strong as we more than doubled the units sold a year ago. And we remain the market share leader for EV certificates, however, as discussed last quarter, we continue to see the effect of the economic slowdown on EV adoption as large scale customers again ordered less than what we expected. As discussed last quarter, we expect that the mainstream adoption of EV certificates will be pushed out until we see improvements in the broader economy.", "Last quarter we also discussed a shift in buying patterns by some large scale customers to begin placing smaller but more frequent orders, as customers are manning to their certificate requirements carefully.", "Also, in our retail and channel business, which typically served customers with less than five certificates, Q4 is typically a seasonally weak quarter, however, this Q4 was weaker than normal for the retail business, as we saw a decrease in new certificate sales and delays in renewals.", "Our channel partners also saw the same economic challenges as did the overall SSL market. These examples make clear that the weakening economy is affecting our SSL business with the net effect being that some portion of certificate sales are not occurring, or are being deferred, and that our SSL revenue growth will be in the single-digits.", "I would like to now take a quick look back at last year as 2008 proves to be another eventful year for VeriSign and the broader markets. While '08 will be remembered as an extremely challenging year, we made good progress on our strategy of focusing the company around our core businesses.", "Brian, will discuss some of the financial metrics in more detail, but we're pleased with our revenue growth and operating margin improvements. Full year core revenue grew 20% year-over-year and operating margins exited the year above 35%, even as we have additional divestures and shared cost reductions to be completed.", "In an environment, which could be described as challenging at best, we were also able to sell seven non-core businesses and our remaining interest in the Jamba joint venture since late in 2007 netting proceeds of approximately $300 million.", "Through the sale of these non-core businesses, as well as disciplined operating management, our headcount ended the year with nearly 1,000 fewer employees or 23% lower than Q4 2007.", "And finally, over the course of the year, we repurchased approximately $39 million shares of common stock, slightly more than the $38 million shares we purchased in 2007. To date, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 31% since the first half of 2007, when we resumed the share repurchase program.", "In summary, while 2008 was a challenging year, it also marked the year of very good progress for VeriSign.", "I would now like to comment on some areas that we believe are of interest to investors, including, how the current economic environment is effecting our core businesses and an update on our divesture activities.", "Over the last 90 days we've been observing spread of the financial crisis into the broader economy and we're constantly assessing how VeriSign is being affected. I want to be clear and acknowledge the obvious. Our business along with virtually every other business is being affected by broader market condition.", "The divesture process has been slowed, mainstream adoption of EV certificates has been pushed out and we've noticed effects to our Naming and SSL businesses, which I'll discuss in a moment.", "In helping investors better understand how the changing markets could affect VeriSign, I would like to share some insight on what we see as being risks and opportunities. While we do not see each and every risk materializing into reality, we do recognize that given the current environment, investors won't understand the range of possibilities.", "Before discussing what we see as some of the general risks, I would like to comment on what we see as opportunities.", "First, our strategy remains unchanged as we're focusing the company to grow our core businesses and we are exiting a number of good, but non-strategic businesses. We believe that our strategy, along with a focus on improving our capital structure, will provide for better shareholder value over time.", "Our core businesses are continuing to grow with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year this quarter. Operating margins improved dramatically during 2008 to current levels at above 35%. The balance sheet is strong with nearly $800 million in cash at the end of '08. We have a proven ability to generate positive cash flow with cash flow from operations of approximately $115 million in this quarter.", "And we remain committed to shareholder value having repurchased more shares in '08 than we did in '07. We recognize these are difficult times, and while many companies will struggle to weather the downturn, we expect to strengthen our competitive position.", "We will be aggressive and we will leverage our financial strength to compete vigorously in core markets, particularly, those markets where IT spending maybe declining in 2009. We also expect that we will make investments to simulate growth in our core businesses and adjacent markets.", "Let me be clear that I'm not signaling a return of active M&A as a means to bring growth. Likewise, I'm not suggesting these investments have any serious or detrimental effects to our commitment to improving operating margins. In the past, we have discussed both marginal investments and close to further growth in our core businesses. This is what I'm talking about.", "In summary, we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet and consistent cash flow should allow us to continue investing in our core and adjacent markets. Not all companies are in the same position of strength, including some of our competitors, and they are being forced to cut people and investments just to survive. As a result, we believe we're in a position to do what others cannot do, especially, should we see an extended downturn.", "Moving now to a discussion of areas which we see as potential risks. As we've previously said, the weakening economy continues to affect the divesture process as well as having some effect on EV adoption.", "With the further weakening of the economy, it should come as no surprise that we continue to feel these effects. Looking further into our core businesses during the fourth quarter, we also saw some effects to the traditional main portion of our Naming business as mentioned earlier.", "Also, the online advertising portion of the Naming business, which accounts for 7% of the adjusted zone, is seeing pronounced weakness due in part to weakening EPC trends, including Google's AdSense program, change and lower spending trends in internet advertising.", "Our Naming business also has opportunities, which we're continuing to develop, including the extension of .com and .net to international markets such as India, China and Latin America.", "Returning to our SSL business; the main effect's of the economic slowdown, slowing of EV adoption, and a shift in buying patterns by large customers, which I discussed earlier. While there is some risk around the uptake of EV certificates, we believe that mainstream adoption is just a matter of time, as customer feedback has been consistent and clear about the benefits of EV certificates.", "One area of risk that we believe is given too much credit is whether we're seeing any signs of cannibalization to our VeriSign branded certificates in light of the declining AUR.", "To address this directly: currently we're not seeing any signs of cannibalization, while we continue to see a strong growth at the low end of the market. GeoTrust growth in particular has been very strong. However, GeoTrust units are sold at lower price points and this has the effect of causing the AURs to decline.", "We continue to see installed base growth in all brands with GeoTrust growing the fastest and VeriSign the slowest. Because of our market share and leadership at the high end of the market, our unit growth at the high end is somewhat bounded by the overall segment growth.", "In the mid and low end segments, where our market share is not as strong, we see good growth opportunities as these markets are growing faster than the high end markets and also leave room for market share gains.", "In sum, these factors suggest we will likely see continued AUR declines, however we expect to see continued revenue growth stemming from organic unit growth and growth opportunities for all certificate brands in international markets.", "In summary, while it's difficult to know with certainty how the current deteriorating economic conditions will effect our core businesses on an absolute basis, I feel very good about the opportunities we have, as well as our performance on a relative basis.", "Before discussing our ongoing divesture efforts, I would like to briefly comment on our recently announced arrangement agreement to acquire Certicom. As the situation is still evolving, there isn't anything we can say other than to acknowledge that we're aware of Certicom's determination that RIMs offer is a superior proposal. At this time we're considering what actions, if any, we might take, for today, we've no comments this matter.", "We remain committed to the strategy of focusing the company on our core businesses including the divesture of 12 non-core businesses, which we began in late 2007. As in past quarters, we continue to feel the effect of the economy on a divesture effort.", "While there continues to be good interest in the remaining businesses being divested, the sale process is taking longer and proving to be more complicated than we originally anticipated as buyers are taking more conservative postures, credit market issues are making it difficult to bring deals to closure.", "The good news is that we have now sold seven smaller businesses plus the remaining interest of the Jamba joint venture. Since our last earnings conference call, we've sold three additional businesses including post paid billing, communications consulting, and the 3united portion of the messaging business.", "In aggregate, since beginning the process late in '07, we've now received net proceeds of approximately $300 million from these sales and the sale of our interest in the Jamba joint venture. At this time, we have five businesses remaining for sale, including communications, enterprise security, messaging, and two small businesses, one of which we expect will close shortly.", "While it's certainly a challenging market in which to sell business we continue to actively work with potential buyers. With that in mind, Mark and I would like to reaffirm for you all our belief that our strategy to divest non-core businesses and focus on core businesses built on internet infrastructure services is the right course of action.", "We will keep going until we've completed all the restructuring we setout to do, including the divesture of all of the non-core businesses, and reducing shared services cost to fit the new smaller size of the company.", "As Brian will discuss later, our disciplined management of non-core businesses again led to solid operating performance. We will continue to maintain our disciplined management approach through the current transition and beyond.", "As we said most of last year, 2008 was going to be a very interesting year with a lot of moving parts. This is certainly proven to be true even in ways we could not have predicted.", "While we may not have achieved all of our goals in 2008, I'm extremely proud of our employees who made every effort possible so that we were able to make the good progress that we have.", "Looking ahead into 2009, we're realistic about the challenges that lie ahead and we have no illusions. We expect the coming year will bring an extended and deepening economic downturn.", "We expect that 2009 will bring new surprises just as 2008 did, and we're preparing for the challenging year ahead. We'll continue to focus as we protect and grow our core businesses, work diligently towards the sale of non-core businesses, right size our business once the divestitures are complete, and we have the right people in place to do all of these things.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Brian who will discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter and provide limited guidance before we move to the Q&A portion of the call. Brian?", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Jim and welcome back Mark. Thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Before discussing our results for the fourth quarter, I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some of our accomplishments in 2008.", "For the year, core revenue was $936 million, up 20% from 2007. Non-GAAP core operating margin for the full year was 33.6%, and we exited the year above 35% as we previously guided. Non-GAAP core earnings per share for the year was $0.96. Cash flow from operations was approximately $475 million and solid throughout the year.", "As Jim mentioned earlier, since late 2007, we have now sold 7 of 12 non-core businesses as well as our interest in the Jamba joint venture, which generated approximately $300 million in proceeds. And finally, we repurchased approximately 39 million shares of common stock in 2008, even more than we repurchased in 2007.", "Since resuming our share repurchase efforts in 2007, we've now reduced the common shares outstanding by 31%. At this juncture, we now moved all of the businesses that we intend to divest into discontinued operations.", "Our prepaid billing business is now the only business remaining in non-core continuing operations, and as previously indicated, we expect this will be wound down in 2009. On a housekeeping note, we have not fully completed the tax provision calculation process, and as a result, our GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter and full year is still preliminary, and therefore, GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share are also preliminary.", "Our final tax provision; GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share will be updated in our annual report on Form 10-K, and may differ materially from the amounts indicated in the press release.", "Also, we had a couple of issues affecting our core revenue this quarter as well as prior periods. The first issue related to revenue recognition for domain names and SSL certificates for the first month of new units.", "Historically, we recognize a full month of revenue, irrespective of which day in the month the name was registered. We have now adopted a mid-month convention and applied it retrospectively, resulting in adjustments for both Q4 and prior periods.", "The second issue related to revenue recognition for SSL certificate renewals, where we were previously recognized in revenue upon the execution of the extension agreement instead of upon the commencement of the renewal period. As a result, adjustment entries were made for both Q4 and prior periods.", "In summary, these two issues resulted in Q4 revenue being reduced by slightly more than $1 million, and the full year effect was a reduction of approximately $5.7 million in revenue. Both issues effect multi-year periods, and as a result, prior year revenue amounts will also be adjusted downward. A full disclosure of prior-period adjustments will be made in our 10-K. Cumulatively, the balance sheet effect is a $41 million increase to deferred revenue at December 31, 2008.", "Turning now to the fourth quarter, given the context of the greater macroeconomic environment and its impact on the business as Jim discussed earlier, I'm pleased to report we had a solid quarter due in part to the continued disciplined expense management. As a result, we were able to achieve our operating margin milestones without completing the divesture process and in spite of the declining market conditions", "Moving now to more detailed discussion of our results for our core business. Revenue for our core business came in near the high end of our guidance at $245 million, up 3% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year, in spite of the revenue adjustment discussed earlier. Growth was largely driven by performance in naming, which was up 23% year-over-year. SSL and IAS were up 9% and 14% year-over-year respectively.", "Turning to operating margins. As noted previously, we exited Q4 with a non-GAAP core operating margin above 35% inline with our guidance. Below the operating income line, we incurred a non-GAAP loss of approximately $8 million, slightly more of a net loss than we expected due to lower interest income.", "Non-GAAP core net income for the fourth quarter was $54 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. The diluted share count used in EPS calculations was 194 million shares, down from approximately 196 million shares last quarter. Due primarily to the share repurchases of approximately 2.6 million shares.", "Moving onto the cash flow and balance sheet items. Both, consolidated operating cash flow and free cash flow, were strong this quarter; coming in at approximately $115 million and approximately $90 million respectively.", "There were multiple drivers this quarter, including continuing strength in our core businesses and favorable working capital trends. Consolidated capital expenditures this quarter were $25 million as we continued to work on primarily core projects including the hardening and expansion of our data center facilities.", "Our ability to consistently generate solid operating cash flows resulted in our maintaining a strong balance sheet, with ending cash and cash equivalents of $791 million, up approximately $137 million from last quarter due largely to proceeds received from the divestures, including our interest in the Jamba joint venture.", "Please note that at the end of 2008, approximately $150 million of funds held by the reserve and discussed last quarter, were reclassified to other current assets this quarter, and are not currently included in our cash and cash equivalents. Of this $150 million, we received approximately $86 million subsequent to the end of the quarter.", "In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $50 million. Over the course of 2008, we repurchased approximately 39 million shares for an aggregate value of $1.3 billion.", "Our 2008 share repurchases exceeded those of 2007, and since resuming our share repurchases program in the first half of 2007, we have reduced the common shares outstanding by 31%.", "Net DSO for the fourth quarter was 35 days, consistent with last quarter. Deferred revenue from continuing operations ended the quarter at $845 million, up $8 million or 1% from last quarter.", "We ended the quarter with approximately 3,300 employees, down 350 from last quarter, largely due to planed headcount reductions and divestitures. As previously discussed, we would expect headcount to continue to decline with sale of non-core businesses and further reductions in shared services headcount.", "In summary, we're pleased with our results given the challenging economic environment. Revenue, non-GAAP operating margins and EPS were all above or inline with consensus and street estimates, and as well we'll discuss in a moment, our outlook is something that we believe most companies would be hard pressed to deliver on in 2009. Double-digit revenue growth in non-GAAP operating margins in excess of 35%.", "2009 will be challenging, but we're continuing to exercise financial and operational discipline to deliver results.", "Moving now, to guidance. This quarter we will again provide guidance for our core businesses, which are naming and authentication. Authentication is SSL and IAS as we align to a BU structure. And as a reminder, our guidance includes VeriSign Japan, given its focus on authentication services.", "Consistent with prior quarters, we are providing guidance one quarter at a time given the uncertainties with regard to the timing of the remaining divestitures. That being said, last quarter we provide a high level guidance around 2009 revenue growth, suggesting we would see double-digit revenue growth.", "Based on market conditions as we discussed, we now expect that 2009 growth will be at the low-end of the prior range.", "Before providing detailed guidance for the first quarter, I would like to call out an important change to our non-GAAP reporting as beginning in Q1. We intend to reduce the list of items excluded from our non-GAAP financial information.", "As an example, previously, we would exclude gains and losses from derivatives and equity investments. Going forward, these gains or losses will be included in our non-GAAP results.", "We're making these changes in an effort to improve the quality of our earnings, but we also recognize that these changes could cause some confusion when comparing results from year-to-year. As a result, the GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations included in our Investor Relation's website will reflect adjusted non-GAAP results for prior periods to reflect these changes.", "Over the course of 2008, these changes impacted non-GAAP earnings per share about $0.04 higher. However, the results did vary quarter-to-quarter. This change won't materially impact our results going forward.", "Moving now to more detailed guidance for the first quarter of 2009; for Q1 we expect revenue for the core businesses will be in the range of $246 million to $251 million or flat to up 2% sequentially. We expect that the Q1 non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately 35%. We also expect that aggregate of items below the operating income line will continue to be similar to this quarter's results.", "We now expect that the first quarter fully diluted share count will be approximately 194 million shares. Finally, we would expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be consistent with this quarter.", "In summary, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 and entering into 2009 we remain focused on executing our strategy as we clearly see this is the key to further unlocking shareholder value longer term.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). ", "And we'll go first to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Hey, guys two questions, First, on the DNS side of the business, as we anniversary the Google AdSense changes, should we expect some of the drag in the online advertising business to lift?", "Jim Bidzos", "Todd, it\u2019s Jim, let me reiterate what we've told you before, that hasn't changed. So basically when the changes in the Google AdSense program were made initiated, essentially at the beginning of July in 2008. We estimated that the number of, so called, advertising names in the zone were about 8 million and we estimated that roughly half of those, about 4 million, would essentially be washed out by that program.", "Based on the methods that we use to identify those advertising names in the zone, we standby those numbers, we did say, and we still believe that, first of all, we know that the non-renewals of those names, as they get flushed through the system over the fourth quarter period, is lumpy, its not smooth, and that Q1 is probably going to be the lowest of the four quarters, with respect to those names.", "So, we're still tracking that. There are other variables obviously, that affect the zone, normal names as well, but for advertising names specifically, the advertising names that we believe were affected by the Google AdSense program; that's the way it still looks to us.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then my second question in terms of operating margins you guys showed very nice improvement last year, even without divesting any of the larger businesses. With the 35% plus guidance this year, you're basically modeling flat operating margins. Should we assume that shared services or margin improvement is totally dependent now on the divestures or is there an opportunity here to take the core business to a more profitable level without the divestures?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, Todd, this is Jim, again. I'll let Brian give you a more detailed answer, but let me give you an overview, higher level answer. One of the things that we did around the third quarter of last year is we sort of realigned along business units.", "There are many benefits associated with that realignment, as opposed to a restructuring; its realignment. And some of the benefits, besides giving us better focus in the core businesses, is that it allowed us to begin identifying those shared services costs that are uniquely associated with one of the business units and move them in.", "Specifically, we did that so that we could, in fact, get ahead of it in that prior to completing the divestiture process. So, the big picture is that, I think we did some things that positioned us to identify and start optimizing shared services prior to actually getting the divestures complete. There is a lot of other heavy listing that goes on in our financial planning. I'll let Brian talk about.", "Brian Robins", "Yeah. That's right, Jim. Hey, Todd, this is Brian. As Jim alluded to, we did do a divide and focus strategy where we broke out the divest business and then operating them on a standalone basis. That enabled us to hit our operating margin a quarter early, despite not completing the divestitures.", "As we gave you updated guidance for the end of the year as a lower part of the range. We aren't reducing our margin profile. So we're continuing to take cost out of the business to hit that.", "On the shared services side, the remaining cost that we talked about last time that will be to reach once the divestitures are completed are mostly in the data center, but most of the various costs around the company that you're alluding to; we've aggressively taken those out over the last couple of quarters.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Why won't we see operating margins improve as pricing rolls into the DNS side of the business?", "Jim Bidzos", "Why wouldn't you see operating margins improve, you\u2019ll see pricing roll into the DNS.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Yes. As the price increases actually started flowing through the P&L, why don't your margins try and expand?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yes. You actually got a mix on revenue, because you have revenue shifting down and then, we're also investing heavily into our infrastructure and the security of the business, and so you know that we invested a lot of money into Titan, where you got a new data center rolling on the last time I talked about our ITN fees going up. There are a lot of one-time fees that we didn't have in 2008 that we're going to have in 2009. In order to achieve those margins we're continuing taking costs out of the business to stay at 35%.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "", "Thank you, we'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Yes. Thanks. I just want to clarify your comment about the 2009 growth, and updating what you said last quarter; I think last quarter you said growth in '09 would be less than '08, but still be double-digits. Is that what you're still saying or you're just saying that its closer to the low end of the double-digit meaning closer to the 10% than something higher?", "Jim Bidzos", "I think we're saying both the things you just said.", "Brian Robins", "That's correct, Sterling.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Okay. On the gross margins in the quarter, looking at the gross margins both sequentially and the trend line, was there impact there because of the AUR and SSL or just give us more color as to what happened in the gross margins for the quarter?", "Brian Robins", "Yes. Great question, Sterling. This is Brian. We had a short-term SOW, where we actually incurred $4 million of cost of revenue greater than previous quarters, which actually impacted our growth margins. Additionally, the data center coming online increased by about $1 million, and then there was some FX exchange relative to our VeriSign's Japan subsidiary.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "Okay. And the last question, I wasn't clear. Jim, as you're talking about the divestures, I just want to make sure I understand. As you think about the three bundles that were there and looking at the announcement from today on the 3United. Are you now saying that you're willing to kind of breakup those bundles to get the divestures done and behind you rather than kind of doing the three big bundle type of sale strategy that you had before?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, Sterling, I wouldn't go as far as to say it was our intention to demonstrate or send a message that we're willing to do that. I think it does say, however, that we are willing to be flexible that we're very determined and I'm personally very focused as is Mark, as is Brian on getting the divestures done. If it makes sense and it doesn't affect the integrity of the bundle, in fact, as Mark was involved in designing it, as was myself and some other folks about a year and a half ago.", "That was a carefully designed bundle to maintain a certain amount of integrity and sort of sensible approach to the market. So to the extent that it doesn't negatively impact that design, I am sure, I think we would be willing to do those sorts of things, in order to move some of these businesses and the associated expense.", "Brian Robins", "Sterling this is Brain. On top of that, I think, it just shows the commitment to our strategy to move forward with the divestures.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan", "All right, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, we'll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Hi, guys. Just want to touch on the SSL business. I think you mentioned that you could potentially see revenue get into the single-digit range. Just wondering, if you could discuss what your sort of expectation is for, maybe, growth in that base, but then also, just ASPs going forward.", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, let me tell you. In the same quarter last year we were talking about 13% unit growth and 9% revenue growth. So in a sense our revenue growth is single-digit technically.", "I think we're seeing in that business, pretty much what we described and we're not really reading anything more into the numbers. We are the largest market shareholder in the high-end. We are the largest owner of revenue in that market. The room that we have to grow is in the lower-end of the market and we see that with the much higher growth rate associated with GeoTrust Certificate.", "So I think for that reason, as we continue to gain market share at low-end. I think you can expect to see the AURs drop. And we're talking about barely over 1% as, for example, a drop of $251 to $248 this quarter. Pretty consistent with I believe a $3 drop that we had last in the prior quarter.", "So those numbers, to us are not surprising at all. They're entirely consistent with what see when we put the individual growth rates of the various brands under a magnifying glass. So we see the market growing and I think it's generally the macroeconomic conditions that are causing people to sort of be more careful, more growth on the low end, a little bit of slowing of EV adoption. I think there is really not much more to it then those things that we observe.", "Ken Bond", "", "Phil, I'd just add one another thing on that high end part of the range; that we have such a strong mark leadership position there that we're somewhat constrained in that our growth there somewhat of a function of the segment growth itself.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "And also, just very quickly, just on the renewal rates, obviously, you've discussed it being negatively impacted by online driven; but also just macro? In the previous cycle it got down into the 50s and even at one point touching the 40s. What\u2019s different about this cycle than the last and where would you expect renewal rates to bottom out at?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Hi, this is Mark. I don't think we see anything near what we saw in the downturn. You said, referring to when the bubble burst, and primarily the reason for that, is back then, what we saw was the business models and the domain name business that weren't yet baked at all, so, there was a tremendous amount of name given away for free by registrars that went into the base with some wild attempts at monetization. When that didn't play out, they deleted them wholesale. So, those sorts of programs haven't existed for years here, so I don't think we would go anywhere near that at all.", "Jim Bidzos", "", "If I can just add to that, too. We mentioned renewal rates basically going from 72% to 70% rounded. I think it would be fair to point out, if we just take the number of one digit to the right of the decimal point, 72 was 71.6 rounded up, and 70 was 70.4 rounded down. So, if the difference appears to be two full percentage points it's actually roughly 1.2.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we'll go to Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "", "Good afternoon, everyone. Just a question on the slowing in the new name ads. How does that impact your decision on price increases; and does that, with the current tough time that we're in, mean there is less inelasticity of demand?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yeah. Hi, Sarah. This is Mark I\u2019ll take that one.", "", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Hi Mark.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Good to talk to you again. We view these things as just completely separate. They are not related, so, from a price increase standpoint, as you know, we have the right to raise prices under the contract and we take a look at that on a one at a time basis at the appropriate time. And we take into account the market conditions around that, primarily related to whether those price increases would have a negative impact on our business either from number the names coming into the system or for other reasons that are broader in the community.", "So, we will take a look at that one at a time and, as far as the impact from that, we hadn't seen an impact in the past from a price increase standpoint in the number of new units coming in today. So I am not sure that that would change in the future.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Sure. Makes sense. Good to have you back as well. Just on the gross margin side benefits, if I could come back just to your comment on that one-off, or kind of temporary impact, of $4 million. Does that fade next quarter, so we go back to gross margins to something more like 78% or does it effectively have an impact through 2009 and kind of fades through the year?", "Mark McLaughlin", "There was a three quarter project that started in 3Q, 4Q was the highest and it will roll-off in Q1. When we gave our guidance before, it was baked into our numbers, and as we gave our guidance it's baked into our 1Q numbers as well.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So that 35% operating margin effectively probably still has a hit of maybe a 100 bps on the gross margin side. Is that the way think about it?", "Mark McLaughlin", "That would be correct.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we'll go to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi. Good afternoon everyone. On the SSL side of the business, can you give us a sense of the renewal rate is or how that's been tracking?", "Mark McLaughlin", "This is Mark. Hi, Rob.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Hi.", "Mark McLaughlin", "On the renewal rates side of the business, we're seeing a slowdown in renewals just like we would see in our naming business, but I think that's no different from the total market we're living in right now.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Any sense of what the magnitude is, Mark, or just where you guys are?", "Ken Bond", "A 50% to 60% kind of range, Rob.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "I'm sorry, Ken?", "Ken Bond", "A 50 percent to 60 percent kind of range.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Is what the renewal rate is?", "Ken Bond", "Yeah.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. And then what's the average life you're seeing right now and how does that compare to the last couple of quarters?", "Ken Bond", "Really, it hasn't changed too much on the average life. Certificates, are right in the range of 16 months, or right above there. It moves a little, like fraction, in a month, but its right around 16.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Cowen and Company.", "Ken Long - Cowen and Company", "Hi guys. This is Ken Long for Walter. Kind of back on the SSL, with AUR going down, is there anything outside of mix that's driving that down, perhaps some pricing pressure from your customers?", "Jim Bidzos", "This is Jim. No. Not that we can see at all. In fact, if you look across the brand, there is actually growth in each of the components and at each segment of the market. It's literally just simply the fact that GeoTrust component is growing much faster than the others. So, there is not a slowdown anywhere, and again, the low end is where we don't have the strong market share that we have in the high end.", "So, there are some competitive pressures out there but the segments are growing and GeoTrust is growing faster. That, I believe, is the sole reason that we can identify that the AURs declined at roughly 1% per quarter that we are seeing in the last couple of quarters.", "Ken Long - Cowen and Company", "And then, I guess, with the low end being, sort of, the fastest growing sector, I mean, you got guys like Go Daddy out there selling them for pretty cheap. Is there anything you guys are doing to try to get a bigger share of the market?", "Mark McLaughlin", "We continue to compete with the brands in the lower end of market as well. You know, we have our blanket brands out that are doing very, very well even on a relative basis to lower end brands of the market.", "Jim Bidzos", "", "I have seen some surveys that say that the low end of the market is growing faster and that competitors are gaining, but, I think some of those surveys you have to be careful about some of the data that comes out of them. Most of them look at public-facing certificates not certificates behind the firewall. There is a huge difference there.", "Ken Long - Cowen and Company", "Yeah, of course. Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). ", "We'll go next to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "", "Hi, onto the domain name side; I would just like to get some color on your decision to no longer break out the online names. It seems that you benefit by segregating it. You can see that your traditional business grow maybe 16% in units in this recent quarter if you would take the drag off, I was just wondering what some of the thinking is behind that? ", "Mark McLaughlin ", "", "Just as a percentage of the base? This is Mark, sorry. Just a percentage of the base, looking at about 7% today, and that will be certainly sub 5%, we believe, by mid-year and maybe even lower after that. So, it's just not a significant portion of the business. If that changed, we would be back to talking about it, but there is really no reason to deal with those kinds of numbers.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Brian, a couple of questions for you. Cash flow from operations has been running about $100 million a quarter. Is that still a reasonable expectation for us in 2009? And can you offer any insight into what capital expenditures might be in 2009? Thanks.", "Brian Robins", "Yes, this is Brian. Cash flow from operations, $100 million, a little north of a $100 million, I would say, and then from a capital perspective what we said before, it's still consistent with about 8% to 10% of revenue.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "", "Hi. Good afternoon. I think you gave some color on domain name growth and the adjusted zone for March. How can you be sure that won't be down; that domain names won't be down quarter-on-quarter? What gives that comfort?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Hi, this is Mark. A mix of things. The base itself generally consists of two things. One, is the number of new names coming in the system, and then the second, is the renewal rate of the names in the system itself. So, when we look at the analysis on both of those from a new name perspective, what our data would show us is Q1 being the strongest quarter generally in the year, plus the renewal rates, given what we said earlier, in the 70%, plus or minus two percent points on the high side of that. You take and mix that math and it looks like the base would not be going backwards.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay, fair enough. And then on the divestures; are there any financing issues or lack of interest because it seems like if there aren't, and you said in the past it hasn't been the case, isn't it just a question of you guys accepting a lower price and just kind of being done with it?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, that's certainly a component. I don't think it's quite as simple as you make it out. We've had strategic buyers for whom the businesses make a lot of sense. In one case, in the case of one bundle, we have a buyer engaged. The sole issue there is financing. There's been progress at a snail's pace and I think that's just simply a function of the economy. The credit markets are frozen and it's really very difficult; very few deals are getting done. So that's one example.", "In other cases, we have buyers, we are engaged. There are some discussions about price. Let me put it this way, if price were the only issue, I think we would have sold these businesses by now. We are moving slower. We're revisiting the process with the sort of strategy of how we're approaching selling and divest business and we're exploring some new ideas, but our commitment to move the businesses out hasn't changed, and I'm reaffirming that commitment now that we will sell those businesses.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay. Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Garrett Bekker of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Garrett Bekker - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good afternoon, Jim, you had talked about some new services in the past around the DNS business, so, just wondering if you could give us an update on the status of those and where you're at with that?", "", "Jim Bidzos", "", "Sure. We actually rolled out into beta something called VIDN, VeriSign Internet Defense Network. This is something we talked about several times that is of particular interest to large organizations, registrars, others who occupy certain issues in the operation of the internet. This is where, essentially, we can use the expertise that we've developed in understanding how attacks are mounted against our network and to share that expertise and provide that capability to others who operate in an environment where uptime is important, obviously, financial institutions and other folks, who provide online services. So, there's I think a very good example.", "We've talked also about data analytics. That's something that we're looking at and working on. Part of the benefit of having Mark come back, after having been with the company for a while, is that a lot of those projects that didn't get funded because resources were going more towards acquisitions at the time, we are reviewing a number of those. We have opportunities that we're looking at. We continue to invest in project Titan, as well, obviously.", "But I point out VIDN is something that's out of the door now in beta, physically at customers, very good response, totally new offering. Simply a result of the fact that a lot of what VeriSign does cannot be supported by off-the-shelf products for the enterprise and we have to develop it ourselves and that, of course, creates opportunities that we can leverage and that's the best example I can give you.", "Garrett Bekker - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, that's helpful. Maybe just one follow-up on the SSL side as well. Apparently there is a security issue related to the MD5 hashing algorithm on the RapidSSL search. Just maybe could you speak to that a little bit, and did that have any impact to the SSL business in 4Q?", "Jim Bidzos", "Now, going backwards, the answer is no. It didn't have any impact on the business that was not unknown and anticipated. We actually were well on top of that. For those out there who don't know, MD5 is a component algorithm that is part of the algorithm suite that's employed to produce a thing called a digital signature. All of these algorithms were developed primarily by RSA, a company that ran in the 80's and 90's, and we knew that MD5 was basically getting long in its shoes. We were well into a process of basically updating the systems and moving beyond it, and so, we were actually on top of it when the researchers who we know very well and know exactly what they were doing,  they exploited one small known weakness and, basically, developed a way by which they could sort of crack one digital signature by getting a huge computing resource to work for several months all at once. And so, long before this was ever turned into anything that could be exploited, we'd essentially rendered the issue moot by replacing the systems in the field. We were ahead of that one.", "Garrett Bekker - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And what's the process for customers who had some of those certificates to maybe switchover?", "Jim Bidzos", "We issue new certificates to them.", "Garrett Bekker - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you, we'll take our next question from Rob Sanderson with Broadpoint.AmTech.", "Rob Sanderson - Broadpoint.AmTech", "Yeah, thank you. Lots of the questions have been answered. Thanks for that. One question that we haven't talked about is your appetite for share re-purchase. I think you left the last quarter with around 950 million remaining on an authorization, picked up a couple of million here this quarter. But what's the current thinking on share re-purchase given the blooming macro environment that you're describing?", "Jim Bidzos", "I think, like everybody else has done, we're taking a cautious view. We think that our balance sheet is one of our great assets as I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier. I think it's just one of our great strengths that, while some companies, many companies, are struggling to survive, taking desperate measures in order to do that, they have no capital with which to grow or invest and we have quite a bit of it.", "So certainly in a market condition where cash is king, we want to be cautious about that, but I also want to underscore our commitment to returning shareholder value in a way that makes the most sense. I think, as you pointed out, the fact that we were buying back in Q4, I think, speaks volumes about that.", "I don't know what the statistics are, but I would venture to guess that not too many companies were buying their shares back in Q4, but we're still committed to returning shareholder values in the best way. Just given the environment, we are more cautious and certainly want to make sure that's the best use of our cash.", "Rob Sanderson - Broadpoint.AmTech", "", "Is it fair to think that as you progress through the year and, at some point hopefully, we start to see a light at end of the tunnel, can we expect you to start becoming more aggressive? If you could just sort of frame the shape of a macro recovery?", "Jim Bidzos", "", "Well, I don't think I want to speculate about what we'll do when and if things turn better this year, certainly the forecast I've seen and the comments I've seen and economists seem to indicate that most people, the consensus seems to be that we, haven't hit the bottom yet and we're not likely to get our way out of this year, but I would love to be wrong about that. I don't want to speculate about what we'll do differently, we're certainly well positioned.", "We did end the year with over $800 million in cash. We actually crossed over $1 billion just recently. So, again I think, that that sort of strength in the balance sheet is a tremendous asset, especially, as I said, if this downturn becomes an extended one.", "If this continues well into 2010, I think that the debt cash is going to be a powerful asset, a powerful weapon for us. We can continue to invest in growth. We can continue to pursue these new opportunities in the core adjacencies. We don't have to raise a penny to do it. We can do pretty much everything we wanted to do, that we set out to do. We talked about achieving operating margin goals, et cetera.", "We have been able to do that without even completing the divestures. So, I'm just reluctant to say what we would do if everything turned around and we sold the divest companies and we were in a different position. Certainly we'd have a wonderful range of options to choose from then, but we earn without options today.", "Rob Sanderson - Broadpoint.AmTech", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And, we'll take our final question from Fred Ziegel with Mackinac Research.", "Fred Ziegel - Mackinac Research", "Hi, everybody. Jim, I guess a framework question around the PKI WiMAX opportunity. How do you think about that or how should we think about that. I know it's obviously a very early on market, but what do you think the opportunity is there?", "Jim Bidzos", "I'm glad you asked that question. I'm actually excited and proud of the fact we were selected to provide CA services to that community. Long ago when this company was founded, the idea, the vision, was to build a company that provided trusted third party services, that as people started to set up networks, intranets, ad hoc networks, specialized networks, public networks, where security would be crucially important, and here wireless, obviously, is an excellent example of that, that they would basically come to the logical choice, which is a trusted third party, whose existence depends on its ability to successfully operate a CA in a very trusted, capable way.", "And, I think our long history of having done that for 14 years, of having operated the security infrastructure for e-commerce, for example, very successfully, is probably something that weighed very heavily in their decision to do it.", "So, I hope that this is the beginning of other operations and other projects that start to secure the broad public network. The internet, its components and parts of it and when those people realize that they need certificate services and they need certificate authority to provide them, that's what we're here for. So, I'm really encouraged and excited about it.", "Fred Ziegel - Mackinac Research", "So, in terms of WiMAX specifically, would you be partnering with people like Clearwire and the DeviceGuys or is it something that a WiMAX customer would load separately. And, I guess the second question is, to the extent that there's an Obama broadband initiative, how do you think you plan that?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well maybe I can just offer up a short example. So, back in the 90\u2019s, in the early 90\u2019s, around 1993 and 1994. We worked with a number of set-top manufacturers to develop a standard or, so called, key management. They wanted to secure the content that they delivered.", "In fact, a lot of people have a set-top box on top of their TV today that allows them to receive content and other services that's secured. That protects everyone, it protects the content providers; it protects the service provider.", "In a very similar way WiMAX, I think, will. That was a model for WiMAX. So the user doesn't see it. It's really transparent. Security succeeds when it's transparent, absolutely secure and the user doesn't even see the costs. It's built into the systems they're receiving. So, I think of that as a model, and again, I think VeriSign is the company that has the means, the network, the experience, the trust as a third party to these various vendors.", "So, WiMAX is just an example of a standard that develops, that requires, the use of encryption. You have got to manage the keys; you've got to manage trust and integrity in that network. And we're just basically a service provider who is invisible to the end user, but we provide a critical component. It couldn't work without somebody playing that role.", "Operator", "Thank you and with that I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Ken Bond for any additional or closing comments.", "Ken Bond", "Thank you, operator. We anticipate our next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our first quarter 2009 results, will be held on Thursday, May 7th at 2 PM. Pacific time. We expect to provide final confirmation of this date on April 1st, the first business day after the close of quarter.", "I would also like to remind you that in light of regulation; FD, VeriSign plans to retain its long standing policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions.

Baird", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Morgan", "Operator", "Good day, everyone and welcome to the VeriSign Incorporated first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Today's conference is being recorded.", "At this time for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I am Nancy Fazioli of Investor Relations. I'm here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and Interim CEO of VeriSign; along with President and Chief Operating Officer, Mark McLaughlin; and Brian Robins, our acting Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, located at investor.verisign.com. Please refer to our website for important information including the Q1 2009 earnings press release and the reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP information.", "A replay of this call will be available on our website within a few hours. Today's slide presentation will also be available for download after the call. Financial results in today's press release are unaudited and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we will discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC.", "Specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "In conformity with the adoption of FAS 160, net income, now includes income attributable to non-controlling interest. References made to net income or loss attributable to VeriSign Inc and subsidiaries whenever we use the term net income or loss, this also applies to earnings per share.", "Additionally financial results in today's press release and the matters we will be discussing today include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. Our non-GAAP income statement and description of items excluded from our non-GAAP financial information are on the Investor Relations website.", "In a moment Jim, Mark and Brian will provide some prepared remarks and after which we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that I'd like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks Nancy and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. I'm pleased to report that VeriSign delivered a very solid quarter on the top and bottom-line. This is particularly gratifying given the ongoing macroeconomic environment and these positive results are a testament of the continued focus of our employees, including those in businesses targeted for divestiture.", "VeriSign holds the unique and central position in the internet ecosystem and we believe our business model has enabled our global team drive strong results. Our Q1 results demonstrate that we delivered on the goals we laid out.", "In the first quarter we delivered revenue in core businesses of $252 million. We also saw improvements in our non-GAAP core operating margins. Non-GAAP earning per share was $0.32, $0.01 of EPS attributable to a one-time benefit to other income spending from an acquisition termination fee. Excluding this one-time event we saw 48% EPS growth year-over-year, very strong results.", "On the P&L there were some unexpected events that occurred in Q1 that contributed to the quarter being slightly better than we planned including some favorable events on the expense side that Brian will highlight further for you.", "Our balance sheet continues to be a growing area of strength for the company. VeriSign's cash position remains strong as we ended the quarter with nearly $950 million of cash. As a -*parenthetical comment today our cash position is 1.291.", "On the divestiture front, we are pleased to note that TNS acquisition of our Communications business closed May 1 and that RTP, a Real-Time Publisher Services closed on May 5. In addition, VeriSign has entered into an exclusive letter of intent to sell MSS, subject to an agreement on final terms and conditions.", "The MSS business represents 65% of Q1 2009 revenues of the Enterprise Security Services or ESS bundle. In the first quarter we unbundled ESS into MSS global security consulting, iDefense, which as Mark will discuss later, we have decided to retain as part of our naming.", "When we first implemented our divestiture plans to-date, we have sold 10 businesses of the 13 that we're currently holding for sale. Collectively the net proceeds from these sales, including the sale of remaining interest of the Jamba joint venture was approximately $540 million.", "I would like to reaffirm that the Board and our executive leadership team is committed to completing the divestitures of our non-core businesses and continued to protect our core franchises of SSL investing in our core identity and authentication businesses as we firmly believe that this is a strategy that will best enable us to create shareholder value in the long-term.", "I'll note that comments and feedback from customers and partners globally indicate that our leadership in solutions are needed now more than ever. We believe that the need for our services remains strong despite macro challenges to the economy that may have dampened over.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark who will go into our business results a bit more for you. Brian, will then provide detailed review of the financials and I'll conclude with brief outlook. Mark.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Thanks, Jim and good afternoon. I would like to echo Jim's thanks to the employees across the company for the performance this quarter. We have a great team committed to winning and it's a pleasure to be back with this team. As Jim mentioned, we had a solid quarter in the phase of the tough economy.", "Before drilling down into the quarter I wanted to note that as you saw in our press release and as Jim mentioned our quarterly revenue includes iDefense which was previously classified as a discontinued operation and will now be included as part of naming services.", "iDefense provides information, security, threat intelligence which has been a valuable resource for our naming business, as we continue to counter threat to the DNS. In addition, many government agencies that we interact with in our DNS operations are customers of the iDefense Services. We therefore concluded that this asset provides strategic value, and we're retaining it as part of the naming business.", "Now let me get into the business unit operating results for the quarter. In our naming business we saw better than expected growth with the adjusted zone for registered names in dot-com and dot-net, totaling 92.4 million names at the end of the quarter. This was an increase of 2 million net names added to the adjusted zone quarter-over-quarter and 9% increase year-over-year.", "In total in the quarter, we processed 7.3 million domain name registration during this quarter compared with 7.8 million names during Q1, 2008.", "On the renewal rate side, as you may recall, the renewal rate for Q4, 2008, bounded down to 70% which was down from 72% in Q3 2008. This declines been largely from non-renewal of domain names registered for the purpose of monetizing online advertising traffic. While renewal rates are not fully determinable until 45 days at the end of the quarter we believe for Q1 2009 the renewal rate will be between 70% and 71%.", "Last quarter our tone was cautious regarding the Q1 outlook. We felt this was prudent given the economy and our view on overall market dynamics. Our view on that has not changed. On the naming side we were pleased to see better than expected growth in the quarter and believe it is due to a number of factors including seasonality, as the first quarter is typically the strongest quarter for this business.", "In addition to strong seasonality during the quarter, we saw new unit promotion programs, international growth, and some strains from domain names being registered for the purpose of online advertising in advance of the April implementation, ITN's policy regarding use of the add grade period for registration deletion.", "On the infrastructure side, we were able to reduce the average daily peak loads by more than 10% through the use our enhanced security and monitoring tools. Even in the phase of growing daily average DNS request. Our average daily query load has increased from 35 billion to 38 billion per day.", "To handle these increases we continue to invest in the DNS, in order to optimally manage the increase in traffic on the internet. We're committed to investing in critical project in infrastructure to maintain a record of 100% uptime over the last 11 years, making us one of the most reliable and trusted networks in the world.", "Now moving on to authentication services, the business unit that includes both our business authentication or SSL services, and user authentication or IAS. In the SSL business we saw the installed base of Certificates increased to 1.15 million certificates, compared to 1.12 million last year and approximately 1 million in Q1 2008. This represents a 13% year-over-year growth in the base.", "The annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the installed base of VeriSign's, GeoTrust and broad branded certificates was $244 for the quarter compared to $248 last quarter. As we've seen in the past the AUR decline this quarter is primarily due to the product mix shift. We continue to see the lower end of the market grow faster than the high-end and our GeoTrust brands continues to grow faster than our overall portfolio as we participate in the high growth segment of the market.", "At the highest end of our offerings, while still a small portion of our SSL business, extended validation or ED certificate sales were strong as we continued the trend of more than doubling the units sold a year ago. We remain the market share leader for ED certificates.", "Finally within our IAS business we have now distributed over 2.3 million credentials as part of the VIP and one-time password program. In the first quarter, we released the iPhone version of our mobile one-time password now available on more than 100 mobile phone models. We're seeing increased interest and stronger authentication as foreign factors become more convenient across this effort.", "Now to give you a sense of what we expect as we move forward. Our continued focus in the naming business is on channel expansion, growth in our international footprint, and the introduction of new services. Our SSL business we are focused on up selling the base, driving sales at the low-end and leveraging the brand. In general, we remain committed to implementing plans to continue to improve operating leverage as we grow the business.", "While there are some reports that the economic environment has a glimmer of stabilization, it is too early to tell what the future may hold. In addition, to staying in close touch with our customers, things we look at when building our forecast, include the projected growth in online advertising and eCommerce growth. While we expected both of these categories will show continued growth in 2009, it should be no surprise that any growth will be at its lower rate than previous years.", "With that in mind for the second quarter, we believe the naming base will grow by 1 million to 1.5 million names and that renewal rates will stay within the historical range of 70% to 71%. We continue to watch the impact of the structural changes in the business related to online advertising, most notably as it relates to our renewal base of business.", "On the SSL side of our business, we are watchful of customer behaviors in this economic environment, which has resulted in us seeing customers renew later than usual and increasingly request discounts and price reductions as well as taking deals to RFP.", "In summary, our core business performed well in the first quarter. With our strong market position, great team, well recognized and regarded brand and our disciplined approach, we remain confident in our ability to maintain continued progress in our business in both the short-term and over the long-term.", "Thanks for your attention and now I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian?", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Mark and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. As Jim and Mark have both discussed, we are proud of the progress that we made in Q1, particularly in light of uncertain macroeconomic headwinds that we faced coming into the quarter. This has been and still is unchartered territory for all of us.", "Before I jump into a more detailed discussion of first quarter results I like to briefly discuss the housekeeping item. As we discussed last quarter, beginning with Q1 we've adopted a more rigorous view of what is excluded as non-GAAP item in order to improve the quality of our earnings. Our description of items excluded from our non-GAAP financial information is available in our press release.", "As of this quarter, gains and losses on derivatives, and macro investments, impairment of property, plant and equipment, and non-recurring costs are no longer excluded. The 2008 non-GAAP reconciliation has been restated for this change. This inclusion of iDefense and the adoption of new accounting standard FSP, ABP 14-1 related to do accounting for our convertible debt instrument is now posted on Investor Relations website at investor.veriSign.com.", "We will be holding our 2009 Analysts Day on November 19th in New York City. Additional details will be forthcoming, but please mark your calendars. We look forward to this event and hope to see many of you then.", "Moving now to a more detailed discussion of results for our core businesses. Revenue for our core businesses came in slightly above our guidance at $252 million up 2% sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. As we noted in our press release, iDefense contributed $3 million to the quarter and is included in naming services. We expect iDefense to contribute approximately $10 million in revenue to 2009.", "Revenue growth in Q1 was largely driven by performance in naming, which was up 17% year-over-year, authentication services revenue which includes SSL, VSJ and IAS was up 8% year-over-year. As noted previously, we exited Q1 with non-GAAP cooperating margin of 36.9%, which was above our internal expectations.", "Factors in Q1 contributing to lower expenses in plan, include lower labor costs and expense reductions related to the implementation of smart spending programs. Expense savings include a slower pace of hiring, more judicious use of outside labor and travel savings.", "Where as the operating income line, we incurred a loss of approximately $5 million for our core operations, this was less than we expected due to a termination fee of $3 million from an acquisition received during the quarter. Due to adoption of SSP, APB 14-1 we expect future quarters to be a loss of approximately $9 million per quarter.", "Non-GAAP core net income for the first quarter was $61 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32. The diluted share account used in the EPS calculations was 193 million shares from approximately 194 million shares last quarter.", "Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet items. Operating cash flow is approximately $38 million and free cash flow is $17 million. Q1 is seasonally low due to the payment of accrued employee bonuses. Consolidated capital expenditures for this quarter were $21 million. Capital spend continues to be related to the expansion and optimization of our infrastructure.", "We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with ending cash and cash equivalence of $944 million, up approximately $153 million from last quarter. During the quarter, we received distributions from the reserve funds of approximately $94 million. There remains $56 million from the reserve funds as currently classified in other current assets.", "Net DSO for the first quarter was 31 days, down 4 days from last quarter stemming from strong collection efforts. Deferred revenue from continuing operations ended the quarter at $872 million, up $27 million, or 3% from last quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,200 employees, down 100 from last quarter largely due to planned head count reductions.", "With the sale of Communication Services, International Clearing, and Real-Time Publisher Services are currently at approximately 2,800 employees. As previously discussed, head count will continue to decline with the sale of non-core businesses and further reduction in shared services head count.", "Our divide and focus approach continues to pay off as a non-core businesses that remain, as well as those that are in the process of being sold, again delivered solid results.", "In summary, we're pleased with our results given the continued challenging economic environment. We delivered double-digit revenue growth, as well as, strong earnings growth this quarter. Although, we benefited on the bottom-line from some favorable events, on the whole our performance speaks for the strength and durability of our business model.", "As we have noted, 2009 will continue to be challenging, but we will also continue to exercise financial and operational discipline in results.", "Moving on to our outlook. Q1 historically is a seasonally strong quarter. For Q2 we expect revenue for the core businesses will be flat to slightly up from Q1. As we look at 2009, we remain cautious in this environment. As we previously discussed our 2009 revenue being at the low-end of our original double-digit range, with the addition of iDefense revenue, we believe that this target is still achievable.", "Without iDefense there are a few factors that could impact our ability to hit this target by a couple of percentage points, specifically, those are swings in FX rate, the global economy, especially in Japan. As context on FX, note there have been fairly dramatic swings in FX rates over the last four months based on economic environment. The dollar has strengthened against the yen and euro by about 10% and 5% respectively from plan rates.", "We expect this to result in $2 to $3 million impact to revenue in the second quarter and possibly by similar amounts in the second half. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin is forecasted to be inline with the first quarter. Given the uncertainties that remain with regard to the economy, we will continue to take a conservative approach to cash in the near-term.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim. Jim?", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks, Brian. 2009 is off to a solid start for VeriSign, demonstrating strong execution in the tough environment. Our strategy is the right one and we believe that the results demonstrate that. While it's easy to get caught up in the details of quarterly earnings I think it's also important to step back and remember what a unique company VeriSign is, as well as, the important foundation that we provide for internet economy.", "We believe our business model puts us in a unique position in the industry and that combination of business model and strategic position has enabled us to deliver revenue growth, margin expansion and strong profitability in this economy.", "Additionally, our balance sheet is very healthy and this allows us to aggressively protect and grow our business in this environment, while maintaining flexibility to pursue opportunities prudently. While 2009 will be a year of challenges and opportunities, we are excited about VeriSign's role and potential as the most trusted provider of internet infrastructure services now and for many years to come.", "We would now like to open the call for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We'll have our first question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "I just wanted to chat a little bit more just on margins you mentioned a flat margin quarter-to-quarter in Q2. Mark, when you kind of just look longer term at the company, I would say some of the macro dynamics have changed. But any sort of change in your opinion what the longer term margin targets are?", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks, Phil. On the longer term basis I think, as I think I mentioned on the last call, we think we could maintain the margins that we're looking at now with possible slight improvement. Factors that go into that are the amount of revenue, continued leverage as we divest the remaining businesses and then some of the programs we have in place to reduce expenses. Those are counter balanced by investments in the infrastructure. We've made some investments in the talent in the people, as well as some product investment.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Then also when you look at SSL business, you mentioned that greater mix shift towards the low-end. When you look at this year, what are you expectations when you think about pricing? Should that continue over the course of the year?", "Jim Bidzos", "I would expect that the mix shift that we're seeing will continue, the low-end of the market is growing faster than the high-end of the market and there is no reason to believe that that's going to change. As far as from AUR standpoint, I think if we look back a few quarters and see the percent declines we see in AUR, that I would expect that could continue for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "If we look at the 2 million net add number on the DNS side, you guys get some demand stimulation in the quarter. When you think about Q2 and guidance of $1 to $1.5 million, are you guys going to repeat some of those demand stimulation programs? Can you give us a sense in terms of the impact of the, ICANN change was in terms of tasting and, that kind of, you mentioned you saw some low-end momentum in Q1, some advertising momentum, sorry?", "Jim Bidzos", "Todd, so a few things there. We did better than we thought and we think it's related to those items. It's not just Todd to review the programs it's the industry-wide. We will continue to do programs, at least for a couple months in this quarter. From what we hear from the industry, a number of the registrars will continue to run programs, as well, but it's not certain as to whether they would do that for the entire quarter or not.", "So it's very difficult to tell how much of the new units from the first quarter are directly related to those kind of programs. So that's just tough to break that out. We did see, particularly as we got closer to April 1, some run-up on new names that we believe are the impact of that is because of the implementation of the PBC non-forgiveness.", "It's hard to say which portion of that is attributable as well. If I had to guess, I would put it in the few hundred thousand sort of category, but that's a difficult thing to do.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Should we be thinking that business is bothering secular bases here in Q2 as we anniversary some of the structural changes?", "Jim Bidzos", "There was two things we had talked about, before structurally. One was the changes that Google particularly made on its programs and I think we've seen the impact of that flow through the system from a new unit basis, and we are continuing to see that slowdown from the renewal basis. It looks like the renewal rates have stabilized and the historical rates like I said is 70% to 71%.", "And then on the other changes that are ICANN related about the restocking fee and the non-forgiveness fee, to the extent we might see impacts from those things other than the run-up of names, it would be the renewal rates, a year or so from today, depending on how those names performed.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sterling Auty with J.P. Morgan.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Jim, I think the comments that you made about being conservative with the cash and being opportunistic, I didn't hear any share repurchase in the quarter. How are you looking at the use of the cash to be opportunistic share repurchase versus acquisition?", "Jim Bidzos", "Our share buyback strategy hasn't changed. We consider that to be a very viable way of returning value to shareholders. We currently have authorization for that $950 million in repurchase. I think given the depth and the continued length of the recession, and the impact that we're seeing from it. I think it's just generally prudent for us to be extremely cautious with cash.", "Having said that, I would add a couple of things. Number one is that we have bought some shares back in every quarter, and that in general our policy has been that we will repurchase at least an amount equal to the [creep], and on an ongoing basis that strategy hasn't changed.", "I would also add that we would be disciplined and opportunistic in any acquisition opportunities. We simply don't see any at this point that would cause us to rethink our view of cash. I would just simply call it one-off caution based on the economic environment, and continuing review of share buyback as a way to return shareholder value.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Can you just review for us the decision process to keep the iDefense part of ESS? And is there any chance that you might keep any of the other disputing [aps] that are still left for sale?", "Jim Bidzos", "I'll turn that over to Mark. I'll just say that, that decision with iDefense was purely strategic, not financial. And the ESS unbundling essentially was a way to help us get to divestiture quicker. Mark?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sterling, I think the short answer is no, we will not keep other portions of the assets. We don't have a plan to do that today. So the iDefense one was one that I got involved in when I got back. I think that's strategic to the Naming business. The two things I mentioned in the prepared remarks are important. Our Naming team uses iDefense services to help them counter the threats we see to the DNS and it seems like it might be able to shortsighted to have to go to market to get those services for that capabilities when we had it in-house.", "And secondly and very importantly, we have a lot of happy customers in the US government who use those services today. And that's closer related from a relationship standpoint to our DNS business, I'd like to continue to maintain good relationships. And the third point is we actually think that there is potential opportunity to grow that business as well which we'll be trying to do.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Sarah Friar, Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk about the pricing on the DNS side? Clearly, I think you've made some comments about wanting to be more careful this year given the macroeconomic environment. But any color on your thoughts about lifting the price overall?", "Mark McLaughlin", "By way of reminder for people who may not know, under a contract we have the ability to take 7% price increases or out of the six years of the agreement for dot-com. So far we've taken two of these increases. And the patentees' have been thoughtful about the timing of the increases, and I think we should be continuing to do so particularly in life as the impact of an increase could have on sales in this weak economy, as well as some uncertainty in the multiple constituencies that are involved in this industry.", "Through the last time we talked as a group, there has been a bit of stabilization in the company but that's hard to say if that's going to last or increase. A few on the uncertainties in the constituency side have been answered by fair to say, newly confirmed Secretary of Commerce, Gary Locke, as of just about two weeks ago.", "And a nominated, but not yet semi-confirmed Head of NTIA, Larry Strickland coming out of the SEC. Hard to say when he will be confirmed. There is still not yet an announced new CEO of ICANN, I don't expect to see that probably at a minimum until the next ICANN meeting in June.", "While we take numerous items into consideration we think through timing and we're going to continue to do that.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "I think you have to give us six months update, normally you've upped the prices historically in the fall. It seems like right now we could think it's going to get pushed out a little bit from there. Is that fair?", "Mark McLaughlin", "We have to give a six months notice period to increasing the prices to the extent that to make a pattern we'd noticed two previous ones in the spring time and taken the increases in the fall, but there is no rule about that.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "And Mark, just a follow-up for you, coming back into the fold, I know you had a lot of ideas about what could be done on the registry side of the business, new business creation there. Any update on something's that you're particularly excited about as you've come back and looked at what's there for you to do?", "Mark McLaughlin", "There are a couple of things, Sarah. I want to be careful as I mentioned last so we don't want to talking about things that are too early to talk about. But two that I spent a bit of time or more than a bit of time since I get back on with one business, [VIVN], which is the various sign internet defense network which we've launched in beta. I spent some time with some customers on that and have some positive feedback so far but that doesn't mean that that's going to be a big deal for us. We're trying to be cautious about that as well.", "And the second thing is, really, I think some clever ideas what the team is looking at to do with the dot-name asset that we purchased, particularly, related to tying together SMS and E-mail using a dot-name. And we're invading a few markets with that right now to getting some interesting feedback. But again these are early things for us, so I'd like to hold off on any details in that.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Cowen and Company.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "Mark, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about the puts and takes on the DNS side. Specifically in the past you guys have mentioned the number of new name ads, big kind of a gross number, so if you could give that number? And then just for Brian, in terms of shared services costs, now that you've got some of these divestitures behind you, if you could help quantify, especially on the G&A expense side? How much of that you think you can take out given what's being completed and what's been announced share in terms of the divestitures?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Just make sure I understand. You mean just as far as new registrations and what goes into that?", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "Right. I guess you have some color on the renewal rate being 70% to 71% estimated for the quarter, but just kind of the -- I don't know, help us out a bit with, it sounds like you saw strong new name registration, or stronger new name registrations as well as maybe a bit less churn than expected. Just trying to get a little bit more color around that qualitative commentary.", "Mark McLaughlin", "If you look back over the course of 2008, this quarter we did 7.3 million new registrations and in the fourth quarter of 2008 we did $6.3 million. In the third quarter we did $6.9 million, and in the second quarter we did $7.5 million. So if you charted that out we're roughly back to where we were in the second quarter of 2008, which I think correlates heavily to the end of the economic world as we knew it.", "And whether that's a trend that will continue, I think it definitely depends to some extent on the economy, and like I said the things we watch on eCommerce growth and online advertising. There are lots of conflicting reports about that but I've seen those will be flat to growing in a single-digit. That leaves us to believe, given the results we've seen in the first quarter but they are probably growing in the high single-digits in both of those categories, and we grow kind of closely to that.", "But the three things I'd mentioned to go into that number for the first quarter are better than we expected, where we did see strong international growth. I think we definitely saw units coming from these promotion programs, and we did see a bit of a run-up in front of that PPC non-forgiveness. Does that answer your question?", "Brian Robins", "", "Walter, this is Brian. On the G&A cost, there will not be any direct immediate savings from the divestitures. The two divestitures that we mentioned RTP and VSP were relatively small. On a comps divestiture which is a more larger divestitures, we've been aggressive predivestiture in separating these assets and it's gone to discontinued operations. And so with [com] specifically, that is actually operating over Olympia, Overland Park office which are dedicated facilities.", "With that said, once the TSAs are done and we fully transferred all the technology, there will be some reductions in facilities in data centers and so there will be some opportunity, and so the next two quarters to trim out G&A. We did deliver higher margins this quarter at 36.9% operating, due to some of the efforts that we've put in place over the last couple of quarters.", "Jim Bidzos", "Walter, this is Jim, I'd answer your question about what divestitures remain. I think there is generally very good news on this front. As you know we closed the com business of course, on May 1st and RTP on May 5th. So basically we have two of the three components of the enterprise security bundle that we are not keeping. And as such we mentioned, we have a letter of intent. We are not identifying the parties under nondisclosure. We have the consulting part of the security business. Then we have the messaging bundle that still remains. That is 10 out of 15 that have closed. So, we are pleased with our progress there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Hi, just a quick question on competing certificate services from the registrars. Can you talk about that, how the business model differs and what the value proposition of the customer might be versus yours?", "Mark McLaughlin", "This is Mark. So, let me start with from a registrar standpoint are primarily a channel for certificates and not all registrars offer their own certificates. The most registrars may have tried to sell our certificates. Ones that people know of, our (inaudible) offer their own certificates. They are almost totally at the very low-end of the market and from a differentiation standpoint a lot of that is around price.", "What that really means from a customer standpoint is the level of authentication that is provided for those services and when you get to that very low-end of the market, it is very minimal usually just verifying that the domain name itself. So, it is a minimal level of authentication.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "And then if you can go back to the price increase on dot.com. I heard your answer that about shifting around government officials and that's understandable. But is that what you're looking for the triggers to take this price increase, meaning that they confirm the head of NPIA and (inaudible) as new CEO or are there some other triggers?", "Mark McLaughlin", "There are a lot of factors in this, Katherine, but primarily what we're concerned about is just the economy itself. So, a lot of the discussions we had from the customer standpoint, we have to believe that in this current economy, unless we see some more stability. The price increases could lead to lower demand to differ and people buy less. That is primarily we are looking for a stabilization economy.", "You throw into that mix some uncertainties that exist, because of the new administration. A lot of players that used to be around the table are different or not yet named and how that's received in this economy is something we need to think about.", "Operator", "We will go next to Rob Owens from Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Couple of questions around iDefense. With the incremental revenue contribution, did you break out what the incremental expense was for the quarter as well?", "Brian Robins", "Hey Rob, this is Brian. We actually don't break that out, but what we have committed to in guidance is we will deliver the same profitability.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "So was it at the same type of corporate margin in Q1 or was it additive?", "Brian Robins", "It was absolutely not at the same corporate margin.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "And then second, I think you said core long-term plan is to grow iDefense. Just curious with the 3 million here in the first quarter, why are you only seeing 10 million fort year, where should we see the weakness?", "Brian Robins", "So we didn't put the decimal around, but that is round-up. So if you look throughout the year. Part of the other issue, as well as since we are just integrating that back into VeriSign, when you go with the divestiture, the willingness for customers' assigned new business with you.", "As Mark talked about we are going to integrate that within VeriSign go into the public sector, incorporate into our threat intelligence. So, I think you will see more coming from that in the future.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "And then on your website are you going to give us comparability for iDefense contributed in '08?", "Brian Robins", "It's there [around].", "Operator", "We'll go next to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Maybe I can start with a housekeeping question. Brian, would it be possible to get the revenue dollar break-down between the naming business, the SSL and the IAS businesses?", "James Bidzos", "I could give that to you. In fact and let me, so I'll give you approximate. Naming was approximately 148 million. SSL was about 91 million. And then in IAS, we have talked about is roughly around 12 million. On a go-forward basis, SSL and IAS is the authentication unit, and so those will be combined.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Perfect. And then is there back to the start business, is there anything you are doing from a marketing standpoint or go to market to try to encourage EV adoption? Thanks.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yeah, this is Mark, Steve. We do, do that and the industry does that as well. So, EV is a standard which is good and bad in that as a standard everybody can use it, everybody can adopt it. The bad news around that is, is that as far as putting enough marketing muscle behind it for it to make a difference, it takes quite a bit.", "So, we certainly do our part for that. I'd like to see lots of other people step up to that as well and I think that would help everybody. But we haven't really seen the entire industry particularly in the browser space do that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Scott Sutherland with Wedbush Morgan.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Morgan", "This is Kerry Rice for Scott. Most of my questions have answered, but I wanted to touch on some things that were mentioned earlier. You mentioned, I think a little bit of improvement from that in the domain names from the advertising. And I was curious if you've seen that sustainable here in April and maybe if you can without giving guidance, what you think the impact is there beyond Q2?", "Brian Robins", "Yeah, so what we saw there, I think is a run-up prior to the implementation of this non-forgiveness fee. So, just for people who may not know what that means, as of April 1st, if you were registering domain names using the ad grace period and then returning those domain names, that used to be free, you had five days to do that. It used to be free and that I kind of created this whole PPT industry. Then I can impose what they call a restocking fee of $0.20 for every one of those names. So, that raised the bar on what you have to monetize that name.", "As of April 1st, there was no more forgiveness of the registry fee, which means you had to pay the entire registry fee to keep those names. So, as a matter of monetizing those names, the bar went from zero up to the entire registration fee plus the restocking fee.", "So, people were trying to get in front of the implementation of that, right up through April 1st. Post-April 1st, I don't think we'll see names going into that category unless they can monetize at that rate and if that is the case there is really no difference between those names and what we would call traditional names of the same thing now because, we are costing the same amount of people who are monetizing at the same level.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Morgan", "And for that run-up, and I don't know if you have any statistics on this, but the ones that we are still trying to kind of beat that deadline. Did they generally do the grace period and drop off, or did you see how lot of those retained going in, because of the restocking fee or can you give any insight on that?", "Brian Robins", "Actually I don't know. I don't know that, I can get back to you on that. But we used to see a very, very wide divergence between the number of names that were attempted to register and the number of names that would stick. And that is going down dramatically over the last year to some thing that is fairly negligible. I call it back to normal, but I could check on that.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Morgan", "I'd be curious to see if they kind of retained them or if they just dropped off. And then the final question I have, there has been some discussion out of the EU about pushing ICANN to run independently and not in the US Department of Commerce. Do you have any thoughts on that or comments on that?", "James Bidzos", "So that relates for folks who may not know, there is that contract between ICANN and the Department of Commerce called the JPA, by its terms it is going to expire in September. And that has been the case every year. It is a year-to-year contract.", "There is a lot of discussion about what will happen come September, and there's no specific proposal out there, yet people have all gotten behind ICANN is proposing self-governance, a lot of other people who have proposed different models.", "Recently the commissioner of the EU suggested trading like a super-G12 nations to provide oversight. But that's one of many proposals that have been on the table.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the conference back over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli for any additional or closing remarks.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator. We anticipate that our next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our second quarter 2009 results will be held on Thursday, August 6th at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.", "I would like to remind you that in light of regulation FD, VeriSign claims to retain its long standing policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call.", "Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Miss Nancy Fazioli.  Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator.  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call.  I'm Nancy Fazioli in investor relations and I\u2019m here today with our Executives Jim Bidzos, Mark McLaughlin, and Brian Robins.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from our investor relations website located at investor.verisign.com.  Please refer to our website for important information including the Q2 2009 earnings press release and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP information.  A replay of this call will be available on our website within a few hours.  Today's slide presentation will also be available for download after the call.  ", "Financial results in today's press release are unaudited, and the matters we will be discussing today include forward looking statements, and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements.", "Additionally, financial results in today's press release and the matters we will be discussing today include non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign.  Our non-GAAP income statement and a description of items excluded from our non-GAAP financial information are located on the VeriSign investor relations website.  ", "In a moment, Jim, Mark, and Brian, will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions.  Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.  With that I would like to turn the call over to Jim.  Jim?", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today.  I'm pleased to report that VeriSign met or exceeded the goals that we laid out for you last quarter.  Second revenue in our core businesses was $255 million which represents 9% growth year over year.  ", "Our non-GAAP core operating margin for the quarter was 38.4%. This quarter we again had some favorable events on the revenue and expense side, which Brian will detail for you later.  Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.31, ahead of our internal plan, which represents 29% year-over-year growth.  ", "On the cash side, our year-to-date operating cash flow is approximately $120 million and we have over $1.3 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet.  From a big picture perspective, while there appear to be glimmers of economic improvement, we continue to be concerned about the macroeconomic outlook for the foreseeable future.  We have repurchased over $70 million of stock from the fourth quarter until now and believe that a continued, cautious, disciplined approach to capital management is prudent in this environment.", "Turning to the non-core businesses, we currently have only two of the original 13 businesses, our messaging and our global security consulting businesses remaining for sale.  We completed the sale of Managed Security Services or MSS, in July.  We're continuing to work hard to see this restructuring process through to completion as expeditiously as possible.", "We have made significant progress on the strategy that we laid out for you in November, 2007, showing resolve in a challenging market.  We remain confident that becoming a more focused company is the right strategy to move us forward.  We will continue to protect our core franchises of naming and business authentication or SSL, while prudently investing in growth opportunities that leverage our existing infrastructure.", "Before I conclude my remarks and pass the call over to Mark, I want to address two items.  First, as many of you are aware on June 5th the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an appeal, the May 2007 US District Court dismissal of a case filed against VeriSign by the Coalition for ICANN Transparency, or CFIT.  ", "In the opinion, the case was remanded to the US District Court for the Northern District of California for further proceedings.  On July 2nd, 2009, VeriSign filed in the Ninth Circuit, a petition for rehearing which is pending.  Although we understand that the details of this case are of interest to investors, as a public company we're able to say very little about pending litigation.  We will continue to defend this case vigorously and we remain confident in our position.", "Finally it gives me great pleasure to announce two important and very well deserved executive appointments that were made by the board of directors this week.  Mark McLaughlin has been appointed Chief Executive Officer effective August 17th.  He has also been appointed to the VeriSign Board of Directors.  You've heard me say over the last year that I thought it more important to get the right person for the position of CEO than it was to get someone as soon as possible.  I wanted to ensure that the next leader of VeriSign would be bringing strong technology skills to all of our core businesses, a strong set of values to unify the company, and firm leadership to take us forward.  ", "Mark has proven himself to be that person and more.  Since rejoining the company in January he's demonstrated the kind of leadership needed to help us set a course for the future.  With the opportunities and challenges ahead, I am very confident that Mark is the right person to lead the company forward.", "Also on Tuesday, the board voted to make Brian Robins Chief Financial Officer on a permanent basis.  His appointment is effective immediately.  As you know, Brian has been acting CFO since April of 2008.  We did conduct a search outside the company for a CFO, but during that process it became clear that Brian was not only qualified for the position, but that he had demonstrated the leadership and initiative we were seeking.  The last year has been one of solid execution in financial growth for VeriSign and it simply could not have happened without Brian's leadership, drive, and commitment.", "This will be my last earnings report as VeriSign's CEO, but as I\u2019ve stated over the last year, I will remain very involved as Executive Chairman of VeriSign.  I was named permanently to that position this week and in that capacity I'll focus primarily on strategy, technology, innovation, and research.  I look forward to continuing to work with the management team as we move the company forward.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark.  Mark?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Thanks, Jim.  Good afternoon.  I'm appreciative and excited to have the opportunity to lead the company at this point in our history.  I'm confident in our ability to show continued leadership in our core businesses as well as move forward in a disciplined manner.  It's a privilege to be part of such a critical function of the Internet infrastructure and to work with such a talented team.  I'd like to thank that team for the continued hard work that produced another strong quarter.", "And turning to the business unit operating results for the quarter I\u2019ll start with naming.  In our naming business, the adjusted zone for registered name in .com and .net totalled 93.5 million names at the end of the quarter.  This is an increase of 1.1 million net names added to the adjusted zone quarter over quarter and a 7% increase in net names year over year.  In the second quarter we processed 7 million new domain name registrations compared with 7.3 million names in Q1, 2009.  And looking at renewal rates you may recall that the renewal rate for Q1 rounded up to 71%, which is up from 70% in Q4, 2008.  While renewal rates are not fully determinable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate will be between 70%-71% for the second quarter.", "As we look forward to the third quarter, which traditionally is a low seasonality quarter, we believe that the adjusted zone for the naming base will grow by a net change of 900,000 to 1.2 million names and that the renewal rates will be between 70%-71%.", "On the infrastructure side of the naming business, our average daily query load during the quarter increased from 38 billion to 49 billion per day.  Despite the increased load, this quarter we again maintained our record of 100% uptime which allows us to continue to provide best in breed services for .com and .net  We believe this demonstrates operational excellence and is a primary reason that the world looks to us to run this important asset.", "As the Internet evolves, so does the sophistication of attacks on the network, as several recent well-publicized cyber techs demonstrate.  Continued investment in DNS is essential in order for VeriSign to handle this growing complexity associated with continued Internet adoption, geographic expansion, as well the increasing number of directed attacks on our network.", "As we approach 2010 we are on track to have more than 100 points of presence capable of handling over 4 trillion interactions per day, and we are hard at work planning for future requirements as we aspire to continued operational excellence.", "Now moving onto authentication services, in business authentication or SSL, we saw the installed base of certificates increase to 1.17 million certificates n the second quarter compared to 1.15 million last quarter and approximately 1.05 million in Q2, 2008.  This represents an 11% year-over-year growth in the base.  The installed base of extended validation or EV certificates continue to trend at more than doubling during the quarter and we remained the market leader share for EV.", "The adjusted annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the installed base of VeriSign, GeoTrust, and Thawte branded certificates for the second quarter was $241 which compares to $244 for the last quarter.  We continue to see the lower end of the market growing faster on a unit basis in the high end.", "Given this mix shift, our GeoTrust brand continues to grow faster than our overall portfolio.  In addition, at the higher end brand segment of the market we continue to see some of our customers in this economy carefully managing their inventory certificates, as well as requesting discounts and price reductions.  These dynamics are likely to continue to lead to similar AUR declines for the foreseeable future.", "Finally, in our user authentication business or IAS, we have distributed over 2.4 million credentials as part of the zip and one-time password or OTP programs.  This includes approximately 35,000 downloads of our mobile OTP application for smart phones that we introduced last quarter.  ", "On the infrastructure side of the authentication business during the first quarter we reported a new milestone of over 1 billion certificate checks a day.  This milestone underscores our ability to meet the increasing scalability requirements of Internet commerce as more people transact online with sites secured by VeriSign, than with any other certificate authority.", "In summary, our business performed well in the first quarter, which is a testament to our team and our business model.  I'll now turn the call over to Brian for a review of our financial results.  Brian?", "Brian G. Robins", "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon.  Before we dig into the core operating results I wanted to provide some commentary on the divestitures.  To date we have sold 11 out of 13 bundles raising an excess of $575 million.  In the second quarter we sold communication services, international clearing, and our real-time publishing business.  ", "The MSS business closed subsequent to the end of the second quarter.  We are in advanced negotiations to sell the two remaining businesses, messaging services as well as global security consulting, which we broke out the enterprise security bundle last quarter.  ", "As we discussed before, we continue to manage these businesses with the divide and focus management approach.  I'd like to thank the employees and the divest groups for their focus, passion, and execution, during this transitional time.  The divest group's bottom line continues to be ahead of plan.", "Last quarter we announced we will be holding an analyst day on November 19th in New York City.  Invitations will be sent out in September.  It will be a half-day of presentations by management that will also be available via webcast.  Prior to the event we will post a high-level event on our IR website.  We are looking forward to it and hope to see many of you then.", "Moving now to a more detailed discussion of results for our core business, revenue for our core businesses was $255 million, up 1% sequentially and 9% year over year.  Growth was largely driven by continuing strength in our naming services with revenue up 15% year over year.  ", "Our non-GAAP core operating margin was 38.4%.  This represents approximately 150 basis points of upside to Q1.  The operating expense improvement that we saw this quarter was better than expected and should be categorized in two categories.  First, the quicker realization of savings related to cost-savings initiatives that were introduced at the company, and secondly, one-time expense and revenue benefits.", "Below the operating income line we incurred a loss of approximately $10 million for our core operations.  This loss was roughly in line with what we expected due to lower interest income and is consistent with what we expect in future quarters.  1.6 million and a 10 million loss is non-cash related to our convertible debt accounting, APB 14-1 adopted at the beginning of the year.", "Non-GAAP core net income for the first quarter was $61 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31.  The diluted share count used in EPS calculations was 193 million shares, flat quarter over quarter in light of share repurchases in Q2 of approximately $20 million.", "Moving onto the cash flow and balance sheet items, operating cash flow was approximately $83 million in Q2 which excludes $68 million of excess tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation, (inaudible) from operating cash flows to financing cash flows, and impacts to operating cash flow related to the divestitures.", "Consolidated capital expenditures were $20 million in the quarter and $41 million year-to-date.  We anticipate capital expenditures to be in the 6%-8% of core revenue range moving forward.  We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with ending cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion, up approximately $366 million from last quarter.  ", "During the quarter we received divestiture proceeds of approximately $230 million as well as distributions from the reserve fund of approximately $24 million.  There remains $32 million from the reserve fund that is currently classified in other current assets.", "Net consolidated DSO for the fourth quarter was 30 days, down one day from last quarter.  Deferred revenue from continuing operations ended the quarter at $878 million, up $6 million or 1% from last quarter.", "We ended the quarter with approximately 2,800 employees, down 400 from last quarter, primarily stemming from the divestitures.  ", "As previously discussed, we expect headcounts to continue to decline with the sale of non-core businesses stabilizing at approximately 2,000 employees including VeriSign Japan.", "Moving onto our outlook, for Q3 we expect revenue for the core businesses will be $256-$260 million, or relatively flat to up 2% for the quarter.  With regard to fiscal year '09 guidance, given the swings in FX rates and the continued impact to the business from the global economy, we expect our year-to-year revenue growth will be in the 8%-10% range.  We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 37%-39%.", "To wrap up, we believe we have executed well in the first half of the year and are pleased with our performance as we continue to execute against our divestiture strategy.  The second half of the year will bring challenges and opportunities, but we remain intensely focused on meeting our short-term goals as well as further unlocking shareholder values longer term.", "We would now like to open up the call for your questions.  Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  Today\u2019s' question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically.  (Operator's Instructions) And it looks like we'll take our first question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Great, thank you.  A couple of questions, you mentioned that there were some one-time benefits on both the revenue and expense side, I was just curious what that was?  And with effectively a guide-up in revenue, what could drive  operating margin down quarter over quarter given that we should expect maybe some divestitures or employee headcounts reduced from here?", "Brian G. Robins", "Thanks, Rob.  There was really two items that happened.  In previous calls I talked about the statement of works that we have.  We actually completed that early and acceptance was received there\u2019s $1.5 million of revenue that we planned on receiving in the third quarter that we received in the second quarter.  Now that's complete so we won't have that on a go-forward basis.  In the operating expense line we had a contra-expense item of approximately $1.3 million related to a legal reimbursement, and so if you take the revenue and the expense, you're approximately at 37.5% operating margin and so we'll be at that or above in third quarter.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest", "Okay.  Great, thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "", "Yeah.  I want to follow up.  Brian, so the difference between the 257 and the 255, was that the statement of works, is what you\u2019re saying, or was that discontinued?  Because I just want to kind of get an apples to apples between what our models had before and what the new guidance represents.", "Brian G. Robins", "Yeah.  So the difference between the 257 and the 255 is we have continuing operations which is broken down between core and non-core because we're winding down our prepaid business.  There\u2019s roughly about $1.5-$1.6 million of prepay revenue.  That gets you down to the 255.  Then the 255 was bumped up $1.5 million by what I just alluded to.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Okay.  Got it.  And then one follow up question, in terms of the naming business, Mark, as you look at it you add 1.1 million names, you got the outlook for September, can you just kind of talk and give us some color in that business?  We had all the ad sense changes, the advertising names that have been coming out, how do you feel about the naming business?  Has it stabilized, and do you think you'll see that improvement once you get passed the seasonally weak third quarter?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yeah thanks, Sterling.  I feel pretty good about because as you look at the new registrations in the quarter we had 7 million new registrations.  In Q1, which is a stronger quarter, we had 7.3, and that was up from 6.3 in the fourth quarter.  So we're seeing from a trending standpoint, new registrations had trended down through the whole PPC period to a low of 6.3 in Q4 '08 and then went to 7.3 in Q1 and are now at seven in a weaker seasonal quarter.  So I think we've seen some stabilization from a new unit registration standpoint.  And then as you look at the renewal rates, on the renewal rate side it's 70%-71% with a bleed-off of the things we discussed that happen in 2008 with the PPC and the ad changes.  I think we are seeing that stabilize as well.  So Q3 is the seasonally weakest quarter, but it looks like stability there.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "All right, great.  Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "", "Hey, guys.  Following up on the question on the naming side, historically you have given us some insight traditional versus PPC, any ability to kind of give us what traditional net ads looks like?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Hey, Todd.  Yeah, so on the traditional versus PPC side \u2014 the PPC business as you know is kind of tailed off dramatically over time with all the changes.  It still exists and it's in the range of hundreds of thousands things versus the millions for traditional.  So there's really not a big difference anymore as far as what people are using the names for so there's pretty much the same thing at this point.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay.  So if I look at the first quarter where traditional, I think, was 2.1 million, given the net number here of 1.1, is it fair to say that the traditional business is decelerating and how much of that is seasonal versus a macro issue and how should we think about that going forward?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yes.  I think last time on the traditional side we had 2.1 in Q1 '09 and then just looking on on-line ad names in the hundred of thousands range.  So the traditional base has slowed down some, I think as a result of the macro economy, and then on a quarter-over-quarter basis we had a few things that we didn't have this quarter.  ", "We had the run-up from PPC in Q1 as people were trying to get in front of the last change to the system in there. We had some seasonality in there and there was also promotional programs that people, including us, tail off in the second and third quarter just because it's the low seasonal quarters and it doesn't make a lot of sense to spend the promotional money on that.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Any sense for whether or not we should be thinking about Q3 as kind of the low watermark here, or do you think there is potentially further weakness from a macro perspective?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "I think that the third quarter historically is the seasonally weakest quarter so I have no reason to believe that that wouldn\u2019t change in that case, but other then that I don't see any reason to believe that we haven't stabilized on a unit basis.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "", "Hi, good afternoon.  You have a contractual right to take another price increase on both .com and .net, can you tell us whether or not you plan to do that?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yeah.  As was mentioned before on the price increases, we look at those very, very carefully and really two things we continue to watch on that is the economy and the ecosystem.  The economy looks like it's maybe stabilizing a little bit, but our channels don\u2019t feel wildly optimistic about it yet with our discussions with them.  And on the ecosystem side, as I mentioned before, it's important for us that we know the folks that are important in the ecosystem and that they know what we do \u2014 they appreciate that and that way they know that we provide great value for our services.", "So we continue to do that.  No new news on this other than we continue to look hard at looking at all these factors.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Mark, but there's a deadline on the next price increase of next July, so you'd have to notify by the end of this year, right?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "The notice period is six months before doing any price increase, so if what you mean is when is the last time that you could put a notice in for a price increase before you threw one away, then that would be next July.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Right.  Okay, and then just quickly on the CFIT litigation, do you plan to continue the process, and how much are you spending on legal fees per quarter now?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "So we have to be very careful about what we can say here so really all we can talk about is the procedural aspects so we have filed a motion for a rehearing which we're waiting on.  We are very confident in our case and would seriously consider exhausting all procedural avenues that we have in the case.  So other then that I really can't say anything.  From a legal standpoint I'll ask Brian to comment on that.", "Brian G. Robins", "And on the expense side side, nothing material is included in the guidance that we gave you of 37%-39% for next quarter.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies", "Okay.  Congratulations on your promotions.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "", "Hi, guys.  Just wanted to focus on operating expenses going forward.  I think you all talked about sort of reinvesting in the company, potentially looking at adjacencies.  The past few quarters have really showed some strong operating margin upside and guiding 37-39 for Q3, how should we just think about just the margin structure this company longer term in three to five years, but also over the next 12-18 months as you get the efficiencies from the divestitures, but also invest in new segments?", "Brian G. Robins", "Hey, Phil.  This is Brian.  I'll take part of it and then I'll turn it over to Mark and let him take the second part.  So we haven't given long-term guidance.  I'll let Mark go through sort of long-term from a company perspective and philosophy perspective.  But from a short-term side we've talked about we're doing a number of things around the company on trying to be more efficient and increase margins and leverage the access that we currently have and so on the divestitures we\u2019re able to take out a lot of expense through the divide and focus management that we did to be able to achieve what we've achieved, accent the divestitures, get them done.  Now that the divestitures are being done, we're taking a sharp focus on our shared-services organizations as well as some inefficiencies that we have in our facilities and data centers and looking at consolidating those.  ", "When we've given out our guidance previously I\u2019m saying that we'll be incrementally up quarter over quarter, that's been baked into those numbers.  So we haven't give a fourth quarter guidance or margin, but we said each quarter would be incrementally better than the prior quarter, and we have a number of programs internally where we're looking at leveraging the business and taking costs out.", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "The current range on the margins we've been operating at allows us to invest to where we need to.  In addition \u2014 as well as including what we need to do to help develop the long-term focus, so as far as the development efforts we're doing around that and getting back to some product parity in some of the places we\u2019ve under invested. ", "So we believe that in the range we're talking about today with continued improvements where we can make them, we've got what we need in order to figure out the longer term.  On a longer-term basis, also no reason for us to believe at this point that it would be substantially different then what we're delivering today, even with investment in future services.", "Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse", "Great.  Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.", "Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch", "", "Hi, thank you very much.  I was just wondering if the CFIT litigation is causing any \u2014 well, I\u2019m not asking you to cause on that particular issue itself, but is it causing any disruption in the end market in how prospects are looking at signing up with VeriSign, or for that matter, your partners, or is it not causing any disruption at all from where you see your business?  That's it for me.", "D. James Bidzos", "From everything we've seen at this point there is no impact on our end business whatsoever from the litigation.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "", "I have a question about cash flow.  It looks like you've now reclassified some of the excess benefit you were getting from stock-based comp.  I'm assuming that's permanent going forward, so what kind of cash flow from operations might we expect to generate on a quarterly basis going forward?", "Brian G. Robins", "Good question on cash flow.  As you know we don't break out our balance sheet between continuing and discontinued operations so the cash that's represented in our cash flow statement is operations from all of our businesses.  Now, FASI requires us to put the tax benefits from stock option exercises and stock option related NOLs to be classified as financing activity as opposed to operating activities.", "So as we sold three divestitures this quarter there was a number of things that took place that actually impacted operating cash flow.  In operating cash flow it's a use and then in financing it's a source.  And so if you take the $83 million and then on a tax affected basis utilize our NOLs, you add approximately $45 million as our tax from operations this quarter with the utilization of NOLs at about $128 million.", "On a go-forward basis we've talked about cash from the business will be approximately $350 million.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "And just a lot of moving pieces and kind of fluid in terms of headcount given the divestitures that are occurring, but are you also hiring at this point and can you just talk about your hiring activity and if you are, where within the organization?", "Brian G. Robins", "Yeah, good question.  I mean every quarter we report net decreases in headcount, but as we look to invest in new areas and look to explore these new areas, we have a number of (inaudible) open that we continue to hire agents where they're very specialized people to fill gaps in the organization, but the net decreases is more exiting than coming on.  So you'll see a net decrease quarter to quarter.", "Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "", "Great.  Thanks for taking my questions, two for you.  The first of them asks the self-cert. side on the pricing side.  When do you think we can reach effectively a low watermark there as macro versus competition start to balance out, and maybe more importantly EV certificates can become a big enough piece of the base to actually make a difference?  And then I have a quick followup.", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Hey, Sarah.  So on the AUR side as far as the price declines, I think we're going to continue to see these price declines for the foreseeable future for a number of reasons like I said.  The first one is we do see the lower brands growing at a higher rate so there is a unit mix going on there, and I think that's the primary driver.  And then we are seeing some negative impacts to the economy as well, and I don't see any reason that those two things are going to change anytime soon so I can't call a bottom on that.  I wouldn't want to try to call a bottom on it right now, but we're not seeing really, really steep declines around the AUR.", "And on the EV side, we\u2019re happy every quarter to report that we've doubled every quarter on the EV side.  It's still a smaller base than we would have liked or anybody would have liked at this point so we have a very robust migration marketing campaign in place for people to go from SGCF to EV and we see good adoption on that, but I think it's still going to be some time before that becomes a majority of the base of our certificates.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great.  That's great color.  And then just a followup which is a bigger picture question.  The CFIT lawsuit, I think the bigger issues for investors is it just raises somewhat of a sensitivity around the .com renewal.  Do you have any ability or would you even consider bringing that renewal forward to kind of get the overhand gone and past you, or are you just waiting until 2012 and let the contract renew as it\u2019s currently set?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yeah.  The renewal is in 2012, Sarah, and we really can't comment beyond that.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, fair enough.  I echo Katherine's thoughts, congrats to both you and Brian as well.", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Thank you very much.", "Brian G. Robins", "Thank you, Sarah.", "Operator", "(Operator's Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Kerry Rice with Wedbush.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Morgan", "", "Thank you.  A couple questions on the SSL business.  Can you talk a little bit about seasonality there?  Is Q3 also the seasonally weakest quarter there, and I guess if the economy stabilizes and improves, would you expect to see a pickup in SSL certs?  And then the second question is can you talk a little bit about the iDefense and what the revenue was there and what trends you see going on there?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yeah, sure.  So on the SSL side, Kerry, we do see a similar kind of seasonality we see in the DNS business on the SSL side of the business and I would definitely expect the SSL business to pick up if the economy picked up.  As I've mentioned before, the economy is tied to a number of things obviously that are much better correlated to our business like ecommerce and Internet advertising.  So I think if those things pick up with a better economy we would see that business do better than it is right now from a sales standpoint.", "And on the iDefense question, we said that iDefense was doing around $10 million for the year in revenue and that's the case.  We're on track to do that.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Cowen and Company.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "", "Hi.  Just one question on the certificate side, one question on both \u2014 I guess, Mark, if we were able to see AUR by segment, not overall but by say by VeriSign brand, Thawte brand, GeoTrust brand \u2014 is the AUR stable within each segment or are you seeing pressure within those independent mix?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "On the mix side from the brand standpoint \u2014 back to the units, the lower grow units grow faster than the higher-end units so you'd see from an AUR standpoint, less impact there and more impact to the higher brand.  But as a general matter, Walter, the total AUR is fairly similar across the brands as far as the increases and decreases.  Not one thing is moving the number, if that is what your question is.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "So it's not necessarily just mix that's pressuring the AUR, it's also pressure within each individual segment?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yeah.  There's different kinds of pressures in the segment, but yeah I think there's definitely a market impact and then there's the next impact.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "Okay.  And then just second question on both businesses, are you seeing any significant difference in term length versus a year ago, say people buying more one-year certificates or people buying shorter name?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "We're not seeing that.  On the average term life we're not really seeing any significant difference on the domain name side of the business, and on the SSL side of the business we see a little bit of a decline around that.  We do see pressure about people buying less more frequently than they were before, but nothing really noticeable in the ATLs.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "Got it.  And then, Brian, on the operating expense line it looks like there might have been a little bit of reclassification going on between things like sales and marketing, cost of revenue, and G&A, are we correct there, and if so, what's going on?", "Brian G. Robins", "Yeah.  This quarter we did move some G&A \u2014 some international facilities cost to where the people were by cost site.  There was actually a larger decrease in G&A relative to the spend initial savings that we have, the savings programs.  And then in sales and marketing this quarter we actually did a lot of planned lead gen loyalty product and branding and so you'll see sales and marketing get back down next quarter.", "Walter Pritchard - Cowen and Company", "Okay, great.  Thanks a lot, and both of you congratulations as well on the appointments.", "Brian G. Robins", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Craig Nakervis with First Analysis.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis", "Yes, thanks very much.  On the registry side, can you talk about overseas strength?  Are you seeing anything sustainable like you saw in Q1?  I think China did particularly well, maybe start there.", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Yeah, sure.  We've mentioned prior the base of names on the international side depending on how you cut it from where the registrar versus the registrant is, is anywhere from 35%-40% of the base.  So it's a smaller portion of the base than the domestic, but we do see that grow at a faster rate than the domestic and that continues to be the case and that growth continues to come from the BRIC countries as well as some increases we're seeing in (inaudible).", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis", "And how about on the SSL side, incremental color on the buying environment?  I know in Q1 you talked about a tough environment, and it sounded like you were saying similar things.  Well, was there any incremental change from your perspective and how it looks in the end market?", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "No.  We're seeing the same macroeconomic impacts on the flow down of the market, but nothing different quarter over quarter.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis", "Okay.  And then lastly, Brian, are you willing to approximate the revenue breakout from the different line items this time around or not?", "Brian G. Robins", "It's roughly about 60% naming and 40% authentication.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis", "Thanks very much.", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "Thanks, Craig.", "Operator", "And well take a followup question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "", "Yeah.  Just one followup, I don't know if you touched upon it and if you did I missed it and I apologize, but deferred revenue I think was up 1% sequentially, can you just go into what might be impacting that either positively or negatively and could part of it be the SSL term-length shortening?", "Brian G. Robins", "Good question, Sterling.  We had a number of factors impacting deferred revenue this quarter.  On the positive side the increase in naming due to the 1.1 million net ads had an increase.  Within authentication or user authentication, we recognized revenue based on a cash basis and we received a large sum due collection efforts from the affiliates, and also the renewal contracts that we're signing are 12 months in length as opposed to 18 months in length.  Both of those attributed to about a $3 million decrease.  And then as discussed on prior calls, the SSL purchase pattern changes from annually to quarterly, and the overall impact in the macro economy, there is a decline quarter over quarter in the SSL of about $2 million.  So net-net you had the inquiry related to the naming and a slight decrease in SSL on purchase pattern buying as well as some of the seasonality from first quarter, second quarter.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "All right, great.  Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And seeing as how there are no further questions I'd like to turn the call back over to Miss Fazioli for any closing comments.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator.  We anticipate that our next quarterly conference call, which will reflect our third quarter 2009 results, will be held on Thursday, November 5th, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.  I would like to remind you that in light of regulation FD, VeriSign plans to retain its longstanding policy to not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for VeriSign\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Nancy Fazioli, Director of Investor Relations and I\u2019m here today with Mark McLaughlin, President and CEO, and Brian Robins, Executive Vice President and CFO. ", "", "Please note that this call and accompanying Slide presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website located at investor.versign.com.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "Mark McLaughlin", "", "Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone. Let me add my welcome to all of you joining today\u2019s call. ", "As the results indicate, Q4 2009 capped a solid finish to the year for VeriSign with the year-over-year growth in core revenue of 8%, while non-GAAP net income attributable to VeriSign and subsidiaries grew 23% from 2008 to 2009. Also during the year, we concluded a significant restructuring effort that was initiated in late 2007 and involved the bundling and eventual sale of 14 non-core businesses. We are pleased with the accomplishments and the results for 2009, particularly in light of the challenging economic backdrop during the year.", "Although the year was not without its challenges, we remained focused on our customers, operations and disciplined investments in growth prospects. For 2010 and beyond, as the economy continues to improve, we believe that we\u2019re in a good position for future growth given our market leading position and our two core businesses of Naming and Authentication Services. We believe both businesses are indispensable to our customers and have made VeriSign\u2019s brand synonymous with trust on the Internet. Also, our infrastructure is unmatched in our industries and provides a significant and unique competitive advantage for the future. ", "I appreciate the hard work from our dedicated team over the last year and would like to thank them for their efforts and achievements. ", "In terms of the business unit results for the quarter, I\u2019ll start with Naming. Naming had a strong quarter. The base of registered names in dot com and dot net totaled 96.7 million names at the end of the quarter. This is an increase of 1.8 million net names added to the domain name base quarter over quarter compared to 1 million in the same quarter last year or a 7% in net names year-over-year. We ended the quarter with registered domain names ahead of our forecast as we saw strengthening in renewal rates and good international growth.", "During the fourth quarter we processed 7.3 million new names. This is a 4% increase quarter over quarter and up from 6.3 million new names in Q4 2008. The Q3 renewal rate was approximately 70.5%, an improvement over Q2 which had rounded up to 70%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for Q4 2009 will be closer to 71%. As a reminder, in mid-December we announced that effective July 1, 2010 registry fees for dot com, dot net names will increase 7% and 10% respectively to $7.34 for dot com and $4.65 for dot net per year.", "As we look forward, given the data we have at this point in the quarter we would expect the Q1 net names added to the domain name base to be between 1.8 and 2.1 million names. To close out the Naming discussion, we have no updates from our analyst day in November regarding the status of the case filed against VeriSign by the Coalition for I Can Transparency or CFIT. The petition for re-hearing is still pending and there is no prescribed timeframe for the court to respond.", "Now, moving on to Authentication Services, in Business Authentication we saw the installed base of SSL certificates increase to 1.22 million certificates in the fourth quarter compared to approximately 1.2 million last quarter and approximately 1.12 million certificates in Q4 2008. This represents a 9% year-over-year growth in the base. The annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the installed base of VeriSign, Geo Trust and thought branded certificates for the fourth quarter was $228 which compares to $234 for the prior quarter. As I noted at our analyst day in November, we believe that the AUR is impacted by two factors, the mix in the base as lower end brands grow at a faster pace than the VeriSign brand and increased discounting in the recent economic slowdown.", "As the economy is improved, we have focused some efforts on reducing discounting and have made progress on that front in the fourth quarter. Also we saw strong bookings in the fourth quarter as enterprises began to show confidence in a market recovery. We appreciated being [met] at you at our analyst day in November. At that event we discussed the opportunities we see in our core businesses, given the increasing need for tracking the Internet. I look forward to reporting on those initiatives as we progress through 2010.", "Our March launch of Trust Services at the RSA Conference is still on target. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian for a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and 2009. Brian?", "Brian Robins", "", "Thanks, Mark, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. Before discussing our results for the fourth quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight some of our accomplishments in 2009.", "For the year, core revenue was $1.026 billion compared to $948 million in 2008, up 8% year to year. Naming Services revenue was up 12% and Authentication Services revenue was up 3% from 2008 to 2009. Non-GAAP core operating margin for the full year rose 420 basis points to 37.7% versus 33.5% in 2008. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.28, which compares to $1 in 2008, a 28% year-over-year increase.", "Cash flow from operations was approximately $395 million for 2009. In 2009, free cash flow or operating cash flow adjusted to include excess tax benefit less net capital expenditures was $304 million. As Mark mentioned, we concluded our divestitures of all non-core businesses, generating total proceeds in excess of $765 million. We reduced headcount by 30%, approximately 1,000 positions. We utilized approximately $250 million in cash to repurchase 11.4 million shares of common stock in 2009.", "Let\u2019s turn now to the fourth quarter. Revenue for our core businesses was $262 million, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Growth was largely driven by continued strength in Naming Services with revenue of $159 million, up 9% year-over-year. Authentication Services revenue of $103 million was up 1% over the same quarter in 2008. In Q4 there was no material impact to revenue from currency exchange rates. For the full year we experienced currency exchange headwind of approximately $4 million, primarily related to the yen.", "Our non-GAAP core operating margin was 36.8% in the fourth quarter, a 180 basis point reduction from the prior quarter. The Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was lower due to an out of period, $4 million non-tax depreciations adjustment in G&A, correcting for certain assets held at VeriSign Japan that were depreciated over a period longer than their useful lives. Normalizing for this G&A increase, non-GAAP core operating margin would have been 38.3%, in line with our original expectations for the quarter.", "In non-GAAP other income and expense, we incurred a loss of approximately $9.5 million in Q4 for our core operations. This loss was greater than expected due primarily to a mark-to-market of the contingent interest on the convertible debt that resulted in a loss of $1.3 million in Q4 as opposed to a gain as we saw in prior quarters in 2009.", "Transition Services revenue was $1.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $1.2 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $59 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.31 compared to $0.33 in Q3. In Q4 we completed share repurchases of approximately $208 million, equating to 9 million shares. Approximately 6 million of the shares repurchased during the fourth quarter will come out of the share count in Q1 due to the treasury stock method of accounting. As of December 31, 2009, we had existing authorization for approximately $700 million for additional share repurchases.", "Moving on to cash flow and balance sheet items, operating cash flow was approximately $173 million in Q4 and was $395 million year-to-date. Consolidated capital expenditures were $51 million in the quarter and $117 million for the full year. Of the $51 million, $26 million was related to the purchase of a critical data center facility. Approximately 92% represents capital expenditures for core services in the quarter.", "We ended the quarter was a strong balance sheet with ending cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $1.5 billion, up $45 million from the prior quarter after share repurchases of $208 million and the purchase of the new facility as I noted previously. In addition to divestiture proceeds of approximately $185 million, during the quarter we received distributions of approximately $12 million from the reserve funds. There remains $21 million of these funds as currently classified in other current assets.", "Net consolidated DSO for the fourth quarter was 21 days, down 8 days from last quarter, due primarily to the completion of the divestitures. ", "Deferred revenue from continuing operations ended the quarter at $888 million, up $7 million from Q3. ", "Moving on to headcount, we ended the quarter with approximately 2,300 employees, down approximately 350 from last quarter as a result of the divestitures. There will be an additional reduction of approximately 200 employees with the wind down of CPS business and the completion of Transition Services. Factoring in possible new hires during the year, we expect to end 2010 with approximately 2,150 employees.", "With regard to guidance, as we indicated at analyst day in November, we anticipate that core revenue growth for 2010 will be in the range of 4% to 7% year-over-year. We also indicated that we anticipate continuing modestly expanding non-GAAP operating margin, expecting that we will exit Q4 2010 in a range of 39% to 39.5%. Non-GAAP other income loss is expected to be a loss of $32 million for 2010.", "Our guidance is based on continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our Naming and Authentication Services business, in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. ", "In summary, we are pleased with our 2009 financial results and business accomplishments. We had solid performance, strong execution on strategic initiatives, and increased efficiency across the company. That being said, the divestiture process has been complex from an accounting and tax perspective and we are happy to have that largely behind us.", "As we enter 2010, we believe that our strong financial position will enable us to win back some top line growth, expand our operating leverage while seeking opportunities to deliver increased shareholder value. ", "With that, I\u2019d like to now open the call for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "Brian, I have a question on the guidance. You gave that guidance before you announced the price increase and it goes into effect in July. Why isn\u2019t there sort of more of a positive [talent] on revenue? Why are you sticking with the 4 to 7%?", "Brian Robins", "Yes, when we talked about this at analyst day, Katherine, we said whether we did a price increase or not that the amount of revenue that we would receive in 2010 wouldn\u2019t impact the overall guidance and so with or without the price increase we\u2019d be 4 to 7%. The amount of the revenue that we would receive from the price increase in 2010 is around $5 million.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "", "So is the impact more 2011, would you say?", "Brian Robins", "Correct. It takes effect in July and then what the deferred revenue models every name that\u2019s renewed after July or new names added that we would get the revenue.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "", "And I believe you said you could grow double digits in 2011. Is that still the case?", "Brian Robins", "That\u2019s our objective.", "Katherine Egbert - Jefferies & Company", "", "Can you just give us an update, you said you made some progress on the AUR by selling bundles. Can you just give us some color?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, what we\u2019re saying there is that on the AUR you know we knew we had the two factors in that of the mix of the brands as well as the discounting. So in the fourth quarter given that the economy was improving we were able to spend some time on getting reduced discounting from a sales perspective, and we were successful at that. So we know we were doing less discounting in the fourth quarter. Impact on that given the model would be seen in out quarters, but we had a very, very strong bookings quarter and less discounting going on in the quarter, so that\u2019s positive for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I have a question on deferred revenue. If I look at short term deferred revenue, it actually declined sequentially from Q3 and I\u2019m just having trouble understanding with the recovery you\u2019re seeing on DNS units and the stability in the SSL business, why deferred revenue would be down sequentially. And as part of this, are you guys discounting in DNS names? Is there any kind of marketing programs going on that would account for that?", "Brian Robins", "Once again with the divested businesses and the core businesses, the balance sheet still has a little bit of apples and oranges. And so deferred revenue for the quarter for the core businesses was approximately $10 million, $6 million in the DNS and $4 million in SSL. Then we had a decline of $1 million in DSJ. Because we wound down our prepaid business, we had a decline of about $2.5 million of the prepaid deferred revenue which resulted in a $7 million net increase, Q3 over Q4. But if you take out the prepay at $2.3, it was a little bit over $9 million for the quarter. That would explain the reduction in short term deferred revenue.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "If I look at the impact we\u2019re seeing in terms of recovery in DNS units and typical seasonality in Q4, it\u2019s typically been greater than that. I guess two questions. Are we done with kind of the balance sheet noise or should we expect that to continue going forward? And are there any special marketing programs that you guys have been doing on the DNS side in Q4?", "Brian Robins", "On the Q4 deferred revenue increase from Q3, it was actually we had a very strong Q4 or more than we anticipated. And Q3 \u201908 to Q4 \u201908 we increased deferred revenue to $3 million and we increased it $6 million this year. And so we doubled the deferred revenue growth, \u201903 to \u201904, \u201908 versus \u201909.", "Mark McLaughlin", "On your question on the promotional programs, we continued to run promotional programs that we had in the business for a long time but nothing out of the ordinary, so there\u2019s nothing special going on there from a promotional program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.", "I guess maybe my question to start with is on the absence of first quarter guidance.", "Brian Robins", "You know as we go into 2010, you know we\u2019ve given guidance for the fiscal year, 4 to 7% on revenue and said that we would incrementally increase our operating margin. We have given Domain Name guidance. The only thing that we haven\u2019t given is the revenue range, to the extent that if we\u2019re off from a revenue growth perspective we would update you on that. But based on the overall economy and some of the uncertainties out there, we aren\u2019t going to be giving quarter-to-quarter revenue guidance. ", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.", "", "Can you maybe talk about the ASP on the new business that was added in the fourth quarter, just how that might have compared to the AUR on certs that were added in the third quarter? ", "Mark McLaughlin", "I\u2019ll talk in terms of ASP to answer that question because it\u2019s one quarter there instead of an annualized number. So from an ASP standpoint we\u2019ve seen the same kind of behavior on ASP that we\u2019ve had in the past except that we were doing like less discounting at the high end. So we had some improvement from an ASP perspective in that regard on the high end.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Inc.", "", "And in terms of share count for full year 2010, is there any kind of high level guidance, Brian, you might be able to give us?", "Brian Robins", "You know on the buy back I really can\u2019t because we have $700 million authorized and we can\u2019t comment on future repurchases, so sort of same comment on analyst days, we\u2019ll look to return value to the shareholders. We purchased a little over $200 million in fourth quarter. Due to the treasury stock accounting method we only removed 3 million shares out. There will be an additional $6 million to come out in the first quarter and then we also said that we will continue to buy back the [crete] and I can\u2019t really expand farther than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse", "", "Just two questions here, first on the operating expense side. You guys have reiterated your margin guidance exit the year at 39 to 35, but how should we think about sort of the progression of OpEx over the course of the year? You\u2019ve mentioned areas for cost reduction but also headcount additions. How do we see those two baking out? And then also just one housekeeping item, the interest on the other income line, what are your expectations for 2010?", "Brian Robins", "On the interest income line, other income, you know at analyst day we said that\u2019d be $32 million and it\u2019s roughly about the same quarter-to-quarter so expect it to be a loss of about $8 million per quarter. We will have some choppiness related to our embedded in derivative on the convert and you saw that between third and fourth quarter. Net net last year in 2009 we had a $500,000 gain on the derivative and so that will be one thing that we\u2019ll call out for you that will potentially change $32 million quarter-to-quarter but for the year $32 million is a good number to use.", "And on the operating expense line, you know we continue to look at areas to take expenses out of the business to become more efficient. And as we do that, we\u2019ll invest some back into the growth opportunities like Trust Services that we talked about at the analyst day. And we\u2019ll look to incrementally increase that quarter-to-quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "With revenue near the high end of the range for the quarter, why didn\u2019t we see a little bit more lift on the operating margin, and I guess specifically on sales and marketing? Were there some unique programs in the quarter or is this seasonal? Anything unusual?", "Brian Robins", "There was actually two things related to sales and marketing. One on our commission side a lot of accelerators were hit in fourth quarter due to the strong bookings that Mark talked about in his prepared remarks. And so there\u2019s about a $1 million increase in commissions related to that. And then also on VeriSign Japan we had about $1 million over normal run rate as well. So the two of those were slightly over $2 million, that was really fourth quarter related, end of year and commissions in it and accelerators and some additional marketing activities that took place in Japan.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "", "Second, do you have the mix of dot com and dot net in the quarter?", "Mark McLaughlin", "As far as the breakdown of new names?", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities", "Yes.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Hang on just a second. Com was 84 million and net was 12.7. That\u2019s the zone, Rob.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch.", "Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "In the security business, Mark, just wondering if, it looks like you\u2019ve seen some price stability on the high end of the VeriSign brand, but are we still seeing a mix shift away from VeriSign or GeoTrust [inaudible]? And when do you think the mix shift will stabilize and therefore the lack of [inaudible] in the high end can actually help your AUR and margins going forward?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think what we\u2019re definitely seeing from a mix shift perspective, the low end still grows at a much higher rate than the high end, almost 4x higher than the high end. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to see the low end grow at a higher rate, whether it\u2019s 4x or not, at a higher rate than the high end of this. So I think we\u2019ll have continued mix shift dynamics there that would impact the AUR for quite some time. So obviously if you were able to improve ASPs at the high end, that will help but my expectation is that the AUR as I said will continue to decline for some time.", "Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Mark, any evidence at all and maybe hopefully this is not the case that there\u2019s a trade down from the VeriSign addition to the lower end additions at all? Or do you allow that to happen with customers?", "Mark McLaughlin", "No. Well, there\u2019s two things I can tell you in that that would lead me to believe that\u2019s not happening, Kash. The first is that the renewal rates at the high end for VeriSign brand are very, very high, so we don\u2019t lose customers up there and implied in that I think is that they\u2019re not trading down on a grant. So I don\u2019t see that happening. The second thing in the fourth quarter like I said we had a pretty strong quarter from a bookings perspective and that was particularly at the high end.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "First on the Naming business you talked about the pick up that you\u2019re seeing and the name growth and particularly you\u2019re seeing the new names pick up. You mentioned international, but is there any other kind of sources that you could point to whether it be advertising, new business creation, what the drivers to some of that new name growth is?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Well, we track to macro trends as we mentioned before, online advertising and e-commerce. Both of those have appeared to pick up nicely in the fourth quarter so I always listen into Google, Yahoo, those guys calls from an online advertising standpoint. And you know both of those companies are reporting strong growth in the fourth quarter and smooth sailing ahead on that. Also some of the metrics that we look at as far as tracking those things have revised their scenarios to increase the expectations as far as what online advertising and e-commerce will grow at for rates in 2010. So that\u2019s a positive for us as well.", "Like I said we always tend to lag a couple of quarters, either up or down on that, depending on what happens. But those are good indications for our business.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "", "On the SSL business we all kind of watch this AUR from quarter-to-quarter so closely, maybe taking it a step up, as you think about the 4 to 7% growth in core revenue in 2010, how should we think about that growth being split out between the Naming business and the SSL business?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think you primarily would see a lot of growth coming out of the Naming side. We have the price increase that won\u2019t really take impact until end of the year in 2011, so there\u2019s the price aspect, there\u2019s the Naming growth. And then you have the Authentication business. Right now from an Authentication standpoint, that\u2019s growing the low single digits. So you keep that in mind. We\u2019re doing some work to increase that growth rate including launch our new Trust Services here at RSA. But I would say you\u2019re going to see more of that growth coming out of the Naming side for a good portion of this year, not the Authentication side until we ramp that up.", "Sterling Auty - J.P. Morgan", "", "Last question would be on the margin side, Brian, you know talk about the modest sequential improvement in operating margins through 2010, should we base that off of the 36.8% reported or backing out the VeriSign Japan impact and really work off of the 38.3?", "Brian Robins", "Great question, Sterling, and thanks for asking it. Work off the 38.3. The VeriSign Japan was an out of period adjustment that will not occur in first quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Corporation.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Corporation", "I guess on the Domain name side, first of all, you\u2019ve had a nice Q4, you talk about good color for advertising, online advertising, etc. Yet the Q1 guidance for Names is about flat I think with year-over-year comp. Wonder if you could comment on why you\u2019re sort of guiding flat year-over-year.", "Mark McLaughlin", "That\u2019s a great question, Craig. We did see strong fourth quarter obviously and we would expect the new names being registered to be strong in the first quarter because we always have great seasonality in the first quarter. The reason we\u2019re a little bit hesitant to go any further than that is in the first quarter we have a much larger number of expiring names in the first quarter than over the fourth quarter, almost 2 million more names. So even though the renewal rates are increasing nicely and even though we would expect a good pick up in new names registered, just given the fact that the expired name basis that much bigger in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, you kind of start at a deficit if you will when you apply the renewal rate to that. Does that make sense?", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Corporation", "I guess so.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Let me be more specific then because with almost 2 million more names in the first quarter expiring, if you apply the renewal rate to that, that\u2019s close to like 700,000 names that you have to get over before you\u2019re adding, if you think of it on a quarter over quarter basis.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Corporation", "", "On the international side, can you comment whether dot cn closing to individuals provides any sort of incremental spur to your activity over there?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It\u2019s possible, Craig. I mean for the benefit of everybody else, in China dot cn is under review by the Chinese government for some of their registration policies and registrars registering dot cn have to go through an increased level of validation before they can register a name. So there\u2019s speculation given that names that might previously have been renewed or registered in dot cn might move to a different [TLC] and obviously if that was the case, one of the things it might accomplish is dot com. So if that\u2019s all true and plays out that way we could expect we might see an increase in registrations coming out of China, but its early days.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Corporation", "", "On just sort of not providing guidance for Q1, the comment was there\u2019s economic uncertainty. Is there something new on the landscape that sort of point\u2019s uncertainty for you? Because there was uncertainty through \u201909 but maybe you\u2019ve sort of had it with that and you don\u2019t want to any longer guide, but I just wonder if there\u2019s something incrementally new that\u2019s causing you to not guide for the quarter.", "Brian Robins", "You know, Craig, there really isn\u2019t. You know our business models, the deferred revenue model, we have high visibility into what the revenue is and there\u2019s really not, the only thing that we aren\u2019t giving that we\u2019ve given previously is revenue and there\u2019s really not much difference. Your model for revenue in first quarter is going to be very close to what the number will be.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Corporation", "", "Do you have any Trust Services revenue baked into your 2010 guidance?", "Brian Robins", "We have some but it\u2019s less than $5 million.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co.", "You know $4 million in headwind in terms of currency from the yen, as we start thinking about the first quarter, are you guys hedging against the yen?", "Brian Robins", "Yes, we\u2019re 100% hedged on the balance sheet but we don\u2019t hedge on the P&L because we don\u2019t want to take FX exposure if the revenue is not attained.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "And as you start thinking about your cash flow for 2010, what\u2019s kind of going to be the estimate for cash flow from operations for the year?", "Mark McLaughlin", "So, Shaul thanks for bringing that up. Good question. We talked about it at analyst day. Once you add back excess tax benefit, the operating cash flow will be approximately $450 million.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ms. Fazioli for any closing remarks.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you very much. We anticipate that our next quarterly conference call which will reflect our first quarter 2010 results will be held on Thursday, April 29, at 2:00 PM Pacific Time. I should also mention that RSA is coming out the week of March 1 through March 5. We\u2019ll be conducting a meeting for analysts and institutional investors on Wednesday, March 3.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark. ", "Mark McLaughlin", "Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone. Q1 was a good quarter for us and a good way to start off the year.  In both naming and authentication services, we are seeing improvements in the business driven by the rebounding economy as well as programs and efforts we have implemented to improve the businesses.  As we have indicated in the past, we believe that online advertising spend and e-commerce spend are correlated to our business results on a lagging basis.", "Both of these areas saw healthy sequential improvement in the first quarter.  On the naming side of the business in the first quarter, this helped us to achieve record new registrations as well as an improving renewal rate, and on the authentication side of the business, we saw continued strength in bookings.", "Before getting into the business unit results, I\u2019ll touch on some highlights from the quarter.  Revenue from our core businesses in the first quarter was $263 million which represented a 4% year-over-year increase.  Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.37 which is a 16% increase year-over-year.  ", "Non-GAAP operating margin was 39.8%.  In the quarter we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares for about $50 million under our repurchase program.  On the cash side, we generated cash from operations of $101 million.", "On the operations side, we continue to deliver 100% availability on our infrastructure.  To help ensure that we maintain this level of performance, we announced a new initiative in the first quarter called Project Apollo.  This project is designed to increase our infrastructure capacity to over 1000 times today\u2019s level of 4 trillion queries so that we can manage up to 4 quadrillion queries per day by 2020.  ", "Over the next decade we believe this investment will dramatically strengthen the scale of the infrastructure and enable us to maintain our operational excellence.  In moving to the business unit results for the quarter, I\u2019ll start with naming.  The base of registered names in dot com and dot net this quarter totaled 99.3 million names at the end of March, a 7% increase year-over-year.", "2.5 million net names were added to the domain name base this quarter, which compares to 2 million net names added in the same quarter last year.  During the quarter, we processed a record 8.1 million new registrations.  This is an 11% increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.", "The 2009 fourth quarter renewal rate was 71.2% up from approximately 70.5% in the third quarter of 2009.  While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2010 will be approximately 72%.  ", "New registration and renewal growth in the quarter was driven by increasing confidence in the economy, continued strong international growth, and registrar marketing programs.  We expect that the Q2 net names added to the domain name base will be between 2 million and 2.3 million names, considering historical seasonality.", "As a reminder, the price for dot com and dot net new and renewing names will increase to $7.34 and $4.65 respectively on July 1 this year.  To close out naming, we have no update regarding the status of the case filed against VeriSign by the Coalition For ICANN Transparency or CFIT.  As previously indicated, the Petition for Rehearing is still pending and the court is not obligated to respond in any prescribed timeframe.", "Now, moving on to authentication services.  In business authentication we saw the install base of SSL Certificates increase to 1.25 million certificates in the first quarter compared to approximately 1.22 million for last quarter and approximately 1.15 million certificates in the first quarter of 2009.  This represents a 9% year-over-year growth in the base.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, the main metric for this business is revenue growth.  Given that revenues are primarily deferred and recognized over a future period, bookings is a good leading indicator of future revenue direction.  From the bookings perspective, we have the second consecutive healthy bookings quarter where SSL bookings exceeded our plan.", "Also, while two quarters do not make a trend, we have second consecutive quarter in which SSL bookings were higher than revenue.  The annualized average unit revenue or AUR for the installed base of VeriSign, GeoTrust, and thought branded certificates for the first quarter was $222 which compares to $228 for the prior quarter.  There are a couple of AUR related points worth mentioning.", "First, the AUR for the VeriSign branded certificates was flat quarter-over-quarter following a decline for the past six quarters.  We believe this is due to increased discipline on discounting policies and the improving economy.  ", "Second, unit volume growth in the low end continues to outpace unit growth in the VeriSign branded certificates.  Given these points, we believe that product mix shift continues to be the major factor in the AUR decline and we would expect that to be the case for at least the remainder of 2010.", "Also, in the first quarter, in the authentication business, we successfully launched the VeriSign Trust Seal as planned in late February just before the RSA conference.  This is our first step in our efforts to increase our [wallet] share and expand our [address for market] and trust services beyond exclusively transaction oriented sites.", "The initial rollout was through a small, direct sales team and through indirect mail efforts.  We have additional rollouts planned to our sales partners and affiliates in May and then we\u2019ll roll the product out for our existing VeriSign SSL customer base in July.  It\u2019s still early but the initial reception has been promising.", "To close out authentication service business, I also wanted to mention that in early April we acquired certain assets from TrustBearer Labs.  This small acquisition follows a year long partnership that allowed us to fully appreciate the PKI expertise of their team of engineers.  The company\u2019s unique technology will further and enhance our solutions, particularly in the public sector.  ", "Now before I turn it over to Brian, I wanted to introduce two new members of my executive team.  First,[Autry] [inaudible] joined VeriSign in the first quarter as Senior Vice President of User Authentication, which includes our VeriSign identity protection and PKI businesses.  [Autry] brings over 20 years of experience in Internet software, security, and cloud-base computing from organizations including McAfee, [Socoric], [inaudible], and Netscape.  ", "Also Ben Petro recently joined VeriSign as the Senior Vice President of VeriSign Internet Defense Services, which encompasses I-Defense and our DDoS Mitigation Service.  Ben knows our space well having successfully built UltraDNS, a DNS solutions provider into a growth business, which was acquired by Neustar in 2006.  We are pleased to welcome both of them to the team.  Brian, I will now turn the call over to you. ", "Brian G. Robins", "", "The Q1 operational and financial results demonstrate that we are making good progress towards our 2010 goals.  You will recall that we highlighted at our Analyst Day the following key financial metrics:  revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth, and free cash flow.  We were pleased with our Q1 performance in all of these areas. ", "Starting with revenue for our core business, revenue was $263 million, up 1% from the prior quarter and up 4% year-over-year.  Naming Services revenue was up 2% sequentially and up 9% year-over-year.  Authentication Services revenue was down 1% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year.  The sequential decline of Authentication Services was related to user authentication as well as VeriSign Japan.  Deferred revenue from continuing operations was strong.  ", "In Q1, we ended the quarter at $924 million, up $36 million or 4% from Q4 and up 6% from the same period in 2009.  The strength is primarily the growth in new domain names and Naming Services.

Non-GAAP operating expenses was approximately $159 million, down 4%, quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the $4 million out of period depreciation adjustment that was discussed in Q4.  ", "As well as managing Q1 expenses ahead of revenue visibility.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year.  Our GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 33.6%.  Non-GAAP operating margin was 39.8% in the first quarter compared to 36.8% in Q4.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $69 million resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37 compared to $0.31 in Q4 and $0.32 in the same period in 2009.  ", "Contributing to a strong sequential earnings growth was the following:  continued execution on expense management, less than expected other loss net due to a gain from the contingent interest derivative related to convertible debt, higher transition services revenue in Q1, and improved interest income, and finally 2.1 million additional shares that we purchased during the quarter, resulting in a diluted share count of 184 million shares and net reduction of 8.5 million shares from Q1 2009.  Operating cash flow was approximately $101 million in Q1, which includes the payment of accrued employee bonuses of approximately $36 million.  ", "Free cash flow was $89 million in Q1, giving $8 million in excess tax benefits and $20 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.  Our balance sheet is strong with ending cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of approximately $1.6 billion; an increase of $73 million after share repurchases of 50 million.  ", "We ended the quarter with approximately $460 million in marketable securities; moving from a government money-market, light boat strategy with our cash to a prudent investment strategy that we hope to improve our yield.  We invested in investment grade securities with an emphasis first on capital preservation liquidity and second on yield.  We have $647 million off rights for share repurchases.  As we indicated previously, approximately 60% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held domestically. ", "Moving on to guidance, as we indicated last quarter we no longer provide quarterly guidance.  However, we will update you on our progress toward our annual guidance each quarter.  At this point we believe that we are making good progress to achieve or exceed the targets we provided at Analyst Day and reiterated on the Q4 call.", "Core revenue growth for 2010 will be in the range of 5% to 7%, up from 4% to 7%.  In light of the sequential improvement that we saw in Q4, we now expect to exit Q4 2010 with non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 39.5% to 40%, up from 39% to 39.5%.  Non-GAAP other loss net is expected to be approximately $32 million for 2010.  ", "Our guidance is based on continued growth, disciplined execution, and increased operating efficiencies within our businesses.  In closing, Q1 provides a strong foundation from which we can continue to focus on growing the business.  During the quarter we improved company-wide performance and profitability while continuing to invest in our people, our technology, and our brand.  Our operational excellence and unique capabilities coupled with our financial strength will move the business forward by relying on our experience and strengths.

(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Sarah Friar \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Two questions for you.  Given the turn that it appears you are starting to see, why not list their revenue guidance a little bit more on the top line?  Then second, can you address competition and the SSL certificate of business too?  Are you starting to see any entry from the more BBB orientated companies? ", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "", "Hi Karen, it\u2019s Mark.  I would be happy to address both of those. On the top side, we obviously saw that there is more achievement in the first quarter than we had predicted.  So from a revenue standpoint, the guidance we had given was 4% to 7%.  We are tightening that range 5% to 7% and we will see how the rest of the year goes.  You know it\u2019s deferred so it bleeds out over time as we over achieve.  ", "On the SSL competition side, the short answer is no.  We haven\u2019t seen any increased competition from what we see today, which is almost primarily all at the low end. ", "Sarah Friar \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, so all of the pricing you have done is 100%, just kind of the mid-shift then.  ", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "", "At this point what we saw in the AUR, as mentioned on the VeriSign branded certificate, the AUR there was slack quarter over quarter so there has been a six-quarter decline on the ASP at VeriSign so it flattened out this quarter, which is good news.  We think it\u2019s due to a lot of, at this point, put in place around discounting and is just the sentiment in the market.  ", "I think that, if you remember from Analyst Day, I discussed this accounting and I discussed the mix shift.  I think that is primarily what we see from an AUR standpoint going forward for our mid-shift basis. ", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question from Shaul Eyal \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. ", "Shaul Eyal \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.  ", "", "I might have kind of missed the initial part of the presentation, but back to the AUR.  Assuming that we focus on the VeriSign brands as one, what do you think those could come in the next quarter?  Are they still likely to be flat?     ", "", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "", "Shaul this is Mark.  I would say that we are obviously working to increase them.  I think it\u2019s a good indicator that they are flat in that quarter; actually it was up a little bit.  We are calling it flat here, but its weak and if we continue to reduce discount, I think we can hold the line on pricing.  It is possible that that could increase.

I apologize; I missed some of the call.  I have two questions for you.  First of all, with $50 million in stock buy-back, especially given seeing the turn in the economy, why not ramp up stock buy-back a little bit more aggressively?  Secondly as I think about the price increase starting to roll into the base, what is the average contract length on the domain side?  Why won\u2019t we see a little bit more on the uptick of operating margins, especially given the out performance that we saw this quarter as the price increase starts to roll into the base? ", "Brian G. Robbins", "", "Hi Todd, this is Brian.  I will take the buy-back question.  As we spoke on prior calls, our position on buybacks hasn\u2019t changed.  We still have approximately $650 million of authorized shares repurchases and we will continue to buy back [the creep] and be in the market on an as-needed basis and look at ways to return value to the shareholders.  So I can\u2019t really comment anymore on buy backs.  ", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "", "Hi Todd, this is Mark.  On the APL side, we are pretty consistent in a 1.17 on the APL, so that hasn\u2019t changed in a while.  Then on your question on the margins, obviously margins will slow from the increase on the base and we will see that again.  You know it is deferred, it takes time for that all to hit.  That is one of the reasons why we are saying 39.5% to 40% on the exit margin; previously we said 39% to 39.5%.

It is possible that someone has already asked about this.  You had pretty nice increases quarterly.  Where can those continue to go?  ", "Brian G. Robins", "Hi Katherine, this is Brian.  As Mark just answered in the previous question that Todd had, we increased guidance from 39.5% to 40% on operating margin on an exit basis.  As we went into the first quarter this year we intentionally wanted to see the revenue visibility within the quarter and held back expenses.  We expect in Q2 that we will be between 39% and 40%.   ", "", "Katherine Egbert \u2013 Jefferies & Co", "", "Okay, thank you.  I\u2019m sorry about that.  I\u2019m juggling multiple calls here.  One other quick one, are there anymore costs in the model from the divestitures?  Is there anything left?", "Brian G. Robins", "", "There really is not.  Most everything is out.  We are sort of at the base employee count.  We entered the quarter with approximately 2,200 employees.  There is differing here and there.  It is just optimization of the divestitures being completed.  We are re-designing some of our internal infrastructure and it is just so there is no material cost left to be taken out. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Phillip Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Phillip Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi guys, great quarter.  I just have a question back on the domain name side.  If you look at the gross adds, it is actually pretty solid acceleration here.  Even during the economic downturn, gross adds were relatively flat.  It was your renewal rate that actually declined.  Now that gross adds seem to be accelerating and the turn rate seems to be coming down here as well, what do you think that translates into positively for a gross rate when you look at this year and next in domain names?  Also do you expect to see a similar acceleration in gross adds for the rest of this year? ", "Brian G. Robins", "Let me take that in reverse.  As far as the rest of the year, we have seasonality in the business as I mentioned, so we talked about 2 million to 2.3 million names in the next quarter.  If you look back historically last year on the percentage declined quarter-over-quarter for the first quarter to the second quarter on seasonality, that would actually be stronger for performance than we have seen historically, even taking seasonality. ", "So we think based on what we saw in the first quarter, we can have better performance into the end of the second quarter if not throughout the rest of the year.  It looks like it is going down obviously, but that is just seasonality.  I compare it to previous years and it looks pretty strong.  ", "Sorry and you had the first part of the question.  Can you repeat that? ", "Phillip Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "What do you think about where you actually think the renewal rate can trend towards?  Obviously it is bottoming, we are bottoming out here.    ", "Brian G. Robins", "Yes.  Well in the past we have seen a normalized renewal rate in the 70%, 71%, and 72%.  Obviously based on what we saw in the fourth quarter, now the first quarter expectations as you go forward I would say are maybe 71% to 72% as opposed to 70% to 71%.  Like I said, if you go historically looking at things taking out the whole PPC period, those rates are fairly normal.

In other words with the economy picking up, is it starting to be new business creation?  Is it advertising?  What do you think the source is on the new names being added to the base?  ", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "", "I think it is the mix of a few things, Sterling.  The overages in the quarter from what our expectations were really were driven both by an increased renewal rate as well as new registrations.  So if I break those two things apart for a second, on the renewal side we know that the registrars have been working hard over the last year to increase the renewal rates just because it is easier to keep those than find new businesses.  It\u2019s less expensive and that appears to be working out for them, plus I think people are just more confident about the economy and that always translates well for us. ", "On the new stuff side, like I said in the first quarter there is a lot of marketing that is done that is generally really geared up for the rest of the year.  That was more successful this year than in previous years; probably because people are feeling more confident.  Internationally we keep seeing really nice international growth as well.  ", "I don\u2019t think the factors have really changed about what we drive the business for, it is just that they are coming through stronger in a better economy.  ", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "I caught your comments on the SSL side about the AUR being flat and the VeriSign brand being kind of a mix, but what I missed a little bit of because we are all juggling multiple calls.  What do you think the overall AUR would be in the June quarter if you made a comment to that?  ", "", "Brian G. Robins", "I didn\u2019t on that.  I would say if I look back a couple, what\u2019s the rate of decline, the declination rate for the AUR, it\u2019s been pretty consistent over the last two or three quarters.  Last quarter has actually slowed down a little bit.  This quarter is consistent with the quarter before that.  So I would say we could probably expect that the next couple of quarters will be the same or a slightly better rate or a little slower rate of decline before we start to turn in the other direction.  I think that\u2019s got a lot to do with the way the money flows in this business on a different month. ", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Then the last question would be is there any update on the global TLD, some of the new initiatives?  I know it\u2019s more for 2011, but in terms of processes is there any more color in terms of the ones that maybe I\u2019ve identified that you want to go after, process, etc., etc.? ", "Mark D. McLaughlin", "No.  There are some TLDs that we would pursue.  We haven\u2019t ever said what those would be for obvious reasons, so we don\u2019t tip our hand.  So none of that\u2019s changed in the sense that we know which ones we like and we know which ones we would go after.  From a process standpoint, there really have been no changes on that process standpoint that would be that any of that is coming down the pike sooner than June 2011 as far as it actually being done and implemented.   ", "Sterling Auty \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Last question that will go to you in terms of the comment they made, I think it was Katherine, the exit rate on the margins was the 39% to 40% for the year, but did you actually make a comment about the operating margin for June?", "Brian G.

The sequential increase wasn\u2019t as fast as the total name base.  I know there are some other registry services that you have in there.  Why aren\u2019t those growing as fast?  What\u2019s going on with dot TV and some of the other things?  I realize they are modest to revenue, but they don\u2019t seem to be pacing in terms of growth.  ", "Brian G.

You saw the increase in deferred revenue that will eventually flow out of revenue.  So you don\u2019t see that there was sort of a mismatch this quarter and you will see those come more inline over the next couple of quarters.

On the who do we sell to, the plan is to at least two groups of folks.  The first one we are after is a broad-broad market that we\u2019ve never addressed before, which would be sites that do not require SSL certificates.  So they are non-transactional sites in nature.  There are ten times more sites in that category than folks who would be in the ecommerce SSL total addressable market. ", "That is where we started and that is where we are right now.  We will increase that into our existing SSL base in the July time frame when we take that into our core customer base.  From a sales perspective, we are doing two things.  The first is we have hired some sales people just to sell this, so that we are going to get trainers.  The trainers, we are going to have special people who are specialized in this.  We are training right now our existing SSL sales force so that they can sell into the existing SSL base come the July time frame.

I think if you look back over the, like I like to do over a ten year period, take out the anomalies of the dot com bust and the PPC , 75% to 76% renewal rate not be historical norm, it\u2019s a bit lower than that.  I think we are approaching or at the more historical norm for the business, so it\u2019s going to get higher than it is today. Yes, we\u2019ve seen that before.  I think if it\u2019s going there it\u2019s going to continue to do like it\u2019s done in the last few quarters which is an incremental basis of moving up a bit, on a quarter to quarter basis.", "Walter Pritchard - Citi      ", "", "Within that improvement do you see over the last say two or three quarters, can you give us a little bit more detail [inaudible] renewal rate on brand new names, is that a permanent renewal rate on the people that have renewed more than once or is it a combination?", "Mark D.

Robins", "From the marketable securities perspective, we have historically been in treasuries as very, very low yield and we weren\u2019t getting much return on cash due to the credit crisis and so we went into AA or better.  Really into corporate paper and government bonds and we in the first quarter we increased our yield considerably and so for the cash that we have on our balance sheet, we\u2019re just looking at ways to increase the yield, first protecting the capital itself and second, looking for yield and returns.

From a buy-back perspective, you know we bought a lot back in fourth quarter, bought back another $50 million in this quarter.

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting that in the securities you are buying.  You bought $50 million but it\u2019s low relative to the possibility of what you were able.  That\u2019s why I am trying to understand, the decision in the first quarter to stick at $50 million versus more and not, obviously, what you\u2019re going to do forward but how have you decided what it was taking to 50?", "Brian G.

Both our Naming Services and Authentication businesses performed well, as we continue to see favorable economic and Internet trends. But before I could discuss our quarterly results, I want to touch on some other highlights during the quarter. First, as you know, on May 19, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the Authentication Services business to Symantec, with an expected close of the transaction within 90 days of that date. We're on track to close within this time frame. Second, we have an update on the status of the case filed against VeriSign by the Coalition for ICANN transparency or CFIT. As we reported in an 8-K that we filed on July 9, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied VeriSign's motion for rehearing, which means that CFIT's complaint against VeriSign can proceed. The denial is based on the application of law and not the merits of the case. ", "In our view, the amended opinion changes in two respects the court's earlier decision. First, the Court of Appeals changed its opinion by explaining that for purposes of reviewing the sufficiency of the complaint, it was not considering the role of the U.S. government in the 2006 agreement. And second, the amended opinion clarifies the earlier decisions by explaining that competitive bidding is not required as a predicate to complying with the antitrust laws.  Procedurally, we have two options at this point and 90 days to make a decision of which to pursue. We can either request further appellate review or have the case remanded to the District Court for proceedings. We remain confident about our position in the case, and we'll vigorously defend this position.", "Now moving on to financial highlights. Authentication Services was placed into discontinued operations in the second quarter. I'm going to give highlights of continuing operations. Revenue in the second quarter for Naming Services was $168 million, representing a 9% year-over-year increase. Naming Services is comprised of Registry Services and Network Intelligence and Availability. Network Intelligence and Availability is our iDefense and DDoS Mitigation businesses. ", "Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.24 compared to $0.16 in Q2 2009. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.5% compared to 33.9% in Q2 2009. On the cash side, we generated cash from operations of $149 million. And in the quarter, we repurchased 8.1 million shares for $227 million under our repurchase program. Following our share repurchases in the quarter, we had approximately $420 million authorized for share repurchases under our existing repurchasing authority. Last week, the Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by approximately $1.1 billion, tripling our current authorized repurchase plan to $1.5 billion. We've periodically considered repurchases in the form of open market purchases, block purchases, ASRs and other strategies.", "Now moving to the business unit results for the quarter. The base of registered names in .com and .net this quarter totaled 101.5 million names at the end of June, a 9% increase year-over-year. 2.2 million net names were added to the domain name base this quarter, in line with our guidance from last quarter's call of 2 million to 2.3 million names. During the second quarter, we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is a 13% increase year-over-year. The 2010 Q1 renewal rate was 72.1%, up from 71.2% in Q4 2009. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for Q2 2010 will be approximately 72.5% to 73%. For net domain name additions, we expect the Q3 net names added to the base to be between 1.9 million to 2.2 million names, considering the July and August have historically been seasonally slower months.", "On July 1, the price for .com and .net new and renewing names increased from $6.86 to $7.34 and from $4.23 to $4.65, respectively. I'm also excited to announce the recent milestone for VeriSign in the Naming business that we're proud of. DNSSEC, which stands for Domain Name System Security Extensions, was implemented in the root zone in July. DNSSEC is a marriage of cryptography and authentication technologies that validate DNS data, which strengthens the Internet's defenses against  cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks. The technology will help give Internet users more confidence in their online experience.", "DNSSEC is the most significant change to DNS since its creation, and VeriSign technologies were among the elite industry group that made it happen. Designing of the root was a culmination of months of preparation, testing and deployment in coordination with the U.S. Department of Commerce, ICANN and the root server operators. In remarks made at the White House Cybersecurity Policy Review Meeting early in July, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke recognized Verisign's workflow in this groundbreaking accomplishment and praised the effort as an example of successful public-private partnerships. I want to knowledge and thank the DNSSEC group deployment team for their efforts in getting the group DNSSEC-enabled. ", "And now moving to Authentication Services for the second quarter. In Business Authentication, we saw the installed base of SSL Certificates increased to 1.27 million certificates in the second quarter compared to 1.25 million in the first quarter. From a bookings perspective, Business Authentication had another healthy bookings quarter, where bookings again exceeded our plan and exceeded revenue. The annualized average unit revenue, or AUR, for the installed base at VeriSign, GeoTrust and Thawte-branded certificates for the second quarter was $222, which is flat from Q1. While product mix shift has been a consistent trend, we are pleased to see stabilization in AUR this quarter, with the strong bookings that we have seen over the past couple quarters starting to flow direct.", "The feedback on the new Trust Seal product launch in late February continue to be strong. There were two key developments since our last earnings call, including the launch through the partner channel in May and the roll out through existing SSL customers in mid July. And with the impending close of the sale of Authentication, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank all the employees in Authentication Services for their hard work and contribution to VeriSign over the years and wish them the best of success as part of Symantec. This is an exceptionally talented team, and they'll be missed.", "As we look forward post the sale of Authentication, we think we are well positioned in the market for a number of reasons. First, a world-class technology. We have strong technical expertise that's demonstrated by our success in running a scalable network infrastructure, with 100% availability for more than a decade. Second, we are the market leader in a competitively defensible position. We've enjoyed strong unit growth and have a healthy renewal rate in a business that should benefit from continued Internet adoption globally. Third, we have a solid financial position, including strong cash flows and an enviable balance sheet to support the existing business and to pursue evolutionary growth opportunities. And finally, we have a team that is seasoned and possesses unique insight into our industry position and core strengths. We think this will prove to be a potent combination as we move the company forward. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian for additional discussion of our results. Brian?", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Mark, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. As Mark highlighted, and as we discussed on the May call, Authentication Services is classified as discontinued operations for the second quarter. The balance sheet for the second quarter is based on the consolidated operations, with Authentication Services placed in held for sale. ", "We're pleased with our performance this quarter. I would like to highlight a few key financial metrics we reviewed in Analyst Day that we're focused on for the year: Revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow.", "Revenue for Naming Services was $168 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 9% year-over-year. As indicated in our filings, revenue from Registry Services for the operation in .com and .net is in U.S. dollars, so we have minimal FX exposure on the top line. Deferred revenue growth for Naming Services was strong in Q2. We ended the quarter at $641 million, up $24 million or 4% in Q1 and up 11% from the same period in 2009.", "Non-GAAP operating expense were approximately $100 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 2% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.5% in the second quarter compared to 39.4% in Q1.", "The Q2 operating margin includes certain overhead costs associated with Authentication Services that will decrease over time with the transition of the business. I'll discuss that in more detail in a minute following the close of the deal.", "We will continue to focus on cost optimization and efficiency. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $43 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.24 compared to $0.22 in Q1 and $0.16 in the same period in 2009, a 50% increase year-over-year. Contributing to the strong sequential growth was revenue growth and share repurchases during the quarter of 8.1 million shares, resulting in a diluted share count of 183 million shares. We initiated the repurchase of approximately 900,000 additional shares in the second quarter that did not settle until July and thus will be reflected in the third quarter share count.", "Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was approximately $149 million in 2Q. Free cash flow was $131 million in 2Q, given $4 million excess tax benefits and $23 million capital expenditures in the quarter. In the quarter the deal closes, we anticipate an impact to free cash flow as a result of losing Authentication Services working capital to proceeds from sales. Our balance sheet is strong with ending cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash of approximately $1.34 billion, a decrease of $213 million after share repurchases of $227 million. ", "Following the close of the transaction, we anticipate that approximately 35% of our cash balance will be held internationally. We may, at some point, consider repatriation a portion of the cash but recognize that would likely result in significant income taxes. As Mark mentioned, we now have $1.5 billion authorized for share repurchases. With regard to current expectations around the transition of the Authentication Services business to Symantec, as we indicated at the time of the announcement, we expect that the bulk of the transition services agreements, or TSAs, will be completed within a year of the close of the transaction taking us through the first half of 2011. While we exited the quarter with 2,225 employees, 1,100 of those employees are part of continuing operations. We expect headcount to be reduced to fewer than 1,000 employees at some point in late 2011, after the fulfillment of the transition services agreement is completed.", "Following the close, our focus will again be on seeking opportunities to achieve cost optimization as we transition Authentication Services business. VeriSign has taken a disciplined approach to restructure the company over the past three years, and we will continue to focus on that trajectory with the transition of the Authentication business, as well as the implementation of our growth initiatives.", "Moving on to guidance. At this point, we believe we are making good progress to achieve and or exceed the targets we provided on the May call: Naming Services revenue growth for 2010 in the range of 8% to 11%, which is on track based on our performance in the first half of the year, resulting in full year 2010 revenue of between $665 million and $685 million; non-GAAP gross margin in the 77% to 78% range; non-GAAP operating margin in the 40% to 41% range for the remainder of the year. Anticipating closing the transaction on schedule, we expect second quarter 2011 exit operating margin to be in the range of 45%. Non-GAAP other loss net is expected to be $20 million for 2010. Our guidance is based on continued growth and increased operating efficiencies on our business.", "I have covered our performance this quarter and last with key metrics of the business, accomplishments in top and bottom line execution and an overview of our goal for cost optimization going forward. As Mark highlighted, VeriSign is entering a new phase, and we believe we are well positioned in the market to move the business forward. We are fortunate to have a nimble culture that adapts well to change, and I'm confident about our ability to execute effectively. I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and focus. Our continued execution is and has been a testament to their capabilities, dedication and professionalism.", "Thank you for your time this afternoon. Before I turn the call over to the operator to take your questions, I'd like to remind you that Mark will be presenting at the Pacific Crest Technology Leadership Forum on Tuesday, August 10. The webcast registration details are available on the Investor Relations website. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Brian, if you could clarify in the margin, the 45% exit. That's exiting which period?", "Brian Robins", "2Q 2011.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "And then as it relates to the buyback, I thought you guys bought back more stock than we expected, about 230 million in the quarter, and it sounded like you had some settling at the end of the quarter. Were you at all restricted in buying back stock in the quarter? Did you have some program in place to be able to go throughout the quarter and buy back stock? Or just if you could kind of clarify how the buyback proceeded to the quarter, and that be helpful to us understanding it.", "Brian Robins", "So we bought about 8.1 million shares in the quarter. That's reflected in our weighted average share count, and there's 900,0000 shares that settled after the quarter ended. As folks are aware, we had a material transaction that we disclosed during the quarter, and such transaction would prevent certain blackout periods.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "And then just lastly on the renewal rate, I guess, I asked you this last quarter, and it seems like the renewal rate continued to creep up here, or I guess your estimated renewal rate in Q2. Mark, could you talk about, are you seeing different renewal rates on subsequent renewals versus first time? And is that continuing to drag up the renewal rate? Or what was the driver of renewal rate continuing to creep up there?", "Mark McLaughlin", "A couple of things, Walter. We continue to see previously renewed names renewing at a higher rate than first-time renewed names. And then the base is trending more towards previously renewed names, so you get an uptake from that. And the second is last year, as I mentioned, registrars run a number of motions around renewals just given the way the economy was trying to keep customers as opposed to spending a lot of money on new customers, and we're seeing the benefit of that come through the renewal rate now.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Did the pricing increase at all impact the renewal rates as we did hear from some registrars that may have pulled forward some renewal activity into June?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's possible, but if it is based on our looks into this, I think it would be immaterial.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Cummings with ThinkEquity.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "Regarding the employees involved in transition services. Do these tend to be kind of discrete job descriptions? Or could it be people who are involved in recurring activities as well? I'm just kind of asking about how orderly this is going to go. I think you said your going forward headcount is around 1,100 and that will trend down over the next couple of quarters.", "Brian Robins", "Dan, this is Brian. The TSAs are not employee-specific. Some of them are employee-specific but they're more task-specific. And so the TSAs range from one month to 24 months, with most of them ending in about nine to 12 months. And so you will see a gradual roll off of the employees over that time period. And they're designed really to create a smooth transition for the customers. And so it's in both of our objectives to get them done sooner than later. And we are working with the transition team that's working hand-in-hand with Symantec on the agreement and on transitioning the certain capabilities over to Symantec.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "Does it involve contractor people as well? Or are these tend to be full-time employees?", "Brian Robins", "Most of them are full-time employees.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Could you talk about the geographic characteristics of the common net growth, what the contribution was for U.S. versus international registrations?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's Mark. We're fairly consistent in a couple of things. One is the zone today, our zone in .com and .net is approaching 40% on an international basis. So it tends to grow nicely and faster than the domestic base. So we haven't seen any changes in that trend over the last six to eight quarters and its positive effect.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Also on the new global TLDs, any updates on initiatives that you maybe working on there?", "Mark McLaughlin", "In order to do that, we have to have that all group from an ICANN perspective as far as them releasing new ccTLD, which a portion of that is the non-english versions of existing TLDs. And that all still appears to be on track for negotiations applications in 2011 with the launch of those things either late 2011 or early 2012.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And just finally, any updates on progress on the Internet Defense Network and the traction you're seeing there?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, it's good. Let's say, with niche in [ph] business, as you know, so just getting that off that ground, Ben Petro joined us recently to think that over, and his doing a good job with the business. We've got a nice pipeline there. One of the things we have to do, given the sale of the Authentication business to Symantec, it's most of our sales resources are going to Symantec. We have been sharing that to get this business off the ground. So we have a little building effort going on there. But Ben is doing a good job, and it's a little early to talk about specifics because I think it's not material enough yet, but we like what we see there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just in preparation for the close, the TSA agreements that you have, will that flow through other income? Or will that show up in revenue?", "Brian Robins", "Other income. The expense will be above the line and then the revenue will be down in other income.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Exiting 2Q of '11, the 45% operating margin, what are some of the examples of the things that might be left to kind of impact phase out off that will drive up margins once you're through with those TSAs?", "Brian Robins", "There is a number of things, one is on the infrastructure side. Prior to the divestitures, we look at we're building the company where $1.5 billion in revenue, 5,500 employees. And so the corporate infrastructure on the system side is currently slated for a lot more capacity. If you look at the international facilities, facilities around the world, where we obviously need to slim down our facilities, the maintenance cost on those systems and then just the optimization across the entire company on a number of other areas.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Mark, on the 7.9 million new names that came in during the quarter, you mentioned international, but are there any other kind of trends or sources to those new name additions that you see?", "Mark McLaughlin", "No, Sterling, we're fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter here as far as the sources of the names. So PPC is a dead thing. And it's hard to tell any longer, anymore what's in there at all. So it's really just to where we used to call traditional and then broken out between domestic and international. It continues to trend as we've seen, like I said, the last six or eight quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Back on the TSA agreements, wondering if you could just quantify that for us in dollar terms what you're expecting for the second half? And then also, when you do look at the exit rate in Q2 fiscal '11, you mentioned getting down below 1,000 heads. Is that exit rate of 45% including getting below 1,000 heads or is that still for the second half?", "Brian Robins", "I'll take the headcount first and then I'll talk about the TSAs. On the headcount side, that would be down under 1,000 heads and then we will gradually add back as we look at some of the new investment areas, which would be small and incremental in nature. So you'll see some come out and some net additions, but will be under 1,000 heads. And then on the TSA side, these are structured in a way to the extent that they if they're able to transition them over to Symantec, that the TSAs can be canceled. And so I don't want to give out a number per se and say, \"Hey, here's a number that you can build in your model.\" It maybe longer, it may be shorter, and we want to make sure that the customers have a very smooth transition from VeriSign over to Symantec. You can think about, on an annual basis, it's approximately in the $5 million range. But there may be some puts and takes there on the timing.", "Mark McLaughlin", "And Philip, it's Mark. Just one clarification. What Brian said earlier was the 45% range was the exit rate coming out of Q2 2011, not the full year. And we're reticent trying to call the floor here yet without having developed a 2,000-head employment operating plan yet, which it's just too early to do that.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "And that 45% includes an assumption that you'll be below 1,000 exiting in Q2 correct?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Steve Ashley, Robert W. Baird.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Wondered if maybe qualitatively you could discuss how aggressive you might be buying back your stock once you receive the $1.3 billion in proceeds from the divestiture?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's Mark. We really can't talk about that, but there are a couple of things to highlight here. The increases of the repurchase authorization up to a total of $1.5 billion now and the fact that we bought about $200 million, close to $230 million in the last quarter or so. I think it's safe to say, as we have in previous calls, that we fully -- we have more than enough cash to run the business and we'd be looking for ways to return some [indiscernible].", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Brian, is there any kind of comment you could make around what cash flow from operations might have looked like just in the Naming business?", "Brian Robins", "So we didn't give out any specific, on the last call, any specific data around it. Part and parcel because the cash flow is highly dependent on margin and future price increases. And so we haven't given out specific guidance on what cash flow will be for Naming.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And is there any rule of thumb, maybe on the CapEx side, of what we could think about in for CapEx needs on the Naming side?", "Brian Robins", "Yes. When we had our last call, we said 8% to 10% of revenue. And so you can expect the CapEx and then maybe some confusion around the CapEx that we reported this quarter. The balance sheet is still consolidated and the P&L was reported into discontinued operations and continuing operations. The CapEx reported this quarter was about 60% Naming and about 40% Authentication.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Owens of Pacific Crest.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "Given that you've got three consecutive quarters of strong double-digit new name growth and you have an improving renewal rate here, how should we think about net new names going forward? Could we see them kind of transition up to a new level for 2011?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's possible, Rob. We're looking at on the new names coming in the system about a 13% increase in the quarter-over-quarter basis, which is up nicely. So if we go back historically, that's the number that is a high number over the last eight, going on nine quarters. So we've got a nice combination going here if it sticks, of more than double-digit growth on new names coming in and renewal rates trending up nicely as well. So I think we could see nine plus percent unit growth for a while.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Mark, maybe just a follow-up to that question on the Naming growth. As the new gTLDs come next year, what have you got [ph] is kind of change it could make to the growth you've got in .com and .net, if any?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think it's positive. So a couple of things. One is just related to .com and .net, with the introduction of new TLDs, the expectation that just brings more people to the market. We generally do find that when more people shop to the market. And the second thing, we intend to participate with some of those [indiscernible] growth opportunities for us.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "On a follow-up on the lawsuit, is there anything that you can do other than going back to court or taking it to Supreme Court or whatever? Just settle and put it behind you or is that just not even an option that can be pursued?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It is an option that could be pursued, but it's not one of the things that I've mentioned that we're -- the few choices we have procedurally, as the case today.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was wondering if you could talk about the contract duration around the Naming business and talk about how we should expect the most recent price increase to kind of flow in to the base?", "Mark McLaughlin", "By contract duration, do you mean the average term license?", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "The Name, yes.", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's holding steady at about 1.17 for names that have been in the cage for a while now. So no expectations that would change up or down dramatically for the time being. And then as far as the flow through of the price increase, we've said that, that would be immaterial for this year and then the deferred impact we'd enter it next year.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And if we look at the 1.17, is it fair to think that the majority of names are one year and then there are some type of barbell where you have a bunch of names that are multi-year?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's possible. One of the things that we don't get to see, Todd, is is that registrars will sometimes sell a name for more than one year to a registrant so they collect the money from the registrant for more than one year. But for cash management purposes, they'll turn around to us and register it for a year at a time. So we may only be seeing a year of a name when somebody registers for three years. We'll get all three, but as far as day one, it looks like one year to us.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Can you talk about under the existing .net and .com agreements, your future price increases and what the timing around announcements would be contractually?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, in both .com and .net, we have the ability to take one remaining current price increase under the current terms of the contract. We chose to do so and if we did that, we would have to give six months advance notice and it would take an impact next year, May 2011. That's as far away as we could go since we've taken one and it took effect in 2010. If we were to do another one, we'd furlough the effective date effective in 2011.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Given the commentary around the renewal rate kind of ticking up here, is it fair to read into that, that you guys are not seeing any kind of price sensitivity from the price increases?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think that would be, I wouldn't be prepared to make that statement, Todd. I think that there's a number of things to be applied here, which is like I said, more names in the base that had previously been renewed, renewing at a higher rate, and then also some of the renewal programs that have been run by the community, I think are primarily what's going on here.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "If you think Pay Per Click has really gone away, do you think the traditional base is price sensitive at current levels?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think that the traditional base is price sensitive at the current levels. I think that what traditional base is trying dig in a lot of value from the name, for whatever purposes you're using it or they like to keep them so they're buying them and they renew them.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll next go to Craig Nankervis with First Analysts (sic) [First Analysis].", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Just to be sure I understand, given the renewal programs that you were referring to, is that a one-time thing or is that ongoing? In other words, in Q3, would there be reasonable likelihood that the renewal rate might go down from Q2?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I'll take that in two parts, Craig. One is programs are generally run all the time. They tend to be in one or two categories. They're either run for new names being sold or renewals, and we've seen the registrar community focus on those more heavily at different times for various reasons. So as far as how they're spending their money, they generally go to those two categories. So does the renewal rate go down from this part [ph], yes, it's possible and if it were the case, then one of the things could be if you had more first-time names up for renewal in a specific quarter, then another quarter, you might see a slight decrease because of that. But as a general matter, we'd said that healthy historical renewal rates trending in the business look to be like in the 70% to low 70%. We saw that last year and we think we're seeing that here.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Scott Kessler, Standard and Poor's.", "Scott Kessler - S&P Equity Research", "So I got on the call a little late so I apologize if this question or the gist of it was already asked, but basically what I'm looking for is some detail around going forward, what the growth strategy is given that you're now essentially going to be meaner and meaner, if you will. And in addition to the notion of international growth, which is something that I think a lot of people see in front of you guys, can you give us a sense of where you see the growth coming from and if, potentially, acquisitions might play a part in that? I know it's ironic to some extent that you're completing this divestiture and I'm asking about acquisitions, especially given that obviously, you guys have talked about looking at some things, but not really necessarily having been able to move forward on them for whatever reason. But I'm wondering if you could provide some comments.", "Mark McLaughlin", "So I think of things in three kind of categories there. The first is just in our core business around .com and .net, we tend to benefit from their growing use of the Internet on a global basis. So if you look at the trend, folks coming online, broadband penetration, e-commerce sales, advertising sales, all those things tend to benefit us if they're growing. And all indications are that they will continue to grow for quite some time despite the recessionary that we. So things seem to be back on uptick there. So first and foremost, we believe it will, in fact, continue to grow just from being -- benefiting at having a central location, if you will, on a fast-growing Internet infrastructure on a global basis. The second thing is we have growth opportunities right around that infrastructure related to like the new gTLDs I just discussed, both the new gTLDs themselves plus the internationalized version of the TLDs we run today. And if you take into account everything I've been saying about international growing very nicely, we think that there's some growth opportunities around the non-English versions of the TLDs we run. So that's the second category. And the third category is in the infrastructure itself. So we spent, we continue to spend a lot of time and money on the infrastructure on .com and .net. And in doing that, we know that we have had to do things for a number of years for ourselves to make that infrastructure robust and secure and scalable. And we turn our attention recently to providing services around that for other folks. So we're utilizing some of our learnings from the network, and that some of the things in this network intelligence and availability to discuss we currently have the Investment Mitigation service. We have the network for intelligence. We recently launched a Managed DNS service. And you'll see us do more services that are very close in around the infrastructure itself where we can utilize what all the work and experience we have there. In to the last part of your question, from an acquisition standpoint, I said earlier that you should not expect us to go off and do a big acquisition or try to leverage our way into a different industry. I don't see that in our future. If we have the opportunity, in any of the areas I just went through, to do bolt-on acquisitions that would give us higher growth rates that we're seeing today on things that we understand very, very well and if we can get an attractive price, we would be open to look at that. But we're being very careful and disciplined in doing that.", "Scott Kessler - S&P Equity Research", "If I could just also follow up on a prior question, it seems to me like to some extent, you commented on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, denying, I guess, your request for a dismissal. I'm wondering if you'd give us a sense of what the next steps are going to be in the related timetable there?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I wanted to clarify in my prepared comments I said that -- let me answer your question and I'll clarify. The -- procedurally one or two things can happen with the case right now. We could request further appellate review, which means we could request a review at the Supreme Court level. Or if we don't do that, if we choose not to do that, then the case would be what's called remanded back to the District Court where a trial would start. We have 90 days from the date of the Ninth Circuit decision, which was on July 9, to make the decision as to which of those two avenues we would go.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kerry Rice with Wedbush.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Just maybe a quick clarification. You guys, in the latest 8-K, indicated that you are moving the facilities or headquarters kind of everything to Dulles, and the needless doubt [ph] kind of the total incurred cost of being about $35 million to $38 million. Is that all related to the move or is that just the cost associated to the move that are included in that in the $35 million to $38 million is just all in now what we expect related to the cost of the Authentication business sale?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian. There's a couple -- there is a restructuring related to the Authentication sale and then there is the restructuring related to moving Corporate Services from California to the Dulles area; and its outplacement, severance, retention, a lot of exit costs and so forth. And so that's not -- if you have a lease here, you break a lease, there's certain exit costs associated with that and so that's in there.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Is there a way to break out those two from the $35 million? You've got the $21 million related to the severance costs and the $14 million to $17 million related to the excess facility. Is that the way to think about the breakout of those two or are there mixed in there so it's not that easy to break it?", "Brian Robins", "That's the way to think about it.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Moving to the Dulles area, is going to occur about the same time that the Authentication Services business sale is closed. Is that correct?", "Brian Robins", "It'll be over the next six to 12 months. There would be a transition related to that.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "I know that you've got some verbage in here talking about estimates, but can you talk at all about potential cost savings or additional costs, besides the kind of separation cost that are related to the move? Is that a move that helps you save cost and if you can't, can you quantify them? Or is there -- the rent higher, how should we think about the impact?", "Brian Robins", "There will be a little increase immediately because you'll have a duplication staff on both those. And then once you have a transition completely done, you'll see lowering cost since we have a smaller and more simple business. You'll see lots of back office staff, supporting sort of the front office, if you will. So you will see a reduction over time. And part of what really drove the decision to move from California to Dulles was the fact that 95% of our business is based on the East Coast. And for the people in the back office supporting the business, just better efficiency that they're located closer, same time zone.", "Kerry Rice - Wedbush Securities Inc.", "Is this all kind of inclusive of the below 1,000 headcount or it will only be addition to that due to this move?", "Brian Robins", "That's built in to the below 1,000 headcount.", "Operator", "And we'll next go to Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "You mentioned the DNSSEC, is that a homegrown technology or are you using or working with some other security vendors?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Shaul, it's Mark. We're working with a number of vendors so DNSSEC is -- the best way to think about is that it's a standard that has been developed over the past 10 years by the IETF, a lot of groups involved with this. And then based on that standard, it's now being rolled out across the entire domain name system, which will affect the Internet. The very first step in that is to apply at the root level and some serve [ph] runs to root servers, the A and the K. We were involved for the last 10 years in working on this with a whole host of folks in standards, bodies, industry, ICANN, Commerce Department [Department of Commerce] international governments, a lot of players. What you'll see now is the DNSSEC technology rolled out across the entire domain name system, .com, .net, other TLDs, etc. ISPs will do some updates. So this is just the beginning of a large scale rollout, but it's taken some time to get everything dealt with.", "Operator", "And with that, this does conclude today's Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call to Nancy Fazioli for closing.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions for this call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for VeriSign Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Nancy Fazioli, Director of Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Mark McLaughlin, President and CEO; and Brian Robins, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast through our investor relations website located at investor.verisign.com. Please refer to our website for important information, including the Q3 2010 earnings press release. A replay of this call will be available on our website within a few hours. Today's slide presentation will also be available for download after the call.", "Financial results in today's press release are unaudited, and the matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail on our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

In a moment, Mark and Brian will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with the performance of the business this quarter. We continue to see strength in the Internet trends that drive our business. Also, the team's ongoing operational discipline and execution leading up to and following the close of the sale of Authentication Services is helping to drive positive results. There is still a lot of work to be done as we transition the Authentication business. We're very focused on a smooth transition, which is on track, in which we expect to be largely completed in the mid-2011 time frame. I'll now cover the highlights of our financial results from the third quarter.", "Revenue in the third quarter for a Naming Services was $172 million, representing an 11% year-over-year increase. Naming Services is comprised of Registry Services and Network Intelligence and Availability or NIA services. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.27 compared to $0.16 in Q3 2009. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43.1% compared to 33.7% in Q3 2009.", "During the quarter, we utilized $146 million of cash to repurchase 5.1 million shares, leaving us with repurchased authorization of approximately $1.4 billion. In August, we received $1.28 billion in proceeds from the sale of the authentication business, which brings our cash balance at the end of the third quarter to $2.55 billion, approximately 65% of which is held domestically.", "Operationally, in Naming Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net this quarter totaled 103.5 million names at the end of September, a 9% increase year-over-year. $2 million net names were added domain name base this quarter.", "During the third quarter, we processed 7.5 million new registrations, which is a 7% increase year-over-year. The 2010 Q2 renewal rate was 73.2%, up from 72.1% in Q1 2010. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days at the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for Q3 2010 will be approximately 73%. For that domain name additions, we expect the Q4 net names added to the base to be between 1.7 million and 2 million names.", "Q4 has a larger expiring name than in the third quarter and an increased number of first-time renewing names and expiring name base. In addition, in some previous years in the fourth quarter, we have seen some registrars doing year-end inventory reviews, resulting in some deletions at the very end of the year. While we review accounts on a regular basis, it is possible that there could be some deletions resulting from this kind of activity. It would not appear in our regular account reviews.", "On the infrastructure front, the growth of the Internet, that is positive for our business, will continue to put increased demands on our infrastructure. In the third quarter, we processed an average $66 billion DNS queries per day, up from $63 billion queries on average per day last quarter. Also last quarter, I highlighted exciting developments with the implementation of DNSSEC [indiscernible] and a forthcoming implementation in the .net zone later this year and the .com zone next year. This is one of the most significant security enhancements for the DNS ever, and we are proud of our leadership role there. As we continue to show leadership for the next digital decade, we will plan to continuously invest in our infrastructure to enhance our readiness for any future DNS requirements.", "Finally, as I know it is an area of interest for investors, we will continue to update you with regard to public developments and the case filed by the Coalition for ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign. In August, we regressed at the case management conference with the District Court to begin the process to resolve this matter through summary disposition or trial. That conference was held on Friday, October 22, and the court established a timeline for the litigation, including among other things, adopting the parties for post schedule for summary judgment on certain threshold issues with a hearing set for March 2011. And for final summary judgment, with the hearing set in October 2011, the court also set the trial date for December 5, 2011. Beyond the procedural updates, given that this is an ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and we'll defend our position vigorously.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Mark, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Mark gave you the highlights for the quarter, so I'd like to just dive into the key financial metrics that we're focused on for the year, revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. As we noted, revenue for Naming Services was $172 million, up 3% from the prior quarter and up 11% year-over-year. From a continuing operations perspective, we are still on track to wind down the final non-core business, Content Portal Services or CPS in Q4. The business contributed $364,000 in revenue during the quarter to bring continuing operations revenue to $173 million.", "Deferred revenue for Naming Services ended the quarter at $654 million, an increase of $13 million or 2% from Q2, and up 13% from the same period in 2009. Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $98 million, down 2% quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43.1% in the third quarter compared to 40.5% in 2Q. As we noted last quarter, there are number of moving parts related to the transition of the Authentication Services business to Symantec. We expect to have those substantially completed by midyear 2011. But in the interim, we may see some variability in operating margins as we head toward the 45% range in the second quarter of 2011 as we discussed last quarter.", "A quick comment on the Transition Services Agreement with Symantec. We still expect that bulk of the TSAs to be completed in mid-2011. Note that the income from the TSA hits other income line, and the reasonable estimate is still $5 million for the second half of 2010, as well as for the first half of 2011. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $48 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 compared to $0.24 in Q2 and $0.16 in the same period in 2009, a 69% increase from 3Q 2009.", "We exited the third quarter with a diluted share count of 175 million shares. During the third quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was negative $82 million in a 3Q, a one-time impact cash resulting from taxes related to the sale of Authentication Services.", "Free cash flow was $47 million in Q3, given $155 million in excess tax benefits and $26 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Year-to-date capital expenditures are running $69 million, which includes approximately $20 million in spend during the year related to Authentication Services. Eight to 10% of the new revenue run rate is still a reasonable way to think about CapEx going forward for the remaining business.", "Just an additional note to clarify, the significant increase net of tax benefits, we would have paid cash taxes related to the sale of Authentication Services if not for net operating losses related to stock options. Due to the use of the stock option NOLs, the cash flow statement must reflect the classification of $155 million as the use of cash and cash from operations and the source of cash in the financing section of the cash flow statement. In the Appendix our slide presentation, that will be posted on the website following the call, we have a cash flow reconciliation that you may find helpful.", "Moving on to guidance. At this point, we believe we are making good progress to achieve or exceed our full year guidance. Naming Services revenue growth for 2010 of approximately 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the 77% to 78% range. Q4 exit non-GAAP operating margin increased to 42% to 43% from previous guidance of 40% to 41%. Non-GAAP other loss, net is expected to be a $20 million for 2010. Our guidance is based on continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business.", "I would like to express appreciation of our employees during this transitional time in the business. Their hard work has enabled us to keep the transition of divested businesses on track. I'm very proud of the operational discipline the team has shown over the past several quarters. Going forward, we believe that we will be able to scale the business to a smaller footprint while continuing to seek opportunities to grow.", "Thanks for your time today. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to our first question from Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "First of all, can you just talk about the stock buyback? Anything that prevented you in the quarter from buying stock were you guys blacked out as a result of the Symantec transaction at all? Just trying to get a sense for what we should be thinking run rate? And then secondly, can you talk about potential pricing? I know you you're guiding for -- well, I won't call it conservative, but net adds down here in Q4 with the growth profile still seems pretty healthy on a unit basis. And what's the likelihood that we'll get the last price increase announced?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Todd, it's Mark. On the buyback side, we don't comment on any blackout periods we may be. So I really can't get into the details about that. All what we can do is report what we've done at the end of the quarter, in the quarter. So I really can't get anything further than that. And on the pricing side, also as you know we've taken three out of four of the deposit price increases, we couldn't comment whether we intend to take the fourth one or when either as well. So we do think about those, as we mentioned before, take a lot of things into account. So you look at those included the economy, how the business is doing, how the registrar is doing and some other factors. A lot of positives in a lot of those areas today, but we can't comment as to if or when we take the next price increase.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Mark, maybe you could help us out because .net auto renews, I think, June of next year. So what's the time frame if you wanted to take one more price increase across .net? Can you do it all the way up until June? Or is there some time frame when you have to do that?", "Brian Robins", "We could take the pricing. We could notice a price increase in .net right up to the end of the term of the contract. If you were within six months or you noticed inside that six-month notice period, then the increase would take effect post the renewal.", "Operator", "And for our next question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "Was curious on the new names added this quarter. It's slowed sequentially, I think, it was the first, kind of single digit number you've seen in a while. And do you think this is a function of just tougher compares? Is this something you're seeing in the economy? Anything from a geography standpoint?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Rob, it's Mark. No, I think on the new units that came in to the -- we got two million net units which is about a strong shelling, and then on the new side, we have $7.5 million. If you look back on historical basis over the last few years, I think three year and a half average, on that means that quarter is about $7.3 million. So it's actually pretty strong showing for net units if you look backwards.", "Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.", "And then second, you guys filed a couple of patents recently. At least I think it was published that were patents filed. Just with regard to scoring and ranking of traffic into domain names, any comment there is that for future potential services you guys are looking at?", "Mark McLaughlin", "We do a lot of intellectual property work, Rob. So we have over 200 patents on file that have been issued or are being filed. So that's regular course of business for us to try to protect intellectual property that we develop, and we wouldn't get into specifics as to what we would do to commercialize unless we have already done so.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I was just wondering, is there any change in the sources for the new names? You talked about the momentum that's building. But is there any new factors that has helped driving name growth?", "Mark McLaughlin", "The big picture around this is that we continue to see good growth in the base itself and then we can peel back on the renewals. Those are going up nicely mostly because the previously renewed base is increasing. And then on the new units, the sources are continuing to be the same, strong international growth. And inside that growth, in the unit standpoint, the BRIC countries continued to deliver very nicely. So there's no dramatic shifts in the good trends we have been seeing.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then on the renewal rate, anything that we should think about in terms of the renewal rate as we enter from its seasonal factor both the third and fourth quarter and then longer-term into the 2011 time frame?", "Mark McLaughlin", "We had more expiring names this quarter than last quarter. So we always have to watch how many names are in the expiring base. So that doesn't impact the renewal rates. It impacts the math as a result of those things. And then on the mix, we will have slightly more expiring names, first time expiring names in the mix. So the combination of those things comes out awashed on the overall renewal rate. An expiring base is fairly steady as a percentage of the base, but we're not really expecting because the base is getting bigger. Does that make sense?", "Operator", "Next question comes from Walter Pritchard with the Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "I was just wondering, now that you guys have SSL closed, do you guys have any more clarity on the timing of transition expenses and how we should think about lumpiness in terms of margins going forward?", "Brian Robins", "Tim, this is Brian. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Transition Services Agreement going to mid-2011, and the Transition Services Agreements are broken into things that can be taken out in the business such as staff that are doing billing and collections and international locations. But the majority of it is network services and infrastructure that we're providing that we'll keep post-transition. And so we expect mid-next year for that to be complete. And the lumpiness in the margins, you'll probably see for the next two quarters.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "And then secondly on headcount, I think you guys are flat this quarter. Is that the number we should expect the company to be at going forward? Or you expect us to fill up over the next few quarters?", "Mark McLaughlin", "There's a couple of puts and takes on headcount, and so we're trying to manage the business to an overall margin profile and not necessarily to our obtain for a headcount profile. We're ramping down on the West Coast and ramping up on the East Coast. We have duplication for a period of time. And then also there's a number of headcount related to the CSAs. As those are [indiscernible], the headcount going down. Then we're also investing back into NIA network in our operability and availability. So there's some puts and takes. So the headcount for probably the next two to three quarters will be one quarter, it may go down, next quarter it may go up just because of the puts and takes related to the Transition Services Agreement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Chloe Wayne", "This is Chloe Wayne for Phil Winslow. Could you comment at all on your expectations for the managed DNS business in the near-term? And how should we think about the margin profile going forward as you continue to ramp it up? And just as a follow-up, when you look at competitors, like UltraDNS from NeuStar, what does managed DNS bring to the people?", "Mark McLaughlin", "On a general manner, we look at the market opportunity there. We look at the overall market is about $900 million market that is expected to grow at about 15% on an annual CAGR for the next three to five years. So the market opportunity itself was attractive. When you get inside that market, it's fairly fragmented market as far as who the players are. So we believe that given the network we have and the experience we have on that network, we have a competitive advantage there plus some name brand repetition that will help us from a selling perspective. So we haven't any guidance as to the business itself. It's not material to date at this point. But we like the space itself, and we will be involved in this space and try to grow that business. Relative to other folks that market from a managed DNS standpoint, other players have a list of services or suite of services of which Managed DNS is one of them, and we have that offering as well. So the idea is to provide ultimately an end solution were DNS-related services that are internal and external DNS.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sarah Friar with Goldman Sachs.", "Sarah Friar - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Mark, can you talk a little bit about some of the newer things like DNSSEC? What can that mean in terms of a revenue opportunity for next year in terms of how much you charge customers, what sort of penetration do you think that you'll get? And then some of the other things that ICANN is working on like the new IDNs and the new TLDs. How do you think about that revenue opportunity and potential impact to your core registries?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sure, on the DNSSEC side, there's two aspects left for us. On the core naming business itself, DNSSEC is the cost it's not a revenue generator because we have to do work in order to implement DNSSEC. It's a good thing for the infrastructure for the world using infrastructure. On the flip side of potential revenue opportunity in our NIA business, things like IPv6, DNSSEC, they make the network in DNS more complicated. So there's an opportunity there to help manage that on an outsourced basis as folks say this is more complicated and we like somebody to help us out with that. So it's across added revenue opportunity for us, but they're different sides of the business. And on the IDN side, we expect the new ccTLD in which we consider the idea and versions of common net to fill out the application process mid-2011 and be granted sometime in 2012. So the time frame as far as market expectations, we think these are opportunities for us. We're trying to be a bit measured on that given two factors that we know and this is a rough analogy. The one thing we know is that the IDNs that during com net base today, the English IDNs. Meaning comps is still on English like calm in front of it. That's about 1 million names in the base today and our base and that. And then on the global basis come if you look at ccTLD, it will be some countries that would be the prime suspects, if you will, for as far as sales that are in cyrillic or some other languages that's not English. There's about 16 million, 17 million total ccTLD that turn those languages. So it's a little hard to be specific if this one is where to come in. But we try to use those sort of English [indiscernible].", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "As you look out and I know I heard you say Managed DNS is very small and young for you. As you look out, can you talk about your expectations for the distribution model? Why wouldn't this be another wholesale opportunity to work through the big tech partners like Go Daddy into it, Symantec and in small medium business? And would you expect it will be a mix of wholesale and the direct retail relationships at the high-end?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, Dan. I think the answer is yes to all that. You got the right idea there. This looks like a traditional sales model where you'd go to market from a small field team going to the high end and then you have an inside sales force against. Getting into mid-market and then you have channel partners at the lower end of the market. And that lower end of the market is where we put our national partners and registrars discussions about the disturbing all these services. But we intend to cover the gamut of the market through those distribution channels.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to our next question from Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I wonder if you could just shed any light on your broader thoughts on potential uses of cash for M&A or the possibility of a special dividend before the end of this year?", "Mark McLaughlin", "In the past, as we've said, we continue to view it this way. From an M&A standpoint, while it's possible that we could do some smaller deals that would help us, from a product roadmap standpoint or a go to market perspective, if we were to do something like that, we would need a few requirements to this core business. It wouldn't be large in size, and it would look at that weight something on the roadmap or go to market. So clear on what we do that. So speak in terms of what we might do and what the likely to do is new industries and we'll likely do anything like that. So from the perspective of using cash farm an M&A standpoint.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "As you look at opportunities to provide registry service, I would say when some of the new global TLDs come online, I know you talked about this as an opportunity. Have you done an analysis of what the business profile and margin profile of these types of services might -- how they might compare to your existing business?", "Mark McLaughlin", "There's two ways to look at that, both where we think are attractive. One is for a new TLD that we might want to go after ourselves and run outside of any marketing we have to do around that. From an operational standpoint, we have a lot of economy skills to add a new TLD on there. And secondly, if we were to back end registry provider for somebody else who have the TLD, we would still enjoy the network efficiencies we have by putting a new TLD on an existing structure. So from a margin perspective, would expect this is attractive for us.", "Operator", "And now for our last question from Craig Nankervis with First Analyst (sic) [First Analysis].", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "For you Mark, the guidance for Q4 net name ads is almost flat year-over-year at the midpoint. I guess I was a little surprised at that. Are there any factors on the negative side this year that's influencing your forecast versus your results a year ago?", "Mark McLaughlin", "There's a couple of things you're looking at there, Craig. One is when we looking at the expiry may be is relative to the third quarter, we have more expiring names in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. And then the second thing is we have slightly higher next mix in the third quarter and fourth quarter of names that are expired and up for renewal for the first time. As you may know, the first time renewal rate is substantially lower than the previously renewed.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "I'm so more focused than that in Q3. But I'm not going to do that in Q4 last year versus what you're guiding for Q4 this year. And I'm trying to understand if there's any end of year dynamics that are different this year and end of year dynamics versus last year?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think the dynamics is the same. We've seen a couple of times in the past like in the script that you might do the end of the year that might not be aware of, given an account review that would happen or not. But from a dynamic standpoint, it's the same.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation", "Brian, sales and marketing was much lower than I expected, is $18 million on a non-GAAP basis. Is that sort of a baseline going forward?", "Brian Robins", "It will be. There's a couple of things in sales and marketing. In the second quarter, we had some one-time expenses. There was the campaign that Symantec took over into third quarter. So we didn't recognize that in the third quarter where we did in the second quarter. Also we had a one-time program related to the 25th anniversary of .com in the second quarter. So second quarter had a couple of one-time events. And as we won the things that we sold our business we took our enterprise sales force and the process of building that up. So you can expect it to be flattish to where it was now. It will gradually grow over time but with the percent of center revenue it will likely go down.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Katherine Egbert with Jefferies.", "Ignatius Njoku", "It's Ignatius in for Katharine. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the BRIC countries? Are you signing up more registrars?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, the BRIC countries continue to perform well for us. If we get inside the base, about 60% of the base is domestic, and about 39% to 40% of it is international. And then if you get inside the 40% that's international, about 25% of that is, well, I'll call it, emerging, which is primarily BRIC. And if you feel that in one layer lower, then you find out the BRIC countries growth rate units is twice as high as what it might be more mature international countries. So the BRIC countries continue to perform well, but it's off a lower base. But we've seen really big growth there.", "Operator", "I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Fazioli. Please go ahead.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Nancy Fazioli, Director of Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Mark McLaughlin, President and CEO; and Brian Robins, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our new corporate website, www.verisigninc.com. Please refer to that website for important information, including the Q1 2011 earnings press release. A replay of this call will be available on the website within a few hours.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. ", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the company's performance. We are seeing a combination of a record number of new domain name registrations and strengthening in renewal rates. Also, we continue to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. And our balance sheet remains healthy, which allows us to declare a special dividend and to have repurchased $200 million in shares in the first quarter. ", "As a leading Internet infrastructure provider, our business is being driven by the continued growth in underlying Internet trends such as online advertising, e-commerce, more global Internet users and the paradigm shift to cloud computing.  We believe we are well positioned to participate in driving and securing that growth as well as to help our customers strengthen the integrity and effectiveness of their Internet services. ", "Before getting into first quarter results, I'd like to comment on the $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced today. As you may recall, in December of last year, when we paid out a $3 special dividend, we expressed our intention that we would return to shareholders at least the proceeds from the sale of our Authentication Service business, which was approximately $1.3 billion. ", "With the $3 special dividend in December, the $200 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and today's $2.75 special dividend, we have returned an excess to proceeds of that sale to the shareholders. Post this dividend payment of $463 million, as well as the related contingent interest payment of $100 million to holders of our convertible bonds, we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining on the balance sheet.  Following the first quarter share repurchases, we have approximately $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization, which has no expiration. ", "Now I'm moving on to first quarter results. In Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled 108 million names at the end of March. This represents a 9% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. ", "In the first quarter, we processed a record 8.3 million new registrations, which is an approximately 3% increase year-over-year. And in the quarter, we added 2.74 million net names to the domain name base. ", "On the renewal rate side, the Q4 2010 renewal rate was 72.7%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2011 will be between 73.5% and 74%.  We expect the Q2 net names added to the base to be between 2 million and 2.3 million names, which reflect the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality. ", "As many of you are aware, our contract with ICANN for .net comes up for renewal on June 30 of this year. On April 11, we announced that ICANN had posted the negotiated renewal terms for the .net Registry Agreement for public comment. There are no material changes to the terms of the proposed renewal agreement from the existing agreement. ICANN's internal policies call for a comment period for the proposed agreement, which we expect will run for approximately 30 days. And we expect the agreement to be renewed by July 1. ", "I would also like to highlight that we successfully implemented DNSSEC in the .com zone on March 31, following implementation of DNSSEC in .net in December and the root zone last fall. This is a significant accomplishment of both teams, that has been in the works for many years, and that required collaboration with numerous constituencies in the Internet ecosystem. We're proud of the role we played in this multi-stakeholder initiative. ", "With regard to the case filed by the Coalition for ICANN Transparency or CFIT against VeriSign, the court established a timeline for the litigation last October that included a summary judgment hearing this past March on certain threshold issues. That hearing took place in March 11, and the matter is pending with the court. We have no other updates on that motion.", "Also, as noted in our 8-K filed on February 14, the court dismissed CFIT's third amended complaint and allowed for CFIT to amend certain allegations. CFIT subsequently filed a fourth amended complaint, and VeriSign filed an answer to that complaint on March 8. According to the court schedule, final summary judgment hearing is scheduled for October 2011, and a trial date is set for December 5, 2011. Beyond the dates just mentioned, given that this is ongoing litigation, we will not be commenting further other than to reiterate that we continue to feel confident about the case, and we'll defend our position vigorously. ", "With regard to our Network Intelligence and Availability business, we continue to make good progress. On March 31, we announced 2 enhancements to our Managed DNS service, including the rollout of support for DNSSEC compliance features, as well as Geo Location. These services strengthen our offering, and we'll continue to strive for a leadership position in this fast-growing, but bright-end market. With the first quarter results, we're off to a good start for the year, and we look forward to updating you on our progress through the year. ", "Thanks for your time. And I'll now turn the call over to Brian.", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, this was a good quarter for us. And I'm pleased about the progress we made toward our goals. ", "I'd like to add to Mark's comments regarding the $2.75 per share special dividend. We use the dividend as an efficient return to shareholders, given our capital position, following the sale of Authentication Services.  ", "From a taxability perspective, which is impacted by the $100 million contingent interest payment to our convertible bondholders, we believe most, if not all, the dividend would likely be a return of capital to the shareholders, and the remainder would be a qualified dividend as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. ", "Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, preferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. And then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.", "Revenue of $182 million for the first quarter was up 2% from a prior quarter and up 12% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $699 million, an increase of $36 million or 5% from Q4 and up 13% from the same period in 2010. Deferred revenue has been reported on a continuing operations or Naming Services basis since the second quarter of last year. And as of this quarter, the balance sheet is also a clean comparison.", "Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $98 million, down 1% quarter-over-quarter and relatively flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 45.9% compared to 44.3% in Q4. We expect continued margin expansion in line with our previously stated intention of achieving a 46% to 48% exit margin in the fourth quarter of this year. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $55 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.32 compared to $0.31 in Q4 and $0.22 in the same period in 2010.", "Income related to transition services included as part of our nonoperating income on the P&L was approximately $3.5 million in the first quarter. A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is reasonable estimate. In 2011, we will pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, of which $28 million is related to the divestiture of the Authentication Services business. ", "We exit Q1 with the diluted share count of 172 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 500,000 shares based on the average share price during the quarter. Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $90 million in first quarter, noting that bonus payments are made in the quarter. Free cash flow was $78 million in Q1, given $4 million excess tax benefits and $16 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.", "Capital expenditures are on track this quarter and include certain infrastructure initiatives as was facilities-related expenditures corresponding to the move of corporate headquarters. We now believe capital expenditures to be closer to 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facilities spend related to the move of corporate headquarters to our new lease space. ", "To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income faster than revenue. We have a healthy cash position, and the strong cash flow generation capabilities of our business continued to be a key benefit of our financial model. ", "Before I move on to guidance, I want to touch upon the status of the transition of Authentication Services business to Symantec and corporate functions to the east coast. Progress has been good, and we still expect the bulk of the transition to be wrapped up in mid-2011. ", "As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q1 was approximately $3.5 million, and we now expect approximately $2 million in Q2 and approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. I would like to thank the entire team for their collaboration this past quarter. I wish our Mountain View colleagues, moving on to new opportunities in the Bay Area, all the best in their new endeavors. ", "With respect to 2011 guidance, revenue for 2011 will be in the range of $756 million to $780 million or growth of 11% to 14%, up from 10% to 14%. Consistent with 2010, we expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 78%. Q4 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 46% to 48%. Interest expense in nonoperating income net, which I previously referred to as other loss net is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. ", "As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on our forecast expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies. ", "I'm excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe that disciplined execution of opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. ", "With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Two questions. One, I'm wondering if you could talk about -- just on the renewal rate, it seems like the mix here is going more towards existing names, which should drive the renewal rate up and you\u2019ve been a little hesitant to kind of let the assumption that we all use go out there, and you did have a better rate this quarter. I'm just wondering if you could talk about sort of the dynamics there and your expectations going forward on renewals.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sure, Walter. It's Mark. I'll do that. Yes, as we said before in the renewal rates, we look at the mix of the first-time expiring names and previously renewed games. And what we've seen consistently over time is that the previously renewal -- renewed renewal rate is much higher than the first-time expiring names. That continues to be the case. And we've also have a continued shift of the base, moving into the direction of becoming previously renewed names. It's a big base of names. There's a lot of names here, so that shift takes time. But we're -- continued to see it gradually moving in that direction, and we're seeing the benefits now with renewal rate's approaching the 73%, 74% range.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Got it. And then just on the revenue growth rate, I guess, the sequential growth was a little lower than we thought. Especially if compare it to sort of sequential growth rates in revenue in the second half of last year, I'm wondering if you could help us understand if there\u2019s anything in there that drove volatility in sequential growth in Q1.", "Brian Robins", "Walter, this is Brian. There wasn't anything large in there that changed the sequential growth quarter-over-quarter. We had -- our counter revenue program is a little larger this quarter than it was in first quarter 2010, and we're -- our revenue growth quarter-over-quarter was 12% year-over-year.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steve Ashley with Robert Baird.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I wonder if you could just talk about in terms of domain name growth, just qualitatively, what you're seeing in North America versus international.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Steve, happy to take that. Historically, in the last few years, we've seen the international side growing at a faster rate than domestic -- a much faster rate, usually by multiple percentage points. That has continued through -- actually, until last quarter, and we're seeing in this quarter a bit of a slowdown there, where that gap is closing, where the international grew at about 1 percentage point higher. And usually, we've seen multiple percentage point higher than that. So that's only one quarter where we're seeing this. I don't want to call anything based on just one quarter worth of data. I did look inside the international piece of it to look at various countries, and we still continue to see some countries growing at very, very healthy rates like China. It grew to about 21%. Yes, 21%. India's got 11%. EMEA as a group has 13%. There were a couple of laggards. Brazil was down about 10%. Australia was down about 5%. So there's still high growth ones in there. There's been some ones that have dropped off a bit in the last quarter. And when we've put that all through the wash, we've got international about 1 percentage point higher growth than domestic. But again, that's just one quarter here. And historically, we\u2019ve see that at a higher rate.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Great. And are there any other registries at this point that are offering DNSSEC?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, there are, so a number of them have that.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And just lastly, the progress on the relocation of the headquarters. You talked about transition services, but just in terms of your hiring and staffing up in Northern Virginia, how is that all going?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian. We're doing a good job on that, better than expected. Everything has gone to pot plan. We should be done at the end of second quarter.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from the Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I think, you partially answered this question, Mark but if you look at it, December quarter was a tough quarter for new name additions. March was very strong, obviously, seasonality playing a part. But what other factors do you see kind of contributing to the new name growth here? You mentioned international. What else are you seeing? And how are you thinking about that going into June? And can you remind everybody about the seasonality of name additions typically in June?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sure. What we're seeing there, Sterling, is I think is domestic is growing nicely, international continues to grow nicely as well for combined mix of 8.3 million new registrations on the new side, this quarter, which is great. As far as the strength behind us, coming off of a bad economy, that certainly has given us a big lift in the last 12 months to the name base and Internet. Online advertising spending is up very, very well in that same period. So on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I saw a staff the other day saying online advertising has reached its highest level of spend ever. So I think those are the drivers and will continue to see those drivers move forward. Seasonality-wise, the first quarter is very strong for us, the strongest quarter. We do see seasonality dropping into the second quarter and the third quarter traditionally and then kind of a flat uppish a little bit in the fourth quarter. So we expect that seasonality to continue.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then on the non-registry part of the business, when you look at -- you made some kind of qualitative comments, but maybe just a little bit more color in terms of the sequential trends that we should think about outside the naming business. The parts of VeriSign, how should we think about how that should grow through the year?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Go get that, Brian.", "Brian Robins", "Hey Sterling, this is Brian. We don't break down the 2 businesses. Last year, we said that the NIA business was roughly about $10 million to $15 million. For the most part, the end last year and to the beginning of this year, we're rebuilding the enterprise sales force. And so the team did a great job in the first quarter and exceeded their bookings target, and they're off to a good start.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Kelly McLeod", "This is actually Kelly McLeod on for Rob. Just wondering why the special dividend rather than share buybacks?", "Brian Robins", "Kelly, this is Brian. As we mentioned before, and considering the use of cash, we wanted to return at least the proceeds from our Authentication Services sale. As far as the method of doing so, we decided to do this on both -- sort of a hybrid approach and bought back $200 million in the first quarter and also declared a special dividend. This had some advantages with being timely and tax-advantageous in a way to give proceeds back to their shareholders. We still have $1.4 billion of cash on balance sheet with the remaining share authorization of $1.2 billion, and so we feel like we have good flexibility and a strong balance sheet.", "Kelly McLeod", "Okay. And then how should we be thinking about share buybacks for the remainder of the year?", "Brian Robins", "So we've committed to returning value to shareholders. We've done what we've committed to. We'll evaluate that on a quarterly basis.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Todd Raker with Deutsche Bank.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Few questions for you. First of all, can you talk about contract length? Deferred revenues stepped up a little bit here. What's driving that relative to the revenue profile?", "Mark McLaughlin", "So the increase in deferred revenue, contract length is average term life on the names is the same, it's about 1.17 years. And the deferred revenue is just a function of the new names that have been registered.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Can you talk about how much cash is going south in the U.S. versus international?", "Brian Robins", "So the revenue makeup is related to the -- what we're doing on the dividend or. . .", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes, well -- no, you've got a significant stock buyback authorization left. You got a substantial cash balance. . .", "Brian Robins", "Yes, the $1.4 billion in cash. It's about $400 million domestically and $1 billion internationally.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And can you talk about -- as you went through the .net renewal process, are there any takeaways that we can apply to our thinking about the .com process coming up?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Todd, we're in the .net renewal process. I just want to make that clear. We're in the midst of the 30-day comment period that ICANN has for the negotiated terms between VeriSign and ICANN. We can expect that contract renewed by July 1. I think, the highest level -- the terms of the .net contract and the .com contract are almost identical. Really, only difference between the 2 is that for .com, in addition to negotiating -- in addition to getting renewed with ICANN, we have to seek Department of Commerce approval.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then one question for you on the CFIT timeline that you walk through. The summary judgment hearing that occurred in March 11, would that apply to the fourth amended complaint that CFIT has filed?", "Mark McLaughlin", "No. So the summary judgment is basically asking the court to dismiss the case or certain portions of the case for various reasons. And then separate from that, the court had dismissed claims already that they had in their third amended complaint. They gave them at lease to amend, so they amended for the fourth time.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. So even if you get a positive summary judgment, you may still see some ongoing court action on the fourth amended complaint?", "Mark McLaughlin", "It's possible to get some things dismissed and others still be out there.", "Todd Raker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "One quick question of mine with respect to cash regularization. We spoke about dividend, and you spoke about the buybacks. With respect to M&A even though you guys have been divesting over the past couple of years, what are you looking right now? Obviously, we have plenty of cash. Is it more kind of fixed-looking tuck-ins type of acquisitions that we might be expecting?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes, Shaul. This is Mark here. To the extent that we would feel the need to accelerate product road map sort of things or go-to-market things, then we would -- may turn to inorganic basis to do that. But as I\u2019ve said in the past if we did it, it would be very adjacent to the things we're doing today and would be -- you use the term tuck-in, but that kind of size and for that sort of reason.", "Shaul Eyal - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Got it.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just wanted to dig in a little bit on that contra-revenue comment that you made regarding Q1, because just looking at your sequential -- just domain name growth and then looking at just the sequential growth and revenue, I would have expected to be a couple million higher. But you did mention the sort of higher contra-revenue. I'm wondering if you could help us just quantify that? Was that $2 million or $3 million more than, let's say, last quarter or year-over-year? And maybe just for those who aren't familiar with the contra-revenue, what does drive that, and what would you expect that to be for the June quarter?", "Brian Robins", "This is Brian. So from a contra-revenue program, we do marketing campaigns with the registers, help stimulate growth. These are programs that we've done historically on the first quarter every quarter for the last several years. It's really based on the amount of names on the base. And so the program, this past quarter was approximately $1 million higher than first quarter 2010.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Got it. And then when you think about for the June quarter, and you said that fade away, so we kind of go step back up then or higher than expected kind of growth sequentially?", "Brian Robins", "The June quarter it varies based on programs that we rollout. The June quarter will be more than what last year, third quarter would be last, and then fourth quarter would be about the same. And so it just really varies based on the programs that the registers have. And we try to work collaboratively with the registers in putting these programs out.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Got it, and will June be higher than March?", "Brian Robins", "Yes.", "Mark McLaughlin", "I think the answer to that is that on an annual basis, we looked at the revenue side, we've called out 11% to 14% revenue growth. So regardless to sort of the ups and downs of contra programs, that's what the at revenue basis looks like.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Got it.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "Two questions. Mark, could you give us an update on your opinion regarding the conditions for enacting price increases for the registries? I think, you said last quarter that conditions look pretty good, overall. And then Brian, CapEx now, the outlook I think, you said was 10% of revenue. I believe prior was 8% to 10%. Can you review for us how much might be registry, how much for growth initiatives?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Dan, it's Mark. I'll take the first question. So as I have said in the past, we think about a lot of variables, when thinking about pricing. Always most important is long-term need for the business. I think everybody knows we have one price increase remaining for .com. We have plenty of time to take that out through November 2012, to notice that price increase if we choose to do that. Last quarter, I commented on various factors we have looked at. All would seem to be a positive direction, so I continue believe that those book positive. Brian, you want to CapEx?", "Brian Robins", "Yes, this is Brian. On the CapEx side, we increased it to the higher end of the range that we gave previously related to the move that we're making from the West Coast to the East Coast and the build-out of our new facility. We don't break down capital between growth initiatives and sort of maintenance and expansion. We have project Apal [ph], which is a multiyear project that we're putting capital into our network to handle the increase attacks and the increase capacity of query loads.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "So is it a nonissue with the regulator?", "Mark McLaughlin", "I'm not sure if we follow the question.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "In terms of -- I mean, there's no segregation of assets between stuff that's dedicated for the registry business and stuff that you're doing to grow your business independently?", "Brian Robins", "No.", "Operator", "And our final question today comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Just a quick question on your broader strategy toward M&A. I mean, given that you've issued a special dividend, and it's obviously, the share repurchase to leave you really with relatively small amount of cash and also taking into account the relocation of some of the staff and some realignment just recently. I mean, have you -- has your fundamental stance towards M&A changed in any respects that caused you to be much more focused on just returning cash at this point?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes. So I don't think that our stance in M&A has changed. Historically, when we discussed this topic, we said, if we were to look on an inorganic basis for things, it's for the reasons I have mentioned earlier, which would be more tactical than base strategic, ideas in nature. And just because of that, those things tend to be smaller. So I think we still have $1.4 billion in cash, and we're generating very healthy cash flow, and we got a great balance sheet. If we need to do something we could.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. And I have one final question, which is the contract you won for .gov. You talked about some of economics for some of the new global TLD opportunities, as well as any other potential registry-related businesses that might be out there.", "Mark McLaughlin", "That's true. Kind of 2 separate things there. So we're happy that we won the contract for .gov. That's a new TLD for us to run, but it's not a new TLD. It's been out there for a while. Separate from that with the real new TLD that ICANN has introduced next year. It's really going to be a big difference in what those economic models look like starting first with are you the front end or the back-end? We, primarily, would consider ourselves back-end service providers as a registry as opposed to the front-end marketing engine of those things. But we do know that whatever the go-to market model looks like for that, there's a cost associated with the plan for those, which is about $185,000 registration fee per name.", "Operator", "And I'd now like to turn the call back over to Nancy Fazioli for any additional or closing remarks.", "Nancy Fazioli", "Thank you, operator.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for VeriSign's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. I'm David Atchley, Corporate Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations, and I'm here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board; Mark McLaughlin, President and CEO; and Brian Robins, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our new corporate website, www.verisigninc.com.

", "In a moment, Jim, Mark and Brian will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?", "James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we discuss the quarter, let me say a few words. As you've  read in our second quarter earnings press release, Mark McLaughlin will be leaving the company on August 25, and I will be reassuming the positions of President and CEO effective August 1. Mark is leaving VeriSign to become CEO of a private company. We will discuss this transition in more detail after we review our second quarter results. ", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter was another quarter for VeriSign, and we continue to be pleased with the company's performance. In our Naming business, we exceeded 8 million new domain name registrations for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, through continued disciplined operations, we were able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion. Also, our balance sheet remains healthy, which allowed us to repurchase $100 million in shares in the second quarter, leaving us with approximately $1.1 billion under the current share repurchase authorization program. ", "Before I get into Q2 results, I want to highlight and comment on a few key events from a busy quarter. First, on May 11, we announced that VeriSign entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with the Coalition for ICANN Transparency, or CFIT, which resolved the over 5-year long CFIT litigation. As we indicated in the press release and 8-K, under the terms of the agreement, CFIT filed a dismissal with prejudice of all claims in the litigation. Further, there was no payment associated with the dismissal, and the parties executed mutual releases from all claims now and in the future related to the litigation. As we've stated in the past, we always believe the case to be without merit. ", "Second, on June 20, ICANN announced that its Board of Directors had approved their plan to increase the number of generic top-level domains. We view the introduction of new gTLDs as an adjacent growth opportunity. We believe that VeriSign's experienced and trusted brand should make us a logical choice to operate the registry for many organizations applying for new gTLDs. ICANN announced they will begin accepting applications for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012. ", "On June 28, we were pleased to announce that ICANN and VeriSign had renewed VeriSign's contract to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the .net registry for another 6 years. With the steady growth of the Internet and the ever-increasing demand on the DNS, VeriSign is committed to invest in, scale and enhance our world-class infrastructure that supports .net to ensure its continued, secure, stable operation. We are proud that we have been entrusted with the continued responsibility of running .net. ", "And lastly, by way of update in the third quarter, on July 14, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .com and .net per our agreements with ICANN. As of January 15, 2012, the registry fee for .com domain names will increase from $7.34 to $7.85, and the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $4.65 to $5.11. The fee increases will have no direct impact to 2011 revenue since the increases are not effective until January 15, 2012. ", "Continued strong global Internet usage growth, along with increasingly powerful cyber attacks, leveled against all parts of the Internet's critical infrastructure, have dramatically increased the demands on Internet infrastructure providers. The volume of DNS queries on VeriSign's global Internet infrastructure has more than doubled in the last 5 years. Future growth is expected to occur in an even faster pace. VeriSign's infrastructure has maintained 100% operational stability for more than a decade due to continued innovation and investment in the infrastructure. ", "I'll comment now on second quarter results. At Registry Services, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 110 million names at the end of June. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and an approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the quarter, we added 1.95 million net names to the domain name base. In the second quarter, we processed 8.1 million new registrations, which is in approximately 2% increase year-over-year. This is the company's second largest quarter in our history for new registrations. ", "On the renewal rate side, the Q1 2011 renewal rate was 73.8%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.5%. We expect the Q3 net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.1 million names, which reflects the continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.", "With regard to our NIA business, we have ramped up our sales efforts, saw positive traction in the market, and again exceeded our planned bookings metrics during the second quarter. Additionally, our product roadmap of offerings and enhancements has allowed us to deliver services to the market that addresses the growing complexity of managing networks in an era of cloud computing. We believe we're well positioned for a leadership role in this fast growing but fragmented market. With the second quarter behind us, we've capped a solid first half of 2011 and look forward to updating you on our third quarter earnings call. ", "Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to Brian.", "Brian Robins", "Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. As Mark said, this was another solid quarter for us, and I'm pleased about the progress we have made towards our goals. Let me quickly recap our performance this quarter on our key operating metrics which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow, and then I'll discuss progress towards our annual guidance.", "Revenue of $190 million for the second quarter was up 5% from the prior quarter and up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $714 million, an increase of $15 million or 2% from 1Q and up 11% from the same period in 2010. ", "Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $92 million, down 7% quarter-over-quarter and down 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 was 51.7% compared to 45.9% in Q1. Second quarter margin expansion was driven primarily by the $6 million nonrecurring accrued expense reversal taken during the quarter, which increased operating margin by 3.1%. ", "Additionally, we realized cost savings through streamlining our business as we have completed our divestitures. We have achieved these savings in G&A support services and we realized them faster than expected. Based on the progress to date, we expect fourth quarter 2011 exit non-GAAP operating margin to be at least 48%. ", "Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $65 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.38 compared to $0.32 in Q1 and $0.23 in the same period in 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 includes a $6 million recurring accrued expense reversal, which increased diluted earnings by $0.02 per share. Income-related transition services, included as part of nonoperating income on the P&L, was approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter. ", "A quick comment on taxes. We continue to believe a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% is a reasonable estimate. In 2011, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million, $28 million of which is related to the divestiture of Authentication Services. ", "We exit Q2 with a diluted share count of 170 million shares. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 1 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. ", "Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $13 million in the second quarter, noting that the contingent interest payment totaling $100 million was paid on May 18, 2011. Free cash flow was negative $4 million in Q2, given a $3 million decrease in excess tax benefits and $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. We still believe capital will be approximately 10% of revenue in 2011, given anticipated facility spend related to the move of our corporate headquarters. ", "As a quick housekeeping item, we've now included unrealized gain loss on contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures as a non-GAAP item. You will now see this item on our reconciliation statement, with first quarter showing a $250,000 loss, while Q2 showed a $700,000 gain. ", "To sum up, we're pleased with our performance. We continue to grow non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a healthy cash position and a strong cash flow generating capabilities of our business continue to be a key benefit of our financial model. ", "We're pleased to report on the status of transitional Authentication Service business to Symantec and corporate functions to the East Coast. Progress has been on track with the bulk of the transition wrapped up. I would like to thank both the East Coast and West Coast employees for their hard work and dedication and making this a successful transition. As noted previously, income related to transition services in Q2 was approximately $2.3 million. We now expect approximately $2 million in the second half of the year. ", "Let's move on to guidance, 2011 guidance. We have tightened the revenue for 2011. We'll be in the range of $765 million to $775 million or growth of 12% to 14%. We now expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 79%. Q4 exit non-GAAP operating margin, as mentioned earlier, is expected to be at least 48%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income, net, which are previously referred to as other loss, net, is still expected to be $25 million for 2011. As I mentioned previously, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 10% of revenue. ", "Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expenses.", "I am excited about the opportunities for the company. We believe the disciplined execution opportunities that leverage our competitive advantages will provide a platform for long-term profitable growth. ", "I'll now turn the call back to Jim. Jim?", "James Bidzos", "Okay. Thanks, Brian and Mark. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, Mark will be leaving to pursue another opportunity. Mark's departure comes at the end of a major 4-year restructuring for the company. We've gone from over 5,000 people to just over 1,000. We operate 15 offices internationally versus more than 80, 4 years ago. We divested a number of businesses, including our Authentication unit, and returned billions of dollars of our shareholders. We relocated our headquarters from California to Virginia. ", "Throughout what was, at times, a very challenging restructuring, we maintained a perfect operational record. And in just the last 6 months, we favorably settled the long-standing CFIT lawsuit, we've renewed .net and expanded our core business with our NIA units. ", "Mark led the company through much of this transition and his contributions to our success are significant and appreciated by the board and employees. Mark leaves VeriSign a stronger company with a stable and growing revenue base and an experienced management team that delivers network performance and reliability the world has come to expect, plus focused and disciplined financial management that continues to deliver profitability and shareholder returns. ", "Mark?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Thanks, Jim. As Jim mentioned, I'll be leaving VeriSign at the end of August for a new opportunity that will be announced next week. This was a very difficult decision for me, given that I've been part of the VeriSign team and family for a long time, and it's such a great company. ", "As Jim said, the team that I've had the honor of working at VeriSign has accomplished an impressive amount of work and has created a lot of value over the past few years. While I have the honor of leading the company during this time period, the credit for its accomplishments goes to the team. It has been my pleasure and privilege to work with such an outstanding team, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of them for their continued hard work and friendship. ", "Jim?", "James Bidzos", "Thank you, Mark, and thanks for all you've done. We all wish you the best. ", "Looking forward, the company is well positioned to continue growing for the remainder of this year and beyond. We'll now take your questions. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Philip Winslow at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just got 2 questions here. Just first, on the margin front. Even x the $6 million onetime reversal, you guys way exceeded the consensus margins for this quarter. Brian, when you look over the sort of the course of the year and obviously you've got some transitional costs, how much more do we have in terms of these transitional costs rolling off versus sort of any incremental that we might see coming on? And then also, just in terms of use of cash. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what percentage of your balance sheet is in the U.S, and just how should we think about the use of cash that you have in the U.S.?", "Brian Robins", "Phil, this quarter, there's -- as far as the margin side, there's a couple of things I want to touch on. As I said in my prepared remarks, we reported an operating margin of 51.7% for the second quarter, the onetime expense reversal $6 million added 3.1%. So if you adjust for this operating margin on a normalized basis, it would've been 48.6%. The increase in the second quarter was attributed to a couple of things. We had a slower ramp in new hires than anticipated, and we achieved across-the-board G&A savings. And then finally, we really completed the transition from the West Coast to the East Coast. We only have a few employees remaining on the West Coast that we're transitioning, and the last employee is being notified on August 3. So I think from a margin perspective, we've taken out most of the excess, if you will. We did increase our operating exit run rate guidance at the end of the year to, say, it'd be at least 48% from 46%, 48%. So we will continue to try to extract savings out of the business. On the cash side, yes, I guess, first, let's step back. And one of the things that we said earlier was that over the course of the -- of 2011, is we would return the remaining proceeds from the Authentication Services divestiture, if you look from Q4 to this quarter, we paid about $1 billion in special dividends, $200 million in contingent interest and have done about $315 million of buybacks. So we've returned about $1.5 billion, which is in excess of proceeds that we received from Symantec. We have just have over $1 billion remaining on the buyback authorization. If you look at the balance sheet, about a little over $300 million is domestic, about $1.1 billion is international. And we're committed to returning value to shareholders, and we'll evaluate quarterly on the most effective way of achieving it.", "Operator", "Next we'll hear from Steve Ashley at Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "I guess I would like to drill down on the domain names, appeared to slow a little bit from the growth we had seen, came in just a tick below the low end of the guidance range, a lot of noise out in the street during the period. And we just love to get some color on what you thought might have been going on there.", "Brian Robins", "Steve, this Brian. Yes, if you take a step back, we said at the beginning of the year that the new names in the zone would grow about 7% to 9% yearly. And so as we sit here today, it looks like the net new names will be right in the middle of that range. In Mark's prepared remarks, he said the renewal rate be approximately 73.5%. And so we also saw the net new -- I'm sorry, the new registrations for the names to be the second largest in the company's history. And so there was a little decline over first quarter, but we still feel pretty comfortable with the 8 -- 7% to 9% year-over-year rate in the middle of that range.", "James Bidzos", "This is Jim, I just want to point out as well that, well, the second quarter was the second largest in the company's history for net new adds. It was the largest 2Q net new adds in the company's history.", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Great. And in terms of the transition from the West Coast to the East Coast, in terms of the management team, the management structure, did everyone make the move, or are there still some open boxes in the org chart that need to be backfilled after the transition?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Steve, it's Mark. Yes, the entire executive team is on the East Coast at this point. So the transition is complete.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next from JPMorgan, Sterling Auty.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "There's going to be lots of speculation on our conversations tomorrow, so I want to just kind of hit it. Is there any additional color that you can give, without giving the name of the company obviously, but the thought process going in? You navigated the company through a lot of divestiture, lot of change and successfully, so why not see it further on in terms of the growth of the company? What was the motivating factor to make the change now?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sterling, so -- the -- where I'm going will get announced next week, so we won't' talk anymore about that. VeriSign is, as I think you know how I feel about it, is a fantastic company. I've got about 10 years of total time at VeriSign. It's been an absolute pleasure to work with the team, and particularly, in the last 3 years, gone through a lot of the restructuring, taking the company forward. So I kind of look at this as an apples-to-oranges situation. The opportunity I'm going to an is a private, pre-public company, got the opportunity to possibly take a company public. I haven't done that in my career before, so I think that's a good career opportunity for me. So it says nothing about VeriSign as to where I'm going, because this company is a hell of a great company, very stable, and it's got a great future.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "All right, great. And then the -- now on to the current business. If we look at it -- so you got about 2 million names that were actually added in the quarter, while the net new addition, the second largest in a quarter -- correct me if I'm wrong, I think the true net addition peak  was probably 4 million or thereabouts. What's it going to take -- can we get back to those kind of quarters were you're adding a net increase of 4 million names to the base? And what's going to be necessary? Because I also don't think that we're that far off the peak on the renewal rates.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Sterling, it's Mark. I think that whole period in 2007 coming in, into the first quarter of 2008 had the PPC phenomenon. And at which -- I'll call that a phenomenon. So in the absence of something very specific like that happen, I think you continue to see a more steady growth rate than that sort of pop we saw for 4 or 5 quarters back there, when you had 4 million names.", "Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "okay, that's fair. And the last question, is there -- was there any special programs that you're running with the registrars in the quarter? And then there's lots of news about Go Daddy and what might be happening with its ownership there. Was there any disruption that maybe you saw?", "Brian Robins", "Sterling, this is Brian. On the Go Daddy front, there -- continue to be a really important customer. There was no disruption that we saw in the quarter, very focused, and they executed well during the quarter. On the revenue programs, as I stated earlier, we run a number of programs throughout the year. We did nothing different in the second quarter that we've done in previous quarters, and we actually increased our revenue guidance for the year and narrowed the range.", "Operator", "Next, we'll hear from Walter Pritchard at Citi.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "I have 2 questions. One, Brian, for you. You've given your revenue guidance for the year, and we can pretty much extrapolate that out for Q3 and Q4. And you've talked about, at least, 48% operating margins. I guess I'm not expecting you to put a tighter range on the 48%. But I guess I'm wondering, you did 48.5% here, and I guess wondering why things wouldn't expand from the 48.5%. And specifically, if there's anything outside of the $6 million that you talked about, the accrual that's an expense, that maybe we're not thinking about that comes back in, in the second half?", "Brian Robins", "Okay. Couple of different things there. So on the margin side, 48.5%, 48.6%, how do you feel about the 48% on a go-forward basis. There's a couple of things. One is we're ramping up our hiring, and so we're -- there's a timing delta that will come on in the second half of the year. Secondly, as we took possession, if you will, of our new headquarters on July 1, which adds approximately $2 million a quarter run rate from an expense perspective, and there's a couple of other things that are happening. And so as I stated earlier, in previous calls, when we announced the Authentication sales, there's going to be some lumpiness between sort of the sale and the final transition. And so there are some onetime things that happened this quarter that won't repeat themselves in third and fourth quarter. And so we wanted to increase the guidance, and we said at least 48% exit operating margin in the fourth quarter.", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup Inc", "Great. And then just for Jim on the CEO search. I'd imagine, Jim, you're probably not stepping back in here to be permanent CEO. You've stepped in a few times, but I'm wondering if you'd maybe this early in the process, that you'd give us some color on sort of the search process, if you're looking at internal and external candidates, and any color on timing?", "James Bidzos", "Okay, sure. Well, first of all, we'll look for another CEO, and I assume we'll conduct a search to do that. Right now, I'm focused on taking full advantage of Mark's willingness to be here until August 25 and ensure a smooth transition, so that's sort of my focus. We're in a transition. That's essentially a succession plan we've had in place. This news is just a few days old. But I'm really focused on taking advantage of Mark's availability and just working through a smooth transition and probably have more to say about it next time we talk.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Gregg Moskowitz at Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC", "I'm wondering if you could talk about international domain name growth this quarter, and how that compared relative to domestic. And maybe if you can sort of touch on some of the more emerging markets countries, such as China, India and Brazil, that'd be helpful.", "Brian Robins", "Hey, this is Brian. International continues to be about 39% of our base. We report the international names by where the registrar is located and not by where the end users at. We recently have seen an increase in resellers changing registrars and consolidation in the  industry. Because the names don't switch until they're renewed, it's becoming difficult for us to track this activity. Therefore, the international growth that we report versus domestic growth is getting a little cloudier. However, international continues to be very important and is still growing. So for instance, China grew 16% year-over-year, EMEA grew about 13% year-over-year and India has grown about 11% year-over-year.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay, great. And, Brian, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense as well of how the contra revenue amount in Q2 compared on a sequential and year-over-year basis, as well as maybe what you're expecting for Q3?", "Brian Robins", "Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, I think it was Sterling's question, it's -- it was less than Q1. It was immaterial. And we've guided towards revenue for the full year, and it's included in the revenue guidance.", "Operator", "Moving on to Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "Can you give us a sense of what kind of revenue growth you're seeing sequentially right now in the NIA business? And I guess this is a question for Jim. What are your expectations for revenue contributions into next year from IDNs and the new TLDs? When does money start changing hands, particularly on the new TLD assignments that you may get?", "Brian Robins", "Dan, this is Brian. I'll take the -- let me take the NIA one, first. And then either myself, Mark or Jim will take the TLD one. On NIA, we really like this space. As we said previously, we estimate it to be at a million -- $1 billion market with double-digit growth. Our teams had a great quarter. As I talked about this, we basically rebuilt the management team and the sales team, put together the product roadmap and are now out executing on that. And so in the quarter, we exceeded our bookings target, and we're continuing to build our sales force. We believe with our brand and operational performance, this is our market to lose. And so we haven't given any guidance specifically on that, but we're doing better than expected.", "James Bidzos", "Dan, this is Jim. With respect to IDNs, we haven't given any guidance for 2012 of course. But the first IDNs actually don't go operational until January of 2013. So it's too early for us to be talking about that.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "The new TLD is Jan. '13 or I'm sorry?", "James Bidzos", "I thought you said IDN specifically. If you're talking about new gTLDs, I'm sorry if I misunderstood.", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes. Dan, the timeline given what ICANN just did in Singapore, is applications will be accepted starting in January 2012. Then there's that -- that will take basically the course of that year to run through the application process and all that's going to occur. They'll be awarded near the end of 2012. So as Jim is saying is you can expect to see new gTLDs actually hit the zone sometime in the late 2012 or early 2013. So from a contribution standpoint for 2012, it would be minimal regardless, and we haven't given any guidance for 2012 yet.", "James Bidzos", "Yes, if you -- Jim. If you got to ICANN's website, their program is to take applications during the first few months of 2012, review them, make announcements at the end of the year. And then the first ones, at the earliest, would go operational in 2013. We're talking about 2 gTLDs, I just want to be clear. And that -- then of course obviously, we would have negotiate venture into relationships to provide registry and back-end services to these new gTLD operators. So I would expect that there would be some amount of time to trail the operation of some of these before we actually get involved and have any revenue that we could talk about or forecast.", "Daniel Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC", "And I guess one other question I just had, related to IDNs, the international domain names. When do you think you might see some noticeable demand stimulus from some of the technical work you're doing around IDNs?", "Mark McLaughlin", "Yes. So on the IDN front specifically, the -- well, there's -- not to overcomplicate things, but there's 2 categories just to keep things straight. There is IDN which are the zone today already. We have about 1 million of those names in the zone. That means that the internationalized version of the name .englishcom, those names grow at about the same rate as the rest of our zone. The second type which is IDN.IDN or what people call the trans federations are in the new gTLD category. And as Jim said, from a timing perspective, you wouldn't see them hit the market until we are through the application process, because we would apply for those. So impact-wise, it'd be 2013 before we would be live or late 2012, I think, before we would be live in the market. So they're included in that new gTLD.", "Operator", "And we will take our last question from Ed Maguire at CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I was -- just wondering if you could discuss your thoughts about the potential pricing for your back-end services for new gTLDs. What you think the market might bear? You're able to charge varying tariffs, as it were, between com and net and names like .gov and would appreciate any color you could throw, at least, on what the dynamics of that market may look like, from your perspective.", "Brian Robins", "Hey, Ed, this is Brian. The -- as Mark and Jim alluded to, the application window opens on January 12 and closes on April 12. And so it's really early in the process, and we don't know what the requirements are going to be for back-end service options, if you will. And so we have-- the team has been busy from business development perspective, working with a number of brands and registrars and setting up partnerships, but really depends based on what the applications are that they want us to do from a back-end perspective. We feel from a company perspective, with our operational performance and our 100% uptime for over a dozen years, that we're really well positioned to be the key player there.", "James Bidzos", "And this is Jim, just adding a comment here as well. And -- Brian's right. It really depends on how people use some of these new gTLDs, which aren't entirely clear -- isn't entirely clear at this point. There may be people who applied to operate one of them for the purpose of selling names and making a business of it. If we were the back-end registry provider, we might have a certain type of relationship based on their exploitation of that gTLD. There are other folks from marketing or branding purposes or other recognition purposes that may operate it, that may not be primarily about selling domain names in that gTLD, we may have an entirely different model for that. We really need to wait and see what emerges, who applies, who succeeds and how they plan to use it. But again, having the premier most reliable, longest-standing registry operation, we certainly see that as an opportunity however it does play out.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Great. And one final question which is relating to your stance towards M&A. With the executive changes on the way, could you update us on your current thinking, and what your considerations may be regarding potential acquisitions?", "James Bidzos", "Sure. I -- let me try to answer that question on a slightly broader level that I think will address the specific question that you raised. As I mentioned, this is a 4-year restructuring. We're at the tail end of it. But we have a management team that's executing on a strategy that's been developed in conjunction with the board over a number of years. Mark was on the board, I'm on the board, obviously, as Chairman. I've also been Executive Chairman. I've worked closely with his management team. But basically, there is no change in our strategy. There is no change in any of the company's outlook, forecast, its management team, its ability to operate, its commitment for growth. There's no change in our commitment to return value to shareholders, and there's no change in our commitment to grow. And if that makes sense through M&A, we've talked about tuck-in M&A where it might make sense. We still view that as an opportunity. We believe we have enough cash on hand for those opportunities that arise. But at this point, we don't see nor do we expect any significant M&A activity that would change the strategy that we're on.", "Operator", "We have time for one final question. That will come from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.", "Kash Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "On the gTLD front, I'm just wondering if you could maybe have done this -- apologies for asking the question again. Can you give us a sense for how big the market opportunity is, be it number of domains, number of sites, and how fragmented or uniform does this market look like? And finally, what kind of synergies, not to get too ahead, but assuming you are successful on this next evolution, what kind of synergies do you currently have, via technology infrastructure, business operations, that will allow you to tap into that market effectively? That's it for me.", "James Bidzos", "Sure, this is Jim. Let me address that again. I think, first of all, we -- our best information about what's likely to emerge in the new gTLD space comes from ICANN's own forecast. I think that their most optimistic expectations that they talked about are somewhere possibly near 1,000 ultimately. How long that takes them, when that ever gets realized, we're not sure. Again, we don't know how many new gTLD operators will come into the business primarily to sell domain names. So what that name space and what that opportunity represents from that perspective is just really, really difficult to identify. We just simply can't tell you. I think the best way to think about this is that it's a market that's going to emerge in a way that's yet undetermined. And that we, as the longest operating registry with the longest record of uptime and availability and reliability, are best positioned to exploit that market. That's the best offering we have, to be essentially the premier service provider, to what will undoubtedly be a number of people who have no registry experience. ICANN has also said that one of the most important things about a top-level domain is that the operation has to be demonstrably secure. It needs reliability and security, first and foremost, and so I think that bodes well for our opportunity. But I think it's just virtually impossible for us to predict what that market might look like, how big it might grow and what direction it might take. So I hope that answered that question.", "Operator", "At this time, Mr. Atchley, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing comments.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign. During the past year, we completed a 4-year board-directed restructuring plan, which included divesting non-core businesses, the sale of our Authentication Services business and relocating our headquarters. This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign that we believe is better prepared for the opportunities ahead.  We delivered both for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us and for our shareholders. ", "As stewards of critical elements of Internet infrastructure, both what we do and how we do it are important for the secure and reliable operation of the global Internet, upon which billions of people worldwide depend.", "In 2011, we continued to demonstrate our commitment to shareholders by completing the return of divestiture proceeds. In May, we paid a special dividend of $463 million to shareholders and $100 million in contingent interest to bondholders. We also continued our share repurchase program during the year, with 16.3 million shares repurchased, returning $535 million during 2011.", "On our last earnings call, we described several pending cash activities. These included the full payment for the rest of the building purchased, potential financing scenarios and the pending repatriation of previously taxed offshore cash. We mentioned this repatriation in our last call but did not state the amount, which is $86 million. All of these items will resolve as expected by December 31. As these activities were pending during the fourth quarter, we took a conservative approach, and for this reason alone, we did not make share repurchases. ", "Security and stability are paramount for the way we run our business, and this extends to the way we manage our liquidity. So, on December 31, with all the pending cash activity successfully concluded, we held $225 million in domestic cash and $1,125,000,000 in offshore cash. We have $831 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best use for our cash, including potential share repurchases. John will discuss our cash balance in more detail in a few minutes.", "During the fourth quarter, we completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. We are excited about this new facility as it brings our main corporate functions under one roof. We're already seeing efficiencies and enhanced collaboration among our teams in the new building. ", "Also, I'd like to give you a quick update from our last call regarding our search for a CFO. As mentioned last time, we have begun a search for a new CFO and are starting the interviewing process. Of course, we'll keep you updated as things progress.", "As we look towards 2012, one important area of focus is the .com agreement renewal. The process and timeline are on track, and we will provide updates as appropriate leading up to the renewal. Since we last spoke to you, we are engaged and are pleased with the progress.", "I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 113.8 million at the end of December. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and then approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.9 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is about a 4% increase over the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was our strongest Q4 for new registrations on record. In fact, that's true for each of the quarters in 2011, thus making it our strongest year for new registrations with over 32 million new registrations processed. ", "The Q3 2011 renewal rate was 73.3%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.  We expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.", "Looking at our NIA business. The team performed very well and exceeded our full year bookings target. The NIA sales team is now fully hired and in place, and we expect 2012 to be a year of execution for the business.  We are focused on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth. ", "As we look forward to 2012, our focus will be to: number one, continue providing unparalleled network and registry services performance; number two, renew the .com agreement with ICANN and receive approval of the agreement by the Department of Commerce; number three, invest in benefiting from the new gTLD program by both applying for strategic names ourself and teaming with other applicants as their backend registry service provider. ", "By the way, we've been selected by several brands that ran an early selection process in anticipation of their applications for new gTLD succeeding. While the revenue is not material and not expected before 2013, I wanted to let you know that we're already competing successfully as the backend service provider. This says a lot about the quality work our Registry Services and network ops teams have been doing. ", "Number four, we want to continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; number five, continue to identify and select opportunities for growth through value-added services, which leverage our core strength and offer quality of revenue; and number six, of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for critical elements of global Internet infrastructure, both operationally and in the management of the business.", "We believe this is the appropriate, responsible strategy for balancing stability, growth and shareholder interest, all of which are intertwined. ", "Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John.", "John Calys", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jim explained, this is another solid quarter and year for us. During 2011, we generated revenue of $772 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by 792 basis points.  These results drove approximately $157 million in free cash flow for the year. ", "Following on to Jim's comments on our cash position. The total cash of investment balance ended Q4 at $1.35 billion. Of this balance, $225 million is domestic. During the quarter, we initiated a new 5-year $200 million credit facility, borrowed $100 million against this facility as short-term financing for our Reston building purchase. In fact, the [ph] cash balance also included $86 million of previously taxed income that was repatriated at the end of the quarter.", "Let me recap our performance for the fourth quarter and year on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss 2012 full year guidance.", "Revenue of $204 million for the fourth quarter was up 3% from the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. 2011 revenue of $772 million was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $729 million, a $6 million increase from Q3 2011 and a $66 million increase year-over-year, up 10%. ", "Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 50.9% compared to 50.1% in Q3. 4Q non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up sequentially and flat year-over-year. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and ways to improve our operating margin.", "Net income and EPS.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 compared to $0.39 in Q3 and $0.31 in the same period in 2010. 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 is a 43% increase over 2010. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2011 was $28 million. This included a pretax $4 million nonoperating accrued expense booked in Q4, which is non-recurring in nature and had a negative effect of $0.02 on EPS.", "With respect to taxes. We think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q4 compared to 164 million in third quarter. ", "Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $124 million in the fourth quarter and $336 million for 2011, which includes the payout of $100 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debt.", "Free cash flow was $6.6 million in Q4, given $11.6 million in excess tax benefits and $129 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2011 was $157 million after $13 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $193 million in capital expenditures. Relating to capital expenditures, the company closed a property purchase of the Reston, Virginia, headquarters building on November 15, 2011 for $118 million. ", "To reiterate, we saw solid performance in Q4. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "With respect to 2012 guidance.  Revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $865 million to $890 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%.", "Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "I will now turn the call back to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, John. In summary, we're pleased with the performance and milestones we've marked in 2011. In addition to completing the restructuring plan, we renewed .net until 2017, DNSSEC went live in .com and we extended our .tv agreement. VeriSign was selected to run .gov for the U.S. government, and we have been selected to service the registry operator for applicants for potential future gTLDs under the new ICANN program. We brought in new talent at all levels, and we moved into our new building in Reston. ", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Wanted to ask about deferred revenue. Deferred revenue growth was lower than expected, and short-term deferred revenue basically didn't grow sequentially. Was there, Jim, any sort of registry purge or some other factor? Or was it just a function of demand possibly being a little bit lower than you were expecting in the quarter?", "John Calys", "This is John. Let me take that. I don't think that was really a surprise to us. A lot of the deferred revenue trends are seasonal. First quarter is always a strong seasonal quarter, so you see a little more of a bump. So sometimes, it could be choppy. Quarter-over-quarter, I think the full year 10% increase is what was expected, but there was no unusual purge or anything of that nature.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of renewal rates over the last 3 quarters, that is assuming that your expected Q4 estimate holds, there hasn't been much change in the overall renewal rate. So I just wanted to get your view on renewal rates in 2012. I would think you should start to see more of an uplift, particularly as the base gets a little bit more mature.", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim. I've invited Pat Kane, who's our executive in charge of the registry. And, Pat, do you want to take that one?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Yes. So the renewal -- as the age of the base, as you pointed out, gets older, you do see a change in the percentage of previously renewed domains versus first-time renewing domains. And since the previously renewed domains actually renew at a higher rate, you will see a natural growth.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I could just ask one other question. So there have been some corporations who have voiced opposition to the new gTLDs, including the timeline and process. I was just curious to get your thoughts on that, and just more broadly, how you envision this moving forward. Do you expect everything to move according to plan?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. We monitor this closely. We're supportive of the multi-stakeholder model and ICANN's plans to move forward. There has been opposition from patent holders. There were hearings both in the House and in the Senate, but the program opened up on January 12 for applications. The application period closes on April 12. And on May 1, ICANN will publish on its website a list of all of the applications. I expect that there will probably be some more comments from the various stakeholders, but that's how the process works. So from our perspective, as I said, we're participants in the program. We're supportive of ours and the participation of others in it. And I think we've made our view of that clear, that we apply for domain names. We see it as an opportunity to be a service provider. We don't expect the revenue to be material. We don't expect it before 2013, but we expect the market to grow. And we expect our business to grow as a result.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to focus on margins for a moment. Obviously, the exit margin guidance you gave of, whatever, 52% to 54%, I believe consensus was 51.6%, it was clearly ahead of where consensus was. What's driving that continued leverage? And then, Jim, how should we think about just margins going forward and the leverage of this business? And just kind of -- is there a target that you have in mind or a ceiling that you see out there? Or how do you think about it?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I think the guidance that we -- margin guidance that we just delivered for 2012 is obviously the way we see it and describe it now. I'll just say that post restructuring, I think there's kind of a long tail that I would describe as a continual optimization of our efforts to do a better job, to focus on our customers better and change the way we do things. Remember, we've gone from over 5,000 employees to roughly 1,000. Actually, we ended 2011 at 1,009 employees. So the process of discovering processes here at VeriSign that haven't caught up with the new VeriSign yet, I think, will probably continue for a while. So I think you see that reflected in our guidance for the year. So I expect in the process of finding ways to do our job better, we'll probably find efficiencies, and we expect that to happen.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Any thoughts, high-level, of how fast you expect the zone file to grow in 2012?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. The revenue guidance that we gave you was $865 million to $890 million for the year, and that has underlying a 6% to 8% unit growth rate for net new names.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Perfect. And this might be for Pat Kane. But on the new gTLDs, the question that I get asked is, will this cannibalize .com, and if not, kind of why not?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, what the new gTLD program is designed to do is to offer more choice for individual registrants. And while that will certainly have people choose domain names in different TLDs for the first time, we also recognize there's tremendous value in having your domain name in .com. And so we will likely see multiple registrations for individual registrants.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then lastly, can you say how many new gTLDs VeriSign intends to bid for directly?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think -- go ahead, Pat.", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, we intend to do about 12. Most of those will be transliterations of .com.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could address your expectations around the NIA business. There's been a lot of headlines about the impact of hacker groups and denial of service attacks. And what your expectations for that business will be over the next year.", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, as we mentioned, that business exceeded our expectations in 2011. We like that business. We think it's a business of growing importance. In particular, I think what you're referring to, which is the DDoS Mitigation part of that business, although we saw growth across all 3 sections of the NIA business, there is the iDefense threat intelligence unit, a managed DNS business, and of course the DDoS Mitigation service. Certainly, denial of service attacks have been more visible, and there's tremendous interest in technology that's available, a service that's available for companies to protect themself. We're well-positioned to benefit from that. I think it's one of the reasons we like the business. It's a growth area. The other reason, of course, is that it leverages our core strengths and our reputation, and we have a tremendous amount of experience. In general, concerning NIA, we now have the sales force hired. We're where we want to be there. And the areas that we're working on in NIA primarily is to structure it for scalability and also to find ways to improve the quality of revenue and make it closer to the quality of revenue that most of our revenues reflect. So we're optimistic about it, but we're obviously not breaking it out separately. And can't tell you exactly when we'll do that. But we're continuing to invest in that business.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And just a follow-up on your uses of cash for buybacks. What pace of buybacks are you expecting to implement this year? And do you also have any plans to deploy some of that offshore cash?", "John Calys", "I missed just the last word there.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "To deploy the cash that's offshore.", "John Calys", "Yes, right. We don't provide any specific guidance on our repurchase activity normally. Obviously, we have $831 million left under our board-approved plan. We evaluate our cash needs and potential uses for cash on a regular basis, and that includes evaluating our offshore cash balances as well in terms of doing what we think is optimal for the company and the shareholders.", "D. James Bidzos", "Ed, this is Jim. I would just add that, basically, our view of buybacks as one option for returning value to shareholders is unchanged. The board authorization of $831 million, as John mentioned, continues to stand. Nothing's changed in our view, and I think we made it clear that there were just pending cash liquidity issues that were unresolved. They did all become favorably resolved at the end of Q4, but as we mentioned, that was the only reason that there were no buybacks in the quarter.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Jim, I'm wondering what type of updates -- you said we'll get updates on the .com process. I mean, what sort of updates do you envision providing us as we go through the next February month with that process ongoing?", "D. James Bidzos", "Let's see. I guess the material events that would certainly be disclosed, of course, would be the -- if you follow the .net process, as I'm sure most of you probably did, there was some point at which we came together with ICANN, agreed on the form of renewal. There were some minor issues, as we mentioned, in the contract. So if you could look back at .net when those issues were addressed and a version of the contract was ready for the public review process, it was then posted on ICANN's website for public comment for 30 days. I will say there's been one change since last year. There's a new ICANN policy that became effective January 1, 2012, in which their public comment periods have changed from a single 30-day comment period to 2 comment periods of 21 days each, effectively making the 30-day comment period a 42-day comment period. But I think the next visible event will be the presentation of that agreement for comment, that then follows, of course, formal approval by ICANN's Board of Directors. And .com, of course, being a little different than .net, we then present that to the Department of Commerce for their approval. So those are the high-level sequence of events. All of that should conclude no later than the termination date of the existing agreement, the expiration date, which is November 30, 2012. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is a timetable and a process. There's been engagement and activity since I last spoke to you, and we're pleased with that progress. So I think that's what we can say to you right now, but that's an overview of the process itself. And I think those are the events you can expect to see being disclosed certainly by VeriSign, but also information that'll appear on, in particular, the contract for public comment on ICANN's website.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then just on -- I guess it may be a question for Pat. But on the domain name guidance, if I look at, I guess, this quarter, we had some confusion on our end whether or not it was 1.8 or 1.9 adds but sort of in the lower end of your range. I recall last quarter, kind of in the lower end of your range. And I'm wondering, as you look at the guidance that you give, what in the last couple of quarters and then how are you looking at Q1 in terms of that range and what factors are driving you to be in the -- have driven you to be in the low end and may influence Q1?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, growth is always dependent upon 2 factors. One is the new registrations and one is the renewal rates as well. And so when we take a look at the range, we have to take into account what renewal rates will look like. And renewal rates fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, dependent upon specific activity from specific registrars. So we know we'll end up within the range. But it's I think sort of the function of the renewal rate as to how we end up where we end up within that range.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So I guess what you're saying is the last couple of quarters it's been more renewal rates that have been the delta within that range rather than the gross new adds?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, I mean, it's -- I guess the answer would be yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just want to follow up, Jim, on the renewal timeline. Given that it's an election year and given the timing of when the contract expires, is there a chance that it can go beyond November 30? And can you just review for people if it were to -- how the contracts are actually handled at that point?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, we certainly don't anticipate that we wouldn't be finished. Our timeline, certainly, the timeline and the engagement process are all designed to avoid any issues that would cause the process to extend beyond November 30. So I just don't envision that happening. I suppose it's possible, but I don't see that happening. There is a requirement that the ICANN VeriSign agreed contract be presented to the Department of Commerce for their approval 90 days prior to the expiration, and we're certainly planning to meet or beat that date and make sure that there's plenty of time to get the contract renewed, which I think everybody feels is in everyone's best interest. So I guess I don't envision that happening.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. A different topic. When you look at the fourth quarter, did you guys run any special programs with registrars to help motivate name additions? What are your plans for kind of work with registrars as you look into the first half of 2012?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, we ran some additional marketing and promotional programs in 4Q, not particularly large, but a little bit. And I would expect for 2012 that those numbers would be pretty consistent with what they've been historically for us.  Generally, the programs we run are not material, and generally, they're sort of -- at the first half of the year, I think we generally run more than we do in the second half.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And based on your kind of talks and interactions with registrars, how do you feel about -- since they're your channel, how do you feel about the help of that channel and kind of where they're positioned to help drive growth in that Naming business for 2012?", "D. James Bidzos", "Pat talks to them all the time, visits with them frequently, so perhaps he can...", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, I think if you just take a look at the new unit numbers that Jim talked about earlier where each quarter of this year was the strongest quarter we've ever had in that quarter, it's a healthy channel. They are finding uses for domain names. Whether it be small, medium businesses, enterprises, et cetera, they're -- it's strong.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, their drivers, they haven't changed. It's Internet adoption. There's more growth internationally than there is in the U.S. It's the continual move of dollars from traditional to online advertising. Basically, all the things that we're seeing just simply continuing. Internet adoption is a growth area.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Scott Kessler with S&P Capital.", "Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research", "I was wondering if you could possibly highlight one or 2 examples. Jim, you highlighted value-added services as a potential growth area for this year, and maybe if you could just talk about one or 2 areas where you might see some uplift.", "D. James Bidzos", "Sure. I guess the obvious area is, first of all, there are several categories of value-added services. First of all, Pat's group is continually developing value-added services for the registrar channel to help them manage their business. We provide them with information, we provide them with data, reports, analyses from the zone that help them manage their business better and hopefully maximize the registrations that they perform. We call that value-added services here at VeriSign. The other growth area that we talked about was NIA, which is an adjacency that's very relevant in the sense that it plays to our strength. The IDN or our DDoS Mitigation service, of course, is a result of homegrown efforts from a very purpose-developed network where we couldn't buy off the shelf solutions, and now we've productized some of those. And managed DNS is essentially our ability to deliver our experience in developing performance in the network and deliver that to customers. So all of those things you might consider value-added services. Certainly, even though we're the largest consumer of some of the threat intelligence information that comes from our iDefense unit, that is also a value-added services. There are new value-added services that we're exploring. We're not talking about these. These are areas, research that we've engaged in. I think it's fair to say we're focused on this like we haven't been before. We're investing more in research. We think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We are seeing opportunities. And these are fundamental new value-added services that would complement and fit well with our current DNS lookup services. So until we're ready to talk about those, we can't say more. But that is the focus of our research efforts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jaimin Soni with Bank of America.", "Jaimin Soni", "I just wanted to follow up on the last question. And looking at the margins guidance that you guys have provided, margins were obviously expected to grow at a nice clip next year. Do you think there's more opportunity in investing more of this upside back into the business to fuel the other growth options that you guys are looking at, like NIA? And are you comfortable with the level of investment in these adjacent opportunities?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, that's a very good question. And the answer is absolutely yes. So in the case of NIA in particular, I mentioned that we're doing a couple of things with NIA. Number one is that we're focusing on structuring it to scale for growth. So -- and also, what we're doing with NIA is finding ways that we can sort of increase the quality of revenue to look more like our traditional business. So those are 2 things we want to do before we make the investment. Before we essentially step on the gas pedal, so to speak, we want to make sure that it's going to scale well, grow smoothly and provide a quality of revenue. So anything that we can do up front before we make the major investment, I think, will pay great dividends down the road if we're successful in achieving good, scalable growth and quality of revenue. So we will be making those investments. We have been making that effort to optimize the business, and that's been the focus of NIA. And we have plenty of cash, and I think you'll -- essentially, our guidance for you in 2012 incorporates our anticipated investments in those areas. There is no anticipation that we would make any acquisitions to fuel that growth. I think most of what we want to do leverages our core strengths. VeriSign, I think most of you understand, is unique. We do have a very purpose-developed network that's actually unique. I think that's something that's not well understood that in the future we're going to try to communicate better. Not only are we databases linked together by a high-speed network, but our ability to do updates, to do them quickly in realtime essentially and replicate it globally across a very diverse network and reliably is unique. And when you're talking about developing services that come from that sort of strength, trading on that kind of strength, those are investments that we have to make here. We have to make that, not buy it, because nobody's doing anything like that. Now if there are opportunities that we see to accelerate that process by making acquisitions that allow us to buy versus make pieces of those efforts as they start to come together, we'll certainly look at those and do those. But it's our view that we have adequate cash to do all of those growth areas and make all those investments. And that's all baked into our guidance for 2012 in margins.", "Jaimin Soni", "So, Jim, when you say that you want to build a base on NIA a little bit more before you step on the accelerator, is this more of a second half of 2012 that we're thinking about or 2013, when you think the timing would be right?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I think what we've said is that at this point, we fully staffed up the NIA sales team. We've done some optimization and restructuring a bit in how the products are packaged and bundled and sold. There are ways in which we have a billing relationship with the customer that will help us get sort of the right scalable structure. I think we're getting pretty close to the end of that process. And 2012, as we said, is a year of execution. So throughout the year, we'll be making investments as we see appropriate, depending on how the marketing effort plays out. But I think we're pretty close to getting ready to make some investments and grow that business a little bit quicker. It's a solid growth area, leverages our strength, there is a need and we like it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question on new name growth. So you mentioned the 4 record quarters that you had throughout 2011. And as I extrapolate kind of your range for Q1, it seems like you're expecting again another record in Q1 of '12 and even maybe a little bit of acceleration in the year-over-year growth. So as we think about '12, how should we begin to think about new name growth, especially kind of given the global economic situation?", "D. James Bidzos", "Pat, do you want to comment?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Yes, this is Pat. So Jim mentioned some of the factors that we track in terms of Internet adoption, online advertising spend. And as those metrics continue to go up and to the right, we will -- people will find new ways to use domains, generate new small, medium businesses and continue to find ways on the Internet. So I think that as long as people continue to adopt the Internet, both domestically and internationally, we're going to see continued growth within .com.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, I think Internet adoption, really, is the key here. I mean, I know some numbers, but I don't know some others. For example, the GDP in the U.S. is roughly $15 trillion. In Europe, it's roughly $16 trillion. And globally, it's about $63 trillion. What portion of U.S. GDP is economic activity that's reliant on the Internet? It's probably more -- substantially more than the rest of the world certainly and probably more than Europe. But the rest of the world is catching up. I think that's one way to just think about the opportunity. Pat's right, Internet adoption and growth, greater reliance of economic activity on the use of the Internet, that's going to continue at a rate that's probably faster than in the U.S. only because of the amount of penetration in the market here. And I think the challenge is ours to find ways to make sure we get our fair share and exploit it and be smart about how we go after it. And we look at those things, we think about them. And we see growth, and we see opportunities.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then any sense of how many names are up for renewal in Q1 of '12?", "D. James Bidzos", "I'm sorry, the number of names that are up for renewal in calendar 2012?", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "No, Q1 of '12.", "D. James Bidzos", "Oh, I'm sorry, Q1. I don't know if I have that number handy.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "And the only other question, with regard to the registry, I think it's a -- somewhat of a follow-on to Walter's question when he talked about -- I think it's been 4 out of the last 6 quarters, you've been at the lower end of the range, and you talked about that really being a function of the renewal rate. And I know there's 2 varying renewal rates that you guys track. It's names that are 1 year old and names that are multiple years old. So if that's been coming in a little bit lower, is it one group or the other?", "John Calys", "The renewal rates on both are trending up slightly, both for first time and times renewing past their first time. I think the renewal rate split is about 56.2 on first time, and it's 82.2 roughly, I think, for second time and beyond. And certainly, as those names renew, beyond the first time, second, third and fourth, that rate continues to climb.", "D. James Bidzos", "By the way, we found the other number. So the number that's coming up for renewal in Q1 of 2012 is 25.2 million.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.", "Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Jim, I wonder if you could tell us, if you'd be willing to tell us, how much NIA contribution or a growth range you're assuming for the revenue guidance for 2012.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, we're not breaking that out, so it's probably early to tell you that. I hope that during 2012, we'll be able to tell you a lot more about it. I think all we said at this point and all I can say now is that the team is exceeding its bookings target that we assigned it.", "Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "And just one follow-up related to NIA. Is the distribution model changing yet very much quarter-on-quarter? Do you envision it changing much in 2012 for VeriSign?", "D. James Bidzos", "There's a transition that's going on that we're very pleased with. It's going well. That's part of the scaling efforts, is a shift in the distribution model, and that's going according to plan.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just had 2 housekeeping follow-ups. Can you go into a little bit more detail? I missed the 2-set impact on the non-recurring. I think you said it was a $4 million pretax charge. Can you just give us a little detail what that was regarding? And I had one other follow-up.", "John Calys", "That was a non-recurring item that we booked in fourth quarter, onetime for $4 million. And we don't expect it to recur, and it passed us.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But what was it tied to? What was it referring to?", "John Calys", "It referred to some non-income-related taxes, non-income tax.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, out of period.", "John Calys", "Right.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got you. And then the other one is, with the cash that you're able to repatriate, is there additional cash that you can use the same methods to repatriate additional cash going forward?", "John Calys", "At this point in time, what we repatriated was all of our previously taxed income, at least through the end of 2011 -- or 2010, I'm sorry, 2010. So there's a small amount of incremental income that's earned offshore that gets taxed U.S. every year. Obviously, the objective is not to have any, but there's a little bit each year. That amount that we repatriated had built it up over a few-year period. So I wouldn't [ph] say there's a substantial amount of previously taxed income to bring back near term.", "Operator", "And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we processed 8.4 million new registrations in Q2, a second quarter record, while adding 1.81 million net names, finishing the quarter with 118.5 million names in the domain name base. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.", "During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.9 million shares for $76 million. Thus far, in 2012, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares or about $144 million, and we have approximately $687 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "On June 23, 2012, ICANN approved the renewal of VeriSign's agreement to service the operator of the .com registry for the term commencing on December 1, 2012, through November 30, 2018. As you may know, the .com renewal agreement terms, including the pricing provisions, are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights.", "The U.S. Department of Commerce, under an agreement called the Cooperative Agreement, is now reviewing the renewal of the .com registry agreement. We expect their approval on the renewal of the .com agreement by November 30.", "During the month of July, we marked 15 years of uninterrupted uptime for the .com and .net zone infrastructure. This is a tremendous achievement and I would like to recognize the efforts of our engineering and operation teams for meeting this milestone. We continue to make protecting our DNS infrastructure a priority, while continuing to meet and exceed requirements of our service-level agreements.", "I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 103.7 million names, while .net equaled 14.8 million names. The total base of registered names in common net was approximately 118.5 million at the end of June. This represents increases of 7.8% year-over-year and 1.6% quarter-over-quarter.", "In the second quarter, we added 1.81 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 8.4 million new registrations or a 4.2% increase in new registrations over the same period a year ago.", "The first quarter of 2012 renewal rate was 73.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares to 73.1% achieved in the second quarter of 2011.", "While Q2 is our second strongest quarter on record for new registrations, our net names added to the domain name base was at the low end of our guidance, primarily driven by what appears to be a softer-than-expected preliminary Q2 renewal rate. Our first time renewal rate was the main driver of the decrease in the preliminary second quarter renewal rate. First time renewal rates are driven by many factors, and 2 factors had incremental impacts in the second quarter.", "First, search engine adjustments made over the past several months affected the economics, which drove domain monetization rates in the first half of 2012. While monetization rates have increased for better performing sites, lower performing sites do not seem to be benefiting. We believe that some of these first time renewing, lower performing sites did not renew during the quarter as a result of these changes, leading to the lower renewal rate. We have seen these search engine changes in the past and the resulting impacts on first time renewing names and our overall renewal rate. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted within several months.", "Secondly, we also believe that some additional promotional activity by registrars during the middle of 2011 led to a lower first time renewal rate this year. We expect the third quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.6 million and 1.9 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality.", "Also, please note that starting tonight, we will make available a summary of the number of active domain names registered in the .com and net registries and the number of .com and .net domain names that are registered but not configured for use in the respective top-level domain zone file. This information will be available from links on our corporate and Investor Relations website, which will also include definitions and explanations of the data. This additional information will continue to increase transparency into the overall size of common net zones as well as increase the frequency that this summary level information is available.", "Our NIA business continues to exhibit steady year-over-year bookings growth. We are focusing our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue.", "Now, let me turn over the call to our CFO, George Kilguss.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year-ago level and 4% sequentially. Of note, during the second quarter, revenue included an out-of-period adjustment that reduced revenue by reclassifying approximately $1.8 million from previously recognized revenue back into deferred revenue. Without this onetime reclassification, revenue would have approached $216 million in the quarter.", "During the quarter, the company also delivered GAAP operating income of $107 million, up 30% from $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 50%, up from 43% from the comparable period a year ago, which was a result of expenses remaining relatively flat from year-ago levels. GAAP net income totaled $68 million compared to a GAAP net loss of $11 million a year earlier.", "As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of June 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of this $1.4 billion total, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.", "Total liabilities were $2 billion as of the second quarter, up slightly from $1.9 billion at year end. Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under our $200 million credit facility and the $598 million present value of our $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet to its $1.25 billion face value over its 25-year remaining term.", "Let me now recap our performance for the second quarter for our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow, then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $214 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign operations. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic-sourced revenue, which grew 11.6% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $804 million, a $75 million increase from year end and $90 million increase from the second quarter of 2011.", "Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes $8.5 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million and was flat sequentially.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter continued to expand and totaled 54% compared to 51.9% in the first quarter of 2012. Our second quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to keep expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to improve our operating margin.", "Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2011 and $0.42 last quarter.", "Now I would like to update you on our taxes. As mentioned earlier, our international markets are growing slightly faster than our domestic markets. As a result, the proportion of income being generated overseas is also increasing. Our foreign income is taxed at a lower marginal rate than our domestic income that we expect to see an improvement in our blended tax rate over time. Accordingly, we believe a more reasonable estimate of our non-GAAP tax rate would be 28% going forward, down from our previous estimate of 30%. We expect to use a 28% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting third quarter 2012 non-GAAP results.", "In 2012, we now expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 164 million shares in the second quarter compared to 163 million shares in the first quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 5.6 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.1 million shares from Q1. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q1 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.9 million shares repurchased during the current quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, up from $110 million in Q1 of this year and up compared to $13 million for the same quarter last year, which included a $100 million contingent interest payment to convertible bondholders. Free cash flow was $130 million for the second quarter of 2012, including $8 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.", "With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $880 million, representing an annual growth rate of between 13% and 14%. We previously gave a range of $870 million to $890 million on the last call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be at least 55%. We previously gave a lower range of 52% to 54% on our last call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012 compared with the $38 million estimate given on our last call.", "And finally, capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% and 8% of revenue. We gave a 7% to 10% range on the last call.", "Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, we continue to experience solid performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. And before opening the call to your questions, I would like to share with you how we're thinking about the business across the 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the Internet infrastructure which we operate. We'll also continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement.", "Second, in addition to the organic growth of our Naming business, we see new gTLDs in our NIA business as adjacent potential growth opportunities.", "Third, we continue to focus on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the domain name system.", "And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We seek to run the business efficiently and effectively through managing costs and continued margin improvement.", "We believe that delivering on these 4 areas with a right balance should provide unparalleled performance for our customers and create value for our shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You mentioned the search engine changes heading the renewal rate, can you give us more color on that as well as was there anything else going on during the quarter that may have impacted the renewal rate?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, Sterling, it's Jim. We think there were 2 main things that drove the slight reduction in the renewal rate. First of all, we mentioned that promotion by a large registrar that was very aggressive and led to an unusually larger number of first time renewing names, which I think, coupled with the changes in the search algorithm were the primary contributors to the reduced renewal rate. The monetization community out there has a history. This has happened before. It happened, as you recall, in 2008, and they have a history of rebounding. They generally sort of adapted the changes after 1 quarter or 2 at most. So we expect that to happen in this case, and all of that is factored into the guidance that we gave.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right. Great. And you mentioned the 8.4 million new names that were added, can you give us a sense whether maybe international versus domestic, what kind of trends you're seeing in the new name portion of the net names?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. First of all, we obviously don't guide that to new adds, but I will say that -- point out that 8.4", "million names is a record for the second quarter and the second highest overall. And I would like George to comment on the impact of domestic versus international.", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Sterling. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're really seeing the international markets grow a little faster than domestically, and they grew 14.5% in the comparable period versus 11.6% domestically. So I think if you use those revenue growth rates, that should give you a consistent idea of the growth that we're seeing internationally versus domestic.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question on margins and then just the domain name guidance. Obviously, you guys have another big margin quarter this quarter and you raised the full year outlook or, I guess, ending -- end-of-the-year outlook. When you think about just your margin structure here, can you give a sense just for anything sort of just the incremental margins are? And especially when you get into potentially the renewal season next year, what are some of the changes to the contract and incremental fees just if that changes at all? And in terms of just the guidance for Q3 for net adds, just wondering what was behind that? Did you assume somewhat lower first year renewal rates or just what was baked into that?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Winslow, this is George speaking. So with regard to operating margin, clearly, we just updated our guidance to exit fourth quarter at least 55%. I think if you look back historically at how we've done from a margin expansion perspective, it's really come from our revenue growth. We've historically been a pretty good shepherd of our funds and maintaining our operating expenses in line, while we've had growth in between marketing or in between R&D. You've seen, we've managed that expense pretty well. As it relates to net adds guidance, clearly, as Jim mentioned, there have been some changes in the search algorithm and that typically takes a few quarters to wash through. And so we're just reflecting that experience into our current guidance for Q3.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, Phil, this is Jim. I think you'd also asked about ICANN fees next year and its potential impact on margins. I guess I'll leave the math to everyone, but basically the changes in the ICANN .com contract took us from annual fees of roughly $17 million based on an alignment now. The change aligns us with their other registry agreements and it essentially puts us, based on a zone of roughly 100 million names, at about $25 million per year. So roughly $8 million additional ICANN fees in 2013 anticipated.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Walter Pritchard from Citi for our next question.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask about the small reclassification of revenue back to deferred revenue. What was the driver there and is this something that could recur in the future?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Walter. The $1.8 million nonrecurring revenue charge was related to a system error of the seldom use feature in our revenue recognition database. One of our secondary controls caught the error in our quarterly review process and we made the out-of-period adjustment this quarter. We fixed that system issue, and we've actually implemented a number of additional processes and procedures to avoid this problem from recurring in the future.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And then just on the renewal rate, I guess, I understand we've seen the search engine changes in the past, and I'm just wondering why you only saw it in the first time renewals and not in the base. It would seem like there probably were some names in the base as well that might have been infected by changes to the search engine and might have also had a lower renewal rate as the result?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Yes, Walter this is Pat. So we did see it across both the first time renewing names and the previously renewed names, but we saw a larger impact in the first time renewing names.", "Operator", "And we'll now go to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In terms of new gTLDs, did you run the expenses for those applications through the P&L this period? And is there anymore expense that we should expect from that in the future?", "George E. Kilguss", "Steve, no. We recorded most of that expense in Q1. There was, I think, one application that we did incur in Q2, but most of that hit our sales and marketing expense last quarter.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then I wonder if you could just talk maybe qualitatively about your thoughts on the timing of the next price increase, what kind of considerations would go into that?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. Well, I think it's a bit early probably for us to talk about that. I think every time an opportunity comes for us to know, there's a price increase. We have to take into account the considerations that surround the business. And I guess it's premature really to talk about that. Assuming that, and as we do expect that the .com contract will receive consent from the Commerce Department for the renewal and be effective no later than November 30, then the first opportunity to do so would be in December. So I think we probably be in a better position to talk to you about that then, what the factors, the economic factors, the climate would be and give you some more information then, but I think it's premature at this point.", "Operator", "And we'll now take a question from Dan Cummins from ThinkEquity.", "Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Question for Jim on your strategy around the Managed Security Services. How is that going? Are you pleased with the progress? And does your higher year-end profit projection reflect any change in your investment posture around some growth initiatives?", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay. I assume when you said MSS, you meant NIA or am I...", "Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "Yes, exactly, the NIA. Exactly.", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay, okay. Yes, we are still achieving bookings growth as we've planned for that business. I did mention in the last couple of calls and I mentioned again in this call that we are working to scale that business better for the quality of revenue that's more consistent with what we get from our Naming business. And I also mentioned in this call, which I've not mentioned before, that we are looking at ways that we can align expense with revenues. So I think those are some -- we don't break it out separately, of course, but I think that should give you a feel for where we're going with that business.", "Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division", "And does it still figure somewhat in your M&A strategy or potential M&A strategy? I know you said before it's a market you like very much and you've mentioned before the problems associated with finding quality revenue.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, I would say our M&A policy is unchanged and whether it applies to that or any other part of our business, it's the same. We would certainly look at opportunities, if they helped us get on our product roadmap or our strategy faster. We do not have M&A on our radar. That is not part of our strategy. We don't view M&A as a strategy. I think what you should expect from us is if there was a small tuck-in opportunity, we'd look at it, if it helps us accelerate our strategy, but that would be the only reason.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Rob Owens from Pacific Crest.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "On the revenue reclass, the $1.8 million, was that a cumulative number that you just effectively took in this period or was that something that was an error relative to this period?", "George E. Kilguss", "Rob, yes, that was a cumulative, I'll call it, error that we accounted for in this period. So approximately -- of the $1.8 million, approximately $1 million is related to 2011 and the balance was related to first quarter of 2012.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And I apologize if I missed this, but what was the net new names guidance for Q3? Was that given earlier on the call?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes it was. It was 1.6 million to 1.9 million.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and sorry about that. We're managing multiple calls. And then lastly, what are names up for renewal in Q3? Do you have that metric in front of you?", "D. James Bidzos", "Let's see if we can find that. John do you  have that?", "George E. Kilguss", "This is George. I think it's 23.7 million names that are renewing in the third quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will now  take a question from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just had a couple of quick questions. So I guess longer term, assuming that the .com renewal goes according to plan, once you have that visibility on the next 6 years of revenue, how should we think about your comfort with leverage and potentially increasing your leverage target?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Gray, this is George. So I would start by saying that, look, I've been in the chair for about 2 months, so we'll continue to take a look and evaluate our capital structure, and this will be something we'll be spending some more time on over the next few quarters. But I can give you maybe a few thoughts that I have developed over the past 2 months. On the leverage side, and being a former lender earlier in my career, I tend to look at the total debt obligations outstanding the company has compared to its EBITDA as a measure of leverage. And when I look at VeriSign, we have, as you know, a $1.25 billion convertible bond plus about $200 million revolving credit facility, so somewhere between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion of total outstanding debt and commitments today. If you were to simply annualize our second quarter EBITDA and then compare that to the debt level that we have, you probably get a ratio of somewhere between 2.6 or 2.8x. And so the real question we need to answer, as a firm, over the coming quarters is, what is the appropriate leverage ratio for the business. We clearly have some debt capacity, but it's really all a matter of what is the appropriate risk profile for the business. So we'll have to do some more work to do on that, but that's really the current framework that I'm thinking about the debt that we have on the books and some thoughts around our capital structure.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it, that's very helpful. And then just one other question, if I can. What kind of investments should we expect you to incur to support the new gTLDs that you recently won? And should we think about that showing up as -- or I guess when should we think about that showing up as incremental CapEx or OpEx?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, clearly, we'll have some incremental cost in bringing those on. I think what we really have to do is to wait for ICANN to go through their process and their approval process, then we'll have a definitive idea of who's been awarded what names. But clearly, we will have some incremental expense to do that. But again, that probably won't affect too much of 2013. But we'll probably give you more information and guidance to that on our fourth quarter call as we give guidance for 2013.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, I would just add to that, that we talked last quarter about the numbers. The number was 220 brands that had signed on to have VeriSign run their back-end registry services, and that number was the result of a process as Pat mentioned in the call last quarter. And I think, as I have mentioned as well, we actually did not take all the business that was available to us there. We do have the benefit of a long history of operating experience, a long reliability record and plus the fact that we just don't run common net, we run under other domains as well. We run .tv and .name and we have a structure that lends itself to supporting this type of multiple domain structure. So I think we're very carefully prepared and positioned and more experienced than -- I think we have a pretty good view into this, so I think George's comments were accurate. And that first of all, we have to wait and see which applications actually get through and what the actual number is. But there was a lot of thought and a lot of process and a lot of careful consideration given to arriving at the 220 number. And so we feel comfortable that we're prepared and our structure is predesigned to support multiple domains. So I think we're in good shape.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the new gTLDs, curious if there's any update on the process just over the past 4 to 5 weeks from your vantage point? And then also if you have any thoughts as to when you think we could potentially go live?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I'll let Pat comment. I'll just say that we're currently at a point where now the application period is where the reveal is made and everybody sees the strings that are applied for. ICANN is now undertaking its evaluation of all of those applications. But at some point, there will be a process that yield to the ultimate results. And maybe for a little more color, I'll ask Pat to comment.", "Patrick S. Kane", "And so I think the one thing to keep in mind is that during the evaluation process, there's a lot of things will take place in terms of what ICANN does, what the government advisory committee does and we believe that there'll be additions to the root zone come Q2 of 2013 in terms of things that will be meaningful. It's at the top of the list.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then we saw -- on another note, we saw the world IPv6 launch take place last month. Is there a point at which IPv6 could become a meaningful resonant opportunity for VeriSign? How do you think about that?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I don't know if I can tell you what that point is, but I think that gradually over time, helping our customers transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is certainly an opportunity for us and we are examining, as part of our innovation efforts, the opportunities that we have to add value to that transition process mainly around better security optimization. So we do see that as an opportunity, but I think it's too early to talk about when or exactly what it is.", "Operator", "We'll now go to Ed Maguire from CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I just had a question about the inputs into the capital efficiency. Since you've raised your margin expectations and lowered capital expense guidance for the year, what's behind this? It looks like you're getting greater, greater efficiencies out of your current infrastructure?", "George E. Kilguss", "I don't think there's anything material behind it, Ed. We continue to be good stewards of the business. We're looking for ways to be more efficient in the business and drive increased profitability. I just think it's continuing being prudent of looking at projects, evaluating them and making sure that we're doing the best job for the shareholders as we can.", "D. James Bidzos", "I would add to that, that the 4 points of our strategy, protect, grow, innovate and manage, they are there for a reason. We focus on them and in manage, we try to manage the business efficiently. So there is this longer tail of the restructuring that we undertook 5 years ago. I know it's been quite a while since 2007 when we began the divestiture, but it was -- even though it was completed in 2010, there are many opportunities for us to optimize and to do our business more efficiently. When you go from greater than 5,000 employees to roughly 1,000, you don't fix everything overnight. So we're finding efficiencies, and I think that's reflected in our increasing margins.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Great. And I did want to follow up, you've made the comment about 220 registry agreements that you signed with the applicants. I'm just wondering if there's a possibility that might change or there are any of the contracts still up for potential bid and it sounds like you've also got a pretty high quality filter in terms of the agreements that you're seeking to go after, so any color there would be helpful.", "Patrick S. Kane", "Edward, this is Pat. So they're still talking about all the approval process, so that's 220 that we submitted at the end of the application window. So basically, there's no more applications that will be taken by ICANN at this point in time. But we know that we've got other unique services that we can provide to the registry operator, so it doesn't mean that the 220 we have today are the ultimate end set of what we do. But that being said, ICANN still has to approve all of these deals. They still sort of could -- it could go down.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll now go to Jaimin Soni from Bank of America.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wanted to go to back to margins quickly. Can you just, if you can, please tell us if the margins that -- are they tracking to your internal plan or are you beating those targets that you have internally? And then going forward, I was just wondering if there's anything that you think is stopping you from really taking this outside that you're getting in margins and investing it in other businesses like the NIA business? Is there some limitation on the scale or demand or some type of technological limitations? What now do you think is the barrier for further investments into other adjacent businesses that can potentially drive top line growth?", "D. James Bidzos", "John, it's Jim. Let me refer you back to this 4 pillar sort of strategy for managing the business. So protect, grow, innovate and manage. So you're referring to the part we think of as managing the business efficiently, which is where margin expansion will occur. The answer to your question is that we don't really think about it as any single or some number of barriers to increasing margins. We think of it as a balance across those 4 areas. Job one is to protect the business. We have growth areas we've committed investments in. That's all baked into our guidance on margins. We think that we have intellectual capital and intellectual property that we can exploit in innovation, which doesn't require great investment, no great capital vestment. And so what you get through that process of balance is the guidance that we gave you in margins. So I think what you're seeing is sort of a steady growth in margins based on, essentially, a thoughtful balance across those 4 areas of our resources. So I really don't think of it as a single barrier. George, do want to comment further?", "George E. Kilguss", "I would just say that the company's also commented in previous calls on the long tail of the restructuring. And you can never know until you actually go through the quarter as to what other efficiencies you may obtain. So clearly, obviously, we have guided 52% to 54%, and now we've increased that guidance to 55%. So we're just seeing those efficiencies come out of the business as we manage it on a day-to-day basis.", "D. James Bidzos", ".", "And again, I think that the fact that manage is 1/4 of the -- 1 of the 4 pillars of our strategy, I think, is just our way of saying to you that we pay close attention to that. We're actively looking for opportunities and that long tail of the restructuring not exclusively to save money but to optimize and be more efficient to serve our customers better, and it's working.", "Operator", "And the last question of the day will come from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Listen, on the -- where we started with the discussion in terms of the search engine changes, so when Google adapted the AdSense program, which I think was in the summer of 2008, a lot of the discussion that we had was how much of the base of names is actually advertising or pay-per-click driven. Since these are first time renewals and they're trying to drive traffic to those types of pages, is there a similar type of analysis that you've done so we can get a sense as to maybe what portion of the base are first time renewals and what portion of those might be these types of advertising names that could get impacted?", "D. James Bidzos", "We haven't talked about any specific numbers, I think, actually, Sterling, since 2008. Back then, we did talk about what we believe to be the advertising makeup of the base. My sense of it is now without any specific data to give you at this moment is, first of all, the basis of those element is obviously much larger. I guess would be that the advertising names are probably larger than they were at the time. However, if you look at the renewal rate, at 72.9 over the last 2 quarters, just looking back, I'm sorry, in the 2 periods of 2010 and 2011, the Q2 periods, it differs only by -- and we did not have, by the way, any search engine changes in those periods. You're only talking about, respectively, 0.2 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point difference in the renewal rate. So my sense is that the safety in numbers, periods at work here and that the zone is larger and even though the number of advertising names may be larger, this rather rare change in search engine algorithms, 2008, now 2012, actually had a smaller impact than it did back then. I'm sure you're remember in 2008, the impact was quite significant. Here we are with a larger zone and a larger number of advertising names and yet the impact was rather modest, literally 0.2% compared to the same period a year ago or 0.3% 2010 and 2011. So that's the way we tend to think of it. The impact was very, very modest. I don't know if you want to add anything, Pat?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Nothing.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And last question and I'll let you go, is there a sense of whether there's going to be a pickup in registrar marketing and promotional campaigns here in the September quarter that might help offset some of the falloff that you just saw this quarter?", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat. I think the registrars -- we've got insight at some of their plans, but not all of their plans, of course. I think that they run promotions from time to time and on a regular basis in terms of what's going on and just the kind of clients that they're trying to attract. So I think that you'll see that, yes.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today, and I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for a final comment.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. With regards to the events in the third quarter, please note that Jim and George will be presenting at the 2012 Citi Technology Conference at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, September 5 in New York.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. As you will have seen from the press release, we have some important news about the status of the renewal of the .com agreement. I'll begin with the news on the .com renewal and then George and I will cover the key highlights for the quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions.", "By terms in an agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign called the Cooperative Agreement, we submitted our agreement with ICANN, to service the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry to the Commerce Department for its review on June 26, 2012. As a result of communications beginning in October 2012 with the Commerce Department, we learned that the Commerce Department was conducting a review of pricing with the Department of Justice. We believe this review, which we are participating in, may continue beyond November 30, 2012, in which case a 6-month extension of the .com registry agreement would become effective. We want to emphasize that nothing has happened that changes the risk of our running .com. We expect to continue to be the registry operator of .com. Our record on security and stability has been acknowledged by the Commerce Department. We are involved in discussions with the Commerce and Justice Departments as they review the pricing terms in the .com renewal agreement. These discussions are ongoing and could extend beyond November 30. We will work diligently with them through the review process. Because of our discussions on this matter are ongoing, I'm not going to go into more detail. We will, however, update you when appropriate regarding new information. I'll now review the key highlights of the third quarter.", "The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign and we continue to see benefits from our restructuring focus and discipline. In Naming, we processed 7.8 million new registrations in the third quarter while adding 1.37 million .net names, finishing the quarter with 119.9 million names in the domain name base.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $77 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $221 million and we have approximately $610 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration.", "We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 105 million names, while .net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 119.9 million at the end of September. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter.", "In the third quarter, we added 1.37 million .net names to the domain name base and we processed 7.8 million new registrations, down 1% compared with the same period a year ago.", "In the second quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.3%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.", "Net number of names added to the domain base during the third quarter were below our guidance, primarily driven by 2 factors. First, the continuing effects of changes in search algorithms we discussed during last quarter. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months continue to affect the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in our last earnings call, we have seen these search engine changes in the past, which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters. We have no way of knowing how long they'll be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment, but we are now experiencing the second quarter of these effects.", "Secondly, we are seeing some signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, are also leading to softer international renewal rates. Given these 2 factors, we expect the fourth quarter .net names added to the base to be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names.", "As discussed on the last call, we post updates to the zone on our website at least once per day. With this increased transparency, you'll be able to track how the zone is growing throughout the fourth quarter.", "Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to focus our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $224 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $116 million, up 30% from $89 million in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 51.9% compared to 45.2% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter.", "GAAP net income totaled $78 million compared to $59 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in the quarter on a GAAP basis. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.", "Total liabilities remained at approximately $2 billion as of the third quarter, up from $1.9 billion at year end.", "As you may have noticed, during the latter part of the third quarter, the stock price exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting them into common stock during the fourth quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, the related embedded derivatives and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of September 30, 2012.", "Total debt on the balance sheet was $703 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under the $200 million credit facility and the $603 million present value of the $1.2 billion in convertible debentures.", "The convertible debentures continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.", "I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2012 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $224 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic source revenue, which grew 12.7% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $809 million, an $80 million increase from year end.", "Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million and was down 1% sequentially.", "G&A operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in legal and related expenses of $3.9 million due to efforts supporting the Department of Commerce review of our renewal of .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and the legal advice related to ICANN's new gTLD program. These increased expenses were expected as part of the .com renewal process and the new gTLD program, and were offset by lower sales and marketing expense in the quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter continued to expand and totaled 56.4% compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising cost, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to benefit our operating margin.", "Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $84 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.45 last quarter.", "With respect to taxes, as stated on our last earnings call, starting from the third quarter, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 166.6 million shares in the third quarter compared to 164.2 million shares in the second quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 9.2 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.6 million shares from the second quarter. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q2 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $122 million for the third quarter, down from $135 million in the second quarter of this year and up compared to $108 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $117 million for the third quarter of 2012, including $9 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.", "With respect to guidance, we now think revenues for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $875 million, representing an annual growth rate of about 13%. We gave a range of $870 million to $880 million on the last call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 55%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012, and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% to 7% of revenue. We gave a range of 6% to 8% on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to give you a progress update on our execution against the strategic framework we shared with you during our last call. Our strategic framework is how we're thinking about the business across 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively.", "First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the infrastructure which we operate. As discussed earlier, we will continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement.", "Second, with respect to growth, as you may have noticed, ICANN has given updates to its timeline and process for their new gTLD program. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net.", "Third, as evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the Domain Name System.", "And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas, with the right balance, should provide unparalleled performance for our customers, businesses and consumers that rely on our critical infrastructure as well as creating value for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Appreciating there may not be a lot you could say, just wondering is there anything else you could give us in terms of this process going forward here with DOC and DOJ and particularly, what type of information have they asked you for at this point?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, Walter, this is Jim. We're in that process so it would really be inappropriate to say anything about the process itself. But let me just reiterate that the status of our ability to operate .com is not an issue here. The performance, in terms of security and stability, is not an issue. As you recall, in the Cooperative Agreement, the Commerce Department gives its consent to what we negotiated with ICANN and it approves that agreement based on the public interest, which is defined as security and stability and registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions. It consults with other agencies, as necessary, in its review. That's the process we're in. We're engaged with them. There is a possibility that it will not be complete by November 30, as we said in our press release and as we've reiterated here. And I wish I could tell you more but I think that's probably the appropriate amount of information given that we're in the process. As soon as we can, we'll share more information with you.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just, George, did you give us a number of names up for renewal or if not, could you give us that number?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, I'd be happy to, Walter. The number of names up for renewal in the fourth quarter is 24 million names.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm curious if the DOT gave an indication. Are they reviewing the level of current pricing or the price increases as indicated in the new contract that's proposed?", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim again. Well, they have a review process, they have the right to review and that's what they're doing. We're in that process. I think to provide any level of detail, it's inappropriate. The process isn't complete. I can only tell you that we're participating in it. We'd like it to be done by November 30, but it is possible that it will extend beyond that. And until we're ready to tell you more, I think that's probably all the information we can give you at this point.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And one follow-up on the actual business. The number of new names processed was actually down, you mentioned the macroeconomic. Is there any particular countries in Europe or can you also talk through any programs that you may have done in the quarter or plan to do to try to invigorate the new name adoption?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sterling, this is George. In the quarter, we absolutely saw that -- well, obviously, .net names are a function of both gross additions, less the deleting names and we took a look at the additions in the quarter, they total about $7.8 million as compared to about 7.9 million names in the last year. So it was down about 1% in that comparative period and when you look at the names deleting out of the zone, we saw those deletions be about 6.4 million this quarter versus about 5.9 million a year ago. So we absolutely have seen an increase in deletions. And when we look at those deletions, we're seeing an increase in them in the international markets. And so our renewal rates, internationally, have come down a little bit. We are still doing more analysis on it, we don't have it by country, but it just seems to be related to the European economy in general is where we're seeing the deletes increase year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Harris Higher [ph] on behalf of Phil Winslow. We were hoping you could comment a little bit on international domain names and expectations going forward into 2013?", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat, Harris. We take a look at the growth opportunities for international domain names, as George said previously, we do see a little bit of drawdown in the European markets. However, we do continue to see growth in India and China and other Asia-Pac countries. And so I think that when you take a look at what our 2013 focus will be in terms of growth opportunities, it really will be China and India. So I think there's good growth coming from those areas.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So back to the Department of Commerce. Has the Department of Justice ever been involved with reviewing a contract before in the past?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. They were involved back in 2006 when the Cooperative Agreement was put together and the associated amendment. The Commerce Department is the party with which VeriSign has entered into the Cooperative Agreement, and the Commerce Department has the responsibility for review and the obligations to VeriSign to act in the public interest against the 2 standards in the agreement, security and stability and registry services. It consults with other government agencies. The Justice Department was involved back in 2006, so this is not the first time that they've been involved.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And would you care to handicap the probability of the pricing terms changing possibly before the agreement is adopted?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think given the process and where it is right now, I think it would be -- well, under most circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to do that as much as I may want to. But no, I can't do that. At this point I think given the process which is really the Commerce Department's process, although we are involved in it, that would be inappropriate for me to comment on.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And just lastly, you've mentioned the fact that Google had tweaked the search engine. Last quarter, you called that out for us. I'm just trying to understand exactly, maybe get more color on what that means. Does that simply mean that certain sites on Google search simply are not ranked high enough? And the reason I ask that is it seems that a lot of these domainer sites really are not got to through Google, they mostly are got to through native search. So trying to understand a little bit more color on what's happening and the impact on those sites.", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat. So basically, what happens with -- what they're trying to attempt to do is to push those search results down further in the rankings. And so therefore, Google is trying to push that down to increase -- or any algorithm search engine is trying to increase their own revenue. So basically, these domains end up being further down in the search results and those are clicked on less. I mean that's it's -- basically, that's the basics.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So I hate to belabor the issue but just sticking with the DOC, maybe could you just state your case for why you think the pricing for the .com contract should remain unchanged? And then, what do you say to proponents that would potentially argue that you are over earning on the contracts?", "D. James Bidzos", "Let's see, this is Jim. I think the first question goes to process and it's probably inappropriate for me to comment on. Your second question about -- is your question about our earnings?", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "No. If someone looks at your operating margins and says you guys have like a 55% operating margin and a very good business and you're potentially earning too much on the .com contract, what do you say to them to counter that argument?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think most of what I would say probably falls under the process that we're currently in. But I would say to you that as we say, as we mentioned earlier during the call, as I talked about and as George talked about, it is, to a large extent, the efficiencies that we see in the business, I think, are due to the fact that we've been running the business more efficiently. Recall of course, that we've just completed a major 5-year restructuring going from over 5,000 employees to about 1,000, shedding numerous non-core businesses, having cash that is a result of proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses, a long-term 5-year divestiture program, and our focus on managing the business efficiently and on operating discipline and on being very focused. So I would say that I think we've done a very good job over the last 5 years of optimizing the business, running it very efficiently, understanding where we are. 2011 was the first year that we really operated on a full year basis as sort of the new VeriSign, focused on one particular business, that being the Registry Services business. Prior to that, we were always something else. It wasn't until past the midpoint of 2010 that we actually completed the sale of the Authentication business. So we've just come off in 2011 and now in 2012, the first year and second year of actually being a focused registry business and it takes some time to adjust to that and as we've adjusted, we've discovered efficiencies because we focus on it. We operate the business efficiently, we target efficient operation. Generally, the result of that is improving margins. So I would say that, that's a very important part of VeriSign's margin story and its efficient business.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I'll move past the DOC questions. I know you're obviously restricted, Jim, in terms of what you can say from here, but I do want to follow up on an earlier question. There's been a lot of talk around lower renewal rates due to the search algo changes and then also, macro issues related to Europe, but the fact that new name registrations did fall slightly year-over-year, wondering if you had any more insight into that. Is that something that was restricted to Europe or did you see any of that in the U.S. or some other regions as well?", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim. Let me make a couple of comments to address that question, then I'll let George and Pat comment as appropriate here. First of all, you'll recall that back in 2009, that was really the first time that we saw a major change in search algorithms that targeted the monetization players who were essentially trying to exploit the search engine algorithm to get themselves placed higher in results so that they could drive traffic and monetize it themselves. We saw that over a period of time, after those changes, there was some recovery and the monetization community adapted to it. We saw in 2012, changes which affected Q2, which we've discussed with you before. I think there is a more serious effort by the search engine algorithm players here to sort of clean up search results and improve the quality, as Pat said, to drive some of the monetization community down further. So we discussed in the last call, the Panda and Penguin programs, for example, that Google utilized where they were targeting content farms, they were targeting keyword stuffers and now they're also targeting exact name matches, which typically are monetization names often. So for example, if you search for purple blue widgets, and purplebluewidgets.com happens to be a registered domain, that in the past, would've been likely to score very high in the search results. However, if the search engine algorithm is tweaked to go out and consider other factors, the age of the domain, how many pages are on it, how fresh is some of the content and give it a score, essentially, on how likely it is that it's truly quality content that the searcher might be interested in versus something that had been set up for monetization purposes, I think the search engine algorithms are essentially targeting that kind of traffic to get it out. You'll also recall that back in 2009, we said that roughly 9% of the zone, as far as we could tell, were so-called advertising names. We're not at a point right now to tell you exactly what that number is today. But I think there might be some developments where other domains have sort of -- other TLDs have targeted in a sense, this monetization community and possibly, some of those names may have been drawn away over the years and moved to other areas, which is, in a sense, a good thing because it means that these changes, while they are making a difference and I know you see that every day, we do too, of course, and while it may take longer to recover depending on how intense and how sustained these campaigns are, the fact is that there may be fewer of these names to work on in .com because of the move to other TLDs. I know Pat watches this very, very closely and George does as well so I'll invite them to comment.", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat. So one of the types of models that Jim is referring to is the one that .tk runs. And so, .tk basically gives away domain registrations for a set of criteria which includes an ad revenue share. So we believe that there's some data that shows that people are using or going to that type of model and registering domains in .tk to drive pure registration without the initial investment that was required within a .com or a .net registration. Those domain names will be up for a while, they develop those names and then the .tk registry itself can take those names back if certain objectives aren't made with the registrar under the domain name, and therefore, continues to be a registration that is run by the registry operator itself.", "George E. Kilguss", "And only thing I would add, Gregg, is that if you look back historically, we do have a little bit of seasonality in the third quarter. Typically, Q1 and Q2 are always a little heavier from a gross registration perspective than Q3 and Q4 are. This particular year in 2012, we actually had an extraordinary strong Q1 and Q2 and so while numerically, decline looks a little steeper in Q3, Q3 this year is falling relatively on top of last year's Q3 gross adds from that perspective.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ed Maguire with CLSA.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just comment on the upside to the operating margin. Were there any unusual factors that led you to see incremental cost savings?", "George E. Kilguss", "So Ed, this is George Kilguss. So in the quarter in general, our total operating costs stayed relatively level with last quarter. We had some movements in the pieces, we saw general and administrative expenses increase by about $3.9 million related to some of the legal costs we had with the DOC and the new gTLD program. And they were offset by some lower spend in our sales and marketing. As you may have known, we had a transition in our leadership and our marketing area, and so we had some underspend in that area, at least in the third quarter. But we at least managed those costs and they offset one another in the quarter. So we, again, look for efficiencies but for example, in the fourth quarter, which we talked about, we will have a change in the ICANN registration fees. Those will go on a more variable basis, instead of a fixed basis. So they'll go up to about $0.25 per name. So starting December 1, we'll see the fees paid to ICANN increase in cost of about $750,000 a month. So costs do vary, but we're doing our best to try to offset those increased costs with efficiencies from the long tail of the restructuring.", "D. James Bidzos", "If I can just add to that, I agree entirely with what George said, I just feel that I should add the caveat, of course, as you know, we've just come off the restructuring, we've optimized, we've run the business much more efficiently, but I'm sure a lot of you have seen in the news recently, the number of DDoS attacks against financial institutions. Some of them sustained, some of them still continuing today, more sophisticated, larger in scale. I would just say that given the nature and growth of these attacks, obviously, we don't budget for the kinds of things that we might need to do to adapt as some of these attacks grow but it is a fact that you're seeing playing out in today's headlines every day, the kind of attacks against infrastructure, against targets for political or other reasons by nation states, at least, it's alleged in some cases. So the caveat is while we run the business very efficiently, events could of course, always dictate that we do need to make capital investments in order to stay ahead of the curve. That's how we got to where we are today with the uptime record that we have. Without getting into the process that we're in with DOC and DOJ, the question earlier about what sort of VeriSign's position is. I mean, I would just simply point out that VeriSign has an unparalleled record of performance in the operational availability of .com and .net and our focus is there and that's our first job and that's the primary requirement of the ICANN contract in terms of the SLAs and that's the first of our 4-part strategy framework, so we do focus there a lot. I think VeriSign's story sort of speaks for itself. We've supported an infrastructure that has allowed e-commerce to flourish and numerous billions of dollars of economic activity sit and rely on the infrastructure and I think it just simply speaks for itself that VeriSign is the secure and stable provider of that infrastructure, that's job 1 and whatever it takes to maintain that, we will.", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Great. And just any updates on some of the contracts you have for granting of new generic TLDs? I know you'd signed a number of the contracts before the bidding process went out and I'm just wondering if there had been any update to some of the arrangements you've had with your contacted parties?", "D. James Bidzos", "Let me just clarify. Are you talking about the applications we've made directly for the IDNs, the International...", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "No, the arrangements to provide back-end services?", "D. James Bidzos", "Oh, okay. For other brands who might want VeriSign to be their back-end service provider?", "Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Yes, precisely.", "D. James Bidzos", "Pat, go ahead, please.", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat. So Gregg, there's been no change in that from the standpoint of where we are. The application window closed so we're not able to take on additional partners at this time. But basically, that process is moving ahead as ICANN has planned. And basically, they've been able to keep a better target on their current timeline such that we believe that, that will transpire in fall of 2013.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Fred Zeigel with Topeka Capital Markets.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Pat, to you, a couple of questions. First, on the international side, has there been a .com to ccTLD displacement as far as you can tell? Second, ICANN apparently, I guess, at their last meeting, approved or didn't stand in the way of a cross-ownership of registries and registrars then -- you're probably a bit hamstrung given your market share but what are your thoughts on that?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, let me address the first one. So you're asking are people choosing .com or choosing the local ccTLD over .com at this point in time?", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Correct.", "Patrick S. Kane", "So there are some markets that certainly, some of the more established markets, that have a preference for the local ccTLD over .com. And if you take a look at Germany very specifically, DENIC, who runs .de, you've got a country with 83 million people and they've got 14 million or 15 million domain names registered in .de so there's a preference in markets like that. But there's still strong preference for .com in India, there's preference for .com in China as well as other nations that are growing. So it's a market by market but we don't see any major changes recently that we've been -- they've been fairly consistent for the last couple of years.", "And then the second one, where you're talking about where ICANN has announced that if registry operators want to move to the new contract, that vertical integration could be considered, correct?", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Correct.", "Patrick S. Kane", "So I think that's across the board that they've done that, I think that .com would of course, always be -- it's different. It will always be looked at differently and so I wouldn't suggest that, that's something that we would do if it was thrown out there but .com is always going to be looked at differently by Commerce and Justice, as Jim has talked about previously. So while it's available, I don't know that it's exactly available to .com.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Given your market share?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think it's hard to say. I mean that's an assessment that would be made on a case-by-case basis. But .com is different so it's really hard to say. We don't -- we haven't done any planning that would have us in a vertical integration scenario as an operating business. Our focus is really, security and stability first, and quite frankly, I think it might be awkward to actually act as a registrar ourselves. It's a very different business and as you may know, we were at one point, many years ago, in that business. When we first bought Network Solutions in June of 2000, it was of course, both a registry and a registrar and it wasn't until a few years later, I believe it was around 2003 when we sold off the retail part of that business and it was very different. So given the new sort of single focus that VeriSign is in right now, as a registry services provider, whose first mission is availability, when you consider for example, over the last 6 years, through a major restructuring, through the 2007, 2008, 2009 economic downturn, we've been able to maintain a record of security and stability. I'm sure a lot of you saw that just over the last few weeks, there were some major outages. I won't mention the names, but a large registrar and a large web services company just over the last few weeks had extended outages. If that happened to .com, I think there'd be a lot more tension, there'd be a lot more people affected, there'd be a lot more economic loss. So I sort of like us as a model focused on doing one thing, which is providing absolutely secure and stable infrastructure because there is just too much that depends on it here.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "A question for George. We're at 56.4% non-GAAP operating margins in Q3 and you're suggesting or guiding to 55% plus in Q4, are we looking at higher ICANN expenses related to the $3.9 million from Q3?", "George E. Kilguss", "We absolutely will see increased expenses from ICANN in Q4. Having said that, we'll only have about 1 month of that. We still believe we'll be in excess of 55%, but we do have rising cost and we continue to look for opportunities to offset those rising costs as we move forward.", "D. James Bidzos", "And don't forget, in the ICANN agreement, in addition to the increased ICANN fees under the new .com registry agreement negotiated with ICANN, there are also far more stringent SLAs so we need to pay attention to that as well. So kind of paying higher fees and asked to do a little bit more, but that's what VeriSign does at  .com.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "This is under .com?", "George E. Kilguss", "Correct. This is under .com.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is under the .com registry agreement.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Under which -- under the new agreement that hasn't been approved?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, under the agreement that was negotiated and approved with ICANN. It contains different ICANN fees that we pay, which George talked about. And it also includes more stringent SLAs. We are actually going to be -- we are already operating, obviously, as you know, given our uptime record. We are already operating beyond any published SLAs but the contract itself specifies the service levels that we have to provide and those have actually been made more stringent for VeriSign in the new agreement. So there's some good benefits for ICANN in that agreement.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Those expenses to you would not begin until the 1st of December? Am I understanding you right or no?", "George E. Kilguss", "It would commence with the renewal of the agreement, which ...", "D. James Bidzos", "Once the new agreement takes over, we are paying the higher ICANN fees.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Last question quickly to Jim. NIA, any update on what you're doing there?", "D. James Bidzos", "We're doing what we started saying, I believe, 2 or 3 quarters ago, that we were going to optimize NIA, we were going to structure it better for better quality of revenue. That originally when it was put together, it was focused on bookings growth. We've stopped focusing on bookings. We now focus on revenue and we're aligning expense with revenue and I'll just say that the team has really been working hard there and we've made really good progress and we're pleased with the direction that, that's moving. So it's more of the same, but we're very happy with the progress that we're making. I think that was the right thing for us to do and it's going well. I think that probably, it's helping us contribute to our efficient business, improving margins, increased revenue. It's not obviously, material or large enough that we call it out separately but it's moving in the right direction and we're very pleased with it.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Do we get to 10% of revenues in 2013 at some point?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I don't want to give any guidance here, but I don't think that's -- I don't think you should expect that to happen. I don't believe it will be material in 2013, let me put it that way.", "Operator", "We will take our last question from Jaimin Soni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. First, if you look at the .net domain name adds this quarter, is it possible to quantify just how much of the delta versus guidance came from the search engine changes versus macro? And then, looking at guidance for next quarter, at the midpoint, it's a pretty big downtick versus what we've seen in prior fourth quarters in the past 3, 4 years. I'm just wondering is it more macro there or also a similar impact from search engine changes?", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim, let me just make a general comment then I'll ask Pat to give you a little bit more color. Yes, there were some macroeconomic headwinds, as we said earlier, particularly in Europe. Certainly, the search engine algorithm changes are a very large factor. Every year and every quarter that the zone grows, we see the law of large numbers, as we refer to it, come into play as well. Clearly, percentage growth will slow as the size of the zone gets larger. So there are a number of different factors. We have some analytics but we don't break that out separately but perhaps Pat can give you a little bit of color.", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat. When you take a look at the renewal rate, that's largely -- where we've seen the shortfalls, really it's largely coming from monetization-type customers. I mean, that's individuals with large portfolios of domains, making pennies off of hundreds of thousands of domains, taking a look at what makes sense for their portfolio. So I would attribute the renewal rate more towards monetization than the macroeconomic trends right now although there's some in there. When you take a look at the new units, things that we have coming out of Europe right now, we're seeing registrars position domain names in the purchase flow that benefit local currency. So they're paying -- if it's a euro-based country, they're taking euro-based registrations and then we, of course, take all of our registrations in U.S. dollars. So there's some of that, that we see as part of the slight shortfall that we have in new units.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Atchley for concluding remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call.", "Operator", "This concludes today's call. Have a wonderful day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Thank you for joining us on VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I am David Atchley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm here today with Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Naming Services.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.verisigninc.com. Please refer to that website for important information, including the fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings press release. A replay of this call will be available on the website within a few hours.

The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our press release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a solid 2012 for VeriSign. We delivered for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us by marking 15 years of uninterrupted availability for .com and .net. We renewed the .com agreement for another 6 years, reported 2012 revenue of $874 million which was 13% revenue year-over-year growth and delivered strong financial performance including $503 million in free cash flow. We continue to see benefits from our restructuring, focus and discipline.", "In Naming we processed a record 33.1 million new gross registrations during 2012, finishing the year with 121.1 million names on the domain name base. Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. With the clarity of the .com renewal now behind us, we can now focus more of our attention on other strategic initiatives.", "In 2013, we intend to put greater emphasis on developing new revenue streams as we explore new products, services and innovation to enhance our offerings. The certainty of the renewal also allows us to focus on our longer-term financial plan, including a review of our capital structure and putting more emphasis on finding efficiencies in our business.", "Before I get into the fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a few events from the quarter. On November 30, 2012, we announced the approval of the renewal of the revised .com agreement by the U.S. Department of Commerce for the term beginning on December 1, 2012, and running through November 30, 2018, and the modified terms of the revised agreement.", "This approval is an endorsement of our record on security and stability and our offerings of .com registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions. The price of a .com registration is now fixed at $7.85 and as of the fourth quarter 2012 end we have 106.2 million .com names in our domain name base.", "On December 19, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .net per our agreement with ICANN. As of July 1, 2013 the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $5.11 to $5.62. Also by way of update, in December, ICANN completed its prioritization draw for processing applications related to its new gTLD program.", "As expected, ICANN gave priority to internationalized domain name transliterations. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net. Based on ICANN's current time line, we are not likely to see revenue from this opportunity until 2014.", "Finally, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.3 million shares for $94 million. Through 2012, we repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares for $315 million. On December 5, 2012, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by approximately $459 million to a total of $1 billion for VeriSign common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we have approximately $976 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our naming business at the end of December, the base of registered names in .com equaled 106.2 million names while .net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 121.1 million at the end of December. This represents an increase of 6.4% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter.", "In the fourth quarter, we added 1.25 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8 million new gross registrations during the fourth quarter, up 1% compared with the same period a year ago. For the full year 2012, we processed a record 33.1 million new gross registrations, up 3% from full year 2011. In the third quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares to 73.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "We see the continuing effects of changes in search out rhythms and macroeconomic headwinds we discussed during last quarter earnings call in our net additions. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months have affected the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in prior earnings calls, we have seen these search engine changes in the past which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters but we have no way of knowing how long they will be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment but we are now experiencing the third quarter of these effects. Secondly, we continue to see signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, have led to softer international renewal rates. However, while these factors are still present, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization and improvement in the renewal rate.", "Taking into consideration these and other factors, we expect the first quarter net names for .com and .net added to the base to between 2.0 million and 2.4 million names. As discussed on prior calls, we post updates to the zone on our website at least once per day. With this continued transparency, you're able to track how the zone is growing throughout the first quarter.", "Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue for both. Our efforts remain focused on positioning the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During 2012, we generated revenue of $874 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $491 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins to 56.2%. These results drove approximately $503 million in free cash flow for the year. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of December 31, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.1 billion of which $1.6 billion was in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Of the $1.6 billion, approximately $280 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.", "Total liabilities were $2.1 billion as of the fourth quarter, up from $1.9 billion a year ago. Due to the stock price not exceeding the convertible debenture trigger of $44.68 in 20 of the last 30 trading days during the fourth quarter, our convertible debentures were no longer convertible starting January 1, 2013. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, the related embedded derivative and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from current liabilities back to long-term liabilities while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from current assets back to long-term assets as of the third -- December 31, 2012.", "Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under our $200 million revolving credit facility and the $598 million present value of the $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.", "As mentioned in prior calls, we are in the process of reviewing the company's capital structure. As we review our capital structure, we are looking at both the leverage profile, including our domestic borrowing capacity, as well as our international cash balance and how that cash balance inter-relates with our international tax structure. We expect to have more information to share with you related to our thoughts around the company's capital structure during our Q1 earnings call in April.", "Deferred revenue at the end of the year totaled $813 million, an $84 million increase from year-end 2011. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2012 the company generated revenues of $230 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $135 million, up 46% from $93 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 58.8% compared to 45.6% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter. GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $54 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.34 for the fourth quarter in 2011.", "Results for the fourth quarter of 2012 included nonrecurring, pretax benefits of $13.6 million, split $5.8 million and $7.8 million between continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively. These amounts were primarily related to reimbursements of previously incurred litigation and defense costs received upon settlement with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business. Additionally, fourth quarter 2012 results include pretax benefits of $5.5 million related to a reduction in our estimated bonus payout for fiscal 2012. Together these items increased the GAAP operating margin by 4.9% and diluted earnings per share by $0.07.", "I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter and full year operating metrics which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $230 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States, and 40% was from foreign customers.", "Revenue in the fourth quarter from international sources grew 14.5% year-over-year and slightly faster than our domestic-sourced revenue, which grew 12.1% year-over-year. 2012 full year revenue was $874 million, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2012 included nonrecurring pretax benefits of $5.8 million recorded in continuing operations primarily related to the reimbursement of the previously incurred litigation defense costs received upon settlement with selling shareholders of that previously acquired business.", "Additionally, the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2012 also included the pretax benefit of $5.5 million related to the reduction in our estimated bonus payout. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $7 million in stock-based compensation, totaled $87 million and was down 11% sequentially as a result of the abovementioned $11.3 million in Q4 benefits.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter expanded to 62% compared to 56.4% in the third quarter of 2012. The nonrecurring pretax benefits and estimated bonus accruals adjustment previously discussed also increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9%. After adjusting for these credits and accrual adjustments, our fourth quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising costs, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter.", "Our non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $96 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.59 compared to $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $0.50 last quarter. The estimated bonus accrual adjustment and credits previously mentioned increased fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.05. Full year 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.97, a 32% increase over fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net for fiscal 2012 was $38 million.", "With respect to taxes, as we've previously stated, starting from the third quarter of 2012, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and our non-GAAP EPS calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2013, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million to $50 million.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 162 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 166.6 million shares in the third quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 6.4 million shares based on the average share pricing during the quarter, a decrease of 2.8 million shares from the third quarter. Share count was decreased further by the full impact of Q3 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 2.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $171 million for the fourth quarter up from $122 million in the third quarter of 2012 and up compared to $124 million for the same quarter last year. Full-year operating 2012 cash flow was $538 million compared with $336 million for 2011. Free cash flow was $155 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 and includes a decrease of $2.3 million in excess benefits from stock-based compensation and excludes $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2012 was $503 million, including $18 million in excess tax benefits and excluding $53 million in capital expenditures.", "With respect to 2013 guidance, revenue for 2013 should be in the range of $945 million to $960 million, representing an annual growth rate of 8% to 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full-year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 57%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP, non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $40 million and $42 million for 2013, and capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2012. We have grown our non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to use our strategic framework and its 4 areas of focus to frame how we think about the business. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business. First, protect. We will continue to protect the business by meeting all of our obligations under our ICANN agreements to operate top level domains.", "Second, grow. We will continue to see growth in the following ways: expansion of our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target com/net zone growth, particularly in emerging international markets, by extending our brand and serving new markets through the IDNs for which we have applied; by extending our high reliability platform to underpin new brand and generic TLDs, including our approximately 220 new gTLD customers; by continuing to scale and grow our NIA business; and by leveraging our patent portfolio to both generate revenue and support our business strategy.", "Third, innovate. As evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation. The goal is new revenue streams resulting from innovative new services that leverage our strengths.", "And fourth, manage. We will continue to manage the business responsibly from a financial perspective. As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of the .com contract renewal is certainty which allows us greater flexibility in optimizing debt, capital allocation and capital structure. We will have more to say on this subject during our next earnings call. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas with the right balance should best serve our customers, employees and shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Obviously, you've been adjusting for the one-time items, very strong operating margin. The outlook you gave on the margin side was quite strong as well. Just wondering if you could walk through just sort of how you kind of view incremental operating margins from here, especially kind of with the context of the renewal having gone through and then you all focusing also on some new business areas and some new segments. Does that include incremental costs going forward? Where do you see the leverage coming from, et cetera?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Philip. This is George. With respect to incremental operating margins throughout fiscal 2012, really our incremental operating margin came from our revenue growth. If you look at our expenses, taking out some of those one-time items, we've been consistently around the $98 million, $99 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation from an expense standpoint. And we\u2019ve -- as we've talked about, we've been able to invest in those areas, sales and marketing, R&D, while creating efficiencies in our operations. As we look out into 2013 we do have some increasing expenses. Like all companies, we have wage expense increases and health care benefits increasing. Unique to VeriSign, we also have costs associated increasing with our new contract with the com renewal where that's now a variable cost. And that, as I said before, will increase costs probably somewhere around $700,000 a month. So we absolutely have increased costs going forward in the business. What we -- what's included in our guidance is our desire, our objective to try to offset those costs to some degree with increased efficiencies. Again, as in 2012, the majority of our margin expansion will come from revenue growth.", "D. James Bidzos", "And Phil, this is Jim. Let me just add, too, I think you mentioned how we're looking at margins and expense given the growth initiatives that we have. Let me just add to what George said that the growth initiatives that I mentioned, so for example, expanding our existing businesses through focused marketing programs. That's baked into the budget and obviously baked into the forecast and the guidance that we gave. We have invested in marketing programs over the years. They are more focused going forward. We're targeting geographies where we think there's real growth opportunity for the com/net zone. The IDNs, we have made -- we've already made the investment in the application fees, as you know, in early 2012. And the support that we'll be providing in terms of back-end registry services for the 220 customers that we signed up, we do have something of an advantage, having been a registry in operation for a long time and having supported multiple TLDs over all of those years of com, net, tv, cc, several others that VeriSign supports. So we've built something called Name Store. So basically, we have a tremendous amount of experience in standing up and operating multiple TLDs within our existing platform. So I think that gives us something of an advantage in that this is something we've invested in, we've built and we have operational and we know how to do. NIA, of course, is something we've been investing in for over 2 years now, and we're optimizing that business. And I talked about our patent portfolio and that's something new. We've never really exploited it before. But essentially, the investments in those areas -- the substantial investments have been made. And I think we've been consistently clear, but let me do it again, about mergers and acquisitions. We don't believe that M&A is a strategy. We don't see any M&A on our horizon. If an opportunity presented itself that helped us accelerate our business strategy, certainly we'd look at that. But that's not part of our plan. So I hope that bit of color gives you a little more insight into how to think about expenses, margins, and growth opportunities through 2013.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just had a couple. So could you maybe help me clarify something in terms of the timing of new gTLDs? Because it looks like ICANN will be approving your foreign language .com transliterations a little bit earlier, at least than what we'd expected. From the website, it looks like possibly early June. So I guess, is that correct? And if so, when do you expect to actually go live? And then, just lastly, how should we think about pricing on the foreign language transliterations?", "D. James Bidzos", "Pat, do you want to comment?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Sure. So as far as the timing goes, the way that the -- this is Pat, the way that -- the way ICANN has laid out the process, it is mechanically possible for new gTLDs to go sometime in Q3. But there's still many outstanding items to be completed, and so I think it's more towards the end of the year. And just recently, Steve Crocker, the Chairman of the Board for ICANN, has indicated that it would be more towards the end of the year. So while it's possible, I think it's going to be, like I said, towards the end of the year. So that is -- and then as far as pricing goes, it's not really -- it doesn't have the same boundaries as the .com contract does, so we can basically set the pricing, and we're still evaluating what that pricing looks like.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, just for clarity, the .com contract is unique in that the cooperative agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign exists for that TLD only. .net is only between VeriSign and ICANN. All of the new applications that we've made in ICANN's new gTLD program and the other domains that we operate are strictly based on contractual relationships between ICANN and VeriSign and are not subject to any price limitations, such as the ones that were imposed in the renewal by the Department of Commerce for .com. And as Pat said, we're still evaluating how we'll be pricing those IDNs. But just like every other applicant in the new gTLD program, we have complete flexibility in how we price them and whatever price increases we choose to bring in over time.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then one more, if I may. Just of the 220 new gTLDs that you will be supporting, can you give us a sense as to how many are brands versus geographies or communities of interest and I guess maybe any other classifications that I may have missed?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Yes, this is Pat. The majority of those 220 are brands or generics operated by brands, and so they will be used probably differently than you would see the major generics. And we have probably 8% to 10% that fall in the other range to include some generics, but the majority of them are brands.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I'd just like to talk about the outlook for the zone file kind of in general and what kind of growth are you looking for in 2013 in the .net and .com zone file?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Steve. So as you know, we guided between 8% to 10% revenue growth for the year for 2013. Last year, we grew at 6.4% for the full year. As you also know, the components of the zone growth really are a function of the growth additions we experienced in the zone as well as the deletes coming out. And we've talked for a few quarters now about the deletes and the deletes we've been seeing overseas which results from the economy, and some of the deletes that have been impacted as a result of some of the changes to the Google algorithm. So part of our guidance, as we look into 2013, is clearly taking into consideration some of those trends with the deletes in the zone. And as we go through the year, we'll get some more visibility as we're right now 3 quarters into or beyond the time when Google made those material changes which impacted us. So today, to answer your question, our current view is the zone growth is somewhere between 4% and 6% that's baked into our full year guidance for 2013.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And is it possible that we could see the renewal rates start to improve in the second half of the year after we start to anniversary the algorithm change?", "George E. Kilguss", "So I think that's a possibility. I think the real answer is we don't know. What we've seen our preliminary renewal rate for the fourth quarter is that it seems to be upticking a little bit. It is back to the second quarter of 2012 rate or thereabouts. Still below 2011 but we are seeing some stabilization, some early signs of that. So it is a possibility, but I think it's just fairly too early to tell right now to where the renewal rate will trend for the full year of 2013.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, Steve. This is Jim. There's also a lot of moving parts to sort of calculating revenue growth and zone growth. In addition to what George said in terms of impact from the search engine, search algorithm changes which are just really hard to predict, we, at this point, have no visibility, no idea what sort of promotional programs registrars may bring into play during any one of the 4 quarters of 2013. Promotions tend to bring in a lot of names that then later on have impact in the subsequent year. So it's just hard to predict what that growth will be because there's just so many variables.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "George, I was wondering if you could talk to us about on the guidance sort of a cash flow number we should be thinking about for 2013. And then also related to that, how much of that cash do you expect to generate in the U.S.?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, I think in general, when you look at our revenues, Walter, we've talked about 60% domestic and 40% international. And that math tends to flow through our income statement for the most part as it relates to cash. So I think that's a fair assessment. I guess from a cash flow perspective, we don't guide to a full year free cash flow number but I think if you take our non-GAAP operating margins, you take and consider the CapEx that we guided, I think you can get a pretty good idea from that math. But this year, we did $503 million. Clearly, incrementally, we expect that number to grow. And then I think you have enough data points to come to a conclusion there, but about 60% is domestic and 40% is international.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then just a question for Jim on the patents, are you -- I guess monetization of patents, you've talked about here now for a couple quarters. Is this something that you intend to monetize through IP or is there any products? Can you talk a bit about -- or sale of patents, could you talk a bit about more specifically about how you think you can monetize some of the patents that you have?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think it's a bit early to talk in detail about how we'll actually do that, but there are a number of different ways. Certainly, one of them that you mentioned, selling patents, that's probably the least likely to occur here. We have a broad patent portfolio. We have over 200 patents and applications in the U.S. alone. We have, to date, not asserted any of our patents. We're reviewing that policy. We have a large number of patents -- a portion of our patents read directly on registry operations, so we think that there are some things that are certainly worth looking at there. The 2 primary ways, one would be to license the patents and generate royalty revenue. Having been in a business before that -- where patents were a great asset, I can tell you from experience that a much more attractive way is to use the patents, if possible, to leverage a business strategy. So that would be the preferred method, but certainly behind that, royalty revenue would be another way to do it. And we are very active in our innovation program, and we're filing many new applications as well so this is a new area. Too early to say exactly how and what that will produce, but we're looking at it very closely and we think it's an opportunity for us.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Safe to say this is no part of your 2013 guidance or are you thinking that you may get some revenue in 2013?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think it's just really too early to say.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan Chase.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. I want to clarify or I want to make sure I heard correctly, George, you said the operating margin guidance is 57% at least for the full year?", "George E. Kilguss", "That's correct, at least 57% for the full year.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. Jim, when you talk about the tweaks to the search engine, were there further tweaks made in the fourth quarter and does that restart the clock of the 2- to 3-quarter adjustment? Or are we 3 quarters into people adapting to it and we should be in the smaller tail of the impacts?", "D. James Bidzos", "I don't know that we have enough detailed information about what changes were being made in that timeframe to say. First, I'll just say that there are changes being made to -- Google, for example, makes changes to their search algorithms essentially constantly. We noticed on, as you know, back in 2009 there were changes they made that directly affected the renewal of domain names and again a year ago. To what extent they either extended or renewed or intensified or changed in any way those efforts, we, at this point, can't say. We do know that over time, the people who use domain names for monetization purposes, advertising or other ways that they generate revenue from them, we do know that they typically tend to find ways to adjust and adapt. There is one thing we do know, that a domain monetization, entity or individual can currently look at their portfolio of names, and essentially I think they can expect a higher yield from it because their cost of goods, essentially the cost of acquiring domain names, has just been fixed at $7.85. So there's one data point that we can give you with some certainty based on the renewal of last November that does change the financials for the monetization of domain names. Their cost of goods is fixed. The portfolios that they hold should now basically have a higher yield. That may be [indiscernible].", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. Sorry, Jim. And just last question, you mentioned the new revenue sources for 2013, new products and services. While I don't expect you to tell us exactly what they are tonight, can you give us a sense of when we might -- timing wise, when we might hear more in terms of exactly what those things would be?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I hope it will be earlier in the year. Our plan is to share more information and possibly roll something out in 2013, but that's a -- those new products and services that play to our strengths that are very core are really the central focus of our innovation efforts. Those efforts tend to spin out a lot of the times that I talked about earlier. But I hope to be talking to you more about it in 2013, and I hope sooner rather than later in the year. But it's too early to say exactly when right now.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Was curious on the network intelligence availability front, just if we look at those different services, are they material to revenue? Are there about 10% or more yet or at what point in the future do you think they'll reach that type of level?", "D. James Bidzos", "They're not at that point yet and we don't guide to those, so I can't really tell you exactly when that'll happen. I can tell you that our efforts to streamline that business, to improve the quality of revenue and to optimize the offerings are yielding some fruit. And as I mentioned, we are seeing increased revenue from that part of the business, so that much I can say. I think everybody knows, who reads the press, that our DDoS attacks are growing, so we see that as an opportunity. Our managed DNS customers certainly benefit from that service that we offer. We -- that part of the business is relatively new, of course, compared to the domain name business. So learning how to optimize it, improve the quality of revenue, more efficiently onboard customers, provision them better, more efficiently, these are all the kinds of things that we're constantly working on. But at this point, we're not reporting it separately, and I can't tell you when that might happen.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you mean by improve the quality? Has it been a lumpy business? Have you seen a lot of customer churn there?", "D. James Bidzos", "What we've said in the past and is still true today is that initially, when we launched this business a couple of years ago, the primary focus was to see how it might grow and to pursue bookings. And what we're doing now is optimizing it. It's basically aligning revenue. We're focusing more on revenue rather than bookings and aligning revenue with expenses better and improving the quality of revenue, primarily translating into better margins.", "Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then second, as I think about new name growth, you've had kind of a flat 6 months here in terms of new names, and you have a tough comp coming up year-over-year in Q1. Just how should we think about new name growth in 2013 and how that helps contribute to overall net new name growth?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, again, as I mentioned, Rob, I mean, our guidance implies about a 4% to 6% zone growth, so that would be your net numbers. We gave you guidance for the first quarter of what we think our first quarter net addition would be in the 2 million to 2.4 million names. Excuse me, so clearly, that is below what we achieved in the prior year. And what you're seeing in some of that estimation is clearly some of the trends we're seeing, even though the renewal rate seems to be stabilizing and looks to be upticking between last quarter. Some of the cautiousness of the changes that we've seen in the international economy as well are factored into our guidance for 2013. Now we'll continue to monitor that. And as we get more information, we'll fully update the market on that. But those are the factors that are really baked into our 2013 guidance at the present.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, don't forget also, Rob, that we're currently at 121.1 million names in the com/net zone. So as the zone gets bigger, you would expect that the rate of growth would start to basically decline a bit, the law of large numbers, et cetera, coming into effect. In answer to an earlier question as well, I might add, about the renewal rate in the second half of 2013, I believe was the question we had earlier, that the larger zone, the aging zone should theoretically at least yield higher renewal rates as the growth rate tends to slack off. Those are more of the moving parts, so it's just really hard to say. As the zone gets older and it gets larger, the growth dynamics of it change. And as George mentioned, the market's changing as well.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two more follow-ups. One, on the capital discussion that you're having specifically to repatriating cash, can you talk to us a little bit about what some of the hurdles or things that you have to consider in repatriating that cash beyond just paying the taxes to bring it back?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Sterling. I can give you some insight. I mean, we're still working that and we'll have more to say next quarter. But clearly, there's a couple things or factors that we need to consider. One is that cash that we have international, like most firms, is part of our international tax structure. And as a result, on the cash we generate overseas, we pay a much lower effective tax rate. So to the extent we were to evaluate any type of repatriation in addition to understanding the tax rate that you'd have to pay, we have to take into consideration how that may disrupt our international tax structure over there, with 40% of our business over there, and would that actually increase our effective tax rate on the monies earned over there if we were to change that tax structure. In addition, we'd also have to look at any other taxes that may -- may or may not incur as a result of taking that cash back with the international entity that we contracted with in setting up that structure. So there may be some other taxes, whether it be exit tax or some other type of tax that may be incurred if you were to make significant changes. And so we're looking at that tax structure. We're looking at our planning and our forecasting, where we're generating our revenues, and it's really those factors that could create potentially increased liability or forego some of the benefits that we've already put in place with the effective tax rate we have over there, which is a much lower effective tax rate to the United States.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. And Sterling, I would just -- it's Jim. I would just add to that, too. At least if you look backwards in the past, when opportunities have presented themselves, in the fourth quarter of 2011 for example, we had an opportunity with some previously taxed income to do a repatriation. When those opportunities have presented themselves, we've taken advantage of them. But I think it's complex. It's part of our international tax structure, as George said. And we're in the same boat as numerous other American companies with offshore cash essentially for the same reasons.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And one housekeeping question. Can you give us a sense of the total names up for renewal in the first quarter versus what it was in the first quarter of 2012?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. We can find that number here. That's $27.2 million.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And what was it in\u2026", "D. James Bidzos", "Oh, sorry, the year-ago number?", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes.", "D. James Bidzos", "$25.2 million.", "Operator", "We want to take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Jim, I know you're not breaking out NIA, it's obviously too small a business at this point. But just looking back at 2012, how did your \u2013 qualitatively, how did your NIA business perform relative to your initial expectations?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, if you mean by initial, expectations of roughly a year ago when we started streamlining it or optimizing it, or from 2 years ago?", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Exactly, from 1 year ago.", "D. James Bidzos", "From a year ago, I'd say it's performing in line with our expectations.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And any thoughts in terms of headcount for 2013 versus 2012? Are you expecting any change in either direction?", "D. James Bidzos", "Let's see. Our current headcount, I believe, is roughly\u2026", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, roughly 1,100.", "D. James Bidzos", "[indiscernible] something like that, yes.", "George E. Kilguss", "So we have some -- as always, we have in our budget some planned headcount in different departments but it doesn't appear, well, I can tell you, it's not material right now from our perspective. But clearly, as businesses have different needs and as they change, we absolutely add headcount in certain areas. To the extent we have those skill sets internally and we can adjust, we'll do that. But there are some times when we don't have the skill set in house and we have to go outside for that, so we do have some headcount budgeted to add in fiscal \u201813.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, George, on the cash flow statement, you had a pretty big benefit this quarter from accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Just wondering if you would provide some color as to why that was so strong in the December period.", "George E. Kilguss", "We can follow up on you that, but it has to do with our Synnex benefit. The share price declined, and as a result, we had a change in the embedded derivative related to our Synnex instrument as the stock price declined. But we can follow up on the specifics on that if you'd like.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Dan Cummins with B. Riley & Company.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division", "First question for George. In thinking about spending and in anticipation of kind of the back-end registry mandates. Can you give us a sense, if you took brand assignments on the one hand, presuming that those would be fixed priced arrangements because the volumes would not be significant, would spending for something like that be in the tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps, as opposed to something like a mandate like running.web, something that could actually scale? In that instance, do you anticipate that preparatory spending could be as much as $1 million or $2 million? Can you just kind of give us a sense of what to think about as these new generic TLDs go live, kind of your spending profile ahead of those? And then I have a follow-up.", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay, this is Jim. Let me just make a general comment about that, and then I'll let George or Pat weigh in. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, we have the infrastructure in place already to support multiple TLDs. So essentially, the larger investments to create the infrastructure and the framework, to operate multiple TLDs is something we already have in place. As far as the individual cost per TLD, whether it's a brand or whether it's a distributed TLD, I'm not sure that we can into that level of detail or even explain what it is or even if there is that much difference. I'll let Pat weigh in on what sort of provisioning there is there.", "Patrick S. Kane", "Yes, so it's a task. The mainframe platform, as Jim mentioned earlier, is really -- it's already set up and designed to onboard these new gTLDs. And then our resolution sites, we've got 74 or 75 around the globe that are positioned strategically that we can actually run traffic through. And as that traffic continues to grow, we'll scale those sites based upon the same decision process we take today.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And just on hand -- do you know how many of those so-called distributed TLDs you have in hand right now of the 220?", "Patrick S. Kane", "It's between 8% and 10%.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Okay. My other question was for George or for Jim. When George talked in very specific terms, I think it was on the July call, about the possibility of levering up the company, I think you were talking about your gross debt EBITDA being around 3, I think. You said that those decisions would be made very carefully in the context of your risk profile. And I apologize if this was asked on the November call, but I was kind of out of the loop. But do you feel like the company's risk profile has changed significantly as a result of what Congress has done or not?", "George E. Kilguss", "That's a good question. I think, clearly, with the certainty of the contract renewed I think -- excuse me, that from a timing perspective, clearly, that gives us certainty over the next 6 years. The risk of the company is a dynamic thing. We clearly have to position ourselves to protect the assets we have and to invest in growth. But I would say, in general, at the higher level, I don't think the risk profile has changed that dramatically year-over-year from before the renewal or after the renewal.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Craig Nankervis with First Analysis.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been asked, but I do have one. Just out of curiosity, can you talk at all about the linearity within a quarter of how names are renewed and how your progress towards the net new names may play out, especially in Q4? Is there a certain seasonality within the months of Q4 that is different than the other quarters? Or just is there any pattern that you've seen that you can just relate?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, clearly, with regard to names or new additions there, there is seasonality. In the fourth quarter, we clearly see things trail off as you get close to the holidays. The last few weeks of December, everybody's on holiday and they go away. We have a similar phenomenon typically in the first quarter that surrounds the Chinese New Year where when that happens it slows down for a period of time. And we've also seen in previous quarters that revenue or -- I'm sorry, new units have grown dramatically in the first quarter as a lot of registrars have run promotions in the first quarter. So it varies from quarter-to-quarter. From a revenue perspective, however, you probably wouldn't see a lot of difference in seasonality as the majority of the revenue gets accreted into revenue as a result of our deferred revenue, and we're amortizing the bulk of that over the course of the year ratably.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Sure, sure. Yes, I understand the revenue side. I was just sort of curious about the actual renewals themselves and some of the patterns within the quarter, that's all.", "Operator", "And we will take our last question from Scott Kessler with Standard & Poor's.", "Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research", "So obviously, there's been a lot of talk on this call and I guess the prior couple of calls perhaps, Jim, about patents. I think you talked about some of the areas where you have patents. I think you mentioned 200 patenting applications in the U.S. I'm wondering if you could somehow quantify both more recent activity related to patents. For example, I think I saw recently that you guys were awarded some sort of patent related to automated country code registrations in bulk. And I'm also wondering if, especially in light of the Department of Commerce and its involvement in the company, if you have concerns about the possibility that increased, let's say, monetization efforts around patents could potentially lead to some type of regulatory issue or concern.", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, let's see. First of all, we, in late 2011, we stepped up our innovation efforts. We funded a larger innovation effort. We increased our research activities. And that started to yield a step-up in patent applications. There was a step-up back in 2008 but a bigger step-up in innovation in general, in R&D in particular, in late 2011. So we've been quite active in the last year, and there have been a number of applications that have been submitted. So I think that's where we're getting that from. We have not, in the past, asserted any patents or really exploited our patent portfolio. In terms of how we would do that or would there be any issues associated with any regulatory aspect of doing that, I guess I certainly can't think of any. There are certainly regulated utilities and other regulated entities that have patents, that monetize patents. I can't imagine that would be an issue for us. We're certainly entitled to exploit our intellectual property and to seek revenue streams where we can find them. And we're certainly motivated to do that given the flat pricing that we'll have over the next 6 years. So I guess the short answer to your question is I don't believe that should be any issue at all for us. Intellectual property is a company asset. And we're a public company, and it's our responsibility to exploit those assets for the benefit of the company and its shareholders and we certainly intend to do that. Having said that, patents are an asset for any company. They do help the community. There are inventions that get published and the company is entitled to benefit from those inventions and after 17 years they fall into the public domain, so I think that's the way the system works. I don't think that should have any impact on us in terms of any regulatory fallout associated with that. It's just simply an asset that's growing, that's valuable and that we are looking at in ways we haven't looked at before.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, at this time, I will turn the call over back to you for any additional and closing remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator.

Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on VeriSign's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I'm David Atchley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm here today with Jim Bidzos,  Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.verisigninc.com.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our press release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter demonstrates a solid start to 2013 for VeriSign. We reported revenue of $236 million, which was 15% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $145 million in free cash flow. In Naming, we processed 8.8 million new gross registrations during the first quarter and added 1.99 million net new names, bringing the name base to a total of 123.1 million .com and .net names. Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $1.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework.", "As you may have seen during April, we completed the issuance of a 10-year $750 million senior unsecured note with a 4.625% coupon. We're very pleased with the results of this issuance, which is part of our revised capital structure. In a few moments, George will discussed our capital structure in more detail.", "During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3 million shares for $132 million. As of March 31, 2013, we have approximately $844 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, at the end of March, the total base of registered names in .com and .net was 123.1 million, with registered names in .com totaling 108.1 million names and in .net totaling 15 million names. This represents an increase of 5.5% year-over-year and a 1.6% quarter-over-quarter. In the first quarter, we added 1.99 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the renewal rate was 72.9%, and the renewal rate for the whole of 2012 was 73.1%. While renewal rates are not totally measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2013 will be approximately 73.3%. This rate compares to 73.9% achieved in the first quarter of 2012. The renewal rate is still below the level of the first quarter 1 year ago. We see the continuing effects of changes in search algorithms and macroeconomic headwinds we discussed during the last few quarterly earnings calls. We cannot be certain of how long the renewal rate will be impacted by these factors, but we are now experiencing the fourth quarter of these effects. In light of these factors, we expect the second quarter net names for .com and .net added to the base will be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing the first quarter financials, I would like to talk about our capital structure in more detail. As stated on prior calls, we have been looking at our capital structure across both our leverage profile, as well as our international cash balance and how the international cash balance interrelates with our international tax structure.", "With our recently announced new senior unsecured debt issue, the company now has 3 debt instruments as part of its capital structure. First, the company has a $200 million senior unsecured credit facility that matures in November 2016. During April, we repaid the $100 million outstanding borrowings under this facility. We view this credit facility as a secondary source of domestic liquidity. Second, with our new debt issuance during April complete, the company now has a $750 million 10-year secured -- senior unsecured note with a coupon rate of 4.625%. This issuance produced approximately $738 million of net proceeds, of which $100 million was used to repay our revolving credit facility previously mentioned. We intend to use the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program. Third, the company has a $1.25 billion subordinated convertible debenture with a coupon rate of 3.25% that matures in 2037. The company now has total outstanding debt obligations of $2 billion, which reflects the full $1.25 billion face value of our subordinated debenture, the new $750 million debt issuance and the repayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility, which occurred after quarter end.", "With trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of $595 million as of March 31, 2013, our pro forma total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 3.4x. This leverage ratio is consistent with the 1.5 to 3.5x range we discussed during prior calls and at a level we believe is reasonable for the company at this time.", "Now as it relates to our international cash balance, the tax work to evaluate our international cash and international tax structure is progressing but remains ongoing. Of the $1.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, approximately $240 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally. The approximate $1.3 billion in international cash has not been taxed at the U.S. level, and our assertion remains unchanged from prior quarters that this balance is indefinitely reinvested offshore. As mentioned, our tax work is ongoing and we will provide updates as soon as appropriate. We expect this work to be completed by the end of the year, if not sooner, and we'll provide appropriate available updates on our Q2 and Q3 quarterly calls.", "I will now discuss the first quarter financial results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $236 million, up 15% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $133 million, up 35% from $99 million in the first quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.4% compared to 48.1% in the same quarter 1 year ago. GAAP net income totaled $85 million compared to $68 million 1 year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.52 in the first quarter compared to $0.42 for the first quarter in 2012. As of March 31, 2013, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.1 billion, which includes the cash balances just discussed. Liabilities also totaled $2.1 billion at quarter's end.", "During the first quarter, the stock price again exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means that the holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting the debenture into common stock during the second quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, as well as the related embedded derivative and deferred tax liability, were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of March 31, 2013.", "I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $236 million for the first quarter. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers outside the U.S. Revenue in the first quarter from international sources grew 18% year-over-year, and domestic-sourced revenue grew 13% year-over-year.", "Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $847 million, a $34 million increase from year-end 2012. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $8 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared with $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. As a reminder, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $11.3 million lower due to certain fourth quarter benefits we discussed last quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter expanded to 59.6% compared to 51.9% in the same quarter of 2012. It should be noted that during the first quarter of 2013, we delayed approximately $5 million of our marketing program expenses to later quarters, which contributed to a higher operating margin.", "Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $94 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58 compared to $0.42 in the first quarter of 2012 and $0.59 last quarter. As noted before, certain benefits described last quarter increased the fourth quarter earnings per share.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. In 2013, we now expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million as compared to the $40 million to $50 million range we gave last quarter as a result of the increased interest expense deduction created from our new senior note obligations. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 161 million shares in the first quarter compared to 162 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debenture was approximately 7.9 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter compared with 2.5 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was decreased by the full impact of fourth quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 3 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $151 million for the first quarter compared to $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $110 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $145 million.", "With respect to 2013 guidance, our guidance remains primarily unchanged except to update -- except for an update to our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income guidance. Revenue for 2013 is still expected to be in the range of $945 million to $960 million, representing an annual growth rate of 8% to 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 57%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $60 million and $62 million for 2013. This range is an increase from the $40 million to $42 million range given on our last call, primarily reflecting the increased interest expense from our new debt issuance. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q1 2012. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to remind you of our strategic framework and its 3 areas of focus. These are, first, to protect; second, to grow, which includes our innovation efforts; and third, to manage the business. During the first quarter, we continued our efforts in each of these areas. We believe that our discipline to deliver in these 3 areas, with the right balance, should continue to offer the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.", "We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just to start off, it's actually fairly unusual to see a 3% sequential revenue increase in a Q1, particularly given that net adds came in at the very low end of guidance. What drove the revenue outperformance in the quarter? Was it NIA or some other factor?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, Gregg, this is George Kilguss. Thanks for the question. In December of this year -- or in the fourth quarter, I should say, we actually changed our methodology of how we account for contra revenue. So contra revenue is a -- our marketing expenses we spend that are a deduct from revenue. We went to a GAAP convention, which recognizes that expense over the life of the customer contract that is entered into. So we had lower contra revenue in Q1. Going forward, the effects that we used to see from more of a seasonal factor in a Q1 from contra will not be as apparent, it will be more smooth as we're recognizing that expense over the contract life of the customer.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And George, can you walk through why you opted to delay about $5 million in marketing expenses in the first quarter? And also, do you expect to make most of that up in the second quarter or in future quarters?", "George E. Kilguss", "So, again, the marketing team constantly evaluates programs in its effectiveness, and programs that we have in the pipeline based on market activities going on. The team, during the quarter, made a determination that it wanted to delay some programs. It didn't think that its effectiveness was going to reach its maximum potential and chose to delay that for a few quarters. Right now, we're expecting to see that. Still, in the third and fourth quarter of this year, the team is regrouping on some of those programs. And we'll get more of an update on that on our next quarter call, but right now, we're expecting to continue to spend that in this fiscal year.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Fantastic. And then for Jim, last quarter, I think you made the comment that you were seeing early signs of a stabilization and improvement in renewal rates. And as you pointed out on -- in your prepared remarks, on a year-over-year basis, you're obviously still working through some of the algo changes. But this represented some fairly nice improvement versus the prior period. I'm just kind of wondering how you're sort of thinking and looking at renewal rates at this point going forward.", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, we're being -- looking -- I would say we're cautiously optimistic about what's happening, but we don't guide to renewal rates, of course. And first of all, I would say that we're still -- we're in the fourth quarter of the algorithm -- search algorithm changes. And so we're still uncertain exactly how that's going to play out. Those changes are ongoing and continuing. So I think we're not in a position to say that those changes have been absorbed or that they've ended, they continue. And secondly, as I mentioned, we still are feeling the effects of macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe.", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes. And Gregg, let me -- this is George. Let me give you a little bit more color on that. As we've previously discussed, our zone metrics have been impacted by both the poor economic conditions here and abroad, as well as changes to algorithms -- search algorithms. As it relates to Google, while they don't provide that much information as it relates to past or future changes to their algorithm, what we do know is, and as we previously discussed, they made 2 major algorithm changes called Panda and Penguin. But when you look at Panda -- Panda started in 2011, and since its inception, they started -- they made over 25 different updates to that particular algorithm change. Of the 25 updates, 14 of those updates happened in 2012. So 56% happened in 2012, and they've actually had 2 additional updates here in the first quarter. So those changes do continue to go on. As it relates to the Penguin change, as we discussed last year, the first time we saw a Penguin change came out was in the first quarter of 2012. And they had -- they made a total of 3 changes to their Penguin algorithm in 2012. Now we haven't seen any changes yet in 2013. I believe Matt Cutts from Google made some comments in a seminar that they believe they were going to make another change in 2013 to Penguin. But I guess my point here is that they may continue these changes to the algorithm. Some impact is more than others. We don't know the impact of the changes until after they make them. So we're constantly monitoring those. But they have made a significant amount of changes, especially in 2012, which have an effect in future periods for us. So we continue to monitor that. We take that information into the guidance that we provide you as 1 data input, but there are many changes that happened, at least, over the past year and the current quarter.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. And then if I could just ask one final question since it's relevant for all of our models. I'm just wondering if you're -- to get a sense of how you're thinking about putting the incremental $650 million of debt to use from a potential buyback standpoint.", "George E. Kilguss", "So Gregg, great question. We have historically not guided to buybacks in any particular quarter. I think if you look at the company's track record, it's had a very consistent track record in the first quarter. We did $132 million of repurchases. As Jim mentioned, we always look at our strategic framework. We look at the cash flow from what do we need to invest in the business to protect the assets? What level of liquidity do we need to maintain on hand? What cash do we need to invest to generate positive IRR returns to propagate growth and innovation? And then to the extent that each quarter we feel we have cash that we deem as excess, we then make decisions on what cash we believe we should be returning to shareholders. So we don't guide, we haven't guided to that, but I think if you look at our track record, we've been relatively consistent in our results and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate.", "D. James Bidzos", "I would just add -- this is Jim. I would just add as well that George talked in his remarks about our capital structure. Part of that obviously is debt leverage ratios. We have talked in the past often about the fact that the company did not have as much debt as it could have. Would it have as much as it absolutely could have? We said, \"No, the number will be somewhere in between.\" I think now you've seen that. And clearly, as you saw from the announcement earlier, when we closed on the debt offering, it was under very attractive terms for the company. We see that as a permanent part of our capital structure under attractive terms. And we've been very clear about the stated purpose for that general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions and potential share repurchases, among other things. And I think our position on acquisitions, mergers and acquisitions, has been very clear and consistent. There's no change whatsoever on that. And as George mentioned, we don't guide on buybacks. But I think if you look at them, how we've dealt with our use of cash issues, which we determine from quarter-to-quarter, certainly, you can look back and see that share repurchase has, under these market conditions over the last couple of years, been an attractive way for us to return value to shareholders.", "Operator", "And moving on, our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just to follow on that last point, Jim. Is buybacks really the main focal point? Or how, within that strategic framework, would you characterize buybacks versus special dividend versus regular dividend as potential capital return?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, we don't guide to any of those, obviously. And we do evaluate our cash situation, our cash needs and our deployment of our cash on a quarterly basis. I think looking back, extraordinary dividends during the divestiture period when we did have divestiture proceeds, certainly, were one way that we deployed cash. Share buyback has been a more consistent method for us. But, again, obviously, we don't guide. So at this point, I'd say based on very dynamic conditions, in the last few quarters, over the course of 2012 and over the first quarter of 2013, clearly, you've seen that share repurchase has been our preferred method of cash deployment. That's based on current conditions. There's no change in our strategy, as I mentioned, with respect to M&A or other uses of cash, it's just determined every quarter.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And George, could you quantify the impact on the first quarter from that change in accounting on contra revenue? And did you say that it's bigger in the first quarter as you adopted the plan and starts to fade? I missed what you were -- how we were explaining that.", "George E. Kilguss", "So contra is, I would say, for all intents and purposes, now going to be more consistent in each quarterly number. It was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter from fourth quarter to first quarter. First quarter 2012 had probably about $4 million more of contra depressing Q1 in 2012. But Q4 to Q1 were very consistent in the amounts.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And last question, on the repatriation analysis that you're doing, what's left to determine? You mentioned before, at the end of the year, you need a ruling by a tax authority. Or what else can we be looking from the outside to gauge where you're at in the process?", "George E. Kilguss", "So as you can imagine, we've been evaluating the strategic alternatives related to our international tax and related liquidity. As you can appreciate, that work is very complex. It is ongoing. We had hoped to have had an update for you know, but as mentioned, that work continues. There are a number of complexities we have, a number of dependencies as well. And we'll give you an update as soon as we can, but it's ongoing. At the end of the day, as you might expect, we need to understand the full cost and risk of any potential changes to our structure before we consider any decision to potential changes. And it is just a very complex area. We do have some dependencies that we're looking at. And we'll provide you an update clearly on Q2 and Q3, if not before. But we think that work should be completed by year-end.", "Operator", "And moving on, we'll now hear from Walter Pritchard of Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "George, I'm wondering just on the margins for the year. I'm wondering if you could -- I didn't hear you talk about the exit margin, again, on this side in the prepared remarks. But what are you thinking in terms of exit margin? I guess that's first question.", "George E. Kilguss", "I'm sorry. Was that marketing expense you're talking about -- you're asking about?", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "No, sorry. The exit -- the operating margin you expect to exit with in the fourth quarter?", "George E. Kilguss", "So -- thank you. I understand now, the operating margin exit rate. So, again, our guidance for the full year is that we expect it to be at least 57% non-GAAP operating margin. We don't guide to a fourth quarter exit rate. We were higher in the first quarter because we did delay some of these marketing expenses. We do expect to spend those this year. So we have not changed our guidance or updated our guidance of at least 57% for 2012.", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim. Just a little bit of additional color on some of the marketing expense. Some of that, a portion of it is tied to investment in marketing, some of the new TLDs that we've applied for. For example, the IDNs, which are actually first in the order of delegation in ICANN's program. And there have been -- there's been some small delay, some uncertainty in that program. Some of our marketing expense is tied to that. So not all of it is entirely within our control. But I think, yes, we expect to spend it during the year. So there's some variability there based on outside factors that are not entirely within our control.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. And then I guess just on a major path on the guidance for net adds for the second quarter, I guess, a little lower than we were expecting. But we've seen the second quarter sort of be all over the map, historically. And I'm wondering, as we get kind of a level below the headline net add guidance, are you guys thinking about a particular change in trajectory between renewal rates and growth adds in terms of how you're getting to the Q2 net add guidance?", "George E. Kilguss", "Walter, we continue to look at our models, factor in many things we just talked about. Some of the continuing changes that are happening with the Google algorithm, we take that into consideration. Our best visibility for Q2 is the guidance we laid out in the call, 0.9 million to 1.3 million. That's what we're seeing today. Again, we do provide that visibility, as you know, daily. It's updated on our website every 12 hours. So you guys are seeing it in real time. But that's what we're seeing at least for the quarter. We talked about last quarter that our total zone growth, our guidance was based on a 4% to 6% total zone growth. That's still consistent with our view there. So we're looking at the total zone, 4% to 6%, that has not changed. But that's what we're seeing for Q2 is this range of 0.9 million to 1.3 million.", "D. James Bidzos", "As George said, it incorporates all of our best forecasting tools, but there are 2 major components under which we have very little direct influence. One is certainly macroeconomic conditions and particularly in Europe. And additionally, search engine algorithmic changes, which, as George mentioned, were highly concentrated in 2012, do continue. We do expect another Penguin update in 2013. Google has signaled that clearly. But those are 2 major factors that are a component of our guidance. So those are 2 that we have no direct influence over, and they're all reflected. And that's in the 0.9 million to 1.3 million guidance number that we provided.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Harris Heyer", "This is actually Harris Heyer on behalf of Phil Winslow. I was just hoping you could provide us a little bit of color on your IP licensing strategy going forward from here.", "D. James Bidzos", "I'm sorry. I missed the last part.", "George E. Kilguss", "IP licensing...", "Harris Hayer", "On your IP licensing strategy.", "D. James Bidzos", "I'm not sure we're in a position right now to give you more color. We're in a middle of a very active effort to inventory, assess and develop a strategy around our IP. I have mentioned in the past that our goal actually is not primarily to derive direct patent licensing royalty revenue from our IP but to use it in support of our business goals and our business planning. That certainly is unchanged, but that activity is well underway. And I hope we'll be able to tell you more shortly.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And that will come from Dan Cummins with B. Riley Bank.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "First, I am sorry, I missed -- you gave the renewal rate for the fourth quarter, and I missed it. And I wanted to ask if you could give us a rough idea of the number of names up for renewal in 2Q. That's the first part.", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Dan. The renewal rate in Q1 was -- again, it's not final until 45 days after the end of the quarter, but our estimate is 73.3% for Q1. And the number of names up for renewal in the second quarter is 26.1 million names.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay, great. And I want to just be clear on the marketing spend. Were you talking about $5 million per quarter? Or is that $5 million for the whole year? And -- those comments about the external factors, I think that explains quite a bit.", "D. James Bidzos", "That $5 million was a number based on calendar 2013, not quarterly, for the marketing spend.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Okay. So we should -- so in terms of understanding maybe the level of profitability that the business is running at right now, it -- the 59.6%, obviously, it seems a little bit overstated. But it probably isn't that far off, actually, if we're not going to see -- in other words, if the 5 just gets peanut buttered out over 3 quarters, the business seems to be running at a level, whatever, 100 to 200 basis points better than the full year guidance. Is that roughly correct?", "George E. Kilguss", "We will spend -- the $5 million that we did not spend in Q1 from marketing, the intention of our marketing department today is to continue to spend that this year. So they have -- it's not in place of other programs. It's programs that, as Jim talked about, some of it is tied to the new gTLD program. So some of that is not in our control, but our -- we expect our marketing spend to accelerate a little bit as we have these new programs going on and as this $5 million has shifted out of Q1 into later quarters.", "Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division", "Great. Okay. And one more thing I may have missed. Did you give headcount? And have you -- did you project headcount increase or decrease from where we are today out to year-end?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Dan. So we -- I believe the headcount number was on our slide -- in our slide deck. Total headcount was 1,070 employees. We do not give a forecast for headcount. That headcount is slightly down from Q4 levels, which was about 1,096 for full-time employees. But 1,070 is the answer to your question.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question today from Jaimin Soni of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick questions. First, kind of going back over what Sterling had asked earlier, looking at the guidance for the second quarter in terms of net domain name adds and the first quarter trend, it seems like the second half of the year, we should expect some normalization or an uptick to get to the 4% to 6% growth for the full year. Is that -- just trying to understand what gives you some confidence that you will see some improvement in the growth rate in the second half. And secondly, just wanted to get an update on the gTLD process from your perspective. When do you think that will start contributing to revenues?", "George E. Kilguss", "Jaimin, this is George Kilguss. Thanks for your question. Again, the guidance that we provided and -- for the quarter and the expectation for the zone, that is based on the most recent information we have. When -- clearly, when you look at historic net adds, you see that Q1 does tend to be a little stronger and then it does tend to flatten out. There are also changes year-to-year when you look at when certain holidays fall. Especially internationally, you can see that there are some Chinese holidays that happen in the first quarter that take those -- that market -- take those folks out of the market for a little bit and they tend to come back in. The Chinese New Year this year was delayed or was later than the previous year by several weeks. And so there's a number of factors that go into the model. Again, Q2, the 0.9 million to 1.3 million, that's what we're seeing today. But we still, at least, we sit here today, believe the zone will grow between 4% and 6%. As it relates to new gTLDs, that program looks like it's still in the works here, but we don't expect too much revenue in 2013 as a result of that program.", "D. James Bidzos", "I just want to give you a little more color on the TLD program. I think the ICANN just had their meeting a couple of weeks ago in Beijing. And there are couple of areas where the program is moving a little bit slower. There was a target date to make some major steps of April 23, a couple of days ago. That date has been delayed. In Beijing, there was a couple of major events. Number one is that advice was received from the government advisory council for ICANN, and I think that there's some issues that have to be addressed by applicants, which is probably going to take some time. That's been put out to public comment. And also, the process of contracting with registrars and registries in a new gTLD program is also a process that now involves public comment period for those contracts. So that's going to take some additional time as that process plays out. There was also a session in Beijing on security and stability. And -- but certainly, I commend ICANN for their commitment to make sure that all critical security and stability issues are addressed prior to delegation going forward. So I think there's a bit more work to do there. This is -- ICANN is getting operational. This is a major undertaking, a massive overhaul of global Internet infrastructure. So there have been delays in the past. It's probably not going to go perfectly smooth. I think at this point, we still expect the program to get off the ground this year but probably later in the year rather than earlier. And I don't think that we expect any significant revenue from our applications and our participation in the program this year. But Pat's here, he was in Beijing. If there's anything, Pat, you'd like to add.", "Patrick S. Kane", "I think you got it covered.", "D. James Bidzos", "So I think George said it succinctly, there's -- I just wanted to give you a little bit more color, but there's no significant revenue that we anticipate in 2013. Although our applications, as you know, are IDNs, which should be early in the process. So as the program does get underway, once again, I think we're well-positioned to participate with our 14 applications, including our 12 IDNs. So we continue to work within the program, work with ICANN, monitor progress and look forward to the program launching at some point.", "Operator", "And Mr. Atchley, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. During the second quarter, Jim and George will be presenting at the JPMorgan TMT conference at 10 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, May 14, in Boston.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. I'm David Atchley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.

VeriSign retains its long-standing policy to not comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our press release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter demonstrates that we're on track with our plans for 2013. We reported revenue of $239 million, which was 12% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $132 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new gross registrations during the second quarter and added 1.22 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of 124.3 million .com and .net domain names.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework.", "During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 7.1 million shares for $334 million. On July 24, 2013, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $519 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and remaining with no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "Also today, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .net, per our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2014, the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $5.62 to $6.18.", "I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the total base of registered domain names and common net was 124.3 million, consisting of 109.2 million for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 4.9% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 1.22 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.", "In the first quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 73.2% compared with 73.9% for the first quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2013 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.9% for the second quarter of 2012.", "In the last year, we've noted the ongoing effects of changes in search algorithms and macroeconomic headwinds on our renewal rates. These factors continue to have a more pronounced effect on first-time renewing rates. Our base has been maturing, and the renewal rate for previously renewed names has stayed relatively consistent, which are positive trends for the overall renewal rate. However, the softer first-time renewal rate is an offsetting factor. We cannot be certain of how long the renewal rate will be impacted by these factors.", "In light of these factors, we expect the third quarter net names for .com and .net added to the base will be between 1 million and 1.4 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin with a discussion of our second quarter financial results. During the quarter, we generated $239 million, up 12% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $132 million, up 23% from $107 million in the second quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.2% compared to 50% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $87 million compared to $68 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.42 for the second quarter last year.", "As of June 30, 2013, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.5 billion. Liabilities totaled approximately $2.8 billion at the quarter end. The second quarter balance sheet reflects the April 2013 issuance of $715 million in senior secured notes due 2023 and the repayment of $100 million in borrowings under our credit facility.", "During the second quarter, our stock price continued to exceed the subordinated convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means the holder of the convertible debentures will continue to have the option of converting the debentures into common stock during the third quarter. Thus the balance sheet classification as current liabilities of these debentures remains the same, as recorded at the end of the first quarter. We will provide updates if the balance sheet classification or the availability of the holder's option to convert the debentures change in the future, should the stock price trigger not be reached.", "I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $213 million for the second quarter. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from both international and domestic sources in the second quarter grew approximately 12% year-over-year.", "Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $856 million, a $44 million increase from the year-end 2012. Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $9 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million compared with $96 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to increased marketing expenses in the second quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter expanded to 58.9% compared to 54% in the same quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $92 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58 compared to $0.45 in the second quarter of 2012 and $0.58 last quarter.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations. In 2013, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 159 million shares in the second quarter compared to 161 million shares in the first quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debenture was approximately 9.4 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter, compared with 5.6 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 7.1 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $147 million for the second quarter compared to $151 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $135 million for the second quarter last year. Second quarter free cash flow was $132 million.", "Regarding our international cash balances and how they interrelate with our international tax structure, this work is progressing, but remains ongoing. We expect to compete our work before the end of the year, and we will update you when appropriate, including during our third quarter earnings call.", "Of the $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, approximately $630 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally. The approximate $1.37 billion in international cash has not been taxed at the U.S. level, and our assertion unchanged from prior quarters, is that this balance is indefinitely reinvested offshore.", "With respect to 2013, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue and operating margin projections. Revenue for 2013 is now expected to be in the range of $952 million to $962 million, representing an annual growth rate of 9% to 10%. This is an increase from the $945 million to $960 million or a growth rate of 8% to 10%, as given on our last earnings call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 58% and 59%. This is an increase from the guidance of at least 57%, as given on our last earnings call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $60 million and $62 million for 2013.", "Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q2 2012. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we continued our efforts to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Jim, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about some of the new product areas that you're exploring. You've, in the past, talked about that and patents as potentially additional sources of revenue. And I note that looks like your revenue this quarter was a bit above what we expected, modeling it off of the demand side and I'm wondering if any of these new product areas start to contribute in the quarter?", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay, thanks. So in our new product area, first of all, I don't know if you're referring specifically to NIA, but we don't report that separately, but we're pleased with the growth of our NIA business. Secondly, in the area of new products that are coming out of our R&D efforts, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making there. I've committed in earlier earnings calls to target a delivery of a new product or service during calendar 2013, and we still hope to be able to do that. So as to contributions to the revenue, I think that, that was part of your question. Certainly, NIA makes contributions to part of our revenue. But as I said, we don't report that separately.", "Operator", "And we will now go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Harris Heyer", "This is Harris Heyer for Phil. I was hoping that you could provide us with an update on your IP strategy that you first mentioned late last year?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, we mentioned last year that we would be reviewing our patent portfolio, and we continue to do that. We continue to add to our patent portfolio. We mentioned that we had over 200 patent applications and patents issued here in the U.S., that progress continues. We've added to that since the last call. We're currently in a review. We're not ready to say anything about where that review will take us, but we're conducting a review of how we can better utilize our intellectual property.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will now go to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just wanted to clarify on the renewal rate. Was it that the renewal rate on the new customers was lower? Or was the mix or the percentage of new customers renewing in the period simply higher?", "George E. Kilguss", "So Steve, this is George Kilguss. Thanks for the question. So the overall renewal rate for the second quarter, which is a preliminary renewal rate, is not final until 45 days after, was 72.4%. That renewal rate, year-over-year, which I think is the best comparison to look at, is down from 72.9% to about 72.4%. So we're a little under last year's renewal rate at this time. The renewal rate, sequentially, did decline, but the sequential decline is more a function of the fact that we have a lot more names coming up for renewal in the first and second quarter. And so that's primarily the reason for the consolidated decline. We also mentioned on the call that we are seeing some softness in the first-time renewal names -- renewing names. We had talked about this in our last quarter call as well, where the previously renewed name ratio is remaining relatively constant, but we're still seeing some pressure on the first-time renewing names.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Any speculations/theory on why that might be happening?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, I think it's really relates to a couple of factors. One, are primarily the factors that we've been talking about for several quarters now, which are changes in the algorithms, the search engine algorithms, as well as economic activities. We did see our international or our international renewal rate on first-time renewing rates come down a little bit more than our domestic, so there's a little more pressure overseas. But it really relates back to those macro and SEO algorithm changes.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then my next question is on the marketing spend, are you spending currently to drive the current .com business, or have you started to spend to seed for some of the new gTLDs that you'll be introducing here in the future?", "D. James Bidzos", "We're not -- the short and to your question is that most of the marketing efforts are the same as they have been throughout the beginning of the year, focused around .com and .net. We are preparing to roll out our IDNs that we've applied for. Nothing has been delegated yet. We hope that will happen sometime this year. There will be some, obviously, some marketing activities around those. But right now, it's mostly development activities.", "Operator", "And we will now go to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Jim, wondering if you just could talk briefly about your decision to raise .net pricing. This time around involved a smaller duration or smaller window, I should say, between price increases than I think we've ever seen before so I just wanted to get your thoughts there?", "D. James Bidzos", "I'm sorry, the part about the window, I didn't catch all of that.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "The window between price increases for .net, Jim?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, so basically, the contract with ICANN allows us to take an increase for .net on an annual basis with a 6-month notice period. And so under that provision of the Registry Agreement with ICANN for .net, we've taken that price increase.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and one thing I wanted to clarify on the renewal rate, and George, you had sort of talked about some that dynamic from a sequential basis, but I just wanted to make sure I understood, you were saying that the number of first-time renewals in Q2 was greater than Q1 and that's why there was a sequential change? Or was it something else?", "George E. Kilguss", "No, I was saying that the total number -- in Q1 and Q2, we tend to have more expiring names in the base than we do, say in Q3 and Q4. And so as you have more names expiring, the renewal rate has a tendency to dip, at least in recent periods, with the larger amount of names renewing in the quarter. But what I also said is some of the pressure is due to the first time renewing rate of first-time renewing names that is still under pressure.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And I guess, what I'm wondering, George, is if there's any dynamic that has changed between Q1 and Q2 when I was asking about sequential? And maybe a better way to ask it is, where there any meaningful search algorithm changes that were made more recently that might have had an effect on renewal rate? Or was that not the case?", "George E. Kilguss", "So there was one algorithm change in the quarter. So in mid to late May, Google made an algorithm change to their Penguin -- their Penguin algorithm. It affected -- I think it affected about 2.3% of queries in general. That's probably a little less than what their first one came out a year ago, which affected about 3% of queries. So there was an algo change. With that, it's difficult for us to see the direct correlation. We do know that change happened, we keep on eye on it. Did that have a direct correlation? I don't have quite that visibility of data to tell that but I do know that, that did happen in the quarter.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. Then just finally, Jim, on the new detailed e-front -- so there continues to be some back-and-forth between ICANN and constituents, but it also looks like there's been some real progress recently with the 2013 registry agreement recently signed. And I think you talked about hopefully getting lift off on the IDN before the end of the year. What additional processes or potential obstacles, I guess, are we looking at between now and then?", "D. James Bidzos", "Sure. ICANN just had their meeting last week in Durban, South Africa. And they did sign 4 new Registry Agreements and a new gTLD program for IDNs. And as to whether what track or timing the program is on, I think, first of all, ICANN is dealing with couple of issues. One is back in Beijing, at the prior meeting, in April, ICANN was given a communiqu\u00e9 from the Governmental Advisory Committee that I think had them sort of addressing a number of issues for new gTLDs. That continued in Durban, with further discussions between ICANN and its GAC, Governmental Advisory Committee, on the advice that they provided on productions around a broad category of applied 4 strings. So I think that's a factor. There are some security instability issues that are being addressed. ICANN hired a very competent, qualified contractor to do a security study that was presented in Durban, If you're interested in that, I'd point you to ICANN's website, where there's audio available of the presentation, of that report and a Q&A session that I think would help you understand that. And then -- so those things are affecting ICANN's rollout. In Durban they also said that the earliest date for the first delegation, assuming all goes well, would be early in September. So that's basically the most recent status that we have.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will now got to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I wanted to start with growth decelerates in the second half as we lose some of the tailwind from the last .com price increase and I think there's a discussion that many of us are having about what is the long-term growth rate for VeriSign look like in absence of price increases on .com? So when you think about new gTLDs, you think about the adding of new products, et cetera, is there a sense that you can give us? Do you think we see reacceleration off of what the growth rate at the back half looks like? And what kind of investment will be necessary to support that? Meaning, what could we think about, just generally, would happen to margins?", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay, let me sort of break that up into 2 questions and I'll address part of it and maybe George can address part of it. First of all, ICANN's new gTLD program, as we've mentioned before, offers us several growth opportunities. First of all, there are the 14 applications that we've made ourselves, 12 of those are IDNs, foreign script variance for common net, so we think that's a growth opportunity for us. In addition, we have roughly 200 strings that are applied for in the new gTLD program, for which VeriSign will be the contracted back-end registry service provider, so we think that's a growth opportunity. We have been very active and working very hard in new initiatives, including some work in a new laboratory that we started last year. We're pleased with the progress we're making there. As I said, we hope to announce the first new product or service this year. And -- so that's one area, where I think we'll be able to introduce new growth. We did, of course, just today announce a price increase for .net. With that price increase, I might add, at $6.18 for a .net name, that registration is still extremely competitive compared to other gTLDs that are out there today. Even .com at $7.85 is below most of the existing or announced prices for existing gTLDs. So all of those offer us opportunities for growth. Then there's the future rate of growth in the zone, which I think was a part of your question as well and I'll invite George to comment there.", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, sure. So, Sterling, as you're aware, we don't give guidance beyond just the current year. When earlier in the year, when we gave our initial guidance, we talked about the zone growing between 4% to 6%. We're seeing now that the zone year-to-date has been about 4.9% year-over-year growth. And so, we're looking to see the zone at least for '13 to be somewhere between 4% and 5%. That's where the zone is currently trending. You talked about profitability. As we roll out some of these new initiatives, as we've talked previously, we look for certain quality of revenues. So we're looking at business opportunities and new initiatives that have similar qualities of revenue as our existing business: stability, visibility, profitability. And so those are the characteristics we're looking for, for new investment in the business. We've talked about the new gTLD program, the brand that we're looking to represent, as well as the new IDNs. And we've been making those or have made a lot of those investments already in the business and don't expect a significant amount of cost increase in taking those new opportunities on. Now, it looks like some of those may be delayed a little bit longer than anticipated based on some of the comments coming out of ICANN, but we still look to participate in those initiatives, as well as looking at our patent portfolio and some new ideas coming out of the hive in subsequent years.", "D. James Bidzos", "And I'm sorry, I will just add to that as well that all of the growth opportunities that I laid out, the IDNs, the back end Registry Services, new products and services that we might introduce, essentially, the cost of developing all of these new initiatives are baked into to the current business plan and all of the guidance that we provide, if that helps.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Absolutely. You mentioned, Jim, the -- a couple of approvals of new registries for IDNs. Has anybody given any sense as to what we might expect in terms of pricing on any of the new IDNs or new gTLDs?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think the short answer to that is no. I would add that while ICANN did sign 4 contracts for IDNs, I believe that there are some conditions associated with those. I think if you got to the website, you'll see that there were some exhibits that the applicants signed in addition to the contracts that essentially say that governmental advisory committee advice and security and stability issues could introduce changes that will change that contract. And so, even though those contracts resigned, there were side agreements attached to them that are on ICANN's website that you can look at that point out that they're subject to changes in a very fluid situation. But I'll let Pat comment -- but I'm not aware of anybody who's announced any pricing at this point.", "Patrick S. Kane", "No, all the applications that were submitted has financials, which were redacted from when the applications were published, so we have no visibility into that.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and last question. Jim, you mentioned NIA. I know you don't break it out specifically, but qualitatively, can you talk about maybe which areas outperformed in the quarter?", "D. James Bidzos", "Go ahead, George, I'm sorry.", "George E. Kilguss", "I mean, Sterling, I would say it continues to meet our expectation. It's performing well year-over-year. We still see growth in all of the products that we offer for sale in that mainly DDoS, as well as MDNS and our iDefense business. We continue to see good growth of that in our business performing line with our expectations.", "Operator", "And we will go to our last question of Jaimin Soni with Bank of America.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A question for George, first. If I'd look at the second half of the year, George, can you just help me understand a little bit about how you expect renewal rates to trend? And when you're looking at the new domains that are coming in, can you give a rough estimation of how many are international versus U.S.?", "George E. Kilguss", "So on your last point, the U.S. versus international, as I mentioned in the script, about 60% of our business is domestic and about 40% is international from a revenue perspective, and that flows pretty much down to the domains, as you might imagine, from a break out perspective. So that has been relatively consistent over the past several quarters, so I don't see a significant change in that mix for the rest of this year. As far as the renewal rate trends, again, that's something we're looking at. We've given the preliminary renewal rate here to second quarter of 2013 of 72.4%, and that's something we're keeping an eye on, the renewal rates. There is a little bit of seasonality if you go back and look at the quarterly renewal rate, it does bounce around depending on the amount of names that are coming up for renewal in a particular quarter. What I can tell you is the amount of expiring names in Q3 is 24.9 million names that are expiring in the quarter and will come up for renewal.", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it, okay. And one quick one for Jim. It seems like the IDN opportunity is to move to a near term of when it comes to the new domain name side of things. Is it possible to just give some parameters on how we can think about the sizing of the TAM here?", "D. James Bidzos", "Are you talking specifically about VeriSign's own applications for IDNs?", "Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes.", "D. James Bidzos", "Well we've made applications for 12 strings that are IDNs for variations of .com and .net and essentially the largest market opportunities, China, India, Japan, Korea and a handful of others. We haven't -- I think it's early for us to say until we actually start marketing and get approval for the IDNs what the potential for that would be. We've not finalized and issued any pricing associated with that. We did send a letter to ICANN clarifying a little bit about our marketing strategy, which I think is reasonable to define as sort of a brand extension strategy, I'll bypass the comments on that as well, but I'm afraid there's really, at this point, it's hard -- it's too early to project the size of the opportunity, but in places like China and India, where there are very large populations of Internet users, who are not English speakers, I certainly think there is an opportunity, but I'll let Pat comment as well.", "Patrick S. Kane", "So .com, .C-O-M, really has great brand awareness around the globe and some of the issues that we will -- that we're about to contend with is the penetration we have with our own brands and the adoption rate of what the local transliterations will look like. And the second piece is, that we talked about this in the past, IDNs are still not completely ubiquitous in terms of their capabilities within desktop and mobile software. So there's still some challenges in that particular area right now. So the growth is kind of -- we're excited about it, but in terms of what the total opportunity looks like, there's still some challenges that define that.", "D. James Bidzos", "There's some infrastructure development that still has to occur before they are fully functional in all of the applications. But there's a tremendous amount of interest, there is growing support. A lot of application developers have committed to support IDNs. There's a lot of activity in developing standards for interoperability between applications to support IDNs. And as I mentioned, I think that for brands that market in those geographies where you have a large population of Internet users who are native -- not English speakers, I think there's certainly an opportunity for them to market to those folks through IDN. So we think it's a good opportunity, but unfortunately, at this time, it's a bit early to try to size the market and since we haven't -- we don't have approval yet for the IDNs. They're not delegated and we haven't published pricing. It's just a bit early to really go farther than that.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call.

Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, Catherine, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. I'm David Atchley, and here with me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There, you will also find our third quarter 2013 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our press release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent form -- report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "", "VeriSign retains its long-standing policy to not comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign.

Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate that we're on track with our full year 2013 plans. We reported revenue of $244 million, which was 9% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $134 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.3 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.55 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of $125.9 million active .com and .net domain names.", "Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business.", "As part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 6.8 million shares for $331 million. At the end of third quarter, $697 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "In today's press release, we announced an update related to our work in reviewing our current tax structure. As you'll note from the press release, we expect to file for a worthless stock deduction, that if claimed, we estimate will yield an income tax benefit of approximately $300 million to $400 million, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our tax work remains ongoing, and we expect to provide further updates during our fourth quarter earnings call. George will discuss this update in more details in a few moments.", "For the last few quarters, I discussed our continuing focus on innovation and intellectual property. Our R&D team continues to actively research and develop new concepts and to evaluate new ideas to improve our current technologies and services and to invent new ones. These efforts support our strategic framework and enhance our ability to create innovative technologies and services.", "As part of our IP strategy we have made, and continue to make, substantial investments in IP. Over the last several years, these investments have included a significant increase in the number of patent applications filed by VeriSign in the United States and Europe. This increase in patent applications supports our strategy to continuously serve our customers and partners in innovative ways through our products and services and to make sure that others only use our IP under appropriate licenses from VeriSign.", "Over the years, VeriSign's commitment to performance and reliability in our registry operations have led us to innovate energetically and to develop capabilities that are not available from off-the-shelf products. As of the end of the third quarter, VeriSign has a patent portfolio with a combined total of 231 patents and patent applications in the U.S., plus 304 granted and pending patent applications in other countries. Our patent portfolio includes 127 granted or pending applications in the U.S. that we believe protect inventions that enable our core registry operations.", "While we've not decided the best ways to fully utilize our IP assets, and it's too early to provide any guidance on how we can use them in the future, supporting our business goals and strategic framework will always drive those decisions. More information about VeriSign's leadership through innovation is available in our new white paper titled VeriSign Innovation, Exceeding the Standard for Registry Operations, located at verisigninc.com/innovation. An additional resource to better understand how our U.S. patents pertain to VeriSign's product and service offerings is available at verisignpatents.com.", "We also have the goal, through our innovation efforts, to offer additional product and services. This work is ongoing, and we're pleased with the progress. This summer, the company hired a Senior Product Executive to lead the development of these new products and services. We had hoped to announce a new product before the end of the year, but this is taking a little longer. However, I am pleased to say that we're in the process of contracting with a customer to pilot this product. Currently, we don't have more to say about this pilot program we're offering, but we will keep you updated when appropriate on our efforts.", "ICANN continues to make progress on its new gTLD program. This week, the first 4 IDNs, or Internationalized Domain Names, as part of this program, were delegated into the root zone. At this point, we're not sure of the timing for our own new gTLD applications or for the back-end Registry Services that we'll be providing, but we will provide updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications.", "I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 125.9 million, consisting of 110.7 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 5% year-over-year. In the third quarter, we added 1.55 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.3 million new gross registrations.", "In the second quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 72.9% for the second quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2013 will be approximately 72.5%, or flat as compared to the third quarter of 2012.", "As we have discussed over the last few quarters, the overall renewal rates softened primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors affecting first time renewal rates and seasonal trends, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the fourth quarter to be between 1.1 million and 1.5 million names.", "As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarters. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've stated on prior calls, we have been examining our tax structure. Today, I would like to discuss the results of our tax work to date. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect to liquidate, for tax purposes, one of our domestic subsidiaries, which we expect will allow us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return. If claimed, based on our preliminary estimates, we expect to record an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 ranging from approximately $300 million to $400 million related to the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions recorded as required under U.S. GAAP.", "The worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the IRS, which could result in reversal of all, part or none of the income tax benefit, or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount we initially record. We cannot guarantee the liquidation of this subsidiary will occur as described, or at all, or what the ultimate outcome, use or amount of the benefit we receive will be, if any. The financial statement carrying value of this subsidiary is not material.", "While we expect our domestic operations to generate sufficient taxable income to fully use the expected tax benefits of the ordinary loss on the worthless stock deduction, we are analyzing and evaluating various scenarios for realizing the benefit. Although our current intent remains to indefinitely reinvest outside of the U.S. those funds held by foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the U.S., and accordingly, we have not provided deferred U.S. taxes for such funds, we anticipate reevaluating our overall business structure and financing of foreign operations as part of this analysis. If the conclusion of this analysis results in a change to our current strategy related to foreign operations, we may be required to accrue an additional U.S. tax obligation, although we cannot predict what such amount, if any, may be.", "Based upon the audited statutory financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2012, on a combined basis, our foreign subsidiaries have up to approximately $600 million of distributable capital under applicable foreign statutes. We do not know what the ultimate outcome, if any, will be resulting from this analysis and evaluation.", "I would now like to discuss our third quarter financial results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $244 million, up 9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $133 million, up 14.3% from $116 million in the third quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 54.5% compared to 51.9% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $81 million compared to $78 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 in the third quarter of this year compared to $0.47 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2013, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. Liabilities totaled $2.8 billion at the quarter and.", "I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $244 million for the third quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from foreign customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $858 million, a $45 million increase from year-end 2012.", "Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10.6 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $98 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 58.8% compared to 56.4% in the same quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $90 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.59 compared to $0.50 in the third quarter of 2012 and $0.58 last quarter.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations. In 2013, we now expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $25 million to $30 million, assuming we claim the benefit of the worthless stock deduction in 2013.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 153 million shares in the third quarter compared to 159 million shares in the second quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 10.5 million shares based on the average share pricing during the third quarter compared with 9.2 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 6.8 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $134 million for the third quarter compared to $147 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $122 million for the third quarter last year. Third quarter free cash flow was $134 million. Of the $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, $389 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally.", "With respect to 2013, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue and capital expenditure projections as follows. Revenue for 2013 is now expected to be in the range of $960 million to $965 million, representing an annual growth rate of 10%. This is an increase from the $952 million to $962 million, or a growth rate of 9% to 10% given on our last earnings call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.", "Full year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 58% and 59%, as we expect an acceleration of sales and marketing spend during the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $60 million and $62 million for 2013.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $65 million and $75 million, changed from the $60 million to $80 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook for our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q3 2012. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Finally, I wanted to note to you an update in our reporting schedule going forward. After reviewing the reporting schedule of our peer group, and with the desire to decrease the time between our fourth quarter earnings release and the issuance of our 10-K, we expect our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings release and earnings call to be held 2 weeks later than in the past. This change affects only our fourth quarter and full year earnings release. Other quarterly dates would remain similar to prior practice. We expect to hold our fourth quarter 2013 and full year 2013 earnings release and earnings call during the first week of February 2014.", "Now, I will return the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value. We have protected our business by providing over 15 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net registries. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, our specialized and purpose-built network, and the extensive redundancy built into our infrastructure. Our focus on innovation supports our business growth initiatives as we continuously work to develop new products and services.", "Finally, we've been managing the business effectively through expansion of our operating margins and delivering value to shareholders. In addition to the $300 million to $400 million expected income tax benefit, we announced today, through the third quarter of this year, we have repurchased 16.9 million shares for $797 million, representing 11% of the 153.4 million shares that were outstanding at the end of 2012. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.", "We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I did want to ask, just given the strength that we saw in net adds this quarter, I was a bit surprised to see deferred revenue be essentially flat on a sequential basis. Just wondering if there were any onetime items or adjustments that might have gone into deferred?", "George E. Kilguss", "Nothing material, Gregg. This is George Kilguss. We had a minor true up in the quarter, but it wasn't material related to our .jobs operation. But no, we had a good quarter with regard to gross additions. They came in a little stronger than we expected, but we were pleased with those results.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And George, you mentioned that you do expect to accelerate your sales and marketing spend in Q4. Can you put a finer point on the nature and amount of the increased investment there?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, Gregg, we don't guide to fourth quarter sales and marketing. But if you recall, back on our comments in -- earlier in the year, we did have an amount of roughly about $5 million that we had delayed into later parts of the year. We have a number of marketing activities that are going on right now, and we have registrars subscribing up for some of those programs, so we absolutely are expecting that spend to increase. But some of those -- that spend is dependent on registrars and other folks subscribing up to programs. But we absolutely have a significant amount of marketing going on in the fourth quarter.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And George, is any of that in relation to the new gTLDs or just completely independent from that?", "George E. Kilguss", "I would say most of the programs that are running today are on, primarily .com and .net activities.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Right, okay. And then just one last one for me, as a clarification regarding the worthless stock. With the income tax benefit, if it does arise in Q4, would that be treated as GAAP only? Or do you envision treating that in a non-GAAP format as well?", "George E. Kilguss", "No, it would just be from a GAAP perspective.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And Sterling Auty with JPMorgan has our next question.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "The $600 million in capital available to be distributed internationally is a far cry from the actual international cash balance that's offshore. Can you talk to us about what causes the limitation? What you might be able to do with the other international cash beyond just this program?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Sterling. So let me first say that as it relates to the $600 million discussed in our prepared remarks, this was the combined amount of distributable reserves in our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012, which is the last statutory audits that we've had filed. My intent in the disclosure was to simply provide the shareholders some more insight into our foreign capital structure, as they have had questions around this area in the past. As you know, we get questions around foreign cash balances all the time. And I was just letting folks know that we are bound by certain foreign statutes. The distributor reserves, just for clarification, are the amount of funds as of 12/31, 2012, that the foreign entities could have distributed through dividends to the U.S. patent at that time. Again, while we've not changed from our current position of these funds being indefinitely reinvested overseas, we are conducting additional reviews in the area, and we'll go through an evaluation process on that. We'll provide you an update, and that now still is ongoing in the fourth quarter. To be a little more specific, the amounts over the distributable reserves overseas, I think we've mentioned this before, some of our cash overseas came from divestitures. And that is where the balance of those distributables -- those amounts that cash over has come from, from the divestitures, other than from a generating income over there. And we're looking at that, and I'll have more to hopefully say to you on our fourth quarter call.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So the last part that you just said, there's the chance or there -- you're looking into ways that perhaps the amounts above the $600 million could also be utilized beyond just internationally?", "George E. Kilguss", "Again, we're looking at evaluating and reevaluating our international cash. We're looking at that. That work is ongoing. I don't have any determinations here today to talk about -- but we're clearly looking at that.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then Jim, I wanted to talk a little bit about the new products. It's been some time. You mentioned that you're hopeful to get a product out. It doesn't look like it's going to come this year, but you had a new head put in place in terms of heading new products in. What I'm curious about is how you're doing the business planning around the new solution that you're possibly taking to pilot in terms of the types of returns that you're expecting to get out of the investment, or how much investment you're going to put around it? So what's the strategy in terms of how you're thinking about putting new products into the marketplace and how much investment will go to support it?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well we don't -- we obviously can't guide to the expenses directly attributable to any new product or anything specific about the product's expenses. But going back to what we set out as goals for some of the innovation that we funded, going back over a year ago, we look for products and that would leverage the existing network that could be covered by intellectual property for us and that yielded margins similar to the core business. So those are the goals for the new products. And when we say that we're pleased with the progress that we're making with some of the new products coming out of what we call the hive, our innovation facility here, they're meeting those requirements. So we also mentioned back when we talked about innovation, that what we're doing is exploiting intellectual capital that the company had, that we have a lot of good ideas on how to utilize our network in more efficient ways to offer new products and services, things that would leverage the investment that we've already made in this high-availability, high-performance, purpose-built network. So I can tell you that it meets all of those requirements. I think it's early to say more than that, but -- and you're right, we're now engaged in contracting for a pilot for this project. So we are making progress, but I think beyond that, it's too early to say more.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Last question, if I may. The changes to the algorithms and search engines, there had been some talk that maybe there are some additional ones that occurred over the last month or so. Is that the case? And it seemed like the name additions were still pretty good. Are we getting to the point of diminishing returns where maybe some of those changes are having less and less impact on the actual growth in the zone?", "George E. Kilguss", "Go ahead, Pat. Why don't you...", "Patrick S. Kane", "So this is Pat. So I think what you're referring to is the Hummingbird release at Google. And, basically, they pushed that out on October 3. And the foundation for this release appears to be more about natural conversations. So they're really looking at the mobile space right now with that, and we've not seen a lot of impact on the domain names because of that. But it's a change, and things I've read about -- that is from Google. This is just the first major really restructuring change since 2001 on the algorithm. So they're going to keep tweaking on it. It's really one of these things that's geared towards mobility, I believe.", "Operator", "And we'll go on to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "George, I was just going back into the tax planning and the worthless stock, involved in it is a subsidiary. I'm just wondering if there was any color you could give us around this subsidiary, and where the value of this asset had been or where it's coming from?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, sure. I mean, all I can really tell you is that it's a subsidiary that has a large tax basis, and that was prior -- it was part of a prior acquisition. But the worthless stock deduction, really is a situation where we have a situation where a stock can become worthless, and you take a claim for that. And so, that happens on the occurrence of certain events, and the event that we're talking about is the expectation of liquidating the subsidiary.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then if I could just maybe turn to the new gTLDs. You mentioned that 4 have gone all the way through the funnel and have been delegated to the root and those were 4 IDNs, and it didn't sound like those were any of the ones that you currently own. But as we just look, going forward, I'm just wondering if you have any comments about what the general timing of icon, moving names through the process in getting the 220 potential customers you have through that process and maybe the other TLDs that you own directly, as we look into next year, if you have any expectation or color you can provide us around that.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, I think it's early for us to predict what's going to happen to our own applications or the applications of our other customers. There are -- the 4 IDMs that were delegated this week, the first of those was actually contracted back in the ICANN meeting in Durban, which was in mid-July. So they're very early. I'm not sure exactly what the contracting status of all of the applications are, but I believe it's around or less than 100 that are in contracting. So we have less than 10% that have reached the contracting phase. And until that's done, they can't get onto the delegation phase. And there's still some work in the -- they're pursuing something called the alternate path to delegation that ICANN provided just very, very recently. And they have to do some blocking in second level domains. The non-alternate path is a more comprehensive, security and stability planning qualitative analysis, so there's -- and sorry, ICANN is still actually developing that process. They're conducting more study to provide more data to inform that process. So I think it's early at this point to speculate exactly what the pace and timing for these other ones will be. Pat, do you want to add anything to that?", "Patrick S. Kane", "No, I think it's exactly right. Just it's, basically, if you move forward on either path, there's a process you can accept the standard agreement if you negotiate and you want other terms inside that agreement, that'll certainly take longer. And that's going to be up to the individual applicant at that point in time.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll now go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Harris Heyer", "This is Harry Heyer for Phil. I know you talked a little bit about building out your IP portfolio. And I was wondering if you might be able to give a little bit of detail on your IP monetization strategy?", "D. James Bidzos", "We have not yet finalized that strategy, as I mentioned, it's early for us to detail that. I think what we announced today is the availability of 2 resources on our website. The first one is the white paper, and I would encourage you to read it. It's easier to read than it is for me to describe. It's essentially -- I'll try though, anyway. It's a survey of the innovation that we've done that we've brought to our infrastructure that we think will benefit our customers. Whether it's all of the global Internet users, who benefit from our resolution services or from our back-end registry services customer. So again, the white paper is available at www.verisign.com/innovation. And so that gives you a lot of context in terms of how the patents are grouped and what particular areas you'll find that we described our innovation efforts and then some of the IP that those efforts have yielded by category. So I think you'll be able to get a broad idea, a big picture idea of where we've been innovating and some rough idea of the categories and number of patents that we have in that area. And I also mention that we do have another resource, verisignpatents.com. And there, what you'll find is a specific list of patents and how they apply to the various products and services that we offer. So if you're interested in just absolute numbers of patents that apply to various services offered by VeriSign, you'll find what's essentially sort of a patent marking website there. So beyond that, we've not gone into any detail on how this portfolio of intellectual property will be used, other than to say we will certainly explore ways to further our business interests with it.", "Operator", "And our final question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just kind of tagging on that IP question there. Sorry, this is Ken Wong for Walter. So tagging on that IP question, I mean is it -- mean, it seems like it's somewhat -- at this stage, it might be somewhat limited to potentially pursuing licensing from other registries, which makes sense with a bunch of gTLDs coming along. I mean, is it more than that? Should we be looking at you guys potentially being able to license this to other Internet service providers? Or is it more limited to just registry/registrar type functionality?", "D. James Bidzos", "It's more than that. I mean, we operate a high-reliability infrastructure that involves high-performance and redundancy. And so these patents cover the entire broad swath of the technology category that applies to everything we do, which is certainly at its core, registry operation. Some of these functions interact with registrar functions and intersect with them. But again, I'd encourage you -- I think you'll find the White Paper very informative in this regard.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. Yes, will definitely check it out. As then second, I guess we haven't heard you guys talk much about the NIA business recently. Any color on how that business is growing? And should we still kind of view that as an area of kind of serious investment from you guys?", "D. James Bidzos", "I'm sorry, I didn't hear the very last part.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess, should we -- just, I mean, should we still view that as an area, where you guys are putting good resources behind in terms of investing in that particular business?", "D. James Bidzos", "We have made substantial investments over the years in NIA. And I mentioned in recent calls, 3 quarters ago -- 2 quarters ago, that what we're doing was streamlining NIA and structuring it better to scale going forward, that we were aligning expenses with revenue in the business. And we're making progress in all of those areas. It's still at a point where we're not calling it out separately or talking about it separately, but in the 3 categories, iDefense, which is threat intelligence, Managed DNS and also DDoS, we do see opportunities in all those areas, and we continue to actively grow that business. I think, at some point, we'll get to a point where we'll talk about separately, but we're not there now.", "Operator", "And we have no additional questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for your final or closing remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, Catherine. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call.

Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our press release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent forms -- report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "Please note that we have not fully completed the tax provision calculation process and the tax provisions for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013, including the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction and income tax expense related to taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation, are still preliminary, and therefore, GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for these periods are also preliminary. Final tax provisions, GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share will be included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, to be filed with the SEC, and may differ materially from what we discuss today.", "VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our press release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results capped a solid 2013 for VeriSign, in which we executed on our goals to protect, grow and manage the business. In 2013, we provided uninterrupted availability for the common net DNS, now for over 16 years. We processed 34 million new domain registrations and finished the year with 127.2 million names in the domain name base. We recorded strong 2013 financial performance, including 10% year-over-year revenue growth and $533 million in free cash flow. During the year, we repurchased 21 million shares for $1 billion.", "As noted in our press release, we liquidated one of our domestic subsidiaries during the fourth quarter and plan to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return for a net tax benefit of approximately $375 million. Also, we intend to repatriate approximately $700 million to $800 million of offshore cash during the second or third quarter of this year. George will provide further details on the worthless stock deduction and plans for repatriating a portion of our offshore cash.", "Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of 2013. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.1 million shares for $225 million. On January 31, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $528 million to a total of $1 billion in authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration.", "We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "New generic top level domains were delegated into the root zone during Q4. While we admit we have been invited by ICANN to begin the contracting process for 12 of our 14 applications, VeriSign has not yet signed agreements for these gTLD applications. We will provide updates, as appropriate, regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers.", "Over the past few quarters, we've spoken about efforts in our area of innovation and intellectual property. We've made progress in both these areas and may see revenue from these efforts, as well as from new gTLDs and back-end Registry Services in 2014. However, based on current visibility, we're not including any such revenue in the 2014 revenue guidance George will be discussing in a few minutes.", "Our NIA unit grew revenues, bookings and customers in 2013. I'll comment now on the fourth quarter and full year operating highlights. In our Naming business, at the end of December, the total base of active registered domain names in the zone for common net was 127.2 million, consisting of 112 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 5% year-over-year.", "In the fourth quarter, we added 1.29 million net new names for the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new name registrations.", "In the third quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 72.5% for the third quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 will be approximately 72.2%. This rate compares to 72.9% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "From the daily posting of the zone file through January, the first quarter incremental zone growth has been trending below last year's levels. While there are many factors that drive zone growth, there are a couple of items of note affecting the zone during this quarter. Recent changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactic have had a near-term negative impact on the zones as these registrars are focused on increasing bundled product offerings rather than on driving domain name sales and have been running fewer discount programs on new domain. Also, we see some impacts from economic headwinds in emerging markets that are contributing to January's lower trend in zone growth. While it is too early to say for how long or how much these factors may affect zone growth, we currently see it impacting registrations in the first half of the year. But we expect net new names additions to return closer to last year's levels in the second half of the year. Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, the overall renewal rate has been softer, primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first-time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors just discussed, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the first quarter of 2014 to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing the fourth quarter and full year financials, I would like to review with you the update on the worthless stock deduction and the repatriation noted in today's press release. As Jim mentioned, we liquidated, for tax purposes, one of our domestic subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2013, which will allow us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return. We recorded a net income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 of approximately $375 million related to the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions. VeriSign also sold certain cost method investments during the fourth quarter of 2013 and realized a pre-tax nonoperating gain of $15.8 million on this disposition. Additional information regarding this liquidation and the benefit is contained in today's press release.", "As with any tax filing, the worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the IRS. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, we may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect our results from operation, financial position and cash flow. Further, we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of benefit we receive will be, if any, if the deduction is reviewed and adjusted by the IRS.", "As part of this process, we evaluated various scenarios to realizing the tax benefits from the worthless stock deduction and determined that using part of the benefit to offset current year domestic income, combined with the repatriation of a portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries, as the most financially beneficial alternative. Accordingly, during the second or third quarter of 2014, we intend to repatriate approximately $700 million to $800 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefit resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the repatriation. The repatriation amount utilizes substantially all of the projected, available, distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes.", "During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an income tax expense of approximately $167 million related to the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation in 2014. For funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the U.S., our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the U.S., and accordingly, we have not provided deferred U.S. taxes for such funds. We expect the remaining worthless stock deduction benefit to be used during fiscal 2014 to offset anticipated domestic income taxes.", "I would now like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. During the fourth quarter, the company generated revenue of $246 million, up 7% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $130 million, compared with $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 53% as compared to 58.8% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $292 million, compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 in the fourth quarter this year, compared to $0.65 for the fourth quarter last year. Results for the fourth quarter of 2013 included the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, income tax expense related to the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation and $15.8 million pre-tax nonoperating gains from the sale of certain investments, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45.", "As of December 31, 2013, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.66 billion, up from $2.06 billion a year ago. Of the total assets, $1.7 billion were in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including $250 million in cash and cash equivalents held domestically. Total liabilities were $3.08 billion as of the fourth quarter, up from $2.07 billion a year ago.", "I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $246 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from foreign customers. For the full year, 2013 revenue was $965 million, up 10% year-over-year. Deferred revenue at year-end 2013 totaled $856 million, a $43 million increase from year-end 2012. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared with $100 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter came to 56.9%, compared to 62% in the same quarter of 2012.", "Last quarter, we signaled an expected increase in sales and marketing expense, which was realized in our fourth quarter results. You will also note that G&A expenses were higher in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared with the third quarter of 2013. Much of this quarter-over-quarter increase in G&A expense is related to capital taxes and other expenses as we prepared for the worthless stock deduction and the intended repatriation of offshore assets during 2014.", "The fourth quarter 2012 operating margin benefited from certain credits, as detailed in last year's press release. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $98 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 compared to $0.59 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $0.59 last year -- last quarter. Full year 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.40, a 22% increase over 2012. Results for 2013 included pre-tax nonoperating gains of $15.8 million recognized during the fourth quarter from the sale of certain cross-method investments, which increased non-GAAP net income by $11.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.07.", "Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2013 was $45 million expense and included the $15.8 million in realized nonoperating gains from investment sales mentioned earlier.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations. In 2014, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $50 million. Much of these expected cash taxes in 2014 relate to international withholding taxes on our intended repatriation. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 150 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 153 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 13.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 6.4 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was reduced by the full effects of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 4.1 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $147 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $134 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $171 million for the fourth quarter last year. Full year 2013 operating cash flow was $579 million compared with $538 million for 2012.", "Fourth quarter free cash flow was $121 million, which includes a decrease of $11 million in excise tax benefit from stock-based compensation and a use of $15 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2013 was $533 million, including a net $19 million of excise tax benefits and a use of $66 million in capital expenditures.", "With respect to 2014 guidance, revenue for 2014 should be in the range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 6%. This revenue range is based on a zone growth rate of between 2% and 4% for 2014 and takes into consideration our Q1 net additions estimate. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 58% and 60%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $73 million and $77 million for 2014. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound performance throughout the year. We grew non-GAAP operating income and net income. We maintained a strong balance sheet, executed on improving our capital structure and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I will turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. Over the last year, we've furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value. We protected our business by providing over 16 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and the net DNS. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, our specialized and purpose-built network and the extensive redundancy built into our infrastructure. Our focus on innovation supports our business growth initiatives as we continually work to develop new products and services.", "Furthermore, we've been managing the business effectively through expansion of our operating margins and delivering value to shareholders. During 2013, we repurchased 21 million shares for $1 billion. We recorded an income tax benefit of $375 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And in 2014, we intend to repatriate $700 million to $800 million of our offshore cash. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and providing value to our customers, employees and shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to drill into the names, first of all. You mentioned a couple of factors that might be headwinds here, emerging markets, and then the renewal rate in terms of the economy. Curious on the emerging markets specifically, can you give us a sense of what kind of growth that they were contributing to the zone increase in 2013? And are there programs you expect to start to come in, in the middle of the year on that discounting trends [ph] that might be exploited? And then one follow-up.", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, Sterling. So we did have some good success in penetrating some international markets last year. They seem to be performing at least early on. We have 1 month of data here with the actual date of January, and we see those markets, but primarily, I would say, China and that market being a little slower than last year. But as we talked about in our prepared comments, there are really a confluence of factors that are affecting our zone in the first quarter. And we talked about some of the changes that registrars had been making in some of their marketing tactics, really focusing more on ARPU and customer acquisitions. We also see them not discounting names as much, which is another indicator of them going after increasing ARPU instead of customer acquisitions. And we've seen the emerging market weakness. I will also say anecdotally, we've seen some continued tweaks of the Google algorithm. We do know there were 2 announced changes, one was a Penguin update and then the other one was something with regard to around how authors are viewed in their systems. But we do note that there's been some volatility in the keyword ranking, at least starting in mid-December and continuing on through January. So we've been noticing that. Haven't seen a direct correlation just yet, but that has been happening. So a confluence of factors that we've seen in the month of January. And as a result of the month of January, we've taken that input into our models and believe that will have somewhat of a negative impact for us, at least in the first half of the year. But our current models show us that the numbers of the net new adds should return in the third and fourth quarter to similar Q3 and Q4 levels from previous years.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, any thought to whether the gTLD program, whether people coming in for new sites might actually be thinking about an alternative gTLD to .com? And maybe that's having some sort of impact? And you also mentioned that your gTLD, both your names and your back-end registry, is not in guidance. Any sense of what that might contribute to 2014?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, Sterling, this is Jim. So let me take those in reverse order there. So first of all, the guidance that we gave, as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, does not include any revenue just because of visibility issues. We've been invited to begin contracting. Contracting, as you know, can be a complex process, so we just don't have the visibility to say that. Now some of our back-end customers, I think, are a little bit further down the process, and when I finish here, I'll invite Pat to comment a little bit on where some of them may be. I believe there's at least one of them that we expect to go live some time fairly early in 2014. So as far as the new gTLD program, I don't think that -- I think I don't see anybody who's going to abandon the .com for a new gTLD. There's a lot of strong anecdotal evidence that, that may not be the case. I can give you an example. So for example, you may have seen that the U.K. paper, dailymail.co.uk, a very typical English configuration for a web address, using a company dot U.K. configuration. So dailymail.co.uk purchased dailymail.com. They said that they purchased it because they wanted something that was more global that would allow them to get more traffic, especially in the U.S. They paid GBP 1 million for it. They bought it from The Charleston Daily Mail of Charleston, West Virginia, a 100-year-old Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper, who after they got their roughly $1.6 million for that domain name, were free to go out and buy whatever they wanted. Then they chose to go out and buy charlestondailymail.com. If they bought it for retail, they probably paid about $10 for it. So I think .com is very much the preferred, established reliable name. I don't know what's going to happen in the future with the TLDs. I'm sure some of them will do well, they'll build some community. But I guess I can give you one data point. If we look at -- look back, this is not the first time this has happened. There have been some new TLDs before, and one of them that I think actually is a good idea of what success what might look like, a good example would be .co. And I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with it. .co is a short name, it's just 2 letters. It's a meaningful name, it's linked to company. They went live in July of 2010. They had a very robust marketing partner, they partnered with Go Daddy, the largest registrar. They did 3 Super Bowl ads. They did, I thought, a very good job of marketing. They did partner with Go Daddy on 3 Super Bowl commercials. They have a substantial marketing budget. They had no gTLD competition when they came out. And they're not ICANN-regulated because they're operating under contract from the ccTLD .co for Colombia. So their history was that when they went live in July of 2010, they registered 100,000 domains in the first 10 minutes that they were live. Less than a year later, in June of 2011, they had reached 1 million domains. During that same period, by the way, that 11-month period, .com registered about 7 million. Just under 2 years later, by April of 2013, they had gone from 1 million to 1.5 million, so they added 500,000 domains during those 2 years. During that period, .com added 13.2 million. And then from April of 2013 until December 31 of last year, they added another 90,000 names, they closed the year at 1.59 million. .com added another 3.5 million during that time. I think they've done a great job with .co. I think they've been successful there. They ended the year at 1.59 million domains. Their growth has slowed a bit, obviously. But in Q3, we added 1.55 million names, that's the entire size of the .co zone. We added that in one quarter. We typically have 5x the size of their zone in gross adds in a quarter. So I think with somewhere in the neighborhood of, I don't know, 400 or 500 gTLDs that are non-brand that'll be distributed, it's going to be a little bit more crowded. They're obviously more specialized and different. I'm not sure where that's going to end up, but I do know that we have at least one data point, so I think we've coexisted well and done well with .co, and I'm sure we will with the other gTLDs. And I'm sure there'll be a lot of excitement as they roll out over the course of 2014. But we -- what we described as impacting our zone in the first quarter is what we see, some registrar behavior and also some economic headwinds that we're seeing in Asia.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "This is Chaitanya for Steve Ashley. I wanted to ask, now that you're going to be repatriating $700 million to $800 million in the middle of the year, how should we be thinking about the cash use? Are you going to continue the strategy of aggressive buybacks? Or is there a possibility of more M&A or even a regular dividend?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, this is Jim. First of all, we don't guide to buyback, but I -- we prefer that you look back at our history. We are committed through our strategy framework to protect, grow and manage the business. Under, as I mentioned during my comments, under manage the business, an important component of that is that we return value to our shareholders. We have in the past used dividends, but, of course, we've made extensive use of share repurchases during '13, during 2013, as I mentioned, having deployed $1 billion in cash for share repurchase. Every quarter, we reevaluate the needs of the business and what we may do to have when we decide on capital allocation. With respect to your question about M&A, I think we've been fairly consistent over the years that sort of growth for growth's sake and growth as a strategy is not part of our growth plan. However, if we see a way to accelerate a path to either a new product that we're developing or some other opportunistic things that may come along, we're certainly not opposed to doing those kinds of things if they're consistent with our core business, consistent with our commitment to delivering good, profitable growth. So I'm not saying we're ruling out M&A completely, of course, but there's no M&A in our radar at this point. There could be opportunities in the future. There will be many new registry operators. I don't know if all 500 will ultimately succeed over the years, but again, if there's an opportunity to improve our core business and drive profitable growth through some M&A opportunity, we're certainly open to looking at it, but that is not a part of our growth strategy. We don't believe in acquisition as a growth strategy. And I'd like George to comment further.", "George E. Kilguss", "No, I think that's right, Jim. With all our cash, as Jim mentioned, we really look to protect, grow and manage. First off, we absolutely want to maintain [ph] enough liquidity to protect the business, the very dynamic business that we're in. There's always a cyber threat that we're thinking ahead of, and we make sure that we invest enough in the business and in the future architecture of the business to protect the business. We then look at opportunities where we can invest the business and try to achieve positive returns for investors. And once we come to that conclusion, if there's excess capital that, as Jim said, could potentially be an accretive acquisition, we may look at that. But otherwise, we historically have returned excess capital to shareholders.", "D. James Bidzos", "And just to add one more comment to that, I think it's often overlooked in our business, and I'll just remind everyone again that our primary strength is the reliability and stability of our global network and our platform. 16 years of uninterrupted reliability for .com has been the foundation on which the hundreds of billions of e-commerce in the U.S. alone have been built on. I think that reliability is absolutely a critical component that helped e-commerce to flourish. So that is job 1 for us. We have a contract, we have obligations to deliver under that contract. First and foremost, the first consideration for our use of cash is making sure that we maintain a secure and stable network. That's the protect part of the business and protect is first for a reason. So we do look at that. And opportunities from there, of course, we consider. But that's first and foremost. And as George mentioned, cyber attacks are becoming more frequent. More challenging, more difficult, cybersecurity is a growing area, of course. And we are a large consumer of our own cybersecurity technology, that's what's kept us delivering and performing for so long.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Absolutely. That's very helpful. And also I just wanted to kind of ask again on the domain name growth side. .net has been lagging the .com growth for a while, and it looks like that decelerated as well in the recent months. Is there any reason for that? And is there anything that you can do from a marketing perspective to help that growth?", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim. I'll just make a brief comment, and I'll invite Pat to comment on that. In past quarters, you may have heard us talk about our efforts to do more targeted marketing. I think we've had some success with that, especially in some offshore markets. And that has, I think, helped some of that growth. But if your question is specifically about the relative comparative growth between .com and .net, I'll invite Pat to comment on that.", "Patrick S. Kane", "So all I can think of is .com has outdone .net from the other direction. But we are taking a look at .net and continue to market that as one of our lead properties. We think it's got a lot of value that can still be gained out of it, but it will continue to grow.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, .net is over 15 million registrations, so it is rather sizable. .co, which I talked about, which I think, again, is an indication of what a successful gTLD launch is. Basically between July of 2010, when they launched, and the end of 2013, December 31, that 1.5 million names is not an easy thing to do. But .net is still roughly 10x that size.", "Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Perfect. And finally, I just wanted to ask on G&A. I know that the second half of last year was elevated because of the liquidation of data [indiscernible]. How do we think about G&A cost going forward when we model out for 2014?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure. So, I mean, if you took our guidance that we provided to you and you use the revenue range that we gave of $1 billion to $1.20 billion and the 58% to 60% non-GAAP operating margin, that would box you into a $400 million to $428 million non-GAAP operating expense range for the full year. As it relates to the fourth quarter, we did have some expenses in the fourth quarter related to our worthless stock deduction that should not be recurring going forward. But for the full year range, I think if you just do the math on our guidance, you'll come to about a $400 million to a $428 million non-GAAP operating expense range.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "George, just wanted to ask, do the tax benefits from the worthless stock deduction completely offset the taxable income from the expected repatriation?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, we should be able to do that in a very tax efficient -- it will offset domestic taxes. We will still pay some international taxes when we do the repatriation, but as far as domestic taxes, we believe we'll able to shield about $167 million of taxes associated with that repatriation to the United States.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So just to confirm, does that mean then, I guess, that the full $700 million to $800 million can be repatriated without any offsetting cash tax liability for the company?", "George E. Kilguss", "Domestic cash, yes. We'll still pay some international tax, and we talked about that number. But we should be able to use that deduction to offset domestic taxes associated with repatriation.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And in Q4, did you spend the full amount of accelerated sales and marketing investments that you had initially planned? And is that something you expect will continue in the first half of this year as well?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, I would say pretty much. I mean, you saw -- if you look at the numbers, you saw that sales and marketing was up about $2 million quarter-over-quarter. We talked about that $2 million, $2.5 million as the amount that we were moving to the back half of the year, so that was pretty much in line with our expectations. I can say that we absolutely plan to continue to invest in marketing, sales and marketing activities. I mean, if you looked at sales and marketing going back a couple of years, we've been as high, for example, in 2012, as $26 million to $24 million the first 2 quarters of 2012. In this particular quarter, we were about $23 million. Again, this is on a non-GAAP basis, which just basically excludes stock-based compensation. And so we continue to look for opportunities to invest in marketing, but we are absolutely monitoring those and making sure that those uses of investments are generating positive returns.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last one. I have a question on the -- I guess for Jim or for George, on the 2014 unit growth guidance of 2% to 4% for .com and .net. In order to reach the low end of that range, just doing the math, it looks like we would have to see net adds in 2014 fall by more than 50% from 2013 levels. And given your comments that net adds should return to similar levels in Q3 and Q4 as what we've seen in previous years, it just seems very difficult to see how we would actually arrive or how you would get to the 2%. Is this just -- is that conservatism or is there something else there that I'm missing?", "George E. Kilguss", "Well, again, I would say we have one month of data, right? If you looked at our January results and you went to the website, you would see that for the month of January, we added about 355 million names. So January was -- I'm sorry, 355,000 names. And so it was down substantially. So we've put those actuals into our models, we've run them out, and we do think that the first half of the year will be below the first half of actual results for last year. When we look at those models today, when we run them, they indicate that those levels should return back close or near to what we did in previous quarters in the second half of the year. So closer to our 3Q and closer to 4Q of last year. Those models are dynamic. They will continue to change, but that's what we're looking at. The 2% to 4% is our view based on what we're seeing coming out of January and in our models, for the rest of the year. Obviously, as you know, you'll be able to monitor our progress from the post on our website that we update daily. And in our next quarter, we'll give you some more update based on more actual information that comes in as these different factors play out. But the 2% to 4% is our expectation for the year as we sit here today.", "D. James Bidzos", "I don't think you should read anything more into that other than it's simply based on the limited visibility based on the amount of time into the year that we are. We have a month's worth of data.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Walter Pritchard of Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just wondering if you could talk a bit about on the delta [ph] marketing expenses. It does feel like with unit growth coming down and with obviously the benefit of the price increase that you had before, that you've had on the margin side to not spend as much to get margin expansion up. I'm just wondering if that's had any -- with reduced sales and marketing spend still sort of flattish, if that's had any impact on your ability to grow the top line?", "George E. Kilguss", "Walter, if you look at total sales and marketing expense for the fiscal year, our spend was down a little bit year-over-year. You're correct there. Now part of that came because we're trying to revamp programs to make them more efficient. And we are investing, I think, more this year, at least in more international markets and more focus over there. And markets have cycles they go through. We had -- I think we had some good progress in some international and emerging markets. Right now there's a little bit of an economic headwind in the short term, but we still think that there's good growth opportunities in those markets. As one would expect, the marketing techniques we need to invest in, in those markets differ a little bit than in the U.S. But we'll continue to experiment in those opportunities in those markets. We find out what works and what doesn't work. But we firmly believe that marketing is impactful and can be impactful for increasing domain names. And we're working with the registrar community to help improve the programs that we're offering and getting feedback all the time. So I do think you'll see us continuing to invest in sales and marketing, and looking for more innovative ways to do that to drive new domain names.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. And Walter, this is Jim. I will just -- just as a reminder, I'm sure you're all aware of this, but for everybody who may not be, we, of course, exclusively sell through registrars. We don't sell directly. So for these opportunities that we speak, particularly outside the United States where .com is viewed as sort of a well-established global brand, we need to make some investments to prepare and educate the registrars there. And that's a slightly different challenge, of course, than working with English-speaking registrars here. There's just a bit of a slightly more complicated effort. They're farther away, they have their cultural and language differences, and so there is an investment required to get everybody up to speed so that the registrars are prepared to meet the demand that's there and to pursue the opportunities that are there. So we do need to do that marketing, it's important.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then, George, just a follow-up on the tax side, [indiscernible] a good portion of it for the offsetting that we did reach [ph]. Can you talk about how you're able to use the other roughly $200 million worthless stock tax credit there? Is it that the reduction is still tax-free [ph] or is there a reduction in cash tax, or over what timeframe?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, sure. So of the roughly $375 million net benefit, as you allude to, we expect to use about $167 million for the repatriation. That will leave us about $208 million. Approximately, half of that $208 million will be used to defer or offset 2013 taxable income. It'll be able to shield that net income. The balance, about $100 million, we expect to use in a normal course in 2014. So we clearly will have U.S. income next year, but we expect to be able to use about $100 million of that benefit in 2014. And we should be through that benefit at the end of next year.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then the rest just sort of stays on as the deferred tax asset [indiscernible]?", "George E. Kilguss", "So that should use up most of the usable benefit. We do have some capital losses, but we don't really see any need for them or use for them in the immediate future. So we have valuation reserved against the capital losses. But the losses that we think we can use, we absolutely have put [ph] and that's been part of the game that we're working [ph].", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Craig Nankervis at First Analyst.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "I don't recall if you spoke to your IP strategy in your prepared remarks, and I wondered if you did not -- I didn't think I heard it, but if you did not, if there has been any sort of update. Maybe we'll just start with that.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, I'm sorry. You said IP?", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Yes.", "D. James Bidzos", "I couldn't hear, I didn't know if you said IT or IP. Yes, if you're talking specifically about our patent program, I did allude to progress that we've made over the quarter, and we did make progress. We have an active program underway to evaluate and develop our plans for exploiting our rather substantial intellectual property portfolio. And I think all I can tell you at this point is that we've made progress in that effort. There's nothing beyond that, that we're ready to publicly disclose at this time. But that effort does continue and we have made progress.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Are you willing to say whether there is a specific strategy beyond the straightforward increase of patent applications? Is there a game plan beyond that activity?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I would say in general, a good approach to any strategy that's designed to exploit your intellectual property, first and foremost, of course, is the investment in developing the IP. And yes, we have done that, and yes, we will continue to do that. I think every program starts with a very careful assessment of what that portfolio is, what value it has, how it can best be exploited, how it can best serve your business interest, whatever those may be. So without getting into details of exactly where we are in that process, we're well along the evaluation process. One needs to understand what one has, match it up to their business strategy and then develop a plan to exploit it. So that's our strategy, and we're progressing down that path. So without giving any details about where we are, we're pleased with the progress we're making and moving down that strategic path. And along the way, we absolutely do continue to innovate, and the patent filings are a byproduct of that innovation where we continue to do that. We take a lot of pride in that.", "Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Am I pushing it a little much by asking, is there any likelihood that something actually happens on this front this year? Or are you not willing to speak to much of a timetable?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think it's just early to say anything at this point. We'll certainly keep you up-to-date, but this quarter's update is that we're active and we're making progress.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to get some color on just sort of the process in interacting with ICANN on these refilled [ph], entering into contract talks. And sort of what is being sort of negotiated here or what could be negotiated back and forth? And then as far as those that have -- and several has been sort of asked through your interim talks. And what percentage of those are you potentially serving as the -- or are you serving as -- going to be serving at the back-end infrastructure [ph] and -- or you already have some sort of contract in place?", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat, and I'll talk to the contracting process. And so there's a base contract that was part of the application guide that ICANN put together that everybody starts from. And there were -- some gTLD applicants were invited to contract even though there were still some issues around the name collisions and how they were going to be handled. And basically we've been waiting to see kind of what that name collision process ends up looking like before we go down a road to where we don't really know what the process is to handle them or basically work within the ICANN framework. So we've been -- so we have 9 months -- there's a 9-month process to go through the contracting process and we've been invited to do that. At the end of that 9 months, there's an opportunity to extend that negotiating contract, an additional 9 months, for a total of 18-month window to negotiate. So there's still some things that we will go to the table and ask for within those contracts. And so it could take some time. And the IDNs that we have, because of the proposed process that we put in place, it could take a bit longer because for -- since sort of we are focusing on helping IP and trademarking intellectual property, protect the brands within those IDNs, which are transliterations of .com and .net. It may take a little bit of extra time for us to do -- to get through that.", "Operator", "I'm showing [indiscernible].", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then just as far as the others that have been invited, outside of the ones that you can directly ask to talk to, how many have you already sort of established the contracts where they've been [indiscernible] to service the back-end?", "Patrick S. Kane", "As far as our back-end services, I don't think that it's really in our place right now to talk about exactly where they are in the contracting process because it is their contracting process. But as Jim said earlier, we will have some that will go live in the spring, but some will take longer.", "D. James Bidzos", "But just to avoid any confusion, the contract between those applicants and VeriSign, those contracts have been completed and been in place for quite some time.", "Patrick S. Kane", "Almost 2 years.", "D. James Bidzos", "Almost 2 years, and that's roughly 200 back-end registry services customers that are applicants. So they have to get through ICANN's process. They have signed up with us, which is the way that they met the requirements under the ICANN process to have established a registry capability by specifying VeriSign as their back-end service provider. But their contracting process or their string itself is between them and ICANN. And that will be what it is between those 2 parties.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on that line of conversation. Pat, you mentioned, to protect trademarks and the IDNs, that may take longer. I guess it was our understanding that there was that period of time that the trademark clearinghouse was supposed to do that. Are you saying that you're doing something above and beyond what the trademark clearinghouse is doing?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Yes. Essentially I haven't said that we're doing something different, and because what we're doing -- we may have talked about this in previous calls, but the idea of applying for the transliterations of .com and .net, one of the benefits of that was to protect the applicant -- or protect the registrant that has invested in .com today. So if there's a transliteration of .com in Chinese, what we have proposed to do is to make certain that only the registrant that is -- or if the registrant has already registered in .com, that they're the only one that has the opportunity to register that domain name in the transliterated version for Chinese or for Hangul or for whatever TLD that we've operated. So that's something that's unique to what we're doing within our applications. And so that's an additional protection for intellectual property and trademarks.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on a different topic, Jim, the proposed guidance has one of the smaller margin expansions that we've seen in the last couple of years, but you're not including potential revenue from the 3 sources that we've discussed. If you were to get revenue from gTLDs or IP, should we think that those would come in and potentially drive incremental margin expansion above the guidance level? Or would there be expenses associated with it, so that's still a good range to think about even if there was a higher revenue add from those sources?", "D. James Bidzos", "Sterling, I love your question. I think I can answer this one, even though it started with if. So I have consistently said over the quarters that I've been speaking with our investors that the growth areas that we're looking at, they're complex, as Pat pointed out, with respect to IDNs. They are sort of specialized in the sense that we're looking for business opportunities that leverage the investment we've made in this network. And so that, therefore, they should yield margins that are comparable to the existing business. And that's why it's taking maybe a little bit longer. We don't do quarterly press releases about new features or products. We're looking for opportunities that play on our strength, that leverage the investment we've made in a powerful global infrastructure that's reliable and high-volume transactions, high-volume registrations and ultra high-volume resolutions in the many, many tens of billions or in excess of 100 billion per day. And so in looking for those applications, by definition, they would yield margins that are, I guess, in the end, are targeted to be accretive to the margins in our business. So I think we certainly aspire to deliver those services in such a way that if there were going to be revenue, that I -- our goal is to have it not adversely impact our margins.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And last question would be, last earnings call, you talked about going into -- I don't think you wanted to call it a beta, but attach with a potential customer on a new product or service during the fourth quarter. Any update to that? Any update to when you might actually release whatever it is commercially?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I've not been quite as timely with that goal as I've sort of hinted in past quarters. And so I wish I had a little bit more I can tell you, but all I can say at this point is that we have made progress. It's an active effort, and we have made progress, and when we can share something with you, we absolutely will. So I apologize, I can't say more than that right now.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any additional or closing comments.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call.

Today's conference is being recorded. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Senior Director of Investors Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There, you will also find our first quarter 2014 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate a good start to 2014. We reported revenue of $249 million, which was 5% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $130 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 1.28 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of 128.5 million active .com and .net domain names. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus in and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business.", "As part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.4 million shares for $132 million. At the end of the first quarter, $868 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "Before I get into the first quarter results, I want to provide updates on a few areas from the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we intend to repatriate between $700 million and $800 million of cash, held by foreign subsidiaries, to the U.S. At that time, we had also indicated our expectation was that this would be done in either the second or third quarter of 2014. And I'm pleased to inform you that we now believe this repatriation will happen sooner and will be completed during the second quarter of 2014.", "During the first quarter, additional new generic top-level domains were delegated into the root zone. As you'll recall, VeriSign applied for 14 new generic top-level domains. 12 of these applications are internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. We applied for 2 IDN transliterations of .com in Chinese, both simplified and traditional Chinese, which are variants of each other. ICANN placed these 2 .com IDN applications in a string similarity contention set because they are variants, and subsequently, requested that we withdraw one of the applications until ICANN could address its policy on variance. For now, we have withdrawn our application for the transliteration of the .com IDN string in traditional Chinese.", "With the Chinese variant contention set behind us, we are now ready to engage in the negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 applications.", "Also, as an update, we do expect one of our back-end registry customers to launch their top-level domain during the second quarter. We will provide further updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers.", "On our innovation and patent programs, we do have progress updates. First, we talked about contracting for a pilot with a large firm for the use of an innovative new product service, which we have developed. The contracting for that pilot was completed earlier this year, and the pilot is underway.", "Second, there is an update on our patent program. We are beginning to receive inquiries from registry operators about using some elements of our patented registry technology. And as you may have seen, we joined with Juniper Networks in the quarter to provide multilevel optimized protection from diverse types of DDoS attacks. The new offering can provide highly scalable, always-on DDoS protection by moving mitigation from Juniper's on-premise DDoS Secure appliance to VeriSign's higher-capacity, cloud-based DDoS Protection Service. Further, VeriSign and Juniper plan to develop and promote open-source standards for communications between on-premise and cloud-based DDoS protection. No delivery dates or forecast for these activities are provided at this time, but will be announced as available.", "During the first quarter, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to begin a process to transition to the global stakeholder community its oversight of what is called the IANA functions and related root zone management functions, which, principally, include processing changes to the root zone like the addition to the root of new top-level domain names, as well as oversight of the IP address base.", "VeriSign makes changes to the root zone that are approved by NTIA, including adding new gTLDs, and then publishes the zone file as part of its Root Zone Maintainer role, which we have performed without compensation, spanning 3 decades. This function is independent from, and not related to, our contracts with ICANN to manage the .com and .net registries.", "As we stated in our March 17 news release, the announcement by NTIA does not affect VeriSign's operation of the .com and .net registries. The announcement does not impact VeriSign's .com or .net domain name business, nor impact its .com or .net revenue, or those agreements which have presumptive rights of renewal.", "I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 128.5 million, consisting of 113.2 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 4% year-over-year. In the first quarter, we added 1.28 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.6 million new gross registrations.", "In the fourth quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.2% compared with 72.9% for the fourth quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.6%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2013.", "As we discussed last quarter, while there are many factors that drive zone growth, changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactics have had a near-term moderating impact on the zone, as they are focused on increasing bundled product offerings rather than on driving domain name sales, and have been running fewer discount programs on new domains. While it's too early to say for how long or how much this factor may affect zone growth, we still see it impacting registration growth in the second quarter.", "By the way, since we discussed this during our February earnings call, we have seen some refocus by certain registers -- registrars back to customer acquisition and discount programs.", "Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, the overall renewal rate has been softer, primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first-time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors just discussed, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the second quarter of 2014 to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names, and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. I'm sorry, wrong page there. Seem to be a little out of sync.", "There we go. Sorry. Last sentence was we expect common net names added to the zone in the second quarter of 2014 to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $249 million, up 5% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $140 million, up 4.7% from $133 million in the first quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.1% compared to 56.4% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $94 million compared to $85 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 in the first quarter this year compared with $0.52 for the first quarter last year.", "As of March 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion, which included $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Liabilities totaled $3.1 billion at the quarter end. Of the $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $192 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally.", "I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full-year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $249 million for the first quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $886 million, a $30 million increase from year-end 2013. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million compared with $106 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $96 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in the expense is primarily a result of timing differences related to implementation of certain planned marketing programs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter expanded to 60.1% compared to 59.6% in the same quarter of 2013.", "Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $95 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.64 compared to $0.58 in the first quarter of 2013 and $0.65 last quarter.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. In 2014, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $50 million, which primarily relate to international taxes, including withholding tax on our intended repatriation.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 149 million shares in the first quarter compared to 150 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.3 million shares, based on the average share price during the first quarter, compared with 7.9 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.4 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $142 million for the first quarter compared to $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $150 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $130 million.", "With respect to our 2014, our full-year guidance includes updates to our revenue and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.015 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 5%. This is a change from the $1 billion to $1.02 billion, or growth rate of 4% to 6%, as given on our last earnings call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full-year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 58% and 60%, as we expect sales and marketing spend to accelerate in future quarters.", "Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $73 million and $77 million for 2014. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $50 million and $70 million, changed from the $60 million to $80 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with the first quarter of 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet, and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. During the first quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business. We have protected our business by providing over 16 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS, and this month celebrated the company's 19th year. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, and our specialized and purpose-built infrastructure. Our innovation efforts support our goals to drive profitable growth through the development of new products and services.", "And finally, we've been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our improved operating margins and delivery of value to shareholders through share repurchases during the first quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.", "We will now take your questions, and operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Jim, in your prepared remarks, you touched upon the NTIA and the transfer of the IANA contract, we still -- we heard your prepared remarks, but we still get a number of questions, people wondering, the next time that .com comes up for renewal, for example, is there any additional risk that this change would actually add in terms of any possibility that you would lose the contract?", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks for that question, Sterling. Yes, we get some questions, too. I think there's confusion because of just similar technology, but the best way I can describe it is to simply say these are entirely separate, they're entirely unrelated, and whatever plays out in NTIA's intent to exit IANA and transition this to ICANN is an entirely separate process. I know that there are some politics that swirl around it as well. But the bottom line is that the .com and .net contracts are entirely separate. They're separate agreements, they stand alone and nothing is has changed since those contracts were signed, meaning that the only we would lose those contracts is if we breach those contracts and fail to cure it. All of this activity swirling around IANA has no impact whatsoever on it. And I guess, I'm not sure how to be more clear than that, but that's the best description I can give you. So in a word, if your question is, how can all this IANA stuff impact our common net renewals, the answer is naught.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I think part of where people are coming from is, is this a sign that U.S., as a government, is relinquishing control? And if you had international stakeholders more in influenced positions with ICANN, could it somehow change what would happen to the contracting process the next time?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, the contract survived any assignment or termination. Our obligation survived, ICANN or its successors' obligations survived. So our obligation to perform and their obligation to renew if we perform all survived. So all of those politics, all of those potential changes. Also, if you watch the hearings, you saw the testimony of Larry Strickling from NTIA and Fadi Chehad\u00e9, ICANN's CEO, they both testified that there will not be a transition without appropriate safeguards. ICANN is not leaving the U.S. And so I think, those are just simply further indications that these -- that what NTIA said, that it is really transitioning what it believes is a clerical role, is the way that it sees this. So we have a long way to go while these safeguards are developed, but given that and given the standalone protected nature of all of the registry agreements, including common net, I just don't see a scenario where there's any impact on these contracts. They are completely separate.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe one last follow-up question. Looking at the .net additions to the zone and the guidance for the June quarter, from your perspective, do you think that the new gTLD program is starting to have an impact on the growth of the .com/.net zone?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well there are a lot of factors that affect the zone. They're all the things that we've been talking about for some time. Obviously, the changes that [indiscernible] for them is the changes in PPC, the law of large numbers as the zone grows and also, these behavioral changes in registrars that we've talked about. Now having said that, additionally, there are roughly 100 -- over 100 new gTLDs that are delegated into the zone, and they're accepting registrations right now, and have been pretty much for most of the first quarter, for roughly almost 3 months now. And in total, there are about 570,000 registrations in, collectively, all of the new gTLDs year-to-date. I think that information is current as of just a couple of days ago. So it's too soon to tell if any of those registrations or what part of those registrations are at the expense of a .com or a .net registration, because until we see the first renewal cycle on these new gTLDs, it's really going to be difficult to assess how much impact they might have on the .com/.net zone.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next call comes from Steve Ashley, W -- Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just maybe to follow up on Sterling's comment here regarding -- and you -- Jim, you did a very nice job with just touching on all of the things that have been impacting the pace of domain name growth, with the behavioral change of the registrar, the algorithm changes, law of large numbers, is it your hope or would it be your expectation that at some point in future, we could see the growth rate of the zone reaccelerate and get stronger? Not asking for a timeframe, just conceptually, is it possible that we could see an acceleration in growth down the road at some point?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I think what we can say and that we said last quarter, and I'll let George add some comments to this, but our models, which we have a fair amount of confidence in, were fairly good in giving us the basis for our first quarter guidance. They do show that second quarter is a little bit weaker, and they do show recovery in the third and fourth quarter. I did mention also that since February, we have seen a return to focus on new-unit acquisition and discount programs by some of the registrars. So I think it's early to tell if that's a trend. But I think, given all those -- and the fact that we did see 8.6 million gross adds during the quarter in .com and .net says that there's still very strong activity and strong registrations. So certainly, in terms of future zone growth, I'm very confident. George, did you want to add anything to that?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes. Steve, the only other commentary I would provide you is, if you recall our guidance that we gave on our last call, we talked about a zone growth of 2% to 4% in 2014. And that's still our expectation for 2013. As Jim mentioned, there are many factors that impact us inter-quarter, but in totality, we're really looking at a zone growth of between 2% and 4% for 2014.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. I guess, put another way, we're essentially see -- we're certainly not changing our full-year 2014 guidance.", "Operator", "And next is Fred Ziegel from Topeka Capital Markets.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "A question on the non-domain business, what's the status there? When are we doing? There's an awful lot of activity in DDoS, and I know you know that with Juniper, but what -- can you give us an update on kind of the products schedule in that part of the business, which I know is a small piece at the moment?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, we don't break it out separately, as you know. I don't have any updates specific to any particular product schedule. Juniper did make a detailed press release, and you can look there for indications from their perspective on this particular partnership. And I did provide the 3 updates. We did get to the signing of a pilot agreement with a large firm that we're conducting a pilot with. I did mention some activity in patents. On the Juniper thing, I think one of the interesting aspects of that particular announcement is that it's quite different and interesting, in a sense that it's a hybrid solution, and it matches both our in-cloud DDoS mitigation service and Juniper's own on-premise equipment DDoS mitigation offering. And certainly, the DDoS market is growing. It's an area where companies are very concerned, and they're making investments. So I'd look at this as an indication that 2 companies that are major players in that market are getting together to try to provide a more optimized offering against more specialized attacks. So I think at this point, the only update that we can give you is that we've partnered with someone to address what we think is a growing market. Beyond that, unfortunately, we just can't say more at this point.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Are you applying more resources, people, R&D to the non-domain part of the business, given the slowdown in net adds?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I -- let me try to answer your question this way. When we put together our plans for 2014, we baked in investments in a number of growth initiatives. And those are fully funded, and we're executing and investing in those growth initiatives. And so all of our guidance contains all of that. We don't expect to change that. So to the extent we've planned for and budgeted for growth initiatives, we are absolutely spending that money where we're making those investments. We've made our bets, we've chosen our innovation programs, we've chosen our new products and services to pursue, and we're pursuing those. And so we're staffing and funding those programs.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And as a final -- I'm sorry, Walter Pritchard from Citibank.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just on the guidance, the operating margin guidance, 58% to 60%, you're running at the high end of the range right now. You've had a history of outperforming on the margin side, and you're also talking a bit about some spending in the second half. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of that margin guide. Why shouldn't we see you sort of hold this margin at 60% through the year? And then just had a follow-up question around some of the specific spending.", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes. Sure, Walter. This is George Kilguss. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have some marketing expense that pushed into later quarters. Basically, as I've talked about, we put a little bit more rigor around evaluating some of our marketing programs. Today, we do quite a bit of marketing through registrars, and they actually give us joint marketing proposals, which we evaluate. And as we're looking at those to see if we think they're good for us driving profitable growth, we put some more rigor and analysis around those. And that has actually caused a little bit of a slip to just some of the approval of those programs. And so some of those have slipped into Q2 and subsequent quarters. I would say, approximately, about $4 million or so of spend -- we expected to spend in marketing have slipped out the first quarter. And I would say, a fair bit of that will go into the second quarter, but some have slipped to the previous quarters. So again, it's really a timing difference. We do continue to have desires to invest further in sales and marketing, and we're doing that, we're trying to do that in a measured way. And so as a result of that timing difference, we're still keeping the same guidance between 58% and 60% for the full year of non-GAAP operating margin.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it, George. And then just following up on that a little bit. On the -- it sounds like you did have some registrars get a bit more aggressive on marketing spend -- or at least, on promotional activity marketing spend. I'm assuming that's more their own -- under their own choice or their own investment. I'm wondering, as you think about deploying more marketing dollars into the field and second -- especially in the second half of the year, is that what the driver is in terms of you believing that the zone file will stabilize and improve in terms of growth? And could you just remind us of the factors you think will drive that improvement?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes. So we made comments last quarter that we saw some registrars go for more ARPU-type of activity than they did for using domain name registrations to acquire customers. And we talked about domestic and international registrars both having that tactic. As Jim mentioned, we did see -- there's still some, particularly U.S. registrars, that are still keeping out with that ARPU strategy, but we have seen some of the international registrars regroup and go back to more of trying to acquire customers using domain names as their method to do it. So more of a customer acquisition. So we have seen a little bit of a change in that behavior. We also talked in the last call that in January, we saw a little softness from emerging markets in the month of January, particularly around China. Now post-January and post our fourth quarter call, we've actually seen a pickup in some of the emerging-market activity, particularly in China. We saw February and March be relatively strong in those markets. And so we're clearly looking for those markets to continue to perform there, but again, there's a number of confluence of factors that are going on that we mentioned there. But we still believe that our zone will grow between 2% and 4% in 2014.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "We noticed that a couple of your larger registrars are running $0.99-first-year .com promotions in the recent months, and just kind of wondering if that was able to stimulate some decent level of demand in the quarter and they may be a partial offset to some of the bundling and some of the going-after-ARPU dynamics that you guys had pointed out?", "George E. Kilguss", "So Gregg, this is George. We definitely saw some of our registrars retarget domain names as a customer-acquisition vehicle. They were doing some discounting there. And I think they've seen some improved results from that. But not all registrars have adopted that. Some registrars have done variance of that where they may have to do something called retargeted or targeted price discounting, where maybe if you come back to their site multiple times, you might get a lower price, depending on your interest. But clearly, internationally, we have seen some registrars go back to discounting, and that has helped net registrations.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, George. And then just one follow-up, wondering if you happen to the number of names up for renewal in the Q2?", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, I can get that for you. So it's 27.5 million.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I'm sorry, George, I didn't catch that.", "George E. Kilguss", "27.5 million.", "Operator", "And we will take our last question from Priya Parasuraman from Wells Fargo.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Priya for Gray. I was wondering if you have any more color on the Chinese IDN transliteration, which you talked about in your prepared remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay, I'm sorry, I had trouble hearing. The very last part of your question was about the Chinese IDN?", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. I was wondering if you could provide any more color on that, and if that could be reinstated or is that temporary?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. So let me just describe what happened there. So basically, ICANN's policy was not prepared to address the situation where a single applicant had a variant. We had communications with ICANN going back over a year. Early on, they advised that we file separate applications until they sorted out their policy. They have not sorted out that policy as of this time. And so the simple way to move forward was to withdraw one and move forward with the other, which we've done. However, when they do sort out that policy, we expect that new policy to mirror their ccTLD policy, which does allow for these multiple variants. And so yes, hopefully, we will have the opportunity to reinstate and bring in the other Chinese IDN. But this, at least, allows us a way forward with the traditional Chinese IDN and it also allows us to move forward with contracting for the other 12. So for a total of 13 IDNs, transliterations of .com and .net, we are now engaging in the contracting process with ICANN. And I have Pat here as well, who's a little closer to all this. If you wanted to add anything, Pat?", "Patrick S. Kane", "The only thing that I would add, Jim, is that when we chose between the Traditional and the Simplified Chinese variant, we chose to retain the Simplified and withdraw the Traditional because the Simplified Chinese is the bigger marketplace.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. I hope that answers your question.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. During the second quarter, Jim and George will be presenting at the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom conference at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 21, in Boston. The webcast registration details for this conference will be available on the Investor Relations section of the VeriSign website. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call. Thank you, and good evening.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference.

Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; and George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There, you will also find our second quarter 2014 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "We reported revenue of $250 million, which was 4.6% higher year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including $129 million in free cash flow. The base of .com and .net active registered domain names ended the quarter at 128.9 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.", "Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. As part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 6 million shares for $300 million. On July 23, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $491 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration.", "We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. First, I'm pleased to inform you that during the second quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $741 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. Also today, we announced an increase in the annual fee for a .net domain registration per our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2015, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $6.18 to $6.79. As of the end of Q2, there were 15.2 million .net registered names.", "During the second quarter, additional new generic top-level domains were delegated into the root zone. As you recall, VeriSign began to engage in the negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 applications last quarter. We continue to move forward on our negotiations with ICANN but have no further updates at this time.", "Also, one of our back-end registry customers, new gTLD has gone into sunrise period, and additional customers have either passed pre-delegation testing or are scheduled for pre-delegation testing shortly. We will provide further updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers.", "Regarding our patent program, we continue to receive inquiries from registry operators about using some elements of our patented registry technology. We're also exploring new ways of bringing the industry together to coordinate ongoing development of registry operations.", "I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 128.9 million, consisting of 113.7 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.7% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 0.42 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.5 million new gross registrations.", "In the first quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72.6% compared with 73.2% for the first quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2014 will be approximately 71.7%. This rate compares to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2013.", "As we discussed the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive zone growth. These include search algorithm changes, changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactics and confusion from the initial rapid introduction of a large number of new top-level domains.", "Also, we have discussed in previous calls renewal rates, for the first time, renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search algorithm changes, growth in geographies of lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions and other factors.", "Last quarter, we did guide to lower net adds for Q2 and indicated an expected recovery in Q3 and Q4. This recovery appears to be on track, and we forecast third quarter 2014 net additions to the zone to be between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $250 million, up 4.6% year-over-year; and delivered GAAP operating income of $143 million, up 8.4%, from $132 million in the second quarter of 2013.", "The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 57.2% compared to 55.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $100 million compared to $87 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.55 for the second quarter last year.", "On June 30, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, which included $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Liabilities totaled $3 billion at the end of the quarter. Of the $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, $729 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally.", "I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide some additional commentary on our cash tax rate, and then discuss our 2014 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $250 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013.", "Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $9 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million compared with $99 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $98 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter expanded to 60.9% compared to 58.9% in the same quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $96 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 compared to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2013 and $0.64 last quarter.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 141 million shares in the second quarter compared to 149 million shares in the first quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 11.3 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter compared with 9.4 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 6 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $121 million for the second quarter compared to $142 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the second quarter last year. Second quarter operating cash flow was lower, primarily due to $28 million in foreign withholding tax on the repatriation completed during the second quarter. Second quarter free cash flow was $129 million.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. However, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. One of the primary reasons for this lower expected cash tax rate relates to our convertible debentures. The interest expense deduction for the income tax purposes is based on the adjusted issue price of these debentures, and the adjusted issue price grows over time due to the difference between the 8.5% interest reduction on the adjusted issue price and the cash coupon rate of 3.25% on the principal amount of the debenture compounded annually.", "The total deduction, which includes the cash coupon amount, has grown since the debentures were issued in 2007 to a deduction of $137 million in 2012, $146 million in 2013 and $77 million through the first 2 quarters of 2014. These amounts are exclusive of any contingent interest payments, which are also tax-deductible.", "We have added additional detail to our second quarter 10-Q to help you better understand the specifics of the tax benefits the company receives from these debentures.", "Additionally, our cash tax rate will benefit over the next several years from the usage of various tax attributes, including $192 million of foreign tax credits. In 2014, we now expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million, which primarily relate to international taxes, including the $28 million in foreign tax withholding on the repatriation completed during the second quarter, just mentioned.", "As a note, we have updated our non-GAAP definition to remove items that no longer appear in our financial statements, as well as to reflect the potential that we may pay contingent interest on our convertible debt debentures in the future.", "Beginning August 2000 -- beginning August 15, 2014, upside contingent interest payments under our convertible debentures may start to accrue if the upside trigger is met. The upside trigger is met if the debenture's average trading price is at least 150% of the par value during the 10 trading days before each semiannual interest period. Recently, the debentures have been trading in a range of about 150% to 155% of par. If triggered, the contingent interest would be payable February 15, 2015, for this initial semiannual period. The upside trigger is tested semiannually for the following 6 months and if the upside trigger is reached for that period, we will issue a news release detailing the amount of the contingent interest that will accrue during the relevant period.", "The semiannual upside contingent interest payment for a given period can be approximated by applying the annual rate of 50 basis points to the aggregate market value of all outstanding debentures, and dividing by 2 for that semiannual period payment amount. Non-GAAP net income will be decreased by amounts accrued, if any, during the period for contingent interest payable resulting from upside or downside triggers related to the subordinated convertible debentures.", "Our non-GAAP definition can be found in today's earnings release and on a slide in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.", "With respect to 2014, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net and capital expenditure projections.", "Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1,003,000,000 to $1,012,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4% to 5%. This is a change from the $1 billion to $1,015,000,000, as given on our last earnings call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 59% and 61%, changed from the 58% to 60% range we gave on our last call.", "Our non-GAAP interest expense and other non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $76 million and $80 million for 2014, reflecting the possibility that we may begin to accrue for the upside contingent interest expense on our convertible debentures starting in August of this year. This expense is increased from the $73 million to $77 million range, as given during our last call.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $50 million and $60 million, changed from the $50 million to $70 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q2 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we further our work to protect, grow and manage the business. One week ago today, we marked 17 continuous years of 100% availability of .com. This track record is due to the skill of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and extending our service offerings and through the development of new products and services.", "Finally, we've been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases during the second quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value-creation for our shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sterling Auty at JP Morgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One question and one follow-up. First, on the question side. We saw some news out of Google recently in terms of it looks like they're getting into the registrar business. I'm wondering if you could comment in terms of how you think that might impact the industry and maybe how it might impact your business.", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay. Sterling, thanks. This is Jim. Yes, and maybe for some of those out there who aren't aware, Google did make an announcement recently that they would -- they are actually an accredited registrar, and they announced that they would be offering a package of services, including domain names to businesses. Their stated goal was to try to get the small businesses online at a faster rate. I think they said that roughly only half of very small businesses in America have Web presences today, and that's the market that they're targeting. So I won't speak for registrars and say what it might mean for them, but I think for registries like VeriSign, this is actually good news because Google is obviously a company with a lot of market reach and is able to target businesses. They did announce this as part of their release of news that .com and .net would be among the domains that they'll be offering to these new businesses that are coming online. They'll be offering some other services as well, e-mail and some other services. But I think for us, this is good news because Google as an additional retail outlet for our products can only benefit .com and .net, as they become available to more people from a company with tremendous capability to reach those small businesses that are not yet online. So I see this as a plus for us. Now Google also has a registry and they have applied for new top-level domains. Some of those have been delegated, but I believe they've said themselves that they keep a separation between their registry and their registrar operation. So I think -- I take their announcement at face value, that they're going to bring businesses online, they're going to offer a package of services and they're going to offer popular domain names, including .com and .net. So I'm encouraged by it.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "All right, great. And then as a follow-up, George, on the tax side, a lot of moving parts there. I just want to make sure, maybe you can kind of summarize the key, real key points as we think about it. And especially wondering, you talked about accruing for the contingent interest. Is that something that -- that contingent interest payment, will that actually still be in the non-GAAP numbers or will you pro forma that out?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, thanks, Sterling. So with regard to taxes, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect our cash tax rate to be well below the 28% tax rate that we used to calculate our non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP net income. My comments really are an attempt to try to give you additional insight into some of the key drivers of that cash tax rate, the largest of which is the interest tax deduction we get from our convertible debenture. As mentioned, the deduction totaled $146 million in 2013. Now that $146 million includes the roughly $40 million of interest, the coupon interest of 3.25%. But that full amount is deductible and helps shield our U.S. tax rate. Now I gave comparative figures in the script of the year-over-year amount, so it was $137 million in 2012 deduction versus $146 million in 2013. And for the 6 months, it was about $73 million in 2013, and that grew to about $77.5 million for 2014. So this deduction continues to grow between about 6% to 7% per year, and that's really a big driver of our deduction with regard to domestic income. I also mentioned that as a result of the repatriation that we did, we were able to free up about $191 million of foreign tax credits. These tax credits will expire in -- by 2024, but we fully expect to be able to use these foreign tax credits to help offset domestic income over that period. So we really have a decent amount of domestic tax shield. And when you combine those tax attributes with our foreign tax structure, I think you'd see that we're relatively efficient from a tax perspective over the next several years.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard at Citigroup.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "This is Ken Wong for Walter. Jim, just a quick question. On the new gTLDs, those are starting to trickle out into the market, and the .net trends have been looking a little soft lately. Can you perhaps help us understand what impacts you're seeing on your business from the new gTLDs?", "D. James Bidzos", "Sure, I can expand on what I said in my prepared remarks. I talked about some impact from the confusion of the rapid delegation of new gTLDs. So I think the number as of today is over 300. I think it's over -- just over 340. So it's more than a trickle. There are very, very large number of new top-level domains that have been delegated. They've been -- the first ones appeared in very early February, and there are many of them that are available for sale. They currently have total gross registrations. They don't have any net numbers yet because they haven't been through a renewal cycle. But their total gross registrations for the roughly 6 months that new gTLDs have been for sale is just over 1.6 million, so I think that puts them right about on par with, say, .co. And just to give you some perspective, if you follow our daily adds, the data for the 23rd of July, yesterday, it's about 110,000 gross adds for common net, with about 30,000 -- over 30,000 net adds. And the data for the 22nd is almost identical, just over 110,000 gross adds that day, with over 30,000 net adds for that 1 day. So putting those in perspective, what I meant is that 342 new gTLDs over a period of 6 months is very, very rapid. And I think there is some confusion. And let me just say, first of all, we should be careful about drawing long-term conclusions until we've actually seen a renewal cycle, which we've not seen yet. But I think in the early wave, what you saw was lots of sales of premium domain names. And then in the second wave, I think you saw a lot of new TLDs offering non-premium pricing for everything. So premium pricing seemed to sort of diminish a bit. And then in the third wave, we've seen lots of top -- new top-level domains being offered essentially for free, in some cases being registered for customers in opt-out campaigns where essentially they're not even asking for them. So I think that's caused some confusion. The fact that there are plurals available. So for example, just recently, .supply and .supplies were both delegated. I think that confuses people a little bit. Should they get a registration in just one? Should they get a registration in both? Can they get a registration in both? What if the registration they're seeking is registered somewhere else with high traffic, like .com, but they can't get that? Are they going to lose a lot of traffic to it? I think these are things people are kind of trying to try a -- having some difficulty understanding. So that's what I mean by confusion. So I think that's had some -- that confusion has had some impact. I think it's mostly been in Q2. As I mentioned in my remarks, we did guide to a lower Q2, and we guided to a growing Q3. And I think the numbers I gave you for the last few days would give you an indication. For those of you that follow it, if you just simply take, for example, a straight-line method of the average daily net adds for common net for Q3, you get a number that's just under 1 million. We guided in the range of 0.6 million to 1.1 million. So I think that's generally what we see with the new gTLDs, some confusion in a very, very large number of them. We do know that a very large percentage of them, perhaps even a majority, are registered by speculators. There's a lot of speculator activity in them. So it's tough to say exactly what impact it will have on our business long term. I think the first renewal cycle will be very interesting. I think your observation about .net is an interesting question. I can't tell you exactly what the specific impact on .net is, but I would say that .net is probably more of a competitor in -- within the new gTLD community than .com, which is really sort of a well-known place where people register domain names for business. .net is as well, but I think it's probably sort of more seen in a category -- maybe even some people think of it as the new gTLD. But it does have 15.2 million registrations. It's growth has slowed a bit, but I can't tell you exactly what the various factors are for that. Maybe next quarter, we'll be able to tell you a little bit more. But that -- hopefully, that background was helpful.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "That was actually very useful. And then maybe a quick question for George. You guys bumped up the full year operating margin guide to 59% to 61%. Is there much kind of incremental marketing dollars that we might expect in the back half to pop up? Or does that get pushed out? I recall kind of in kind of Q1, there was some potential marketing that you guys thought you guys would do that might be pushed out. Has that been pushed out beyond 2014 and that's the impact on the guide? Or is that still expected to roll in this year?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, thanks for the question. We actually saw marketing expense increase quarter-over-quarter. We talked about that in Q1 that we felt we would see an acceleration, and we did. Marketing expense was about $22 million in the quarter. And we continue to have a desire to spend marketing dollars. We expect to put more dollars toward marketing. Having said that, as you've seen in this quarter and previous quarters, we actively manage our expenses. We're clearly looking at the other line items, and we're actually looking at a balance to drive profitable growth. So we're finding areas, opportunity in other areas, to help fund the marketing dollars that we're putting forth. But you should expect us to continue to have a desire to spend on the marketing front.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gray Powell at Wells Fargo.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I just had a couple. To follow up on the last one, can you give us a sense as to the key components that you spend sales and marketing dollars on? And then, how should we think social marketing -- or how should we think of the trending as you launch the new IDNs next year?", "George E. Kilguss", "You broke up a little there, at least on our end here, Gray. But I think the first part of the question was regards to where we spend our marketing dollars, and we spend it in a variety of different areas. Traditionally, at least this year, a lot of our programs have been looking to spend dollars with registrars in various markets to drive awareness of the brand, whether that be domestically or internationally. But the majority of our marketing programs, at least this year, have been with registrars. And we continually evaluate all the programs that we have in play, assessing the return on investment in. I think some of the programs have worked very, very well for us. Some of the programs, I think, we can tweak and do better on or redirect those funds. But a lot of these programs that we do, we just don't spend it on a dime from quarter-to-quarter. There's a lead time for a lot of these programs that we have to set up, sometimes almost a year in advance with the registrars to get these things laid out. So we can slow down some programs if we see a program that's not working that well or we think that we may have missed the mark and redirect it, but it takes a little while to get that back in the market directed at another program. And as far as -- I think your question was with IDNs. We're still assessing IDNs right now. We'll go through a budgeting process later this year, and I'll probably have a better sense as to what that program would look like once we go through that process.", "D. James Bidzos", "Just to add to that a bit, Gray, it's Jim. With respect to the second part of your question concerning IDNs, those IDNs that we've applied for when we get through contracting and get the delegation and actually make them available, by definition, are going to need to be marketed through registrars because they're going to be marketed in countries, of course, in the native language script. So we won't be working through domestic registrars here in the U.S., maybe their partners overseas. So clearly, we'll need to make some investment with the registrar together to prepare materials and develop marketing materials in the local native language script. One sort of interesting aspect of the IDNs that we've applied for is that they will not be subject to the same pricing restrictions that .com or.net, as a matter of fact, will be, because they'll be covered by the new Registry Agreement, and we will be allowed to price those with tremendous flexibility. The only restriction will be 6 months' notice on price changes. There won't be limits on what the price changes will be, and we'll be able to even price each of the 9 differently if we choose to. So we can price in factors that can address issues of particular marketing expenses, so we're developing those programs, but we are fortunate to have a tremendous amount of flexibility on how we market them and how we team with the registrars to work with them. So we're moving down that path. We're starting to work out those plans, but we're sort of focused on contracting with ICANN right now.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful. And then just one more, if I may, and I hope this one isn't too specific. Do you have a sense as to the percentage of .com domains that are either parked or owned by speculators? And I know you guys used to disclose it in your quarterly domain stats report. And I think the last stat I saw in 2012, was it about maybe 17% and on the decline. I was just curious if you happen to know that statistic.", "D. James Bidzos", "We don't have that number with any accuracy. I'm not sure that we -- I mean, we may have -- I'm not sure how we reported that number you're referring to. It would be speculative, anyway. I mean, I can -- it's a very difficult number to arrive at. So I'll give you one very brief example of why you have to be very careful about those numbers. I own a couple of domains, very few, just a handful. I'm not a domain speculator by any means, but I do own a couple of domains that are not active. I don't do anything with them. And I've registered 1 with 1 registrar, and I've registered 2 with a different registrar. Registrar A has a policy that allows them to park my domain because it's not active and to post ads to that. And so anybody who's out there crawling the Web, trying to assess what that domain name is would very quickly conclude, based on its characteristics, that the owner is a domain speculator. And I am absolutely not a domain speculator. The other registrar that I have domains registered through has a policy that does not allow that. And so maybe you'll get a more accurate accounting for that one. So it's very, very difficult there. Lots of individuals who have purchased domains, their family name, as in my case, or other domains, that they just aren't doing anything with at this moment. And depending on who they're registered through, they very much look like they're owned by domain speculators. So if you do see any statistics like that, I think you have to be very, very careful about them. It's a very tricky thing to assess.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; and George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There you will also find our third quarter 2014 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of that call -- of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we've discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.", "VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David. Good afternoon everyone.", "Our third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "We reported revenue of $255 million, which was 4.7% higher year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including $150 million in free cash flow. The base of .com and .net active registered domain names ended the quarter at 130 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline.", "As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.2 million shares for $226 million. At the end of the third quarter, $833 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call.", "As you recall, VeriSign began to engage in a negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 new gTLD applications, which primarily consists of transliterations of .com and .net, earlier this year. We have been in discussions with ICANN during this contracting period and have requested certain modifications to the registry agreements that would govern these new top level domains.", "As we have not yet reached a final agreement, ICANN has granted an extension of time until December 30, 2014 to execute the new agreements for all but our .verisign application, where the deadline is July 29th, 2015.", "Also in regards to our back-end registry customers' new gTLD applications, 5 of our customers' new gTLDs are now delegated into the zone. As a reminder, most of our back-end registry customers have applications for .brand gTLDs. New gTLD applications that qualified as a .brand by ICANN have the opportunity to apply for an extension to execute their registry agreement for a period which ends July 29th, 2015, and many of our customers applied for this extension.", "Finally, Richard Goshorn, our General Counsel, Senior Vice President and Secretary, has tendered his resignation effective November 14, 2014, to pursue other opportunities. Thomas Indelicarto, currently an Associate General Counsel at VeriSign, will become Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective November 14, 2014. Tom joined VeriSign in 2006 and his lengthy experience with the company in senior legal roles will ensure a seamless transition.", "Over the past several years, we have successfully refocused the company through the completion of our divestiture plan, renewed key contracts, and created process efficiencies. Rick has been an integral leader in these, as well as many other strategic initiatives. Our shareholders have been well served by the company's restructuring over the last 7 years. We thank Rick for his important contributions to helping make VeriSign the company it is today and wish him the very best.", "I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 130 million, consisting of 114.9 million for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.3% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 1.15 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.", "In the second quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 71.8% compared with 72.7% for the second quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72%. This rate compares to 72.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2013.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive zone growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity, and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies. Also as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions, as well as other factors.", "Last quarter, we indicated an expected improvement in Q3 and Q4 from the levels we experienced in Q2. This stabilization appears to be on track as we generated 1.15 million net registrations in Q3. As a result, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2014 net additions to the zone to be between 0.7 million and 1.2 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim and good afternoon everyone. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $255 million, up 4.7% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $139 million, up 5.1% from $133 million in the third quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 54.7%, compared to 54.5% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $95 million compared to $81 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.53 for the third quarter last year.", "As of September 30, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which, $599 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Liabilities totaled $3 billion at the end of the quarter.", "I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $255 million for the third quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $893 million, a $37 million increase from year end 2013. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 60.6% compared to 58.8% in the same quarter of 2013.", "Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $97 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.59 in the third quarter of 2013 and $0.68 last quarter.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 138 million shares in the third quarter compared to 141 million shares in the second quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 13.2 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter, compared with 10.5 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter repurchase activity and the weighted affect of the 4.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $168 million for the third quarter compared to $121 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $134 million in the third quarter last year. Third quarter free cash flow was $150 million.", "With respect to taxes, we continue to use a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. However, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years.", "In 2014, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million, which primarily relate to international taxes including the $28 million in foreign withholding tax on the repatriation completed during the second quarter.", "As stated in our news release from August 18, 2014, the upside trigger on our convertible debentures has been met for the 6-month interest payment period from August 15, 2014, to February 14, 2015. As a result, contingent interest of approximately $5.2 million will be paid on the February 15, 2015 for the -- for this initial semiannual period.", "With respect to our 2014, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1,006,000,000 to $1,011,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4.5%. This is a change from the $1,003,000,000 to $1,012,000,000 given on our last earnings call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.", "Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 60% and 61%, changed from the 59% to 61% range we gave during our last call.", "Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $76 million and $80 million for 2014 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. This is a change from the $50 million to $60 million range given on our last call.", "Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q3 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business. We continue to protect the business by providing over 17 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com DNS. This track record is due to the skill of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. Also, we continue to invest in the development of new products and services.", "Finally, we've been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position, and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases during the third quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Jim, the net domain name activity improved actually very nicely in Q3 after a challenging first half in terms of the 1.15 million net adds. And I know some of this is seasonality, at least relative to Q2 anyway. But is there anything else in particular that you would attribute the rebound to?", "D. James Bidzos", "I'll let George comment on that. I'll just say that I think we did forecast last quarter. We were quite clear that we believe that our data and our modeling showed that we would see a stabilization in Q3 and Q4. So I think first of all, our modeling systems are serving us well, as what we projected actually did occur. I will just comment as well that Q3 was a record for Q3 gross adds. So the business is strong. I think it's calm as a trusted brand. And I think that, that's primarily at the heart of it, but I'll let George add some comments as well.", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes sure, Gregg. As Jim mentioned, the net adds came in at 1.15 in the quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance. And gross registrations were really the reason that we got to the high end. 8.7 million was clearly up sequentially in both year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, it was the highest Q3 on record. And in gross registrations, we have really seen China continue to be a growth engine for us. China performed very, very well internationally. We also actually saw one of our large U.S. registers -- registrars -- also refocus on customer acquisition and began using discounts to acquire domain names for their customers. And so we also saw some benefit here domestically as well.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay terrific. And then looking within the TLDs, so .net is obviously much smaller than .com, but the .net names in the base did decline again, albeit very slightly this quarter. And I really wanted to get a sense of how you view this going forward. Do you think that we'll continue to see this go a bit lower? Or do you think that .net will resume growth at some point going forward?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, so look, .net zone growth has been relatively flat all year. We believe, like other gTLDs, .net is experiencing some headwinds from the launch of the new gTLD program that happened earlier this year, about February. That program, that new gTLD program, has accumulated about 2.8 million registrations so far this year. But -- so we are seeing some headwinds from that. As far as long-term, we'll give some views at our next call, but I think it really depends on how the market digests those new gTLDs. There's a number of them coming out. There is quite a bit of confusion in the marketplace, and I think it's having some effects on the industry as a total -- as a whole.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then just one last one, if I could, for Jim. Would love to hear an update on the patent portfolio and any potential new services.", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay. We haven't provided any specific updates this quarter. We continue to invest and work on the development on a number of new initiatives and we are making progress on those. But no update on those and no specific news with respect to the patent program other than it's an active program. And, of course, we're very busy and active in filing patents for our innovative inventions here.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "This is Ken Wong for Walter. On -- you mentioned some traction with your partners on gTLDs running their back-end registries. Can you give us a sense, now that you've got a few of those under your belt, how customers are going about kind of paying for that product line? Is it a fixed cost? Are you guys getting some piece of the transactional element? Help us understand how that revenue model starts to flow through.", "Patrick S. Kane", "This is Pat Kane. Depending upon the type of TLD it is, it varies. And so if it's a brand customer, it certainly is a flat fee that we do because it's small numbers of registrations. But if it's going to be a more widely distributed customer, they tend to be more minimum payments and then per-domain fees on top of that.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. So far, these early days, it's more of the flat fee variety since it's mostly the brands, right?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Well, we've only had 5 go in, so far, that are active. And since most of the ones that we have remaining are brands, we'll see most of those come online in 2015.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. And then Jim, you mentioned that you guys had reached out to ICANN to modify your contracts for the transliterations of .com/.net. Kind of what exactly are you trying to get changed? And then how does that potentially impact how you go to market with those particular domains?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I don't think there's actually time to go into the very specifics. We are in what's -- this is essentially a contract negotiation, so we are in that negotiating phase with ICANN for our IDN applications. And just to -- in addition to what Pat said, I want to say that any brands, essentially, were allowed an extension -- to seek an extension to June 29th -- or was it July 29th?", "Unknown Executive", "July.", "D. James Bidzos", "July 29, 2015. That includes our .verisign brand and, of course, that would include the brands that we're providing the back-end services for. In the case of our own non-brand IDN applications, ICANN allows up to a 9-month extension, depending on your request and the circumstances. So without going into the details of our negotiation, we were given an extension beyond the September deadline until December 30th of this year. So we have basically a little over a couple of months to complete the negotiating phase that we're in with ICANN. I think I would say that this is a contract negotiation. This is what ICANN's Board envisioned when they authorized the form of agreement and the negotiating period, so we're engaged in the process. I just don't think I can, or it doesn't make sense, and I really can't go into all of those details. But the new date is December 30th of this year.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. Okay. So look for something potentially Q1 timeframe. And I guess last thing for George, I note the G&A expense kind of ticked up a bit in Q3 and overall, I think you guys take care [ph] of the margins. Just wondering if anything we should think about there.", "George E. Kilguss", "In the G&A, nothing really jumps out to me, Ken. I mean, on a GAAP basis, we did see our stock-based compensation go up a little bit quarter-over-quarter and that's primarily because we have our annual director grants hit us in Q3. And we also use variable accounting for a portion of our performance stock units. And as the stock price is up a little over $6 in the quarter, our stock-based compensation increased a little bit as a result of that. But as far as core expenses, I mean, there were a few movements between the line items, but as I mentioned last quarter, I think you should expect that as we continue to actively manage the business.", "Operator", "And from JPMorgan, we'll go next to Sterling Auty.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to revisit, you made the comment of headwinds that gTLDs have made on the .net base. Is there any concern that you'll see enough headwinds in .com that the .com could get to the point where it's flat or declining like .net is?", "D. James Bidzos", "This is Jim. I think when George said that .net was seeing some headwinds from the confusion associated with new gTLDs, I think generally, .net may be more susceptible to that confusion that swirls around new gTLDs. We're talking about hundreds that have already been delegated into the zone and hundreds more coming. So I think there's some consumer and business confusion associated with all of those. There are many plurals and I think .net is maybe more susceptible to that aspect of the new gTLD program. As I mentioned earlier, .com is going to be celebrating its 30th year in 2015 next year. .com is and is also -- .com also enjoys the longest track record of uninterrupted DNS service, 100% uptime in excess of 17 years now. So I think .com is just a strong brand and strong -- and for that reason, it's a trusted brand. And strong, trusted brands always do well. So I think that's the slight differentiation I would point out between .com and .net, that I think .net is more likely to be -- to fall into that category of different or, in this case, new gTLDs, and possibly be more susceptible to issues surrounding the confusion, which I'm afraid may -- it's going to continue. I mean, we're seeing hundreds of more new gTLDs coming and they're coming at the rate of many every single week. So there -- that confusion is likely to get worse.", "George E. Kilguss", "And Sterling, I would just like add, I mean, .net was 15.1 million names in the zone versus 15.2 million names. I mean, it's been relatively flat. And so I actually think .net has held up pretty well over the year with all these new names coming on, bringing new names confusion. So I don't view .net's performance as anything negative. I just think it hasn't maybe grown as much or it's been a little flattish just because of the comments Jim was talking about, about the name confusion.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes. Again, .com is a strong brand for the reason of trust, security and stability. I would just point out again that this was the largest net new add -- sorry, largest gross adds in Q3 on record. And this is -- now, we're almost a year into the launch of hundreds of new gTLDs. I think that just points out what the security and stability of .com and the trusted brand of .com represent.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got you, got you. And now, looking at the guidance that you gave for name additions for the fourth quarter, how much of that is expectation of continued good gross additions on the top versus improved renewal rates? And maybe a comment on how you see the quarter has started. I think it's probably a little bit slower than last year, but obviously, we're at a different point this year, I think, in terms of cycle.", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, Sterling. So I mean, we guided 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations for the quarter. You did mention that we're out to a little bit of a slow pace in the month of October, but what you have to keep in mind or what I would like to let you know is that there was a -- there's a national Chinese holiday called National Day, which happens the 1st week of October. So as China becomes a larger part of our domain name business, it tends to impact seasonally a little bit more in the months when these holidays occur. So that happened for 7 days in the first month of October and slowed additions a little bit during that time. So we'll see what the zone does. You and I will see it as it's printed on the website. But if you even took where we were today and annualized it, you'd come to the low end of guidance even with that holiday in there. So we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we've articulated there.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got you. Last -- [indiscernible]", "D. James Bidzos", "Sorry, if I could just add something, this is Jim. I think another thing to consider with respect to the renewal rate, which you mentioned as well, is that at 72%, which I described in my opening remarks, the renewal rate has ranged between 70% and 74% for the last 5 years. And so we're dead center in the middle of that range.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No. All right, that made sense. Last question is, maybe I didn't really hear a lot of color on the non-naming business, so the other areas. Any particular comments that you could give in terms of how it performed in the quarter? Any changes in outlook?", "D. James Bidzos", "There's no update -- there's no news that we're actually delivering this quarter other than to say that we're -- if you're referring specifically to the NIA business, we're pleased with the development there, but of course, we're not calling that out separately. And we are aggressively pursuing a number of initiatives in which we are making progress, but there's just no update this quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel with Topeka Capital Markets.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "As I understand it, ICANN for their fiscal '15 budget was originally using something in excess of 30 million new gTLDs. That number, apparently, is now 15 million and most people think that number is way too high. So does that all tie back to confusion, contracting? Are people deciding to just move back to .com? Or what dynamics are at work in that?", "Patrick S. Kane", "Fred, this is Pat. What I would start off with, as far as the projections go, you're probably best off asking ICANN or better yet, maybe the registrars that actually sell the domains as to what they're thinking. But as Jim mentioned earlier, it's quite possible, and we believe, and we've -- and I've certainly seen written many times that there is additional confusion in the space, whether you have singles, plurals, who's going to buy what in terms of the different areas, what the communities look like, et cetera, and what still has to come out. So I think that there is some confusion. And I think, as Jim pointed out, with all these domains, the TLD that roll out every week, you'll see more and more confusion, I believe.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, I'll turn the call back to you, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call.

Any unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call.", "With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings release.", "At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were in line with our objective of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "During 2014, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.010 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $568 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 60.2%.", "Exceeding $1 billion marks a significant growth and an important milestone since the completion of our divestiture program in 2010, a year in which we reported $681 million in revenues.", "Operationally, 2014 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 34 million new domain name registrations and finished the year with 130.6 million names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and .net domain name systems.", "As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3.7 million shares for $209 million.", "During the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares for $867 million.", "Effective January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $453 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration.", "Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.", "Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "As you recall, one way VeriSign participated in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of .com and .net, as well as .verisign and .comsec. We have signed the registry agreements for. comsec and 11 IDN TLDs, 8 of which are transliterations of .com and 3 are transliterations of .net.", "While these registry agreements with ICANN are signed before these domains become generally available, a few more steps remain, including delegation; controlled interruption, which deals with potential name collisions; completion of a Sunrise period; and finalization and approval of our launch plans. The failure to gain approval, if required, could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs.", "I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 130.6 million, consisting of 115.6 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 2.7% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 0.59 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new gross registrations. In a few moments, George will discuss an update we intend to make to our definition of the domain name base, which will start with the first quarter of 2015.", "In the third quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72% compared with 72.7% for the third quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies.", "Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first-time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions as well as other factors.", "Net name additions during the fourth quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to fewer gross additions. Some of the gross additions strength we saw during the third quarter, which was coming from emerging markets, including China, did not continue the same -- at the same growth rate during the fourth quarter.", "Based on these factors and current trends, we are forecasting first quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.", "During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $256 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $142 million, up 9% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.6% compared to 53% in the same quarter a year ago.", "GAAP net income totaled $65 million compared to $292 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.94 in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimates for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014.", "As described, last year, fourth quarter 2013 GAAP results included tax benefits, pretax nonoperating gains and expenses, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45.", "As of December 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $486 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally.", "Total liabilities were $3 billion at the quarter end, down from $3.1 billion a year ago.", "I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $256 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. 2014 full year revenue was $1.010 billion up 4.7% from full year 2013 revenues. Deferred revenue at year-end 2014 totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $106 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 59.4% compared to 56.9% in the same quarter of 2013.", "Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin was 60.2%.", "Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.70 last quarter.", "Full year 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.72, a 13% increase over 2013. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2014 was a $77 million expense.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 135.9 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 138.1 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 13.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of 3.7 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $170 million for the fourth quarter compared to $168 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the fourth quarter last year.", "Full year 2014 operating cash flow was $601 million compared with $579 million for 2013.", "Fourth quarter free cash flow was $159 million, including a use of $9 million in capital expenditures.", "Free cash flow for 2014 was $568 million, including a net $6 million of excess tax benefits and a use of $39 million in capital expenditures.", "With respect to taxes, we used a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share during 2014. As we continue to optimize our tax structure, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share going forward is 26%. As a result, we expect to use a 26% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2015 non-GAAP results.", "Also, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to say stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.", "As Jim mentioned, I want to note a change we'll be making to our domain name base definition and reporting starting next quarter.", "Currently, we report our domain name base to you both on our website and during earnings each quarter. The domain name base includes the active zone, which is defined as the names that resolve in the zone plus the names that are requested to be not configured for use in the top-level domain zone filed by the registrant. Historically, there has also been an immaterial portion of names that we manage and for which we are paid that are not included in our domain name base definition. These names get removed from the active zone primarily by registrars when they place the name on hold status.", "Over the last several years, the average amount of names in the on-hold status category has been approximately 400,000 names and the net change year-over-year has been very small.", "While still immaterial, during 2014, we saw an increase in the amount of names registrars have placed on hold status, which appears to be a result of these registrars complying with the new mandated compliance mechanisms in ICANN's 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement or RAA.", "In 2014, we saw an increase in domain names placed on hold status from roughly 394,000 names at the end of 2013 to about 870,000 at the end of 2014.", "While the number of these names in total is not material to our overall domain name base of over 130.6 million domain names, as registrars use of this mechanism has increased, we believe it now makes sense to include these names when we report the number of domain names in the domain name base.", "As we are paid for these on-hold names and they have always been included in our reported revenue and gross additions, starting with our first quarter 2015 report, we plan to amend our current definition of our domain name base to include these on-hold status names and we'll be consistent in our reporting of prior periods by also including these names for comparative purposes going forward.", "Before our next earnings call, we intend to update the daily reporting on our website to included these names.", "In the meantime, updates to the domain name base are still posted on our website per our current definition at least once per day allowing you to continue to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.", "The Q1 net addition guidance Jim gave earlier of 1 million to 1.5 million net name additions is not affected by this new domain name base definition as our quarterly guidance is focused on gross additions and deletions.", "With respect to full year 2015 guidance. Revenue for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $1.040 billion to $1.060 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is based on domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 60% and 62%.", "Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures.", "Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million.", "Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2014. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, George. During the last year, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We continue to protect the business by providing more than 17 continuous years of 100% availability of the com and net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. Also, I want to highlight that this quarter marks the 30th anniversaries of both .com and .net. We're proud to be the registry operator of these 2 top-level domains, which are a key component of the Internet's infrastructure.", "We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. While we continue to actively invest in the development of new products and services where we continue to make progress, we don't have an update at this time.", "Finally, we have been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, returning $867 million to shareholders, and repatriated $741 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries.", "We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple if I may. George, you mentioned the hold status names in your prepared remarks. Can you give us a better sense as to what exactly that means and the impact on the zone files? I just want to make sure that I understand that correctly when doing my daily tracking.", "George E. Kilguss", "Sure, I'd be happy to, Gray. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, names in an on-hold status have always been reported in our revenues and gross additions. So these are not new names. They just haven't been included in our domain name base definition. So as a result, they've not been included in the total 130.6 million name count. On-hold names are a simply management mechanism used primarily by registrars to place names into a hold status, which removes them from the active zone file and prevent them from resolving. The name, however, is still registered by the registrar regardless of the status. Now these names represent a very small and nonmaterial portion of the domain name base, approximately 400,000 at the start of 2014, and their totals have been relatively constant for many years. I'd also add, however, that registrars use this mechanism -- use of this mechanism has increased during 2014, and as a result, we feel it appropriate to amend our definition to include these names going forward. As mentioned at the end of 2014, the names classified with a hold designation totaled about 870,000, which was an increase of about 470,000 -- 475,000 in 2014, up from 394,000 at the end of 2013. Again, it's a very minor point, but we just want to provide the additional transparency and felt the definitional change would really help in this instance.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense, I think. And so I guess, like one day you'll include it in the zone files that we see in your website and it'll look like you added 870,000 names in one day or something like that, but the reality would just be it's a definitional change, is that correct?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, just the base is going up. And as I mentioned, this doesn't affect our guidance as we're trying to guide to gross name additions and deletions. It's just a base that's going up. We get paid for these names, they're in our revenue and it's a small amount, but we felt the additional transparency made sense as registrars' use of these things had increased over the past 12 months.", "Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And last question, if I may. I know it's kind of tough to call out monthly trends in terms of domain name adds, but we noticed a fairly meaningful slowdown in December and then things really picked up significantly in January. I think you're tracking to, I think, it looks like 650,000 adds so far in the last 35 days. Can you just kind of give us a sense as to what happened there and what the main drivers are?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, sure. So I think what you're seeing in the first month in bit -- a little bit in 2015 really relates to the Chinese New Year. Last year, the new year started, I believe, January 31. This year, it doesn't start till February 19, so it's about 20 years -- 20 days late. And we typically see the activity slow a little bit about a week before the Chinese New Year. So we've just had a good constant demand for domains in the month-to-date period, but we expect it to fall off a little bit as the Chinese New Year kicks in later this month.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "George, Q4 operating margins came in lower than industry is expecting and operating margins for the year effectively came in at the low end of your guidance. Was there anything relating to fourth quarter expenses that you would call out?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes. Sure, Gregg. So if you looked at our total non-GAAP operating expense, it actually was -- for the fourth quarter, actually it was down year-over-year, but it was up sequentially by about $3.4 million. And we saw that increase really come primarily in G&A. We saw that being up about $2.4 million and G&A was up in the quarter primarily because we had about $1 million of severance expense in the quarter. And then we have about another $1 million of, what I would call, seasonal fourth quarter expenses that hit us, some of which were related to higher consulting expenses as we approached the year-end. The other increase we had was in R&D, and as far as R&D goes, we saw a slight decrease in the amount of labor that we actually capitalized on the balance sheet. And as a result of that lower amount of capitalization, some of that flowed into the income statement and that was the majority of the increase in the R&D expense.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Jim, wanted to ask, just because we've seen sort of ongoing sluggishness with .net, if you had an updated perspective there. Do you see risk of a secular decline from new gTLDs? Or do think that .net will resume growth going forward?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, .net is a well-established brand, it's 30 years old. It did dip below 15 million registrations, but it's back over that. I would just point out that, in 2014, .net had 3.6 million gross registrations. And as of the end of December, at the end of the year, that's roughly the same as the total number of registrations in all of the new gTLDs combined. So it's a strong brand, it's been around for 30 years, it's going to be around for the next 30 years. I mentioned on the last call and I think it's still true that there is some confusion with the .net is suffering from, that this -- the 400-plus new gTLDs that are out and available today are sort of bringing some confusion. There are hundreds more that are coming, so I think that will probably continue. But net is a strong brand, 30 years old, well-respected, 3.6 million gross adds last year, 800,000 adds last quarter, so it's going to be around for a while and it will do well.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And if I could just ask one, one last one, also on this topic and I appreciate the update earlier on the transliteration front. But just kind of more, if you had any broader thoughts, on new gTLDs and specifically their overall impact to VeriSign's financials going forward, that would be helpful.", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I think a specific answer with respect to the financials, I think, is a bit difficult. But in general, I would like Pat to make some comments about new gTLDs. Pat?", "Patrick S. Kane", "So the new gTLDs, I think the story is still out on the success of them. If you take a look at the 400 -- the 400-plus TLDs that are in existence today, at the end of 2014, there were 3.7 million registrations in those 400-plus TLDs. But one of the things in terms of identifying whether they'll be successful or not is really what the renewal rate is and we're just now going to see the beginning of a renewal cycle for this new gTLDs. And the second thing that we take a look at is what does the DNS traffic look like. And so if you think about the com, net DNS base today, we do about 82 billion transactions a day and we don't have any idea what those same transactions would look like for the new gTLDs, but that would be another indicator of success. So it's still -- time will still tell.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "You commented on some slowdown in the month of December in China then obviously you commented on, actually, China contributing to what was a strong start in January. When you kind of contemplated your guidance for domain names for this year and you kind of think about it, I guess, geographically, did anything sort of jump out to you as you kind of built this? Any sort of change that you've seen over the course of the year? Or as you contemplated 2015 or any kind of reversal of a trend that you may be did see, just any sort of color from a geographic perspective would be great on the guidance.", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, sure, Phil, this is George. So as we talked about Q4, we did continue to see growth in emerging markets, but it just wasn't as robust as we had seen exiting Q3 and so that trend waned a little bit. But they still grew. I think, in general, I think by definition, emerging markets they have their ups and downs, they do have some volatility there in their definition of being emerging. But we're still seeing a lot of growth there. More specifically, we still see good activity in China, we still see good activity in India and in Asia Pac. We're still seeing very strong and good demand for the products there and that's where most of the growth is going on internationally. So the U.S. market is a little bit more tepid in regard to that.", "Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then just one quick follow-up question on the capitalization of R&D. You said it was a little lower this quarter, so therefore expense is higher. When you contemplated your margin guidance for '15 here, what kind of assumption did you make of sort of capitalization versus the levels that you saw in '14?", "George E. Kilguss", "We expect it to be similar to last year. But again, there are small movements. Fourth quarter I think was about 0.5 million, so it really depends on the projects that we're looking for, what stage those projects are in and if we actually have some products that are coming to market and we're actually developing new functionality, then we'll capitalize that further, the regulations in GAAP. But it really depends on the projects that we're working on, what stage those projects are in and we'll just treat it according to the GAAP regulations as to what get capitalized or not.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "This is Ken Wong for Walter. So Jim, in terms -- Q1 being seasonally strongest quarter on domain add, just wondering what you guys are hearing or seeing from your registrar partners in terms of their approach to domains, in .com, in particular? And then also have you guys planned to do anything kind of unique to try to drive activity here?", "D. James Bidzos", "So first of all, with respect to what registrars may be doing differently. A couple of -- for the last couple of quarters at least, we talked about a shift in registrar marketing tactics where they were looking for increasing ARPU and then a shift back, which gave us some uplift over the last couple of quarters. So I think we continue to see that, which has helped us. As far as commenting on -- I'm sorry, not new gTLDs, but in terms of what we may do in promotion, we constantly run regular programs of promotion with the registrars. We use marketing programs to try to drive resources geographically and through other means. We did recently launch a contest for .com names and a number of other promotions that we're doing. We'll be doing a number of things through the year in recognition of the 30th anniversary of .com, in particular. But I think the best thing that we do is just simply highlight the brand and the widespread adoption of .com. I think if you watched the Super Bowl, for example, I think, pretty much everybody who advertised is branded .com. It's just a strong powerful brand and we do have the benefit of endorsements from every company that brands itself that way.", "George E. Kilguss", "We also try to move dollars around or invest heavily or more heavy in those markets that we think are growing faster and we think we can gain a competitive advantage. And so we take a careful analysis at all the markets we look at and we make very strong decisions and base decisions as to which markets to go into, to drive growth based on our budget expectations. And so clearly, we're investing internationally in a lot of the growth markets that we talked about.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got you. And then, George, on the margin guidance, so kind of 60% to 62%, some decent uptick there even in the face of kind of slowing revenue. Which line items would you say you guys are going to be able to extract the most incremental margin from?", "George E. Kilguss", "So we don't give guidance, Ken, to each individual line item. When you take a look at our K, you'll see that our expectation is that they should be relatively consistent as a percent of revenue to what they are currently. But having said that, we're continuing to actively manage the business, and we always look for opportunities to continue to create efficiencies in the business. And as opportunities present themselves, we look to reinvest in the business as well. I don't think our strategic objectives have changed in the sense that we clearly have a desire to spend more in sales and marketing to drive top line growth and we clearly have a desire to invest in new products and technology that we think can drive positive returns for the company. And so we'll clearly look to invest in those areas and look for savings opportunities in other areas of the business to help fund those opportunities.", "D. James Bidzos", "And if I could just add something, sorry, to the answer I gave you earlier to your question about com, in particular. I'm just reminded that, earlier today, there was a new record sale in the aftermarket of a .com domain, 360.com sold for just under $17 million. And I think if you've seen -- if you look at the history of some of these aftermarket sales of .com, we had dailymail.com sell for GBP 1 million last year. Z.com sold in a private sale without auction for $6.8 million a few months ago to a Japanese company. We had a porno.com [ph] sold for $8.888 million and 360.com was sold to, I believe, a Chinese company, like I said, for $17 million, that's a new record. It's an incredible statement about the value of the .com brand. I think Daily Mail is a good example because here you don't have -- it's not a single character. It wasn't -- it was purchased because the company had made such an investment in developing its brand in .com that it simply wanted -- sorry, in the U.K. domain that it owned that it wanted the .com equivalent and I think that just simply represents the value of a .com name. 360.com for $17 million, a record that, I think, just says a lot about the value of the brand.", "Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes, clearly, the brand still remains kind of the top-selling position for domains. I originally thought there's going to be [indiscernible] that bought it and I quickly [indiscernible].", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On the transliteration and new gTLD for your guys, the timing of those 11 transliterations, you mentioned the phases that you have to go through. Can you maybe put some general time ranges? Would you anticipate that these would be in the market more generally in the first half of the year or is it second half of the year?", "Patrick S. Kane", "So this is Pat, Sterling. I think it's really hard to tell because we are going to do -- we're going to ask for a modified Sunrise period and that will likely have to require approval from ICANN. We're not certain of that right now, but that's still going to take some time to get that and going as well as the Sunrise period and then the controlled interruption period for the identification of name collisions is also a long period. So it's hard to say right now as to what the exact time would be.", "George E. Kilguss", "And Sterling, this is George. As we mentioned last quarter, many of our back-end registry customers qualify as .Brand gTLDs and ICANN gave .Brand applicants until July of this year to finish the agreement process. So I think your back half is much more likely than the front half of the year.", "Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. And could you give us a sense of when those launch in the marketplace, what kind of marketing spend or investment generally are you anticipating to drive those new IDNs into the marketplace?", "D. James Bidzos", "I think that's tough to say, Sterling, this is Jim. The marketing plan that Pat alluded to that's a little different with different Sunrise period, during the Sunrise period, trademark holders are invited to come in and register their marked names prior to general availability. We have what you might call a much more brand-friendly sort of Sunrise in the sense that we are reserving the transliteration of the brands that are registered in .com. And so that implies that there'll be a different marketing approach. We'll simply be notifying existing registrants brands that the transliteration of their .com registration is available to them. So it's hard to say, it's not a traditional sort of a marketing effort. I think, in general, it means that we're not going to need to go out and promote the availability of these IDNs, although we'll certainly do some of that because people are free to register whatever they like in them. But the brand holders who are registered in .com have their brand name reserved for them in the IDNs. They're protected against somebody else registering a name who doesn't own that name. But it's an opportunity for them to have their brand name in the native language script of countries that they operate in. So I think you can see the obvious benefits of that. Putting a price tag on that marketing effort, I think, is - it's just kind of too early to say what it will be. But it'll be focused. It'll be more focused because it's quite targeted. It's unique, I think, as far as any TLD that's ever been launched.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "In terms of -- you talked about putting -- registrars putting the names on hold. Why do registrars put names on hold?", "D. James Bidzos", "Pat, you want to go ahead?", "Patrick S. Kane", "So there are several reasons. One of the most common is that you will get a court order that would ask to put something on hold while it's in dispute. People will also have domains that they don't want to have in the general zone, so that they can have the name registered, but not able to resolve. It may be something detrimental to their corporate brand and they don't want it to be out there. And then the one that we've seen most recently is the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires registrars to put on hold domain names that they cannot validate the who-is information. And so that's where we've seen the largest trend these days in terms of what the growth is in those particular hold names. Now once they do validate the who-is data, those names will come out of the hold status and then, of course, be active at that point in time.", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, let me just let me just add a couple of quick comments to that. If you're familiar with the so-called dark domains, these are the nonconfigured names where the registrant does not want it to resolve, for example, something that is not flattering about a corporate name. A corporation may defensively register that and they simply don't want it to resolve. We get paid for it, but it doesn't appear in the act -- it does not appear in the active zone. You can think of these hold names, we're going to treat them all together with these dark domains very similarly. So we'll get paid for them, but you'll see them reported in our domain name base, they'll be counted in there. The other thing is that George had mentioned this new 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement. This is the new agreement that the registrars signed with ICANN that they operate under. Now the number of accredited registrars is, I think, closer to 1,500 today where it was 900 some years ago. So I think -- I hope what we're seeing here, just to keep everything simple, is that all of them have pretty much signed this during 2014. And I think almost all of the registrars have signed it, a large number of them. So I think there's just this initial sort of compliance effort. Pat mentioned that they have to collect who-is data. This also means that some registrars that do not have direct distribution models, who actually sell indirectly through distributions, may find it a little more difficult or may find that it takes more time to collect accurate who-is data. And so these names will get put on hold while they go about doing that and then eventually they come off hold and then they're up here in the active zone. So that's sort of the activity that goes on. But if you understand how dark domains have worked and been counted, these are just like that. You can now think of these names on hold just like that.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And just real quickly, George, do you -- can you remind me, do you sell globally in U.S. dollars?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, for com and net, the majority of our products we sell in U.S. dollars. So if you're referring to the FX impact in the traditional sense, we don't expect that to have an immediate or impact in our 2015 revenue. That being said, for some non-U.S. buyers of domain names, the strength of the U.S. dollar could create a perceived price increase, which could have an impact on demand. But while the strength of the U.S. dollar may be having some effect on demand, we really haven't seen that in any of our numbers, so it hasn't really been an impact for us to date.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. And just to go back and you may have already given this in the past, but the renewal rates today lower than they were a year ago, 2 years ago. Is that true in every country? Or are some countries more pronounced than others?", "George E. Kilguss", "Yes, renewal rates vary by country. Typically, in the more mature markets, the renewal rates are higher. In some of the emerging rates, the renewal rates tend to be a little bit lower.", "Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right. But my question is change. If we look at markets a year ago and today, which have seen the most change?", "George E. Kilguss", "So we don't break it out by market. I mean, if you -- and if you want to talk about change, I mean, the first-time renewal rate at the end of 2013 was about 52.8% and the first-time renewal rate did come down to about 50.7% for the full year 2014. Previous-renewed rates were very consistent at about 82%. And so we did see some of the first-time renewal rates come down and I think more of that is a function of the growth we're seeing in China, which has typically lower first-time renewal rate than the U.S., which is our largest market now. Again, that's an emerging market. As those markets mature, I would expect those renewal rates to improve, but it's a large market that's growing and is still emerging. And so it's just becoming a larger portion of the base and so you get a weighted average effect on the first-time renewal rate.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. David Atchley for any final remarks or comments.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President and CEO", "George Kilguss - SVP and CFO", "Analysts", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Company", "Operator", "Good day, everyone, welcome to the VeriSign's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. An unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley ", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's First Quarter and 2015 Earnings Call.", "With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, at www.verisigninc.com. There you will also find our first quarter 2015 earnings release.", "At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "We reported revenue of 258 million up 3.9% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance including 126 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the first quarter and had a 1.51 million net new names ending with 133 million dotcom and dotnet domain names in the domain name base. ", "Our financial position is strong with 1.9 billion in cash, cash-equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.7 million shares for 160 million as of March 31st 2015 we have 917 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no exploration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. ", "I'll comment now on a few recent events. In March I was pleased to announce the appointment of Todd Strubbe as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Todd joined us just this week and we are delighted to have him on the team. Also in March we completed the issuance of our 10 year $500 million senior unsecured notes with the five and quarter percent coupon. We're pleased with the results of this issuance which further enhances our capital structure. ", "Finally, as you may recall one way VeriSign has been participating in [Indiscernible] program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of dotcom and dotnet. As mentioned during the last earnings call we have side 11 IBM TLP registry agreements and are seeking a modified sunrise period from [Indiscernible] since we spoke to you last quarter we have submitted our request for this modified sunrise period and our waiting response from [my kin]. The failure to gain approval could delay of general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go to market strategy for the IDMs. ", "I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March the domain base in dotcom and dotnet was 133 million consisting of 117.9 million names for dotcom and 15.1 million names for dotnet. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the first quarter we added 1.51 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations. In the fourth quarter of 2014 the renewal rate was 72.5% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2013. ", "While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.5% this rate compares favorably to 72.6% achieved in the first quarter of 2014. As we discussed over the last few quarters there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include internet adoption, economic and ecommerce activity and registrar go to market strategies. Based on these and other factors we are forecasting second quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. 2015 will mark the third year in a row where the second quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter from a net additions perspective. Q2 has been our lowest quarter as deletions are historically at their seasonal high point in Q2. We believe this is seasonal gross additions are typically at their high point in Q1 and most registrars take advantage of our 45 days grace period after expiry to delete domain which fall into the second quarter.", "Similar to last year, we expect 7.5, 2015 net additions to increase relative to Q2's expected performance. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our Web site at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names as we discussed during the last earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of 258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of 144 million, up 3% from 140 million in the first quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.8% compared to 56.1% in the same quarter a year ago.", "GAAP net income totaled 88 million compared to 94 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.64 for the first quarter of last year.", "During the first quarter, the Company continued to manage its capital structure through the issuance of its 500 million 10-year senior secured notes offering. The notes which are not callable mature in 2025 and bare a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. In addition, the Company also entered into a new five year 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2020, which takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility.", "The Company had no borrowings under this facility at the end of the quarter. The first quarter ending balance sheet reflects the March 2015 issuance of the 500 million senior secured notes due 2025.", "As of March 31, 2015, the Company maintained total assets of 2.6 billion. These assets included 1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which 901 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were 3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from 3 billion at the end of 2014.", "I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $258 million for the first quarter, 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of first quarter totaled 925 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2014. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes 10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2014 and compared with $99 million in the same quarter a year ago, non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 59.7% compared to 60.1% in the same quarter of 2014.", "Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 compared using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.8 million shares. This compares to $0.64 in the first quarter of 2014 and $0.70 last quarter using 148.6 million and 135.9 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.", "Operating cash flow was 133 million for the first quarter compared to 170 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 142 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was 126 million, including 6 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and reduced by 13 million in capital expenditures.", "With respect to taxes, as we noted in our last earnings call starting with the first quarter of 2015, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Also as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used our non-GAAP calculations for at least for the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.", "With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.043 billion to $1.057 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is changed from the 1.40 billion to 1.60 billion given on our last call. This revenue range still assumes a domain name based growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. ", "Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be in expense of between 104 million to 110 million changed from between 84 and 90 million for 2015 and reflects the interest expense as a new bond issue. Capital expenditures to the year are still expected to be between 40 million and 50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business an addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. ", "In summary, the company continue to demonstrate solid financial performance in the first quarter. We have growing non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income we have maintain the strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. ", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. During the first quarter we further our work to protect grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We continue to protect the business by providing more than 17 continues years of 100% availability of the dotcom and dotnet DNS. This previous record is due to the expertise of our people in our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. We continue to actively invest in the development of new products, technology and services. ", "Finally we've been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved capital structure and through the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long term value creation for our shareholders. ", "We'll now take your questions. Operator we are ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Will take our first question from Steven Ashley with Robert W. Baird. ", "Steven Ashley ", "I guess first of all I was going to ask about the [position with icon] for the modified sunrise period has not got response back yet is there any anymore color you can provide has there been a dialogue are you are aware of the situation or is there any color you can provide around that?", "D. James Bidzos", "The only update that we have at this point is that we've taken a step of filling the [RCEP] it's a common practice it's a normal method available to anybody who wants to modify registry service and so we've employed it. At this point I cannot make this evaluation and respond so we are waiting for that response but we just submitted it recently in this quarter.", "Steven Ashley ", "Perfect. And just lastly from me the renewal rate again the estimate for the first quarter looks to show some improvement and I wonder if there was some color around that?", "George Kilguss", "Sure. Steve this is George Kilgus. So, as we mentioned our fourth quarter filed renewal rate came in at 72.5% versus the year ago period of 72.2% so slightly up in the fourth quarter and our preliminary first quarter renewal rate is expected to be 73.5% which is about 90 basis points from 72.6% in the year ago period we're seeing that improvement come from both first time renewing names as well as previously renewed names and we're pleased with that result. ", "As far as what that data point for future renewal rates I think it's a bit early to speculate there but we'll keep an eye on it and report that got to you next quarter when we have some additional information. ", "As far as renewal rates between international and domestic geographies, what I can tell you is that in the Q1 preliminary number we saw increases in both domestic and international first time renewing rates and then improvement in international rates for previously renewed names. Domestic previously renewed renewal rates were relatively flat in the first quarter, again the renewal rate is preliminary, we will give you the final rate in next call but we're pleased to see that renewal rate has increased in the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And will take our question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Unverified Analyst", "Hey, guys. This is [Indiscernible] for Walter. This first question for maybe Jim or Pat if you are there you guys hit the high end of your range on the zone file in Q1 and I guess the early trend in Q2 looks like a little bit more average [Indiscernible] counts about 50,000 net as it. Any activity in Q1 that you think you guys might have done to maybe go forward or is it really just the seasonal trend shifting away from Q2?", "D. James Bidzos", "Well first of all Q1 was a strong quarter but I think that's just simply due to fundamental demand for the strong dotcom brand and the growth that we've alluded to in the past particularly in Asia. So I think basically strong underline drivers, strong demand for quality names, there could some other or less factors that affected but I think that's it predominately. There is some seasonality in Q2 that will drive this growth, but our models and our forecasts and our guidance of course are the only comments we'll make about Q2.", "George Kilguss", "Ken, this is George Kilguss, I would agree that we're very similar to last year at this point in time, we\u2019re a little slow out of the gate. I think the website you're correct it's about 60,000 names and we're about 30,000 names light from last quarter, but as Jim mentioned in call because we have more gross adds in the first quarter in that 45 day grace period for deletions we tend to get more deletions in the second quarter and we tend to get actually more of them in April than any other month in the second quarter, so that's affecting I think the quarter-to-date or the month-to-date number that you\u2019ve seen today, but as we've mentioned we still believe that the growth rate for the domain name base this year will be between 2% and 3.5% and we believe will fall within our guidance that we gave 300,000 names for the second quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got you and then George maybe on the OpEx lines, sales and marketing and G&A were both roughly flat sequentially. I think historically it trends down from Q4 just wondering if there was anything you need to call out in terms of how you guys are spending in Q1?", "George Kilguss", "Yes, so you're absolutely right we were flat for OpEx sequentially, but year-over-year Q1 to Q1 we were up about $5 million. The year-over-year increases were primarily in marketing and G&A as you point out. In marketing, we have increased programmatic spend in Q1 of this year relative to the last year by about 2.5 million as we pushed out some of our marketing programs earlier in the year as compared to last year so that's really more of a timing issue. ", "On the G&A front, we were up about $3 million from the year ago period and the majority of that increase approximately 2 million was the result of a onetime non-income related tax accrual that we made in the quarter, but as we talked about again on the call or our prepared remarks we still expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin to be between 60% and 62% for the full year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay so that G&A we should I mean all things equal that should step down by 2 million in the June quarter?", "George Kilguss", "We expect that it should come down slightly from Q1, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz", "I just have follow-on to Steve's question; I know you still kind of parsing the data somewhat, but on the renewal rate because it really has been ticking up nicely and this quarter in particularly I saw a significant jump, I am just kind of wondering do you have any sense if this is the maturation of the customer base or is there something different in a way that some of the registrars are engaging with their customers?", "George Kilguss", "So Gregg, this is George. I think it's a little too early to speculate on that. We do note the slight increase it has happened both as I mentioned in the first time renewing names as well as in the previous renewed names. So we're excited about that. We think that's a good trend, but we just need a few more quarters to see if this data point continued on our trend and we'll monitor it, and like I said, we report back out to you next quarter on that.", "Gregg Moskowitz", "Okay and how many names I guess in the Q1 are base represent names that they were on and on hold status?", "George Kilguss", "So they weren't much changed from Q4, Q4 as I mentioned was 870 and I think we're maybe 890 in Q1, but again the domain name base includes those names and so the 1.5 million net additions is an apples-to-apples comparison of the increase.", "Gregg Moskowitz", "Okay right perfect and then just lastly, I guess question for Jim, so it does seem like new gTLDs are starting to gain a little bit more momentum just wanted to get your latest thoughts and opportunity that represents to VeriSign, talking about the backend gTLD obviously not the IDN? Thanks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Well, I guess let me answer that in two parts. Gaining more momentum, we do have dot realtor and dot jobs as backend, .realtor is a good performing name but those names are available for the first year for free to all, all of credited realtors. So we're seeing some good growth there and we hope that will continue beyond the first year. New gTLDs are all about I think just over maybe 5.25 million in total at this point 14 or 15 months in the market. Comments were I just heard 8.7 million names gross adds this quarter and 1.5 million net for the quarter, so I think -- but I think your statement is fair and we certainly don\u2019t guide to specific growth and deployment and revenue production from our backend, registry customers are still many of them that enough and delegated yet. Many of them not launched their products yet. So I don't want to speculate about what that means for revenue, but I think it's a good trend. We think we do have nearly 200 about our 175 or so back end customers so we should know something in the coming quarter to and will certainly let you know.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And will take a question from [Indiscernible] ", "Unverified Analyst ", "Hi, guys. Couple of questions one to George in an interest rate environment at 0% why are we paying almost 6% for financing and to Jim could you talk at all about what's going on outside the DNS business I've seen a few announcements on the DDoS partnerships that talk to that?", "George Kilguss", "Sure. So, Fred this is George. Regarding your first question I mean when you look back historically for the companies that are rated DD plus like we are historically a rate and the rate could be a little attract 4.62% on our first bond and 5% in a quarter, today historically those are actually fairly attractive rates. Clearly we believe that we can put those funds to good use in the company to drive profitable growth as well as to drive shareholder returns so we're looking to do that. We like others think that we're on historical loads from an interest rate perspective and while we don't know when we do think that rates eventually will increase and we thought it was a timely opportunity to go into the market to raise some capital and we think that the rate that we're able to attract was a very fair rate and favorable rate for the company.", "D. James Bidzos ", "And Fred, this is Jim. If you didn\u2019t have a follow up to George I will go ahead and answer your second question. ", "Unverified Analyst ", "Yes.", "D. James Bidzos", "Okay, thanks. Yes with respect to DDoS obviously cyber security is a white hot space and a very large component of cyber security DDoS attacks are growing in size and intensity and frequency and for those on the call who are not familiar DDoS is a portion of our NIA component our security in it and so the were some of the recent announcements that we\u2019ve made relate to a strategy that we're employing where it started with Juniper last year but basically our strategy is to provide an open interface a standard essentially to allow those who are using on premise equipment to provide initial protection against DDoS attacks and mitigate them it\u2019s a way for those hardware vendors to basically right to expect that allows them to seamlessly transition to in a cloud mitigation using our DDoS protection service, we think that's really a great trend in the future it's great for customers, it's a great distribution model for us, it's more efficient it's part of our ongoing efforts to streamline and optimize our security services unit, so we help to see a lot more than that but thanks for noticing that, that's really about an effort on our pipe such as basically make DDoS protection more available in a way on demand where it's needed to the customers in a way that they want using our service available through the cloud.", "Unverified Analyst ", "Okay. Is it getting close to being a reportable number meaning 10% of your business?", "D. James Bidzos", "We'll will let you know as soon as it is till than it\u2019s not this quarter but we'll let you know what it is we continue to see progress and worth we can continue to work on optimizing the strategy the team and more importantly the distribution model and the mechanism by which we deliver the technology, we think this was scale much better for us so stay tuned.", "Unverified Analyst ", "Can you talk about what other initiatives you\u2019ve got on the security side?", "D. James Bidzos", "While we do have a couple of other components to the NIA unit one is a manage DNS which is very more of a performance component and we do have our iDefense unit which is a threat intelligence capability not only do we provide that service to a number of well-known large clients we are also a consumer of that service ourselves. ", "We're working on strategies to make those products more widely available and change the distribution model as well so yes we do it primarily a threat intelligence capability going to malware but certainly not limited to that and a lot of cyber security experts who work in that unit.", "Unverified Analyst ", "Would you be tying into other threat and intelligence networks from [Indiscernible] etcetera?", "D. James Bidzos", "While we have a broad set of customers that include many companies well know security companies so we do think some of our malware identification service as to and other trade intelligence so yes we work very hard to broaden the market for those services but it's not limited to hand users it is in fact security companies and fire wall vendors of the type you are talking about.", "Operator", "Thank you. Will take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Hi, guys this is Jackson [Indiscernible] for sterling. Couple of questions from our side the first thing just to touch back on the IDN even with the sunrise period do you guys have the best guess as to when those will actually go up?", "D. James Bidzos", "So, this is Pat. So there is a process that we have to go through start off with what's call pre-delegation which will happen in early May and there is a controlled interruption phase which last for 90 days, which actually have to deal with the main collisions and may concern that there is not any unwanted behaviors within the new gTLD space and don't get launched after that at the earliest, so it all really depends upon the getting approval from ICANN on the modified Sunrise period and see what we can do from there.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay and remind, these you have a little bit flexibility with pricing if I am not mistaking, is that correct do you might just clarifying that for us?", "D. James Bidzos", "Yes, there are no shared prices within new registry agreements for the IDN and gTLDs. And let me just be a bit more specific there too, we are free to set any initial price that we choose under the new registry agreement and the only requirement that should we choose to change those prices would be a six-month notice period. We have additional flexibility in that applied for 11 of these IDNs. Most of them are .com some of them are.net. All of them are spread across different countries in different local language character sets and we are free also to price differently in those geographies or differently for [congruent]. We have complete flexibility on how we price those products, so that does afford us a great deal of flexibility.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks, that's helpful and then the last one from just a housekeeping one, how many names are up for renewal in March and in the June quarter?", "D. James Bidzos", "So in the first quarter there were 29.5 million and next quarter there are 28.3 million names that are expiring.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. David Atchley at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos", "Thank you, operator.

Today's conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley - Treasurer & Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President, and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.verisigninc.com. There you will also find our second quarter 2015 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names ending with 133.5 million dot-com and dot-net domain names in the domain name base.", "Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a dot-net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN.", "As of February 21, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for dot-net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million dot-net registered names. Also, as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of com and net.", "Based primarily on feedback from domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as standalone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms, available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility and, for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market.", "Finally, we believe this approach should provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.", "I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in com and net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million names for dot-com and 15 million names for dot-net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.", "In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4%, compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between point 0.6 million and 1.1 million names.", "As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over George.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014.", "The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7%, compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million, compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures.", "As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally.", "Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.", "I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.", "As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014.", "Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter, using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.", "Year-over-year non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate.", "Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash.", "Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.", "With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1.043 billion to $1.057 billion given on our last call.", "Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million, and $110 million.", "Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. We continue to actively invest in the development of new products, technologies, and services. Finally, we have been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our operating margins, efficient capital structure, and through the return of value to shareholders by share repurchases.", "We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.", "Just this past week, we marked 18 continuous years of 100% availability of the dot-com and dot-net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more and more important.", "We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our first question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back, Jim, to the revised strategy and maybe you can just help us understand what has changed? What is the revision and how is it different from the original plan you had?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Okay. Originally, we had a modified plan for a sunrise offering where we would reserve some names for certain pre-registered names in IDN.com. Based on feedback that we received from the community, it seems that it will work better for everyone and the preference on the part of our community, especially brand-holders is that we offer a standard form of sunrise. So that means that we will proceed with a standard TLD rollout for all of our IDNs, which does not require any ICANN approval.", "I think the important difference here in today's news versus what we talked about to you a quarter ago is that we no longer are waiting or require any ICANN approval, and we have some more certainty around the timing in rollout. We know what we need to do now. We have the set activities that precede an actual rollout. So we can say with some confidence that our staged rollout of our 11 IDNs will begin by the end of the year.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Under the previous plan, you had really hoped to provide, I think, more protection to brand-holders by extending the sunrise period and making sure that a named dot-com holder had the rights to \u2013 they would have \u2013 be the only ones who would have the rights to the new IDNs. Are you saying now that the third-parties after the sunrise period would be able to buy some of these IDNs?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Under some circumstances that might be possible. There are a number of different approaches that are available to all TLD registries under the new RA that we signed, the new registry agreement. And so, our marketing plan could include some of the capabilities that you talked about. What we aren't doing is specifying a plan that requires approval from ICANN that doesn't contain some of the precise sunrise provisions that were there before. It's a standard sunrise that will be rolled out. And I would like Pat to comment further on that part of the process.", "Patrick S. Kane - Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services", "Well, definitely we would contemplate changing is to not hold a reservation for grandfathered dot-com registrations during the sunrise. And that's the modification that we were trying to get approval from ICANN on. And we've taken that out, so we can move forward.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. We'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering first on the IDNs, will all of your IDNs roll out simultaneously? Or will it be a phased rollout beginning at the end of the year?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "The rollout will be phased. We're not going to roll out all 11 at once. You shouldn't expect that we're going to sequentially space out 11 either. It'll be phased. It'll be based on a number of different considerations. Certainly, the size of each market, the complexity of each market, the opportunity as it exists will all be factors. But we can say that the rollout will begin before the end of the year.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is there any update on pricing that you're willing to give us at this point?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Only that we're still working on it. And that, as you know, we do have complete flexibility by each individual IDN and by each region. So, we also have the flexibility to utilize premium pricing. There are a number of different \u2013 of course, it's very different from the provisions of the dot-com registry agreements. So, we have tremendous flexibility. So, we are working through that. But I don't expect that to slow down the rollout. And it is a bit early for us to describe to you what that pricing will be.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And last question, have you guys done any additional work so I get a sense of what the dot-com and dot-net pace looks like in each of the regions that you're going to rollout an IDN. So in other words, is there any sense of what we can expect in terms of uptake once they launch?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Okay. I'm not sure I understand your question exactly, Sterling. Are you saying that an analysis of existing...", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "If you look at where those IDNs are targeted in terms of the languages, so if you look at the countries of those languages. We talked a little bit about this last quarter. I didn't know if you went back and did any additional work to say: well, of the dot-com base you see this many names in that region and you'd take a reasonable percentage that might also want that IDN. Here's what the uptake might look like.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Well, first of all, we don't have precise visibility into that because, of course, we're working through registrars and not all the Whois data is available to us. So, it's not with great precision that we understand exactly what the distribution of com registrations is geographically. But of course, we do have some idea, and we are very aware of that. And that certainly factors into our plans. But I'm not sure if I answered your question.", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "No, I think that's fine. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Okay.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks, this is actually Priya Parasuraman in for Gray. Could you talk about renewal rates, particularly with respect to first time and previously renewed rates? And also across geographic market?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So, this is George Kilguss. Your first question was on renewal rates. So our renewal rate for the second quarter was 72.6%, clearly up from 71.8% a year ago. We continue to see improvement in that renewal rate, primarily as a result of previously renewed names. We saw about a 70 basis points increase year-over-year, to about 82.6% of previous renewed rate. First time renewal rates are close to 50% still. And so, most of the improvement we've seen have been in previously renewed rates.", "As far as domestic, I think you were asking about different geographies.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Right.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "They haven't changed too much from previous reports. We do see first time renewal rates being a little lower in emerging markets, whether those be markets in Asia Pacific or India or Greater Asia markets than we do here domestically. But we continue to see strength in the previously renewed names.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. Just one more, could you talk about your new DNS firewall product and how it's been received so far?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Sure. It's a fairly new product so it's a bit early to give you any real detail on financial detail. But we can tell you that the reception is good in the market. There is tremendous interest in it. Most large enterprises and virtually all ISPs do operate their own recursive servers. And we operate a recursive service as well. The market feedback that we received was that a firewall would be a very, very welcome and important aspect of that to give these customers more precise control over filtering access using the DNS as essentially as another layer to prevent malware, which is of course something that's on everybody's mind these days.", "So I would certainly say that the initial response from the market is good. There's tremendous interest, particularly in the firewall aspect of this recursive service. And so, we're certainly hoping for success for the product. But it's early to really give you any more detail than that. But specifically to answer your question, the initial reception is a strong interest and very much so, specifically, in the firewall aspect.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. There seems to be more volatility in net adds activity over the past six to nine months than anything we've seen probably over the past five plus years. And I know there's been recent promotional activity that's on and off, but that's always been the case in some fashion at least. And so, I'm just wondering if there's anything that you would kind of point to that might be driving some of the volatility in net adds from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Gregg, this is George. I mean, there are many, many factors that happen inter-quarter or inter-year with domain names. Clearly, we have varying growth rates in markets around the world. As I mentioned last quarter and it holds true for this quarter as well, we still see more growth internationally than we do domestic. Our Asia, in general, markets are growing much faster. But as far as the individual nuances for the net zone, some of those factors harken back to promotions that registrars may have run a year ago, and their respective renewal rates and effectiveness of those programs.", "Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so, it's really a confluence of obviously adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility only in the sense that the net adds in each quarter from several years ago are smaller than they used to be or they are currently.", "But we saw 500,000 net adds in the second quarter. As you can see our guidance, we're expecting just like last year the third quarter to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we still see strong demand for our product globally.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks, George. And just one follow-up if I could on dot-net names, so the attrition of dot-net did pick up a little bit in Q2. Obviously, you're going to be raising pricing by 10% in February of next year. And just wondering if there are kind of any concerns that you might have around price elasticity for dot.net? Thank you.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. I mean, we still believe that the dot.net product is a very fairly priced asset in the marketplace. We look at a lot of the competitors who are priced higher than we are. We think there's a lot of value in that brand. And yes dot.net's growth has been a little bit muted. But as we talked about, you have to keep in mind there's been over 700 new competitors entering the marketplace, a lot of those targeting \u2013 clearly, targeting both the com and net and the other legacy gTLDs. But clearly, net probably has been more affected than com has, even though I think they've been both targeted from competitors.", "But net has held up very well. We think the product is quite well priced in the marketplace, and fairly priced for the value of asset that we're delivering and the value of product. So, we expect net to continue to perform.", "Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "Thanks. Afternoon, everybody. I guess this might be for Pat. In your dot \u2013 or I'm sorry, in your dot brand customer base that you're working with, what's your sense of how they're thinking about it from the perspective of are they going to move from dot-com to .xyz or whatever? Or are they more thinking that this will be an incremental domain?", "Patrick S. Kane - Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services", "So, not all of our brand customers have determined exactly how they are going to use their top level domains. But we would imagine that some would complement their current dot-com with their own offering, but we don't see them abandoning their dot-com.", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "And just to clarify, this is Jim, I'm not sure what you meant by your question, but there can be two answers to that. Number one is the way you put it, I assume you meant dot brand where customers may take their own. And I think Pat is right. So, for example, if we were to employ dot-verisign, we would never abandon verisign.com. We've, like most brands, we've invested heavily in promoting it and everybody is familiar with it. And it would simply \u2013 we would probably redirect traffic from one to the other. We'd never abandon it. And since we run the registry for \u2013 we would be running the registry for both dot-com and for dot-verisign, for us, it's the same reliable platform.", "But we do see \u2013 we are aware of some brands who \u2013 in fact, most of the dot brands that have applied, many of them are our backend registry customers. So they're not only keeping their dot-com, but they're also moving their dot brand onto our platform to make sure that it runs on the same reliable 18 years of 100% availability infrastructure that we operate.", "At this point, I think the traffic for anybody in dot-com is so valuable that I don't see anybody abandoning their dot-com for either a brand or another TLD.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "No. So the answer shortly, I guess, it's largely incremental as opposed to cannibalizing dot-com?", "D. James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President & CEO", "Well, I think if you just look at the numbers for dot-com and the net adds, you'll see that being the powerful brand that it is, it's still growing quite briskly. So I think those numbers speak for themselves. Dot-com is the reliable brand and people are choosing great names in it and the registration numbers are strong. It's in demand and people are registering dot-coms and, of course, needless to say, all of the global brands are on dot-com and I don't expect that to change.", "Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for any additional or any closing remarks.", "David Atchley - Treasurer & Head-Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator.

LLC", "Operator", "Good day, everyone. Welcome to the VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded and any unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley, CFA - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming and Directory Services.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There, you will also find our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open up the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "During 2015, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.059 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $629 million, and producing full-year non-GAAP operating margins of 61.5%.", "Operationally, 2015 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 38.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 139.8 million .com and .net names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 18 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.", "As a part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. During the full-year 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares for $622 million.", "Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $611 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration.", "Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, of which $753 million was held domestically and the remainder held abroad. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 139.8 million, consisting of 124 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 6.3% year-over-year, as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods.", "In the fourth quarter, we added 4.6 million net names to the domain name base after processing 12.2 million new gross registrations. In the third quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 71.9% compared with 72% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. Towards the end of the third quarter and mainly during the first two months of the fourth quarter, we saw higher volume of gross additions coming largely in our Asia-Pacific region, primarily through registrars in China. While we believe China and the Asia-Pacific region will continue to perform well, we expect these markets to return to more normal levels in 2016.", "Based on registrar feedback, the most likely contributor of the additional gross addition volume appears to have been driven primarily from domain investment activity in that region. Also, as we have noted in the past, the renewal rates for domain names registered in emerging markets, such as Asia-Pacific, have historically been lower than those registered in more developed markets.", "Considering these factors, we expect the first three quarters of the year to have roughly a similar pattern of quarterly net additions to the domain name base as we saw during 2015. However, we expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have the largest percentage of first-time renewing names that we've seen as a result of the strong Q4 2015 performance.", "While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to the unusually large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, deletions could exceed additions in the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the first quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 1.5 million and 2 million names. And we are forecasting the full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 0.5% and 2%.", "As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day. And our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter and year. Finally, as an update related to the launch of our internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net, during December, the localized Katakana version of .com in Japanese launched and will be in the Sunrise Period until March 14.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the full-year 2015, we recognize revenue of $1.059 billion, up 4.9% from full-year 2014 revenue and delivered GAAP operating income of $606 million, up 7.4% from $564 million for the full-year 2014. During the fourth quarter, we recognized revenue of $273 million, up 6.5% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $158 million, up 11.3% from $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "The GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter came to 58.1%, compared to 55.6% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $102 million, compared to $65 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter this year, compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter last year.", "As described last year, our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a charge in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets back in 2014.", "As of December 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.4 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $753 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.", "Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at year end, up from $2.8 billion at the end of 2014, primarily as a result of the issuance of a new 10-year, 5.25%, $500 million debenture completed in the first quarter of 2015.", "I'll now review some of our key metrics for our fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance.", "As mentioned, 2015 full year revenue was $1.059 billion, up 4.9% from full-year 2014 revenues. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled $273 million, up 6.5% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenues was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $961 million, a $71 million increase from year-end 2014.", "Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million compared with $99 million in the third quarter of 2015 and down from $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 62.4% compared to 59.4% in the same quarter of 2014. Full-year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 61.5%.", "Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $105 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.78 last quarter, based on 135.9 million and 131.7 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.", "Full-year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.05, a 12% increase over 2014. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 131.7 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.4 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 14.7 million for the same quarter in 2014 and 18 million shares last quarter.", "Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the fourth quarter were $189 million and $176 million, respectively, compared with $170 million and $159 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. Full-year 2015 operating cash flow was $651 million compared with $601 million for 2014. Free cash flow for 2015 was $629 million compared with $568 million for 2014.", "Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below the 26% tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2016 we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $10 million to $20 million. Due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international.", "With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%.", "Full year-2016 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income, net, is expected to be an expense of between $114 million to $120 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2015. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Thank you, George. I want to take this opportunity to update you on another item. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to transition its historic stewardship role related to the Internet's domain name system to the global multistakeholder community.", "A year later, in March of 2015, in preparation for the implementation phase of the IANA stewardship transition, NTIA asked VeriSign and ICANN to submit a proposal detailing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with root zone management. These related root zone management functions involve our role as Root Zone Maintainer under the Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Commerce.", "In response to the March 2015 request from NTIA, ICANN and VeriSign submitted a proposal to NTIA, describing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet's domain name system.", "NTIA published this joint ICANN-VeriSign proposal on August 17, 2015, noting it was anticipated that performance of the Root Zone Maintainer function would be conducted by VeriSign under a new Root Zone Maintainer Agreement with ICANN once the Root Zone Maintainer function obligations under the Cooperative Agreement were completed.", "ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of drafting the new Root Zone Maintainer Agreement to perform this Root Zone Maintainer role as a commercial service for ICANN upon the successful transition of the IANA functions.", "The Root Zone Maintainer functions performed by VeriSign are delivered via the secure, stable and resilient purpose-built DNS infrastructure that has delivered .com, .net and A and J RootZone services for an uninterrupted and unparalleled 18 years.", "To ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high level during the expected 10-year term of the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement, ICANN and VeriSign are in discussions to extend the term of the .com Registry Agreement to coincide with the expected 10-year term of the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement, ensuring that the terms of the two agreements are the same, will promote the stability of root operations, and will remove potential instability that might otherwise arise if the terms did not coincide.", "VeriSign's commitment to security, stability, and resiliency within the DNS is the first priority and consideration in the performance of our roles as directed by ICANN and the NTIA. While we cannot yet determine when or if these documents will be completed, having stability with these key contracts is an important component of the stability of the core infrastructure of the Internet.", "While ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stage of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents, there are several important steps that still need to occur including completing the drafting of the agreements, posting them for public comment and obtaining approvals from ICANN's and VeriSign's Board of Directors.", "Additionally, under the Cooperative Agreement, we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the .com Registry Agreement without the prior written approval of the Department of Commerce. If the department does not approve the extension, then the current .com Registry Agreement will remain unchanged. We will provide periodic updates, as appropriate, on our progress toward these objectives.", "In closing, during the last year, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. The end of 2015 marks five years since the completion of our divestiture program and the sale of our Authentication Services Business. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation.", "Since the end of 2010, revenue has grown sequentially for five straight years. Annual non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $1.04 in 2010 to $3.05 in 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $629 million during 2015. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 41.8% in 2010 to 61.5% during 2015. We have returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders, including repurchasing over 70 million shares for $3.36 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period.", "We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure, are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe the proper balance within our strategy framework, protect, grow and manage, is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers.", "I am sometimes asked what the next big thing is for VeriSign. And my answer is simple, more of the same; steady and efficient operation of a great business, so that we can steadily and consistently create value and efficiently return that value to our shareholders.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks so much; just like to go back to the changing the terms of the .com agreement. And just be clear, can you tell us what, from a practical standpoint, from an investor perspective, is going to change potentially with the new contracting?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Sure, Steve. So, first of all, I think it helps to just understand that we're not actually changing the terms of the .com Registry Agreement. And this is not a renewal. This is an extension. We are negotiating entering into a 10-year contract with ICANN to perform commercial services as the Root Zone Maintainer, services that we now perform under contract to the NTIA. The contemplated or anticipated term of that agreement is 10 years. In order to ensure the same steady, available, uninterrupted, secure and stable environment that we've been providing for three decades as a Root Zone Maintainer, it is also anticipated \u2013 we are discussing \u2013 the extension of the .com Registry Agreement for 10 years.", "So at that point, should all of these conditions that I described earlier, for example, approval of ICANN's Board of Directors and VeriSign's Board of Directors, no changes whatsoever can be made to the .com Registry Agreement without the consent of the NTIA.", "So subject to those approvals and the transition occurring, then we would have 10-year concurrent terms for the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement. So what you would see is essentially a change of the date, the term, of the .com Registry Agreement.", "That's essentially the change. From an investor viewpoint, instead of a renewal in 2018, you would see a 10-year term that starts with the effective date of the two changes, the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the extended .com Registry Agreement. So, instead of November 30, 2018, you would see a date that is 10 years from the effective date of those two.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "But when would that be executed? When is the date of actually extending the terms?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "So, again, qualifying all of this to say that if we conclude our negotiations, we get all the necessary approvals, the triggering event that marks the \"effective date\" would then be the IANA transition occurring. That process has been underway since March of 2014. I certainly can't say with any definite date when that will happen, but I can tell you that there is steady progress on the transition. The target date is September of 2016. That is the date of the expiration of the IANA contract between NTIA and ICANN.", "And if everything occurs at that point and it is certainly possible, all of the work that needs to be done can be accomplished by that date, but again I can't, of course, tell you what will happen when. I can simply tell you that that is everyone's goal and that the community, ICANN, NTIA, et cetera, are all driving for that September 2016 date. So, that is the best date that everybody's shooting for. So, if you wanted to know roughly when that might happen, that would be the target date.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Perfect. And then, just my quick follow-up here is on the surge in domain names we saw in China and you called out the fact that just getting some feedback from registrars, that it looked like it was investment. What do you think drove that investment? Is it possible that the new gTLDs, specifically the ones you own, the .coms, are an incentive for people to own, maybe .com in other languages? Well, what might have driven the investment surge?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Steve, this is George. Just to put some more clarification around it, the growth in the fourth quarter was not unique to .com and .net. The local ccTLD .cn reported increased growth in the quarter. We've seen other TLDs report growth. And so, .com and .net has also performed quite well in that year. So it was \u2013 we call it \u2013 clearly solid investment community in the emerging market performed well. Again, we don't have direct visibility into the end user. Our customers are the registrars in those regions. But again, based on the information that we have, we saw that the investor community performed well across the board.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.", "Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks, guys, just a couple questions and congrats on a strong quarter. First, to the NTIA announcement that you guys talked about there, the potential 10-year extension, you said sort of negotiations. Are you kind of submitting to the idea that everything sort of remains stable and just gets extended for 10 years on sort of the same price point and the same terms, or is there some sort of, kind of, give and take with this extension?", "And then, also, just as a follow-up to the quarter itself, you said, obviously, there was a spike out of China. I wonder if you could help us quantify that. Just kind of how many names are we talking about that were sort of over and above, call it, a normal run rate in Q4? Thanks.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "This is Jim. Let me take the first part of your question. I would just reiterate again that what we're contemplating here, what we're working towards, is an extension of the .com agreement. So, the terms wouldn't change in the .com agreement. It is literally an extension so that it coincides with the new Root Zone Maintainer Agreement.", "Essentially, the goal is to make the term of those two contracts to run concurrently. That's the objective. So, we don't anticipate that there will be any substantive change or any change, actually, to the terms of the agreement itself, if that helps. Does that answer your question?", "Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yes, that's perfect. Thank you.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "And, Phil, with regard to your question on Q4 net adds, as discussed, net additions in the fourth quarter were 4.6 million, and they were comprised of 12.2 million new adds, new registrations, and 7.6 million deletes from prior periods. The 4.6 million was up about 3.8 million from the 800,000 we achieved in Q4 2014 and up about 2.9 million from the 1.7 million net adds delivered in Q3 2015.", "The Q4 year-over-year improvement was primarily a result of about 3.5 million incremental registrations coming out of our Asia-Pacific region. As we mentioned, that was primarily China and appear largely to be from the investor community over there.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Phil, this is Jim, too. Just to clarify, I want to make sure I answered entirely your first question. You were asking me about a change in terms of the .com agreement. Did you mean to implicate at all the Cooperative Agreement and the terms, for example, such as the price caps on the price of .coms?", "Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Both those two, the Cooperative and the .com, exactly. So the price caps, but also just the sort of presumptive right of renewal, things like that.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Yeah. So let me just say that, first of all, the terms of the .com agreement will not change, and the presumptive right of renewal, of course, would remain in the .com agreement. The .com agreement doesn't actually address pricing. That's addressed separately in the Cooperative Agreement.", "The Amendment 11 of the Cooperative Agreement is the section that describes our contractual relationship with NTIA with respect to the root zone maintainer role. And that is the portion that it's contemplated would essentially move into a new contract, the RZMA that we're negotiating with ICANN.", "Amendment 32 is a separate part of the Cooperative Agreement that addresses pricing with respect to our ability to seek a price change if we think it's justified by market conditions. So I certainly don't anticipate that that would change. That would remain. So VeriSign's right to seek relief from price controls based on market conditions that would warrant it would remain.", "Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the detail.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Just three quick questions, one on the agreements, so you did mention that it is not a renewal, it'a an extension. But I'm assuming that the Department of Commerce review would be similar to what the review would be during a renewal? I just wanted to make sure I understood what the difference was technically between an extension and renewal for those purposes.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Yeah. I don't believe that's the case. I think the extension means that the date changes on the agreement. But any change to the agreement requires the consent of the NTIA. And so, I can't speak for NTIA. This is their process. The part of the process we're involved in would be to negotiate the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement with ICANN to present that along with a .com contract that has the date extended and present that to NTIA.", "This is, of course, in response to their March 2015 request for a way to transition the root zone maintainer role and to take NTIA out of that process. So that will be up to them when they see it. So I think that's what they asked for and that's what they're looking for. This is not a renewal in the sense that all of the normal things that happen during a renewal would happen. So I don't quite see it that way.", "I see this is precisely what NTIA has called it. It's a parallel process to address the issue of the root and parallel to the IANA transition process, which began in March of 2014.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then, George, on your end, there's been a lot of activity in the TLD space and you've had a lot of marketing dollars, I think, come into the market. And I think you even in your lawsuit with XYZ talked about having to spend more money from a \u2013 I can't remember what you called it \u2013 remedial marketing, something like that, to make sure your brand was positioned right. I'm wondering. Your guidance really doesn't seem to imply any kind of uptick in marketing spend. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand what the environment looks like, what you decided to bake in to your guide from a marketing expense perspective.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, from a sales and marketing perspective, we would expect that sales and marketing expense to be similar as a percent of revenue as it has been this year.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, you guys obviously did divestitures for a number of years. You haven't really done any M&A. Is there any update on how you're thinking about inorganic activities as it relates to your strategy in 2016 and beyond?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "This is Jim. So, in a word, no, but let me just say this. During my earlier remarks, I mentioned that the next big thing for VeriSign is more of the same. What we did for the last five years in efficiently running our business, providing security and stability, generating value, and efficiently returning that value to our shareholders; that's what you're going to see for the next five years. So, some sort of inorganic growth strategy to try to grow in other businesses or non-core businesses is not part of our plan. And I certainly don't see that happening. And we've been very consistent about that messaging.", "Now, I've also consistently said something else over the last year or two, which is that, for example, the new gTLD program could present some inorganic opportunities in our core business. And that's certainly still true. In fact, just recently, a group of observers of that marketplace, who are heavily involved in, all sort of opined that 2016 could be the year of consolidation in that business. And certainly those opportunities to acquire growth in our core business would be something we'd look at, and we've been very consistent about all of that. Since completing the divestitures, our position on acquisitions is essentially unchanged.", "But again, if we see opportunities that come along, we're not opposed to looking at those, as long as they're consistent with our core business, consistent with our commitment to deliver profitable growth. Again, the opportunity to participate in a consolidation in 2016, that's an opportunity for us. As a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 we have evaluated, and we are pursuing, and we'll continue to evaluate and pursue, acquisitions of TLDs that are currently in operation, those that have not yet been awarded, in support of our growth strategy as long as they fit with that strategy.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks, Jim.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Sure.", "Operator", "We'll now take our last question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. Jim, just, I guess, to start off to follow on to Phil's question, I just want to make sure we're on the same page here. Should the .com agreement and Cooperative Agreement get sort of rolled into this 10-year extension? If that does come to fruition, is the expectation that there would be no built-in price escalators, but that VeriSign would be able to petition if there was a change in market power or if there were some sort of unusual expense that was required of VeriSign from a security perspective to secure the DNS? Do I have that correctly?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Almost. Yes. For the most part, you have it correct. But let me just point out the .com \u2013 so the short answer to your question is yes. I don't expect any of that to change. I anticipate that we would have our Amendment 32 rights to petition based on changing market conditions for price relief. And also that, certainly, the agreement calls for the ability for VeriSign to seek so-called cost-justified price increases and that includes things like cost of implementing Consensus Policies or specific threats to the DNS that are extraordinary that we have to respond to \u2013 unanticipated expenses associated with responding to threats. So I don't see those changing at all.", "But in the front part of your question, you sort of lumped the .com Registry Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement together, and those are different agreements. What we're doing here is we're seeking an extension to the .com Registry Agreement. The Cooperative Agreement expires in 2018, and we are not seeking any change to that. That is up to NTIA. That is their process, their contract, so I would certainly defer to them.", "But we are not rolling up those two together for a 10-year extension. We are just simply ensuring that the .com Registry Agreement, which, I might add, has the most stringent SLAs, the most stringent security performance requirements of any Registry Agreement, run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement, because remember, our performance as the Root Zone Maintainer and Publisher, essentially you can think of it as the bootstrapping process of the Internet, which we do at least twice a day. And it is critically important to the secure operation of the global Internet that that process be done in an uninterrupted, secure way.", "And so in order to achieve that, we are seeking a concurrent term for the .com Registry Agreement, which addresses the infrastructure and the performance requirements for that infrastructure that provides the security for .com and .net and the roots to run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement for obvious reasons, to avoid any possible instability that might result.", "The Cooperative Agreement, the only thing that we anticipate would change \u2013 I'm not speaking for NTIA, but I assume, at some point, Amendment 11, which talks about our role as the Root Zone Maintainer would, of necessity, change. But we have no anticipation or expectation that anything else would change. It expires in 2018, but it's up to NTIA to decide at that point what happens.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. And then earlier, you said that you believe that deletions in Q4 could exceed additions, just given the big uptick in first-time renewals. As part of your unit growth guidance of 0.5% to 2%, if we sort of look at the mid-point of that, is that effectively what you're kind of factoring in for Q4? Just wondering how you're sort of thinking about that as part of the guidance.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Well, I think it is factored in. I'll let George offer you some more color on that. But I will just say that Q4 is a ways off. It is unique. We had basically roughly a 50% increase from the year ago quarter in Q4 of 2015. I think we had 8-point-something million gross adds in Q4 of 2014 and we went to 12.2 million in Q4 of 2015. So it was extraordinary in that sense. And it's technically possible that a wide range of outcomes could result. And so, I just wanted to point out that one possibility certainly is that deletes could exceed adds just because of the sheer volume of gross adds that occurred in Q4 of 2015.", "That is a mathematical fact and I just wanted to point it out and maybe George can add some color.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think that's exactly right. I mean, as Jim pointed out, last year in the fourth quarter of 2014, 8.2 million adds versus the 12.2 million adds in the fourth quarter of this year, so 4 million increase in the additions. As we historically know, first-time renewal rates are typically around 50%, so that would mathematically suggest that there's maybe a 2 million unit increase in deletions.", "We've also said that when we look around the world from a renewal rate perspective, we do see emerging markets having a slightly lower renewal rate, on average. So that could impact the number as well.", "Clearly, what would dictate Q4 net adds would be the other side of that equation as to what gross adds would be. But clearly, as we said in our prepared remarks, the renewing name base is going to be large. I mean, we had a great, great fourth quarter. And so we'll have those names come up for renewal, and we'll keep an eye on what the renewal rate is. But historically, our first-time renewal rate has been 50%.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And if I could just ask one last one, George, can you just walk through why expected cash taxes for 2016 are likely to be quite a bit lower than 2015?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. I'd be happy to. In 2015 last year, we did have some expense related to a small restructuring of a portion of our international operations, and the primary difference is that restructuring amount. Again, from a U.S. perspective, we have our convertible debenture that produces a tax shield. Last year, it was about $165 million, as we said. That convertible debenture tax shield tends to grow about 6% year-over-year.", "We also have approximately $173 million of foreign tax credits that we expect to utilize before they expire over the next seven or eight years. And so we don't expect to pay very much U.S. tax based on our attributes. So really we would look to the $10 million to $20 million to be primarily foreign taxes, but, again, we had a small restructuring. We talked about it last year, where we did pay some cash taxes as a result of that international restructuring.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, very helpful. Thank you, guys.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments.", "David Atchley, CFA - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

Today's conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley, CFA - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There, you will also find our first quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open up the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow. We processed nearly 10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 2.65 million net new names ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in a domain name base.", "Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million.", "We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives.", "I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.5 million, consisting of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year.", "In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.", "During the first quarter, we continued to see strength in net additions in many parts of the world, both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue through the second quarter.", "Also as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter of 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting the full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%. As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized Katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May.", "And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totals $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers.", "GAAP operating income for the first quarter totaled $167 million, up 15.6% from $144 million in the first quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59.2% compared to 55.8% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $107 million compared to $88 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.66 for the first quarter last year.", "As of March 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $667 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at the quarter end.", "I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on 133.8 million and 133.4 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.", "We had a weighted average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.", "Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year.", "With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from the $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full-year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of the 1% to 2.5%.", "Full-year 2016, non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range as given on our last earnings call.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in the 2016 are international. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Thank you, George. In closing, during the first quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We believe that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in a most efficient manner.", "We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you very much. So, I guess I'd like to ask, in terms of the revenue growth rate, revenue grew 9.1% year-over-year, but the name file grew 7.1%. Historically, if you look at those two, they've been very close to one another within 10 basis points, and here you have 200 basis points different. Do you have any insight into why the revenue growth rate might have been 200 basis points stronger than the name growth rate?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Steve. I think a couple of factors. One, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have a .net price increase that took effect in February of this year. Also really the timing of when the ads came in, we clearly had a very strong 4Q of name additions, and we also had a very strong 1Q name additions. And so, as that revenue waterfalls, that also helped. While not material, our BFS business continue to grow in the quarter as well.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. And then, you mentioned China, the expectation is that, that should normalize here in the second quarter. What gives you confidence or what leads you to believe that that's going to be the situation?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I think the short answer is, as we look at the trends, we've seen the demand that happened in the second half of the first quarter kind of ebb and flow. So we saw it come. It was pretty strong for a few weeks and then it came back to more than normalized path. So we don't have a perfect crystal ball, but based on the trends that we've seen that we've been tracking, it seems to be back on the normalized path for that particular region, at least as what we've seen historically.", "Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. That's helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is (14:37) for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the Japanese IDN, which I believe is in the (14:44) space. (14:45) at this point, are you able to disclose the pricing for the registry fees and also what will be the subsequent IDN fee \u2013 what will the subsequent IDN fee priced similarly? Thanks.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "I'm sorry but that was completely unreadable on our end. I don't know if you are on a cell phone, but none of us in this room could get a word of it, I apologize.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hello. Can you \u2013 is this better?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Oh, that's much better.", "Unknown Speaker", "Sorry. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. Just quickly, I wanted to ask about the Japanese IDN. Are you able to disclose the pricing for the registry fee at this point? And will the subsequent IDNs be priced similarly?", "Todd B. Strubbe - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, so in Japan \u2013 hi, this is Todd Strubbe. In Japan, we are currently in our limited release one phase and we enter a GA in June. Our pricing right now has a combination of base pricing and we have lunched premium pricing, so it's a combination. Our general availability pricing is established at $8 for the registrars and then has several tiers associated with premium pricing.", "Our Korea launch, we just announced, will go into Sunrise phase in May, as Jim said, with the targeted general availability for both Korea streams, the .com and the .net, in late August. And that pricing will likely be very similar to what we have priced in Japan.", "Unknown Speaker", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll hear next from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Out of the 2.65 million net names that were added in the quarter, about how much of that came from Asia-Pac?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "So, we don't break out the gross adds by particular region, but what I can tell you is the incremental names that happened in the quarter that were \u2013 kind of surprised us was about a million names. So about a million incremental names in the quarter were over and above the trend line that we typically see in China.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I guess, George, just getting back to your commentary on the ebbs and flows with respect to the second half of Q1 in China. If we sort of think back to Q4, if I recall, you had an extremely strong first six weeks in that quarter and then the activity seemed to die down quite a bit as well. Is the thought on normalization in Q2 a function of seasonality being stronger in Q1 versus Q4? I guess just any commentary there would be helpful.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Clearly, seasonality has some to do with it. Q2 tends to be a little bit less than Q1. Q1 does tend to be our strongest quarter. But when we look at the trends from that particular market, it just deviated from the normal trend that we were expecting. And then again, subsequent to the end of the quarter, it came pretty much back on our expectations. The only other color I can give you is that, in fourth quarter when we saw the demand coming out of China, that was pretty broad spread across many TLDs and across frankly many of our own TLDs, whereas the one that happened in Q1 was fairly localized to .com. I don't have intelligence for all the other TLDs per se, but I can tell you, it was much more centered at .com than the Q4 event.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just one last question. I guess either for Jim and George. So just in light of the net adds activity in Q1, and then if I take the midpoint of your Q2, new name guidance, based on my math, it looks like the high end of your new 2016 guidance for unit growth, which would be 2.5%, it looks like that would actually imply if I'm not mistaken, net deletions not only for the Q4 as you outlined in your script, but in fact for the entire second half. And just wondering if you could help me understand, I guess, why the unit growth guidance for the full year would not be higher than 1% to 2.5% or is it just a function of conservatism?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Well, just again in Q4 since the number of incremental names was so strong, we had about 3.5 million incremental names out of a total of 12.2 million. We hadn't seen that level of activity from the investment community over there. And so, it's a little bit of a unicorn. We're not exactly sure what the renewal rates are there. And so, we're just being, I think, prudent as to estimating what renewal rates can be, because we don't quite have an experience with that particular segment of that base and how they'll perform.", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "I think you need just think of it as a conservative approach to forecasting in a situation where we have a situation arising in Q4 that we just simply haven't seen before. We have a lot of data, and we have a lot of forecasting tools, but I think you should view that forecast in that light.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Could you help us understand as you look out at maybe 1Q 2017? I know you're not providing 2017 guidance in total. But do you expect kind of the same dynamic in that period to persist from what you're seeing in 4Q given the overage in registrations coming out of Asia in the current or in the most recent reported quarter?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "I think it's just too early to speculate as to what will happen in Q1, but certainly what happened in Q1 of 2016 is very different than what happened in Q4 of 2015. So, the impact that we're anticipating in Q4 of 2016 really wouldn't be the same in the subsequent quarter. And I think it's sort of a favorable development that there's more of a concentration of .com registrations in the sort of increase in activity in Q1 of 2016", "So, it's early to say, but I think there's just a larger number of renewing names, that ratio that exists in Q4 of 2016 is not very likely to be the same in subsequent quarters, it almost certainly won't.", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "And the only other thing I'll say is that \u2013 when we start seeing these names start to renew late in Q3 and Q4, we'll get some additional information that will help us to answer that question for Q1 and when we provide guidance on our fourth quarter call.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. And then, just as, Jim, as it relates to the contract processes, you said you're in the final stages there. I assume the next stage here would be a posting of that contract and \u2013 posting the agreements in the public comment period. And could you just let us know what your expected dates are to have that process wrapped up?", "D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman", "Yeah. I can't speak for all the parties involved. So, I can't give you a date. I can just tell you that we've moved down the road in drafting the agreement and we're much further along in that process and we certainly are making progress and I'm sure that, we'll certainly know more by the next time we talk to you in the following quarter, and it's very possible that something could happen before that.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just last question for George, on the guide for the year, you did raise your revenue guidance on the back of the strengthened demands. You didn't change your margin guidance, is there a corresponding increase in spending that you're pushing through or what else would explain the difference between higher revenue and margins not going up?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Looking in our business with the recurring revenue model, we're clearly looking to continue to drive growth that we see various opportunities in various markets and we're trying to be flexible in making investments and marking to drive additional growth. And so we're always putting plans in place for future periods.", "We do have some variable costs, as it relates to the fees that are charged for domain names that we pay to ICANN as these fees right up, so we do have some variable costs there. And if you look at some of our costs quarter-over-quarter, we have been investing in the business, but, yeah, I think, what you should imply is that as revenue grows, we're looking to invest in the business and maintain margins in the range we guided to.", "Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple. So how should we think about the pace of internationalized.com and .net trans order agents (24:27) coming on or going GA over the rest of the year? And do you have any indications of early demand?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "I think, Gray, and I think it's just too early. The limited release phase that we're in right now, those who are able to buy the .komo (24:53), the Japanese name, are limited to those who have the .com and they have to do that sort of the registrar, they have the .com, so the combination of those two has limited the addressable market in that limited release phase. So we'll really start to see once we hit general availability in the June timeframe and the 30, 60, 90 days after that. Same thing with Korea. Korea will be different in that we have both a .com and a .net there, so that will be the first time we'll test both of those strings in that market. And our follow-on plans past Korea, we're working on them and as we learn from Japan and Korea, both will help determine what we do next.", "Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Can any of those strings hit in the second half of the year or is it just too early to say?", "George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "I think we're \u2013 we would be targeting probably two more strings by the second half of the year, maybe a third. So, we \u2013 that would be the high level plans, I'd say, but still not ready to share those yet.", "Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments.", "David Atchley, CFA - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

(NASDAQ:VRSN) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call July 28, 2016  4:30 PM ET", "Executives", "David Atchley - VP, IR", "Jim Bidzos - President & CEO", "Todd Strubbe - EVP & COO", "George Kilguss - EVP & CFO", "Analysts", "Walter Pritchard - Citigroup", "Matt Broome - Cowen and Company", "Sterling Auty - JPMorgan", "Steven Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.", "Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Operator", "Good day everyone, welcome to VeriSign's second-quarter 2016 earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.", "At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's second-quarter 2016 earnings call.", "With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the investor relations section of our VeriSign.com website. There you will also find our second-quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results and our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.", "The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second-quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter, and added 0.78 million net new names, ending with 143.2 million common net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong, with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.", "As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign had been working on the Root Zone maintainer services agreement, and the .com registry agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RZMA for public review and the .com registry agreement amendment for public comment, after which our respective Boards of Directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment, which extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to NTIA for review and approval, according to their processes.", "I'll comment now on second-quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year.", "In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4%, compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015.", "As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized.", "Also, as discussed during the last two quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing names, as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth-quarter deletions to be elevated.", "Accordingly, as we stated the last two quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third-quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million, and between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names, and we are now forecasting full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2%.", "Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the US, and 42% was from international customers.", "GAAP operating income in the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 18.3% from $149 million in the second quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5%, compared to 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million, compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year.", "As of June 30, 2016, the Company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. Assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $609 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.", "I'll now review some additional second-quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance.", "Second-quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016, and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employer payroll tax withholdings in the quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.4%, compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter, and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year.", "Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015, and $0.85 last quarter, based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.", "Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares, based on the average share price during the second quarter, compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015, and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first-quarter 2016 repurchase activity, and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.", "Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million, compared with $175 million and $171 million respectively for the second quarter last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full-year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%.", "Full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million.", "Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "Jim Bidzos", "Thank you, George. In closing, during the second quarter, we continued to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders.", "Since the start of this quarter, the Company achieved two important milestones. First, we marked 19 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people, and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more important.", "Second, we were informed earlier this month by the Chinese government that we are now licensed to provide domain name registry services for .com and .net in the PRC. We believe that .com and .net are the first non-China based registries to be fully licensed in China.", "We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions, and operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard", "Hi. Thanks. One question for George, and then for Jim. George, on the OpEx, when you did, looks like it was pretty constrained in the first half of the year, you mentioned some marketing programs. Is that typical with what you've done in past years?", "It doesn't seem like they've really stepped down necessarily the margins in the second half, and I'm wondering how this year might be different in terms of what you're driving in the business.", "George Kilguss", "Sure, Walter. As you mentioned, if you look at our marketing expenses, sales and marketing expenses, they were actually flat sequentially, but they were down year-over-year by about $4 million. There are a number of programs that we run, some that we direct specifically that we take a look at, others that -- programs that we open up to registrars to submit programs to us.", "As we evaluate some of those programs that come in for us, clearly we're looking at those to see if it's going to have the right impact for our business, and if it's going to generate positive returns for us.", "Sometimes some of those programs that get submitted are not that attractive for us, and so we look to solicit additional proposals from registrars, as well as redirecting some of our programs. Depending on what's going on around the globe, as you might expect, there's a number of geopolitical things happening, and so we take those and other factors into place.", "I don't think there's anything unique here, other than we do have some programs that we did not execute on in the second half of -- the first half of the year, and we expect to execute on those in the second half of the year. So we're expecting our sales and marketing expense to increase in the second half of the year.", "Walter Pritchard", "And then for Jim, on the IDNs, I know that Korea and Japan have rolled out, I think we're pretty early still in the process, but would love to hear any update on registration volumes, how we should maybe look at those in terms of the ramp of volumes versus what we see in other gTLDs, and any sort of update on that process.", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure, I'll let Todd give you a little color on the progress of our IDNs. I'll just say upfront that remember that we're roughly six months into our IDN program. We started in Japan. It was the very first one.", "We're learning from that. We're working with partners and introducing new products. There are some infrastructure challenges, and that there are a lot of Internet applications that don't fully support IDNs, so there's some things that are continuing to develop. We try to strike a balance between adoption, growth and revenue.", "So there are a lot of factors that go into this. It's a little bit early. I don't think we're going to be able to give you a lot of detail, but Todd, if you want to add anything to that?", "Todd Strubbe", "Not a lot of detail. Just we are launched in Japan, and we are in general availability. We launched in Korea earlier with two IDNs, and we're in our limited release phase there, and we'll go into general availability on August 30. We don't publish our zone there, but you can see the stats on places like nTLDstats.com.", "Walter Pritchard", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from with Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.", "Matt Broome", "Thanks very much. This is Matt Broome on for Gregg. So you had very little zone growth in the month of July. Can you walk through why the net add activities have been a lot weaker than what we usually see, as well as what gives you the confidence that things will pick up over the rest of the quarter?", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure. As you point out, July we've had I think about 133,000 adds quarter to date so far. It's not that different from last year. We typically, when we look at the third quarter results we expect to pick up typically more in the latter half of the quarter.", "That tends to be a trend that we've seen historically, at least. But right now, if you were to straight line the net adds that we've had, you'd come to about 453,000. Clearly, we're expecting that to pick up right around the quarter, just based on seasonal trends we've seen previously.", "Matt Broome", "Okay. Great. Out of the 780,000 net adds in Q2, roughly I guess how much of that came from China?", "Jim Bidzos", "We don't break out our net adds by country. China continued to perform well for us this year, but so did the US, which is clearly our largest market, and EMEA continued to perform well for us as well.", "Matt Broome", "Okay. And then just one last one, if you could -- well, what's the latest I guess on timing around the ICANN contract extension for .com? That's it from me. Thanks.", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure. The .com extension amendment to our registry agreement is out for comment. That period ends in -- on August 12. After that, the Root Zone maintainer agreement and the .com extension contract both will be -- need to be approved by VeriSign's Board of Directors and ICANN's Board of Directors.", "After that, they'll be given to NTIA for approval according to NTIA's processes. The only firm date I can give you at this point is the close of the comment period on August 12, and then it's a series of approvals following that.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we move next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes thanks. Hi guys. Just following on that line of questions, I frequently get the question as whether, as part of this process or maybe soon thereafter, would you revisit the pricing situation with the Department of Commerce and have the market study done again, or is that really going to be thought of as separate and maybe sometime down the road?", "Todd Strubbe", "Sterling, I assume you're talking about the opportunity available to the Company to pursue some review of our pricing?", "Sterling Auty", "Correct.", "Todd Strubbe", "That's what you're talking about? Yes, unrelated to the .com extension, unrelated to the Root Zone maintainer agreement. I really can't comment on when we would do that. I would say what I've said before in the past, that I believe that there is some data that's trending favorably for us, in that ICANN has now crossed over 1,000 new gTLDs delegated to the root.", "I'm trying not to be too understated, but more than ample consumer choice for new gTLDs for consumers to choose from, and many of these TLDs are priced higher than .com. That data is helpful, but I really can't comment on when we might do that. I think there are a lot of factors we'd consider, and there's a process that we'd follow, but I'm not able to give you any information about exactly when we might do that.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. That's fair. And then on the talk of the marketing programs that appear to be shifting to the second half, if I'm not mistaken, I think we were in a similar situation last year, and the year before. What is the drivers behind the timing of it? And can you remind us, did you end up spending those programs in the back half in each of the last two years, or in some cases, would you potentially decide not to spend that money?", "George Kilguss", "Well, I think in general, Sterling, look, if we can find marketing programs that generate positive rates of return for us and drive shareholder growth, I want to spend as much money in sales and marketing to accomplish that. Clearly, as we get a number of proposals, we offer these programs open to every single registrar, and so they're allowed to submit them. We have to evaluate them.", "So we clearly want to make sure that the ones that we're pursuing and accepting meet certain financial criteria. To some degree, it really depends on the proposals that are being submitted to us. Others we direct, as I mentioned to an earlier caller, we're taking a variety of things into consideration.", "We're marketing globally, we're looking at certain markets, and there are clearly are things that happen, whether it be, I don't know, a Brexit, or whether it be something that goes on in Turkey or other areas, we may choose to delay a program, or because of other factors outside of our control. So there's a variety of things that we take into consideration.", "Last year we did spend more money. We did spend money in the second half of the year. But again, there's a variety of factors that come to lumpiness. Our intention is to invest dollars into the market that will drive incremental profitable growth for the business. So, hopefully that answers your question.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes, it does. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our last question from -- our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steven Ashley", "Thank you very much. I think I'd just like to ask the first question on the renewal rates, which have improved here, especially in the first quarter, but still at a good level here. Is that just mix of first-time renewals being lower as a percentage of total, or have you seen any change in first-time renewal rates there? Thank you.", "George Kilguss", "Yes, thanks for the question. So you're correct, our renewal rates are up about 1% year-over-year, our preliminary renewal rate in the quarter is 73.7%, as Jim mentioned, up from 72%. The improvement we're seeing is primarily in the previously renewed rate. That's up about 80 basis points year-over-year from about 82.7% a year ago to 83.5% this year.", "And that improvement in the previously renewed rate, we're seeing that both in U.S. and international markets. On our first time renewal rate, it's also up slightly, but we're primarily seeing that improvement in the U.S. market. On average, that first-time renewal rate is still around the 50% range, though.", "Steven Ashley", "Okay. Gross margins, 83.6%. I think that's the highest number we may have ever seen. What is contributing to that improvement? Is that sustainable?", "George Kilguss", "Again, Steve, we look to manage all our expenses, not particularly a particular line item -- in a particular line item. I mean, we've also had slightly lower registration fees in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So because there tends to be more new names in the first quarter, we tend to have higher registration fees for ICANN, than we have in the second quarter.", "So it's a little seasonal dip there from that. But we continue to look at our expenses across the board, add resources where we feel it's appropriate, but in total, we're really focused on that total non-GAAP operating expense as a key metric that we're looking to manage.", "Steven Ashley", "And in terms of the range of outcomes we could see from the Department of Commerce, if we get through the Board approval of VeriSign, if we get through the Board approval of ICANN, if this is sent to the Department of Commerce for approval, is the range of outcomes either thumbs up or thumbs down, or could they separate the two, and say we're willing to do the Root Zone but .com we want back on the old schedule? I'm just wondering if you have any color around that.", "Jim Bidzos", "The fundamental rationale for the two agreements is addressing the priority, as called for by NTIA of security and stability in the Root Zone. And that's the reason that the .com agreement is being extended, so that it can be coterminous with the Root Zone maintainer agreement. The two agreements are related in that sense.", "So hopefully that helps you understand that the two agreements are really part of an effort to provide security and stability during this transition process of Root Zone oversight from NTIA to ICANN. I think in that sense, you view them as part of an effort to assure security and stability during a transition process.", "Steven Ashley", "Thank you.", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will take our last question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.", "Priya Parasuraman", "This is actually Priya Parasuraman for Gray. Just a quick one from me. Could you talk about what's going on in China and whether you expect things to normalize there, and does the fact that you've been licensed change anything?", "George Kilguss", "Sure, Priya. As we talked about last quarter, we did expect the China volumes to normalize and at least in the second quarter, they absolutely did normalize for us. So at least what we're currently seeing is those are at much more normal levels. As far as the license agreement, I don't really -- I don't have any particular expectations.", "We've always operated in China. We've done well there. I think our brand is quite strong there. I don't really have any change of expectation, just related to the license, to how we perform. Anything you want to add, Jim?", "Jim Bidzos", "Yes, I think the license is important, but we have been operating with the approval of the Chinese government for a period of time, as they introduce new processes for their local registrars to follow. There was a new licensing regime that was announced some time ago.", "We've been in that process for a period of time, and as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we now are the -- as far as we know, the first registries, .com and .net to be approved. So we are licensed for those registries to operate in China, which is important, although we did expect that process would yield the result that it did.", "So I don't see any interruption in the availability of our products and their operation in China, so I think it's certainly an important milestone for us, but one that we've been working with the Chinese government on for a period of time. That in and of itself I don't expect to change anything from the registrant point of view. It just simply enables to registrars to comply with local law.", "Priya Parasuraman", "Thank you.", "Jim Bidzos", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Please go ahead, sir.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our VeriSign.com website. There you will also find our third quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.", "Financial results and our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "James Bidzos", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report another solid third for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.", "Before I get into the third quarter results I want to comment on two areas of focus for the Company. First, last week VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement, or RZMA, and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the Cooperative Agreement.", "Additionally, NTIA approved the .com extension, which extends the .com Registry Agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024 to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018.", "Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top-level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with this strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there are still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we are excited about the .web opportunity as we believe that we are well-positioned to make it successful.", "I will comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.", "As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter we continued our share repurchase program 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of September the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations.", "This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. During the quarter we processed 8.3 million new registrations. In the second quarter of 2016 the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015.", "While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include but are not limited to Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.", "During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume of these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace.", "Also, as discussed the last three quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal - the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015.", "While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base we still expect fourth-quarter deletions to be elevated with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full-year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2% despite a net decrease to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to George.", "George Kilguss", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $288 million up 8.2% year-over-year. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S., and 42% was from international customers.", "GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8%, compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million, compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year, compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year.", "As of September 30, 2016, the Company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.", "I\u2019ll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance.", "Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016, and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3%, compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015, and $0.91 last quarter, based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.", "Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares, based on the average share price during the third quarter, compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015, and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2016 repurchase activity, and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.", "Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter compared with $155 million and $157 million respectively for the third quarter last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call.", "Full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures.", "In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016.", "Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "James Bidzos", "Thank you, George. In closing, during the third quarter we continued to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long-term lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.", "We believe the two developments I speak of, the .com extension and our move to becoming the registry operator for the .web extension will result in security and stability for our customers and our business as well as long-term growth opportunities for the Company.", "We will now take your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Want to start with - can you help us really understand the net impacts from both the .com extension and the signing of the Root Zone Maintainer? It feels like there was a number of moving parts, but maybe summarize the net impacts of both of those on the business.", "James Bidzos", "Sure, Sterling. Let me try to just, I guess, factually state what\u2019s actually changed. First of all, the IANA transition was completed and the IANA contract between NTIA and ICANN was allowed to sunset. So ICANN is now accountable to the community under enhanced accountability mechanisms.", "Second, the term of VeriSign\u2019s .com Registry Agreement with ICANN is now extended to November 30, 2024. So, the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024 not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete, as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone maintenance function it has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN.", "Fourth, there are two amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone maintenance responsibilities and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018.", "It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement if we demonstrate to the Department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Those are the basic, factual changes in all of these various events of the last 30 days or so.", "Sterling Auty", "One follow-up to it on that last point. So, if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to expire, what does that mean for pricing? Do you automatically get the ability to raise prices? Will you seek a request from the DOJ? So what happens on the pricing front if the Cooperative Agreement does go away?", "James Bidzos", "So, if NTIA decides - and it\u2019s their process and their decision - but if they do decide to allow the Cooperative Agreement to sunset, as opposed to exercising their right to extend it - so, I don\u2019t want to speculate on that process because that\u2019s NTIA\u2019s decision whether to sunset it or extend it beyond 2018. I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision.", "However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there\u2019s a change to, or a termination of, or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the .com Registry Agreement itself contains something called the Cooperation Clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the Registry Agreement, the .com Registry Agreement, as necessary for consistency with changes to, or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, if that helps.", "Sterling Auty", "It does, but kind of still leaves a little bit of ambiguity. So, if it goes away and you renegotiate with ICANN, I would imagine one of the things that, if I\u2019m in your shoes you would be interested in is negotiating back the ability to raise prices. Or would you still be under a consent decree of the Department of Justice through 2024 to keep .com prices capped?", "James Bidzos", "So, I think I can answer part of that. I\u2019m just trying to avoid speculating. But in your scenario, if you are assuming that the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset and there is no other contractual relationship or provision or restrictions - relationship between DOJ, DOC and VeriSign, then VeriSign would negotiate in good faith, as we are both required to under the agreement, with ICANN to effect whatever changes need to be effected as a result of the sunset of the Cooperative Agreement. So, that certainly would include pricing, but I don\u2019t want to speculate what that would look like today.", "Sterling Auty", "Okay. Last item. So just to clarify then, really the cap on pricing that the DOJ effectively helped put into place is not like when a DOJ steps in and declares a company a monopoly and puts in a consent decree where they have direct oversight and capping. You are saying that the price agreement that the DOJ market power study helped is really just entirely encapsulated within the Cooperative Agreement?", "James Bidzos", "I believe that\u2019s correct. It\u2019s a fact that the relationship that we have with NTIA is the mechanism by which the price caps are imposed on.com and that NTIA, where appropriate for its oversight through the Cooperative Agreement, consults with DOJ on issues of competitive issues, et cetera. So, if that went away there would be at that point - if that\u2019s all that happened and the Cooperative Agreement sunset and there is no other contractual relationship that we have at this point. We don\u2019t have that type of relationship that you described upfront in your question.", "Sterling Auty", "Makes sense. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.", "Steve Ashley", "Great. Well, I\u2019m going to just pick up right where Sterling left off and just keep drilling down. So, because it is something we are all very interested in, if the Cooperative Agreement sunsets, who will control pricing? And you talked Jim about you would negotiate with ICANN. Would ICANN have the authority to set pricing, veto pricing? What we are just trying to understand where authority for setting and enforcing pricing would reside if the Cooperative Agreement sunsets on November 18, 2018.", "James Bidzos", "I don\u2019t want to speculate on what that process in detail would look like and, therefore, it\u2019s hard to say where it would come out. But it would, according to the language that\u2019s in the documents today, it would be the result of a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN.", "Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So, having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that will yield I think would be speculating. But I would observe that ICANN\u2019s policies at least are fairly consistent in how they\u2019ve applied pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program.", "There are a number of legacy TLDs, of course like .com and .net and .org and others. But it\u2019s just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are two years away. I think the main point is that the pricing imposed on .com at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC, so that mechanism goes away. But in terms of what happens and who has the authority, it\u2019s a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN. That much is factual.", "Steve Ashley", "Great. And then I would just like to ask a question on deferred revenue. It declined sequentially from - not a lot, a little bit, for the second time consecutively. That hasn\u2019t been kind of the norm over the past years. Is there any comment around the small sequential decline in deferred revenue we are seeing?", "George Kilguss", "Nothing other than it typically does slow down as the year progresses. Typically, at least historically we used to have very large registrations in the first quarter, so we\u2019d get a bump in deferred revenue and it would decline sequentially over the years. More recently that bump in Q1 has gotten less and so some of the changes year-over-year have rolled through, but nothing material that I am aware of, Steve.", "Steve Ashley", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.", "Walter Pritchard", "Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One on - you\u2019ve been pretty clear on the Q4 trajectory given what happened last year. Can you talk about how you look at that into Q1?", "George Kilguss", "So, Walter this is George. We\u2019ll give you Q1 guidance on our fourth quarter call. But, again, the reason for the large range that we put in place this particular quarter is the fact that it was a fairly large amount of names that came up for renewal, or will come up for renewal in this quarter.", "And the cohort, or the type of names that they are, they are related to a Chinese investment community, we really don\u2019t have a tremendous amount of data around that. And so we are really waiting to take a look at those names as they come up for renewal in the middle of November and early December we will get a better look at that, and once we have a better look at that it will give us a little more clarity into Q1.", "But we have always said, the Q4 is a relatively unique event. There\u2019s over 4 million names that are really coming up for renewal as a result of the demand that happened last year. And so we are really waiting to take a look at that before we provide guidance to Q1.", "Walter Pritchard", "And then, George, just on the expenses, you had a very good I guess, the expenses very low, declining year-over-year by about 3% in the quarter. Can you talk about the sustainability, I guess, first the source of the expense decline year-over-year and then the sustainability of that trajectory as you look into Q4 and beyond?", "George Kilguss", "Yes. I would say, as you have commented on, I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of trying to keep expenses level. When you talk about year-over-year you are looking at the third quarter. And I think it\u2019s probably more appropriate to look at the nine months because things can move from quarter-to-quarter. And when I look at the nine months on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You are correct there. But we are seeing some movement between the groups.", "So, we\u2019ve seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We\u2019ve got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we\u2019ve talked about that. It\u2019s been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there and I would think that\u2019s really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. As we talked about last quarter, I believe we did close our Indian Development Corporation over there last year and so we are getting some benefits from a labor perspective through the P&L at the present time.", "And then G&A is up a little bit. We do have some slightly higher labor and we\u2019ve incurred some higher legal costs this quarter. As far as your questions to the sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the Company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis. And we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies, but at the same time we are not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic.", "As the cyber environment continues to evolve we absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining the security and stability of the business. So, we will continue to be vigilant on that, but to date we\u2019ve done a good job of keeping them in the range where they\u2019ve been historically.", "Walter Pritchard", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We are taking a follow-up question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. That\u2019s also our final question.", "Sterling Auty", "Yes, just a housekeeping follow-up question. Can you remind us what the total number of names that are up for renewal in the fourth quarter and if you are willing to give it for the first quarter, so March actually, are?", "George Kilguss", "Yes, a couple of data points. The names that were up for renewal this quarter was 28.7 million and the names that are up for Q4 are going to be 32 million names that are up for renewal.", "Sterling Auty", "All right. Great. And how about March 2017, or is it too early to give that?", "George Kilguss", "I would say it\u2019s too early for that at this point.", "Sterling Auty", "And actually - and maybe one other we didn\u2019t touch upon. So, early here in the quarter, so you\u2019ve got the guidance for the decline in the base, but there was a pop, actually, in the Zone file of like 350,000 names the one-week, including a pretty healthy pop in .net. Anything that you can ascribe the jump to?", "George Kilguss", "Yes, we ran some marketing activities in the quarter around .net and they were actually relatively successful. And so the team is evaluating programs to see if we want to run some more of those. But we had a marketing program basically, and those numbers are roughly right, about 300 names came in from those marketing programs.", "Sterling Auty", "And when you talk about those marketing programs, are these different than - I think about in the past that you ran marketing programs with registrars at the end market to spur demand, but are these those types of things, or are these incentives where maybe you are giving discount on registry fees on .net above certain thresholds, or anything like that?", "George Kilguss", "The programs vary from program to program. This was more of a program we were looking to see if we were in a short-term program what would be the effect of. Sometimes we run programs throughout the year, much longer-term programs and we are questioning the effectiveness of those compared to some shorter-rate programs, shorter-term programs, and this one was a relatively short program. We just want to understand the duration of programs and get some feedback as we think about 2017.", "Sterling Auty", "Got it. Thank you much.", "Operator", "That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David Atchley for closing remarks.", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open the call for your questions.", "With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 and $171 million in free cash flow.", "During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million. Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations.", "Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations.", "I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the six-year term, or fees paid to ICANN. Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July and we're pleased with the results of this issuance.", "Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net priced lower than other popular legacy TLDs.", "And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.", "George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.", "Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers.", "As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million, compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago.", "Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. (5:42) the second quarter include a pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09.", "As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed-rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering closed in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance.", "As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.", "I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017.", "Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter, based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Results for the second quarter included pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06.", "As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million, compared with $167 million and $161 million respectively for the second quarter last year.", "Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares, based on average share price during the second quarter, compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.", "With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion range provided on our prior earnings call.", "Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million, as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance.", "Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures.", "As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue.", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017.", "Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "Thank you, George. In closing, during the second quarter we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We have marked some significant milestones since our last call. In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another six years, earlier this month the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure.", "We believe our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trendlines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.", "We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you We'll go first to Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird.", "Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great, thanks. This is Matt Lemenager on for Rob. Question on the strength of the domain name activity, quarter to date, in the guidance, it's a little bit above maybe what we expected, at least a few quarters ago, at 0.8 million to 1.3 million. So as we think about what is driving that strength, is there any direction that you can point to us? Is it perhaps promotional activity, or international domain name ads? I don't know if there's any color you could add there.", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "I think probably the biggest contributors there are, there is some strengthening in the economy. There's more economic activity, which generally contributes to domain name growth. But I also think the strong brands that .com and .net represent, they're strong, recognized, trusted global brands, are showing their strength and contributed to that good performance as well.", "George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.", "The only other point I'd put on that, Rob, is as you saw in the first quarter, we had also good demand coming out of the U.S. market, and that strength in the U.S. continued into the second quarter.", "Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great, thanks. And then just one other question on the expense structure. Is there any expenses that are kind of more second half weighted? As we think about the EBIT margin guidance we've kind of been above, or at the high end of that range for the full-year guide. Is there anything for the second half, that's maybe expenses that are second-half-specific, that would cause that EBIT margin to come in at that lower end of that guide?", "George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.", "Well, we provided our guidance for our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year just now, but as far as how expenses flow, what we've outlined in our 10-Q is we do expense our sales and marketing expenses to be higher in the second half of the year, but we'll continue to manage all the expenses of the business, and we expect to be within the non-GAAP operating margin of between 64.5% to 64.25% just given earlier.", "Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.", "Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Hey. Hi guys, this is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. Just to expand on the domain name question, you said about the strengthening economy in the U.S. that is driving the growth in domains. What are you seeing within the international market currently, versus what you saw about a year ago? And how should we think about it going forward?", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "Well, there's a \u2013 let me see if I understand your question properly. By international markets, I can point to one thing that has changed. We did mention in several past quarters that the so-called China surge, which began in late 2015 and continued into 2016, including the second quarter, of course, affected renewals through 2017. We believe now that, that effect, the China effect, so to speak, has pretty much pushed through the system. So I think that might be a factor. Certainly, some activity I would point to in terms of international market.", "There is general strong growth in the international market. But as George pointed out, some growth in the U.S. market in the first quarter continued into the second market as well. So there are good signs, there's general growth outside the U.S. and then economic activity in the U.S. has contributed to some continuing growth here.", "Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Perfect. That's really helpful. And another one on expenses. Operating margins came somewhere around 65.3% versus somewhere 66% we were estimating. Any particular expenses that were higher within the quarter that led to the dinging of margins?", "George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.", "So we did see a slight increase in G&A expense in the quarter. During the quarter we purchased some additional software licenses for the core business, and we also had slightly higher legal fees in the quarter. But again, on a non-GAAP basis, we were pretty much flat. We can consistently be around about $100 million non-GAAP operating expense level.", "Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Okay. And if I could sneak one more in, where are you currently in the .web antitrust suit, and what is a normal procedure and timeline you're expecting with that particular suit?", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "Well, there's really no update to provide on .web at this point. With respect to our interactions with the Department of Justice, we continue to cooperate with DOJ as it pertains to the CID we discussed last quarter. That dialogue is constructive, has been constructive. We produced documents and information. We'd answered questions as needed, and we're meeting with the department. So that's an ongoing process, and beyond that, there's really nothing to say at this point.", "Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.", "Perfect. Thank you so much guys.", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Just I guess to start off, a follow-up on one of those last questions. I was wondering if you might be able to, George, put a finer point on the amount of excess G&A expense in Q2, just for us to get a little bit more of a normalized sense of the OpEx.", "George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.", "Well, I'm not sure what you mean by excess expense, Greg. I mean, we continue to manage all the lines of expenses throughout the business pretty much on a quarterly and monthly basis. And each quarter, there's always going to be some type of expense that comes in that might not have been planned or one might call non-recurring. But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view as non-recurring.", "As I said, in the quarter we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter, But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture. On a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount, and year-over-year, I believe it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there.", "We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis, and that's really a function of two areas. One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, if you looked at our website, we brought on an SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer-term incentive programs, and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on the results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerators that get accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that.", "But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other nits and that in the quarter. But in general, very consistent with the year-ago period as well as sequentially.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, just one other question. As you noted in your prepared remarks, you recently issued a little over $500 million in debt. Are you looking to put that to work in relatively short order, or can you give us an update on what you plan to do with the cash? Thanks.", "D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.", "Sure. So as you point out, we absolutely added some additional debt to capital structure. And as you know, as a company, we try to actively manage that capital structure. One of the things that we clearly look at and monitor is our ability to raise debt in the market, our ability to execute it, and also what interest rate we can do that. And when we looked at the market, we felt that where the market was, it was an attractive time for us to go add other piece of long-term capital to our capital structure.", "So as far as use of proceeds, as we mentioned in the offering, we plan to use those proceeds for general corporate purposes. That would also include potential share repurchases. As you know from following us, we don't guide to share repurchases, but we try to be very prudent with the capital of the company and we'll continue to look for ways to generate positive returns for the shareholders.", "Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And with that, I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks.", "David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

", "David Atchley", "Thank you, operator and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.", "This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site.

", "Jim Bidzos", "Thanks David and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter which kept the strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long term value to our shareholders. ", "In 2017 VeriSign delivered strong financial performance reporting $1.165 billion in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 2017 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base, in which the company processed 36.7 million registrations and finished the with 146.4 million links. During the year we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. Also last year we renewed the .net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. ", "During the quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million for $145 million. during the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. Effective today the board of directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which have no expression. ", "Our final position in strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.", "At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. During the fourth quarter we processed 9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter we continue to see strength from domestic registrars which was offset by a lower second time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surge names from late 2015. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. ", "We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 3%. For the first quarter we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. I would like to comment now on a recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8K we filed in January, in it we disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice's anti-trust division notified us that it had closed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. ", "We're now engaged in ICANN process to move the delegation of .web forward. However as this is ICANN's process we cannot say when it will conclude and while it's possible that our operation of .web will commence this year the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we will provide with updates as appropriate.", "And now I would like to turn the call over to George. ", "George Kilguss", "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2107 the company generated revenue of 1.165 million up 2% from 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of 708 million up 3% from 687 million for the full year 2016. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. ", "During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customer abroad. As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in fourth quarter 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago.", "Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total asset of 2.9 billion and total liabilities of 4.2 billion. Assets included 2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalence and marketable securities of which 729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. ", "I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. And then we'll discuss our 2018 full year guidance. ", "As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. ", "Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. ", "Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to the $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on $125.5 million and $124.1 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. ", "Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with $20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. ", "The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the $1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year. ", "Now, I'd like to provide an update on implications to the company of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I'll refer to as the Tax Act. ", "As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million consisting of onetime U.S. taxes on cumulative foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related for withholding taxes. Both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. ", "As a result of the onetime U.S. taxes on cumulative foreign earnings we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes based on current exchange rates. ", "Additionally, on a go-forward basis due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. ", "Also, the lower corporate tax rates and limitations on the deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act, decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we're presently evaluating our capital structure including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. ", "Finally, since mid-2017, we've used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead we believe the more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. ", "With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of 1,195 million to 1,215 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. ", "Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, and finally cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act including the impacts of our intended repay reaction. ", "In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017.", "Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.", "Jim Bidzos", "Thank you, George. 2017 was another solid year for VeriSign, there was further expansion of the domain name based and revenues, we generated an efficiently return value to shareholders, we renewed the .net registry agreement for another six years until 2023 and we mark more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. ", "Finally, or early with this year we discuss that the U.S. Department of Justice notified as closed it investigation regarding the .net top level domain. We continued our work to protect grow advance of business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We think our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution in extent the long-term lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. ", "We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. ", "Gregg Moskowitz", "In the third quarter the top five keyword searches for .com and while some form of crypto currency and black chain, how incremental do you think crypto has been in driving .com growth as over the past several months or so. ", "Jim Bidzos", "I don\u2019t think I have it at the tip of my fingers that pr\u00e9cis numbers but I don\u2019t believe that they are materially, I've seen a lot of activity in the secondary markets of trading in comp registrations that have crypto in them. But I don\u2019t think that there are any meaningful direct contributions to new net registrations in the numbers that we've reported. ", "There is just a huge amount of interest in cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin as you know now that it has the exchanges. And what we've seen I would say specifically is a spike in value in the secondary market of -- any multiple keyword names with crypto in them. ", "Gregg Moskowitz", "Okay, thanks Jim. And then George, you have told us that you would spend more in marketing Q4 and did and then I know I'm dating myself here, but I would have to go all the way back to 2007 to find another quarter where sales and marketing expense grew this much in absolute dollars on a sequential basis. So, can you maybe just sort of give a little bit more color on the activities that you undertook in Q4 as well as what the sales and marketing strategy is for 2018?", "George Kilguss", "Sure. I mean keep in mind though on an annual basis, our total marketing expense is pretty flat year-over-year. As I talked about few quarters ago, we clearly look to execute on marketing programs, that we think drive the best returns for the company and sometimes those programs we have to pivot during the year and we had lighter marketing expenses as we've talked about in the middle of 2017 and we finally got some programs coming out. We didn't make a little bit of a shift away from some register our marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We did some advertising for our brands both .com and .net both domestically and abroad. And so, we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here.", "Gregg Moskowitz", "Okay, great. And then just one last question for me. Can you expand on why your cash taxes are so much higher in 2018? And as part of that is the [indiscernible] tax yield associated with the convert? Is that less valuable going forward under tax reform?", "George Kilguss", "Yes. So as mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a GAAP perspective, we made an accrual for the onetime transition tax and that was partially offset by the revaluation of our DTLs and from a GAAP perspective that was about $9 million. ", "From a cash tax perspective, as you mentioned we're guiding to $70 million to $90 million in 2018 and that's up from about $28 million this year. As mentioned this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act including the impacts of our impended repatriation. And while I don't think it make sense with all the puts and takes with the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax on foreign earnings and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions partially offset by the U.S. tax rate but that amount does include impact as well from our repatriation. ", "As far as interest limitations U.S. tax reforms clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense, there are some limitations there. And as a result, I mentioned we are looking at our entire capital structure, we're looking at it, we'll be evaluating it. And as our convert to part of that capital structure we'll look at them as well.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Rob Oliver with Baird. ", "Matt Lemenager", "Good afternoon this is Matt -- in for Rob. I realize I might be early, but just looking to see if there is any plan around .web? Maybe things around go-to-market, how that might look, any different than .com would you be doing extra marketing just to get that brand up and going. Any early thoughts I realize, no expectation in the guidance or anything but any early thoughts. ", "Jim Bidzos", "I think it's just too early at this point to discuss any details about go-to-market or launch plan for .web. because an ICANN process that we are now engaged in with Department of Justice having closed their investigation of .web and when that process completes, I'm sure we will have a lot more to say but at this point would just be premature. ", "Matt Lemenager", "And on the expectations for domain growth 2% to 3% for this year, any difference in the expectations for U.S. versus international, I know you talked about strength in the economy in the United States and that the China phenomenon has kind roll of, I don\u2019t know if any of the international markets were starting to come back. ", "George Kilguss", "In 2017 we absolutely have seen a good U.S. market but have been said that European markets have also done well for us, our expectation is that we will see good growth in both U.S. and international markets next year but we don\u2019t guide to the specific markets over their performances. ", "Matt Lemenager", "Got it and the last question I had, on the repatriation. Would it be fair to assume that the primary use case would be for share repurchases or do you think there would be other avenues that you would look to deploy the repatriated cash?", "George Kilguss", "Well, I think in general, I don\u2019t think there will be a change in how we approach capital allocation. As always, we look to need to business using our strategic frame work of protect, grow and manage and we do what we think is best for the business. As you may recall our strategic frame work includes making sure we maintain and adequate amount of liquidity for the business both today and for tomorrow, what we think the needs are to continue to invest in our protect mission for the network and our business for today and tomorrow, to invest in technology and innovation that we think will drive profitable growth for the business and then once we accomplish those goals, we then evaluate how much excess capital we think appropriate to return to shareholders and in what form. We think that frame work which we have been using for the past six years as service well and we will continue to use that frame work as it relates to the capital corporation. ", "Operator", "We will go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. ", "Ugam Kamat ", "This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. So, Jim, you mentioned that the renewal rate out of China was disappointing, especially the second-time renewal rate. So just wondering what was the renewal rate especially in China? Like you gave the blended renewal rate, but just wondering, what was the renewal rate in China? And how many names are left? And what would be the future renewal rates that you expect to come out from this region?", "George Kilguss", "We don\u2019t guide renewal rates by country as mentioned the cohort that was originally from the 2015 China search that cohort was about 1.4 million names coming into the year and that renewal rate was probably out of blended basis may be about 40%, for that cohort. So, we did have a portion of those names come out, however we were anticipating that, we did comment on that last quarter and that was in the guidance that we gave and we fell within the range of the guidance but most of that cohort now is I would say through the system if many material names. I would expect renewal rates to go back to more normalized rates. ", "Ugam Kamat ", "All right, perfect. That's helpful. And secondly, since we are coming closer to the Cooperative Agreement date in October, any particular update that you can give us on the process that you're having with the Department of Commerce? Or any particular survey that they might have done to allow the renewal of Cooperative Agreement or just allow it to expire?", "Jim Bidzos", "Well, first of all, I guess just to remind everybody on the call. In late September 2016, NTIA approved the .com registry agreement to be extended to November 30, 2024. At that time, NTIA chose not to extend the cooperative agreement. So, it is currently scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2018. Whether to extend that cooperative agreement or not as NTIA's decision and their process. And so, I can't comment on that. they have the right to conduct the public interest review for the sole purpose of terminating whether or not they will exercise their right to extend the term of the cooperative agreement. ", "Now one update that is new since the last time we've talked is that David Redl was confirmed as the assistant secretary and administrator of the NTIA in that November of 2017. Unfortunately, there is no update I can give you there, we can't comment on Mr. Redl's appointment or the NTIA in regard to their progress related to the cooperative agreement that's theirs not ours. As soon as we can, we'll share whatever information we do have though. ", "Operator", "we'll take our last question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. ", "Walter Pritchard", "Hi thank. I think all my questions have been answered. Just one I wanted to make sure I clarified. On the tax scenario that you've outlined the $70 million to $90 million in the tax reform out of 22%. Does that contemplate within in the convert. And if not does the redeem of the convert potentially have additional tax impact beyond what you've talked about. ", "George Kilguss", "So, Walter as I mentioned, we're just evaluating our convertible debentures in conjunction with evaluating our capital structure. So, we're still looking at that. So, our guidance is really based on where we see today or what we're doing it, it's doesn't involve looking at any changes from that fact. We're still evaluating it. ", "Walter Pritchard", "And then is that 70 to 90 cash tax rate, it sounds like that doesn't mean, most companies are talking about having an 8 year [Technical Difficulty].", "George Kilguss", "Yeah so, I think you're referring to the transition tax, Tax Act allows you to look at your taxes and what they would have been with the Tax Act or without. So, it's a with or without calculation. And for us when we do that calculation, we expect to actually defer that amount of tax over the 8 years allowed by the Tax Act. ", "Walter Pritchard", "Okay. So, the 70 to 90 will that be a pretty good number of the next say several years. That include that 8-year period too?", "George Kilguss", "So, as we mentioned previously, we don't guide to a long-term cash tax rate. However, I would say in the short term we expect that that rate to still be below our GAAP tax rate as we use up foreign tax credits. At the end of 2017 we had about $122 million of foreign tax credits. And we now expect to utilize those over the next 2 to 3 years.", "Walter Pritchard", "But the 70 to 90 does includes still the benefit of some of those foreign tax credits and then those would expire at some point here. ", "George Kilguss", "That\u2019s correct.", "Walter Pritchard", "Okay, any good detail on how much per year you can use of that 122?", "George Kilguss", "Like I said they will probably full utilize it over the next three years, so obviously you\u2019re using more up in the year one and two and probably less in year three but the utilization of FTC to be perfectly candid is somewhat complex and is depended on a variety of factors, so it\u2019s a little bit, clearly I have an idea of what they will be but it's probably premature to give that number because they can change overtime depending on how foreign income is recognized overseas.
