(NYSE:UHS) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2017  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Alan Miller - CEO", "Steve Filton - CFO", "Analysts", "Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital", "Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank", "Sarah James - Piper Jaffray", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citi", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "Ann Hynes - Mizuho Securities", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Toni, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. And we welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services Results for the First Quarter ended March 31, 2017.", "During this call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended on December 31, 2016.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $2.12 for the quarter. After adjusting for the favorable impact from our January 1 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as discussed in our press release and the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records, applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $2.10 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.", "On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 4.8% during the first quarter of 2017. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions, and a 0.4% decrease in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 19.7% during the first quarter of 2017 from 21.1% during the first quarter of 2016.", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 1.4% during the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.4%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.2% over the prior year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 1.1% during the first quarter of 2017 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division increased to 25, excuse me, decreased to 25.6% during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 27.5% during the comparable prior year period.", "Our cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $483 million during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $475 million in the first quarter of 2016. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined slightly to 50 days during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 51 days during the first quarter of last year. Our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization declined to 45.2% at March 31, 2017 as compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We spent $144 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2017.", "Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Joanna Gajuk", "This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. So first on the psych business, if I may. So same-store revenue growth decelerated, right, to 1.4% from like a 2% growth, call it, from second half of '16, right? So there's probably a leap year impact there, right, which maybe the 100 basis points, is that right?", "Steve Filton", "Correct.", "Joanna Gajuk", "And then, was there also maybe some headwinds still from the exchange rates, right, because in the Q4, you said it was about 100 basis points. So was it also in that ballpark?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I think it was a little bit lower, but yes, we have the same sort of directionally currency impact in the quarter.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Okay. So I guess if you adjust for those two things for the leap year and the exchange rate, so maybe your kind of say, core sort of same-store revenue growth was maybe 3%, 3.5%. So what I'm getting at, and the main question that I have here is last quarter you kind of talked about your expectations for that business to come back to a 5% call it, same-store revenue growth by the end of the year. So do you feel like in traction, you're getting towards the target, and how you're going to get there whether it's 3% or 3.5% kind of starting point for the year?", "Steve Filton", "Okay. Thanks, Joanna. Yes. So I think everything that you said is accurate, and I think for the most part, we feel like we're largely on track to continue to improve. I think we started to see improvement in our behavioral volumes and consequently, revenues in the back half of 2016. I think admission growth continued to improve into the first quarter, and we continue to adhere to our guidance, which is that we anticipate exiting 2017 at about a 5%, 5.5% same-store revenue growth rate in behavioral which would restore us to sort of where we were right around the middle of 2015 when we started to suffer from labor shortages, both physicians and nurses in a number of our hospitals.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Okay, that's good to know. And a follow-up to that was -- so the one thing I've noticed was for the same-store length of stay was actually down 2% year-over-year. And I guess it was somewhat stable in '16. I mean, prior to '16, you had multiple years of declines but I guess '16, it seemed like it was stabilizing. So is there something that you've noticed in Q1? Or is there some impact from the leap year effect here? How should we think about length of stay in terms of same-store, and how's that kind of impacted the adjusted patient days?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So well, length of stay was down about 2% in the quarter as you note and that obviously has a muting impact on revenues because virtually, all of our reimbursement is on a per day or per diem basis in the behavioral business. The decline in length of stay was in our acute behavioral business. We're doing, I think some further analysis, but anecdotally, as I talked to the hospitals, it seemed like it seemed to be focused on the managed Medicaid portion of our business, but it wasn't really focused specifically on a particular payer or a particular geography or a particular hospital.", "It didn't strike me in the work that I did in reviewing it to be necessarily indicative of a continuing trend. And as you point out, length of stay has been relatively stable for well over a year now. So we'll see as we move forward, but, and I did notice that our public peer announced a similar decline in their U.S. length of stay during the quarter, and I don't know if they had any comments on it, but it seemed, we seem to have a similar dynamic.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman", "Maybe can you update us on your JV pipeline with hospitals that you've talked about in order to attempt benefit from the changes to the IMD exclusion?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean, what we've said before, Gary, I think is, remains largely true, and that is, we continue to have a large number of conversations with a variety of not-for-profit hospitals, largely not-for-profit, actually, some for-profit hospitals around the country about being able to joint venture with them in some way to help them run their behavioral operations. Some of those conversations have already been executed and acted upon. We had, as I think we've mentioned before, probably 7 or 8 existing arrangements that, quite frankly, have been existing for quite some time now.", "We announced a couple of new hospitals that we're building in conjunction with acute care systems last quarter or the quarter before that. And we continue to have significant number of conversations with other hospitals. We continue to believe that, that opportunity that we describe as acute care integration is probably our single biggest, at least domestically, the business development opportunity over the next several years. And we are very focused on it and devoting a significant amount of resources to it.", "Gary Lieberman", "So maybe, can you just update us on where you are in U.K. and the CMA review? And any remedies that you guys may expect to offer up?", "Steve Filton", "So we got the report from the CMA last Friday, late last Friday on the markets that they have expressed some concern about. The way the process works, is we have until this Friday to decide whether we want to offer a remedy, as they describe it, which would be the divestiture of certain facilities. We are, literally, as we speak, going through the process of cost-benefit analysis of whether we think offering a remedy is an appropriate solution or whether we would just rather go to a Phase II review, where we think we might have some fairly robust and valid arguments that might cause the CMA in Phase II to modify their position, and we have to see.", "If we offer remedies this Friday, the CMA has until May to respond to those remedies and decide whether they are in their minds adequate. And if they decide they're inadequate, we would also go to Phase II. So obviously, within a couple of days, we'll make an announcement of what we have chosen to do.", "Gary Lieberman", "I guess, maybe just to follow up on that. Have they said or have they told you how many actual facilities are under review? And if you do go to a Phase II review, is there any negative financial impact you've met?", "Steve Filton", "So there are basically, I think 5 individual markets that the CMA has identified as having some level of concern with. I think the answer to your question is if we go to a Phase II, we don't really believe that there's any material implication in the sense that, and I think we were clear about this when we announced the transaction, that because our presence in the UK is relatively small and the transaction itself is relatively small, there were no significant synergies to be realized by the combination of our existing business and the Cambian adult business. So any delay is not really costing us in terms of being able to achieve some measurable amount of synergies. So we'll make a judgment again about whether the costs of going through Phase II, how that compares to the benefit of potentially getting the CMA to modify their position.", "Alan Miller", "Also, were we to sell a facility or two facilities, there's a robust market in the UK And we would recoup whatever we sold the facilities for. So we have to see what that all means.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital.", "Frank Morgan", "Certainly, HCA and even then they actually called out commercial mix shift. Are you seeing anything like that in your acute business?", "Steve Filton", "Frank, I don't think so. We got some questions last night about the relatively flattish acute care revenue per admission and inquiries about whether that sort of implied some issues with payer mix. I think as we looked at our payer mix for the quarter, it seemed to be pretty consistent with what we've been running. And I would think that what is really sort of driving or the impetus behind that relatively flat revenue per admission are two things. One is simply mechanical and that is as we've talked about at some length, we opened our Henderson facility in the fourth quarter of last year in Las Vegas.", "As Alan mentioned on our year-end call, it's doing quite well. It's ramping up rather robustly, but obviously, its results and its revenues are in our non-same-store numbers to the degree that some of its business is coming from our existing facilities, and there's a cannibalization of some of our existing revenues in Vegas that's impairing or muting, I guess, a better word, our same-store revenues in the Vegas market. So there's a little bit of shift in my mind from same-store to non-same-store.", "And I think the other issue that we did see in the quarter was a bit of a decline in acuity. And again, nothing that I sort of view as worrisome or troubling in the sense that our surgical volumes were rather strong in the quarter. Surgeries were up 3% or 4% between in and outpatient. But our medical volumes were up even more, given the fact that our same-store adjusted admissions were up 5%, medical admissions were up even more. And the increase in medical admissions which tend to be lower acuity just skewed those revenue per admission numbers down a little bit. But I think that's more a function of a relatively robust admission numbers than anything else.", "Frank Morgan", "Got you. And on the ED, emergency department, ER volumes, what were those on the same-store basis?", "Steve Filton", "I think our ER volumes were up also, like 3% or 4% in the quarter.", "Frank Morgan", "Okay. Maybe, if I can, just on the behavioral side. I think you're acknowledging that you're going to see some growing momentum in census that started last year and carrying on. Could you give us any color on how that volume moved across the months of the quarter? Did you end, say, the third month of the quarter at a high note? Or was it flat? Any kind of color on the possibility of growing momentum in census?", "Steve Filton", "No. Other than what I said before, I mean, I think that stepping back from the quarter, and stepping all the way back to the back half of last year, I think beginning in Q3 of last year, we began to make some progress, particularly on this labor shortage issue. And I think our admission started to grow, albeit gradually and pretty incrementally, but we saw improvement in Q3, improvement in Q4, a little bit more improvement in Q1.", "Within the quarter, I wouldn't say there was any particular trajectory to point to, but again, over the last few quarters, I think that the trajectory has generally been incrementally positive, and we would hope that would continue through the balance of the year, and that certainly what our guidance is based on.", "Frank Morgan", "Got you. One last question. On the 5 markets identified by CMA, how many beds or how much revenue would those 5 markets represent? And I'll hop off.", "Steve Filton", "I'm not sure I know the answer to that question, Frank. I think what we're trying to, really more precisely, I think quantify is what other satisfactory remedy to the CMA would involve in terms of EBITDA that they would be asking us to divest. I'm not sure we certainly have a sense of what exactly that number is, but I would certainly make the argument that in terms of our consolidated EBITDA, it's a very minor number. We have a next question?", "Operator", "Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Rigg", "I got on a little late here. So hopefully this wasn't covered, but when I look at the behavioral segment, EBITDAR margin down roughly 200 basis points year-to-year. Obviously, there are several moving factors there, but you've got the leap year, you've got the FX, and then sort of the core staffing concerns that have been out there for a while. Can you sort of just maybe flesh out those 3 items, just to give us a sense for what sort of anomalous because of the calendar in FX versus sort of core pressure?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I think the fundamental issue, Chris, and I think we've been pretty candid about this for a bit now, is that with same-store revenue growth of 1.5%, it is extremely difficult to have, I think in any sort of practical expectation of an expanding margin. We think we need to get to probably 3% or 4% same-store revenue growth to even begin to sort of have the possibility of expanding margins. And if we exit the year as our guidance suggests that we will at 5%, 5.5% revenue growth, then we believe, we will return to a model where we'd have expanding margins. But I think the reason that you see contracting margins currently is simply because our current revenue growth is not sufficient to support the increase in expenses.", "And I think we talked about this in the last quarter or 2, the current expense load does incorporate some investment in solving the labor shortage problem. Meaning, in wage increases in certain markets that we've had to make to be competitive as well as temporary use of, or use of temporary nurses and temporary physicians, so there's some amount of what I would call extra or excessive expense as well. So until we get that same-store revenue growth up to a somewhat higher level than we are today, I think we're going to be faced with these relatively stagnant or even declining margins.", "Chris Rigg", "Got you. And then on the labor issue, and I'm not even sure if this is the right way to think about it. But can you give us a sense do you think you sort of fixed the problem, are you 80% of the way to fixing the problem, 50%? I'm just trying to get a sense for where you think you are in terms of getting things completely under control and sort of back to normal inflationary trends.", "Steve Filton", "I get asked that question a lot, and it's a difficult one to answer because it sort of implies that it's kind of a fixed or static issue, and you can sort of measure, as you ask the question, you measure your sort of percentage of achievement. And the challenge really is that it's very fluid and I think we've made a lot of progress on hiring nurses and physicians and filling vacancies. We've worked hard to increase our retention rates and reduce our turnover rates, but they're constantly changing. I mean, literally, every quarter, we're hiring new nurses, and some are leaving. I sort of think about it as a process in which we take two steps forward and one step back.", "We make improvements, I would cite, Boston is a market that was maybe at one point in time, our number one more challenging market from a labor perspective. We've got multiple facilities in that market, and I think all of them are really running kind of back to normal levels with the exception of maybe one. But a couple of other markets have proven to be a little more problematic in the interim. So I think we're making net progress, and I think that net progress is reflected in that incrementally growing admission number. But it's hard to peg it as a sort of a percentage of achievement towards the ultimate goal. It's sort of a constant and continual process.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.", "Sarah James", "So in the past, you've kind of framed up where you are with the labor shortage in terms of bed closures. And in the past, I think you've talked about making good progress being maybe like a quarter or a third of the way there, and with the goal of reopening all of the closed beds by the end of the year. Do you still feel like that's a realistic goal? And are you any further down the line towards reopening beds?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Sarah. I think as I was saying to Chris, we absolutely have reopened a number of units where we had closed beds. We've uncapped census in a number of facilities where we had previously capped census. And I think again as I was addressing Chris, on a net basis, I think we have less closed beds or uncapped census today than we did six months ago or nine months ago.", "But to be fair, I think we still have some places where we are still suffering from a lack of clinicians, whether they'd be nurses or psychiatrists. And we continue to address those as we go forward, look, I'm a financial guy, who's very objective, and I just continue to point to the admission data as really the proof in the pudding here rather than any sort of labor metric that to me, the proof that we're making net progress is that our admissions are growing incrementally each quarter for the last three quarters.", "Sarah James", "Okay. Then a clarification on the length of stay. It sounded like you're indicating that this is an industry-wide trend for the behavioral health sector. I just wanted to clarify that there were no policy changes that impact how you evaluate the necessary length of stay, that this was more a factor that you did not I guess, direct.", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So just to be clear, I mean, I'm not sure that I was bold enough to suggest there was an industry-wide trend, simply to note that our peer in the behavioral industry who also reported publicly last night had a, what seemed like a similar decline in their U.S. length of stay. So I'm not sure that's the same as describing it as an industry trend, but no. In response to the second part of your question, as we did the analysis, it is not apparent to me, in any way that we are changing our policies.", "Length of stay, I think is largely a payer-driven issue. And sometimes when payers put additional pressure on us, it takes us a little bit, a little while to get our response in place, et cetera, or even realize that quite frankly, we're under pressure. So there may be some of that going off, but we haven't internally changed any of our policies.", "Sarah James", "Okay. And last question here is on the joint ventures. For the ones that you're kind of stepping into like a Baylor or Providence, their large systems, how do you think about the time line to when you can start to have those conversations about expanding system wide? How close are we to that step?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think to some degree, we're already there. I mean, we have multiple arrangements with Baylor, and we have multiple arrangements with Providence. So I think that we've already demonstrated a level of expertise and competence that has given them confidence to do further deals with us, further joint ventures. There is no sort of prescribed time line in our arrangements or in our contracts.", "I think this is as you might expect with any sort of a vendor, the notion of gaining confidence from the company that you're serving, and hoping that in doing so, they'll allow you more opportunity and more responsibility. And again, I think we've demonstrated that in the case of both Baylor and Providence, and I think we'll, we hope to continue to do that with lots of other hospitals and hospital systems around the country.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice", "Maybe a couple of questions, if I could. You've obviously seen a nice strength in the absolute admissions on the site side, and especially, given the leap year day in the first quarter. I wonder, as you've drilled down, obviously, there's been some adverse publicity around the site business -- are you seeing any impact at all from that, that you can discern of maybe the facilities that have already been discussed? Are they seeing any different trends than the ones that haven't? Just and any, is there any update in discussions with the regulatory authorities that's worth highlighting?", "Steve Filton", "So I think that, at your last question, A.J., there really is nothing substantive to report on a sort of a status update regarding the large government investigation. There's really nothing new there. As far as your other question about have we really seen an impact on the underlying business since then, I think the most recent negative publicity began in early December, I think we've said a number of times, we've said it on the year-end call, and I'll just reiterate it today, I think the answer to that is no.", "We really see no response from our referral sources of any measurable note. We've seen no response from our own clinicians and a change in their behavior. Honestly, the single biggest reaction, external reaction that we've gotten to that and to the media reporting has been from the investor community, not from clinicians themselves.", "I think clinicians have tended to discount that reporting as being largely anecdotal and not an accurate depiction of what it is really like to run a behavioral hospital in the U.S. So no, I mean the short answer to your question is no. And again, I'm just going to go back and say Q1 is the first full quarter we had since these articles started to appear, and our admission growth actually ticked up in the quarter.", "A.J. Rice", "Right, right. Then maybe I could ask you about capital deployment. You guys just standout that your debt-to-EBITDA is approaching two, I guess, now the lowest by -- well range in the industry. You made an opportunistic buy of some shares in the fourth quarter, you slowed it down a bit in the first quarter. Is this approach on share repurchase really to try to look for the opportunistic situations like you had in the fourth quarter? Or you think we'll see a pickup in that? And maybe as an alternative deployment of capital for de novo projects or for acquisitions, what are you all seeing out there?", "Steve Filton", "Look, I'd make the one comment, being that the first quarter is the most difficult sort of the mechanical quarter for us to be a repurchaser of shares. We literally have about a two week window during the quarter where we are not in a quiet period, and just the first couple of weeks of March, and sometimes it's a little bit awkward to manage through that.", "Look, I think we continue to believe that we're very bullish about the prospects of the company's future earnings potential in both divisions and as a consequence, I think that we view share repurchase as an attractive use of capital deployment. And I think we'll continue to be an active purchaser of our own shares throughout 2017, as I think we represented we would be as well as continue to investigate other potential acquisition and deployment opportunities because I think our capital structure is such that we have a lot of flexibility to do both.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.", "Justin Lake", "I'm going to follow up on A.J.'s question for the second time this morning. I'd love to hear Alan, just your view, big picture on capital deployment. You've created, Alan, a lot of value for shareholders over time. And a big part of that in my mind, I've been covering the stock for pushing 20 years now, is how disciplined and thoughtful you've been on capital deployment, whether it was the original site facility buys, the PSY deal, and also, aggressively buying back your stock, even going as far as doing big ASRs and levering up to do them.", "So with 2 times leverage and a free cash flow, this 6%, 7%, probably the biggest question I get is how you deploy capital from here? So can you give us kind of your updated kind of state view of the world on capital deployment and M&A and share repurchase? I'd really love to hear it.", "Alan Miller", "I think that I'll reiterate that we are opportunistic. We've been in a fortunate position that we've been consistent with earnings, and we certainly have a big bank line and all the capital that we would need in the foreseeable future. So whatever is opportunistic for us, we take advantage of. Steve talked about difficulty in buying our shares in the first quarter. We think our shares, and I think the Street usually thinks that they're good values just not undervalue, but we're always looking at deployment of our capital, where we think we can do well with it.", "We're very excited about the 2 new hospitals that we built in acute care. We're excited about our acquisition in the U.K. our latest acquisition. We've got to work our way through it, obviously. But we're excited about all of those. So depending on what appears to us opportunistically in good returns, that's what we follow. So just to reiterate, we can buy stock, we can buy a company or a small company. We can build a hospital or a number of hospitals. So we have all of those avenues open to us.", "Justin Lake", "And Alan, can you just tell us what, do you see a robust M&A pipeline? I mean, the, obviously you've done some of those site deals that are certainly interesting, but you generate so much cash that the, I think people are somewhat surprised that you're paying down debt at these leverage levels rather than buying back more stock. I mean, are there mechanical ways to accelerate share repurchases whether it's an ASR or whatever, so that you don't run into these mechanical issues? And maybe that is just you're seeing a big M&A pipeline. So if you just follow up with that, that would be really helpful.", "Alan Miller", "I think there are all of those. I think we would like to buy shares. There is an M&A pipeline. We're very excited about the Cambian Adult business that we bought. Cambian was offered, as you may know, for the last few years, a whole company, which we weren't interested in, so we opportunistically bought the business that is profitable. We're very excited about that. We're excited about opening the hospital in Henderson. We like our shares. I don't know what else to say other than we look at all of these things.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "The first question I had was on acute, on bad debt, and I apologize if someone asked this. It did pick up, and you guys have all had a pretty solid 2016. So is this about exchange attrition or something else that's going on or just one-offs?", "Steve Filton", "So I'm sure people who listen to our calls regularly feel like I sound like a broken record on this issue. I always make the point that we never look at bad debt expense in isolation, that we only look at uncompensated care in total, which is bad debt and charity care and uninsured discount. And we also look at it as a percentage of gross revenue because it is impacted by our gross pricing, uncompensated care, the nature of our accounting will always be that it will increase at a minimum by the amount that we increase our gross pricing.", "And when we look at our 2017 Q1 uncompensated care in total as a percentage of gross revenue, it is exactly flat with the first quarter of 2016. So while I can see that bad debt expense increased significantly, I think that the total amount of uncompensated care really has not changed in a measurable way between Q1 of '17 and Q1 of '16.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. So nothing, no trends outside of the accounting for it. Nothing that you're seeing that should change the uncompensated care on a go-forward basis for '17?", "Steve Filton", "No. Look, I think we have acknowledged, probably since the middle of 2015 that, after a year and half, beginning in the beginning of '14 of uncompensated volumes declining fairly dramatically, that beginning in 2015, they started to creep back up for I think some of the reasons that you alluded to, Ana, which is that, first of all, I think that the benefit, the significant benefit from the Affordable Care Act leveled off. I think there was some disenrollment in the exchanges as premiums went up. I think some people got the care that they were looking for, and maybe disenrolled from the exchanges as a result of that.", "But I think that trend has been fairly steady. We don't see it necessarily accelerating. We believe we've incorporated it in the net revenue guidance that we give, so when we talk about acute care net revenue going up 6%, or anticipated going up 6% in 2017, that already presumes a slight and continued uptick in uncompensated care. But no, I don't think we're seeing any changes that we did not anticipate.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. Then moving on to behavioral. The slide say the length of stay declined, I think the question has been asked about that the revenue per patient day and the mix shifting to Medicaid, I'm assuming, is a piece of it. How much pressure are you seeing, if any, on commercial contracting in a downward? And should we think about that as it's going to be flat going forward?", "Steve Filton", "So I think we have talked about pricing, sustainable pricing in the behavioral division to be in the kind of 1% to 2% range. So when we talk about hoping to exit the year at 5%, 5.5% volume growth in behavioral, which is sort of getting us back to where we were before the labor shortage began, we're really thinking of that being composed of 3% to 4% volume and 1% to 2% price.", "If you look at our pricing for the quarter, our revenue per patient day, per adjusted patient day is right in that 1.5% range, particularly if you adjust for the currency fluctuation. So I think from a pricing perspective, we've been where we think we're going to be and we were in the first quarter. So I think on the behavioral side, the outstanding variable remains volume. And what will be required for us to get from where we are today to where we hope to be at the end of the year is an increase in volume.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] You have a follow-up from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice", "I thought that maybe I just come back. Any comments that you guys would care to make on what's happening down, and watching with the ACA repeal and replace, where you see that? I know, Alan, you follow pretty closely. Second, I know you've gotten a way from talking about your exposure, but I think it's relatively modest you perceive to some of the changes that are being made, but any updated thoughts on -- of the acute and behavioral and what your exposure might be to some changes? And then I guess, the third aspect to this question is the administration.", "The new administration clearly is asking for people to give them insights on what regulatory changes they might like to see. And it has been instructed in healthcare, there just doesn't seem to be that much, that healthcare providers or payers are bringing forward, at least overtly. And I wondered if there was anything that would be on a wish list that you guys might put in front of the administration in terms of regulatory changes that would be helpful.", "Alan Miller", "A.J., we got some information this morning, but I don't know what you could make of it. I don't think we're going to see anything in the short run. I mean, the House, the 2 sides of the Republicans in the House have been talking to each other. And this morning we saw a couple of changes, but they haven't come up with a consistent plan to be voted on, and then after that, it has to go to the Senate. So I don't think we're going to be looking at anything in the short term. I really don't. And I'm familiar with all the different changes that they've been talking about, but I don't think it makes sense to get all concerned about it.", "They're trying to, a lot of different things, they're trying to keep the insurers in line, and there's a lot of ways to do it, subsidy. We did go through this in great detail, but I don't think it's worthwhile. The bottom line is, I don't think we're going to see anything in the short term. I don't think they'll even get to a vote because they learned that it doesn't make sense to bring it up to a vote if you don't have the votes. I think Ryan is learning about how these guys, how it should work. What was your other question? Also, just give me a call, A.J.", "Steve Filton", "So A.J., I mean, you asked about our exposure. I mean, and look, I think the point that we made when repeal and replace was being discussed, was that we really have said fairly consistently from the outset that our behavioral business has benefited very little from the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, to the degree that it is scaled back. We don't think the behavioral business would be impacted much. I got into a lot of questions a few weeks ago when the Republicans first floated this idea of getting rid of the essential health benefit, and I'd made the point that I don't think again that our behavioral business has benefited a great deal from the essential health benefit.", "I think that the real benefit to the behavioral business from a benefits perspective was when mental health parity passed, legislation passed several years ago. And that's really what I think has increased and made more robust behavioral coverage around the country. And I think as long as mental health parity remains in place, and to the best of my knowledge, there is no conversation in any corner of the legislative activity that suggested that is in any way, is being tinkered with. I think that we should be in pretty good shape there. Your last question, I think about the industry suggesting regulatory changes, first of all, I think we would largely do that through our industry organization.", "But I think the second part of that is maybe why our lobbying organization has been not quite so aggressive about that is because they're really fighting the, what I think the big battle is at the moment, which is ACA repeal. And I think that's occupying their attention.", "Alan Miller", "Yes. The point that Steve made just bring us back to the point I was making earlier about all the changes. I mean, essential benefits, they've been arguing about it. So what they came up with was, it seems to me a very lenient way for all the states to get exceptions. So what do you have? Depends on what states, one which, have exceptions based on what? Of the essential benefits. So you really don't, we don't have anything to really comment on that I think that's worthwhile at the moment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "I hopped on late, so apologies if this was already addressed. But can you give a sense of same-facility EBITDA? And maybe what that was down year-over-year kind of on a dollar basis? And if you can give the contribution of maybe non-same facility, that would be helpful.", "Steve Filton", "So I think on the acute side, Ralph, same-facility EBITDA was down like 2%. And I would make the point that I think that was very much within our expectations. We were asked maybe even by you directly on the Q4 call whether it was possible that acute care EBITDA could be down in Q1, given how robust the numbers from Q1 of '16 were. And I think we said that not only was it possible, but I think we thought it was likely. So same-store EBITDA was I think down 2% in the acute. I think full non-same-store EBITDA was actually up 2%, and that's largely I think the Henderson impact that I discussed before. On the behavioral side, I think same-store EBITDA was down like 5% on the behavioral side.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then anything on the health plan business? Is that something you're still testing? Do you want to grow it? How's performance been? Just any thoughts there.", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I think we have said fairly candidly that the health care business in its first couple of years has been a drag on our acute care results and margins, but that we thought 2017 was an important transition year in which we would really minimize that drag. And I think, at least in the first quarter, that was the case, I think we had a few million dollars of losses, but nothing that I think materially impacted the numbers. And we would certainly expect that trend to continue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo", "I might just sneak one in here. Just looking for an update on foundations, and then maybe how that is trending versus your expectations. And do you think about getting much larger in the addiction space going forward?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. Whit, when we bought foundations, I think we acknowledged that it was sort of a transition period for the addiction treatment business largely moving from sort of an out-of-network model to an in-network model. And one of the attractions to us of the foundation itself was that it sort of had a blend of business, and therefore, we thought could and would make that transition more easily than another company that was really more exclusively reliant on the added network model.", "I think in the short period that we've owned them, they are going through that transition, and there's some temporary disruption. And we're working our way through that. I think we feel like over the long run, the demand, especially for addiction treatment services, is doing nothing but increase. And we still think it's a smart thing to have a significant presence in that business. And so we continue to focus on working our way through transition in the model by being able to take advantage of that demand as it grows.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.", "Ann Hynes", "I'm getting back to Washington since Trump is introducing his tax plan today, and based on our analysis, any change in the statutory rate is very good for Universal. With that potential change in capital allocation plans, any, maybe an increase of dividend or anything like that?", "Steve Filton", "So Ann, I mean, I think we would concur with your 20,000-foot analysis, which is that likely, almost any reform and reduction in the corporate tax rate would benefit a company like ours, which is basically a statutory rate taxpayer. But I think we're still so far away from any relevant details or being able to really calculate what the impact would be. It would be sort of wildly premature for us to say that we're going to take this windfall and reinvest it in a particular way that I think we're a long way away from that. But we'd certainly concur with the notion that if the Trump administration is able to advance tax reform, and I mean, incorporate tax reform in a meaningful way, we should be a beneficiary on that.", "Ann Hynes", "Okay, great. And on the de novo facilities, this seems to be a very successful strategy for you. Is there any other markets that you currently operate in that you see more de novo facilities?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean, in the, I think if you look at our history, one of our most significant strategies has been enhancing our existing franchises, and we've built new hospitals in any number of our existing markets. We've built 3 new hospitals in the Vegas market, and with the Henderson, that's actually the fourth new hospital that we've opened in the last 10 years or 12 years. We've opened the new hospital in Riverside County, California. And I'm not going to get into details because I think we have for certain competitive reasons, we like to keep our strategies sort of close to the vest.", "But we are certainly looking at other markets where expansion would make sense to us, where we have a strong franchise currently, and have desire to take advantage of a continuing growth in the market and strengthening our franchise in those markets. But yes, absolutely, that's a continued focus and likely a continuing strategy of ours.", "Operator", "And there seem to be no further questions at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. Well, we'd like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to talking with everyone next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Steve Filton. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton", "Thank you. Good morning. I am Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2013.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.53 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased 7% to $1.20 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2013, as compared to $1.12 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.", "On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.2% during the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 5.4%, and adjusted patient days increased 1.8% during the second quarter.", "Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 1.3% during the second quarter of 2013 over the comparable prior-year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year remained unchanged at 28.7% during each of the quarters ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.", "This year's second quarter results include approximately $4 million of legal fees related to our ongoing Department of Justice investigation.", "On a same facility basis, in our acute division, revenues increased 4.9% during the second quarter of 2013. The increase resulted primarily from a 2% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 2.9% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 14.8% during the second quarter of 2013 from 16.1% during the second quarter of 2012.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $258 million and $266 million during the 3-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in charity care and uninsured discounts recorded at our acute care hospitals during the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter of 2012 was offset by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, which amounted to $216 million during the second quarter of 2013 as compared to $164 million during the second quarter of 2012.", "As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debts, charity care expense and the uninsured discount in this year's second quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the second quarter of 2012.", "Our cash from operating activities was approximately $218 million during the second quarter of 2013, as compared to $246 million in the second quarter of 2012. For the 6 months ended June 13, 2013, our cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 9% to $406 million over the $373 million generated during the comparable 6-month period of 2012. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 57 days during the second quarter of 2013.", "At June 30, 2013, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 54.2%. Due to systems issues experienced by our fiscal intermediary, approximately $18 million of Medicare claims payments were delayed during the quarter. Fiscal intermediary system issues have been resolved, and the delayed payments were received in July.", "We spent $80 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to Austin Oaks hospital, a new 80-bed behavioral health hospital in Austin, Texas, which opened in May, and ongoing construction of a new acute care hospital in Temecula, California, which we anticipate will open late in the third quarter of this year. We are pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe first, we could talk about the behavioral business, specifically, looked like length of stay continues to be a little bit of a pressure there, but EBITDA growth is still strong. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? And Steve, maybe give us your thoughts on what a reasonable kind of long-term same-store revenue and same-store EBITDA growth or EBITDA growth numbers in that behavioral business in your mind?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Justin. So the length of stay issue is not a new one and certainly one we've spoken about before. We continue to face pressure on our length of stay and declines in our length of stay, primarily in our residential business and primarily amongst our Medicaid, the traditional Medicaid and managed Medicaid payers. In fact, we had very strong admission growth in the quarter, over 5% same-store growth in the behavioral business. So we have a view that when the length of stay issue sort of reaches its trough and levels off, which we think -- and I know we've said this before, but we think we're awfully close to that, that our revenue growth will pick up a little bit. If you look at the 6-months results for behavioral, I think we've got basically kind of 3% same-store revenue growth and a little over 6% EBITDA growth. I think our general sense again, is when the length of stay issue resolves itself, we can push both those numbers up a little bit. And I think that, from our perspective, is the ongoing trajectory of behavioral growth, absent any considerations surrounding reform and the benefits we might get from reform, which is, I think, we view as a separate issue.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And while I have you guys, last night, one of your peers put out a slide deck that gave some view -- gave their view point on what they think are the potential impact from reform could be. And they appear to think in 2014, the benefit to EBITDA could be double-digits, let's call it 10% to 15%. Just curious if you've seen that, and then any kind of thoughts from your perspective that you want to share with us in terms of what the potential benefit could be to your business from reform.", "Steve G. Filton", "To be candid, Justin, as you might expect, we're very focused at this time of the year on our own results. And so we did not have a chance to see the slide deck that you're talking about. I mean, in general, I would just say that we have -- we've been very sort of public about the idea that we think both of our business segments will be beneficiaries of health care reform and perhaps different aspects of it. But I think it's difficult at this point to sort of parse the benefit out between years and say how much is in '14 and '15 and '16, I think. And we hope that later in the year, we'll have a better sense of that, as we see the enrollment in the exchanges and the enrollment in expanded Medicaid. And we'll just have a better sense of how quickly this is playing out. But that's, I think, all we would say at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, if we look at the acute care business, I thought the volume number was really strong and the overall same-store revenue number was pretty good. And if we -- but if we subtract out and just certainly put aside any kind of malpractice reserve adjustments in the quarter, I'm just wondering why there wasn't more leverage on that type of same-store revenue growth.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that, Kevin, the primary explanation is one that we've talked about in probably the last quarter or 2. And that is, I think the margins were depressed primarily by costs associated with our newly-acquired physician practices and newly-employed physicians. When we look at it, our what I'll call our hospital-only entities, tended to show the sort of margin improvement that you're suggesting you'd expect to see and that we'd expect to see, and I think it's mostly those physician-related costs. Obviously, we view those costs as a significant investment in the future and think it positions us well for the upcoming requirements of reform, as well as just the way that markets and the landscape is changing in general. So I think we think it's the right thing to do, but I suggest that, that's sort of a short-term effect that you're seeing.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you give an update on the Las Vegas market? Looks like the minority interest number was a bit higher than we thought. Is that -- did Vegas here rebound particularly?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, I think that the encouraging aspects of the second quarter results, as you point out, one is just the overall strength in revenue in the acute division, which is, I think, probably the strongest revenue growth we've seen in some time, and then the improvement in the Vegas market. Those 2 items are interrelated to some point, but -- to some degree. But we definitely saw stronger results in the Vegas market in Q2. We've been expecting that. We've been talking, I think, on our last few conference calls about the fact that the overarching economic metrics in Vegas surrounding unemployment, surrounding the gaming industry, have all been getting better for the last 3 or 4 quarters, and that we thought it was just a matter of time before we began to experience some of that benefit. And in Q2, it appears at least, we began to experience the starts -- the start of that. So mostly, I think, from an improved payor mix in Vegas, we definitely saw stronger results in Q2, as you suggest, which tend to be manifested on that minority interest line.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So is this something that you feel like is going to be more sustainable in the second half of the year? There's nothing like unusual in the Q2 Vegas numbers?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I mean the only caveat I would offer, Kevin, is that sometimes these developments are not uninterrupted. I mean, I think we feel like we're certainly on an upward trajectory at this point in the Vegas market. But whether that, again, is going to continue on uninterrupted or could we have another soft quarter next quarter or a quarter or 2 away, that's possible. But I do think that after, as you know, several years of really softer performance as a result of the local economy in that market, I do think we're poised now for the recovery that we've been expecting.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe last question, I know that -- it looks like on the Medicaid expansion side of things that free-standing psych will not be covered for that population. Is there anything that the industry or you guys can do behind the scenes to try and change that position right now within HHS?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, the industry lobbied hard to have the IMD exclusion lifted, and I think will continue to do so. And we believe that it would be the right thing to do. I believe we're also going to pursue at the state level. And it's not entirely clear what the opportunities are to have states continue to apply for waivers for that exclusion. We're participating in the demonstration project that's part of the ACA that waives the exclusion in about 1 dozen states. So we're doing all those things. But to be fair, while we were lobbying as an industry very aggressively for the lifting of the exclusion, I think we were realistic about the chances of that happening. So I don't think that HHS's ultimate position came as a big surprise to us. We're going to continue to work to change it. But we're not shocked at where we are right now.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That's interesting, the state-level initiatives, I hadn't heard that. Is there -- are there examples of states today that have gotten waivers too, beyond the demonstration project that you alluded to?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, unfortunately, I don't have the information in front of me, but I will -- I know, for instance, that Louisiana is a state that has had the exclusion waived for some time. There are other states. I just don't have the information in front of me, Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe I'll just follow up on the commentary around Las Vegas. First of all, I think Vegas is still about 28% to 30% of your revenues in the acute care division. Would you characterize what you saw in the second quarter as being better than maybe was baked into your expectations? And if you think about the second half, when you formulated the guidance, were you assuming a turn in Vegas to play out or were you sort of assuming a steady-state?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, no, I think that, I would have to say, A.J., that the Las Vegas market outperformed our expectations in Q2. Obviously, sort of by definition almost, it means that some other markets underperformed. So I think if the question is, does it really change our view of how the entire year plays out, I'm not sure that it does. Obviously, as we've talked about for a number of years now, a turn in the Vegas market is very important to us, and I think just generally sets us up for stronger performance as we move forward. But I don't know that it changes in any sort of dramatic way our view of the remaining half of this year.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. I know you mentioned reform -- talked about reform briefly. But I know last time, you said you really hadn't had a lot of exchange-related contracting discussion. I'm just curious if you -- if that has changed in any way at this point over the last 3 months?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think it's fair to say, I mean, we've negotiated exchange contracts in most of our markets. I think, to a large degree, it -- those are with existing payers, and I think in most cases, it is either sort of an add-on or an extension of existing contracts that we have. I think that the real activity and the real changes are going to incur as enrollment takes place and it becomes apparent which exchanges get the greatest amount of market share, and they may be looking to change their networks, et cetera. So I think our view is that we're going to continue to be in a pretty kind of status quo sort of situation until this whole exercise plays out for another few months.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe lastly, I'll just ask you a couple of specific things on the psych business. Your legal expense of $4 million to $5 million in the quarter related to the investigations there. Is that unusually high because it's just ramping up, or is that sort of a run rate in your mind? And then also, just with the volume remaining strong, has your target on capacity additions there been tweaked in any way?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, as to the legal fees question, I'd love to be real precise about what the ongoing obligation is. But as you might imagine, unfortunately, these are largely out of our control. Those fees are mostly incurred in response to the government's subpoena. And we certainly work with and talk to the government and try and manage the scope of the response as reasonably as possible. But again, we respond to what the government has asked for basically. I do think there's sort of a front-end loading aspect of this. We sort of go from 0 to 60 almost immediately, as we begin to ramp up the effort to respond. But I would also say these are clearly going to be continuing fees. We would hope that they decline as we move forward. We would hope that the issue is resolved quickly. Obviously, we believe, for the most part, that there are not any significant problems in the segment. So that's our point of view. But difficult for us to project how this is going to go going forward. As to your last question or second question about capacity, we are very focused about the opportunities to expand capacity throughout the division, both in terms of responding to current dynamics. We operate right now at occupancy levels in the mid-70s, which means that there are a number of facilities that operate at occupancy levels that are quite a bit higher than that. I mentioned in my remarks that we opened a new 80-bed facility in the quarter. And we continue to work aggressively to add capacity, both to meet current demands, and to the degree that demands increase as a result of reform, we want to be in a position to respond to that as quickly as possible.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Steve, just one more question, I guess, on Vegas. If you look at the economic data, especially employment data, looks like things started getting slightly better, even back in 2011. We're seeing it in -- I guess D.C. is another one of your markets where we're seeing similar types of real strong trends. Why do you think it's taking this long? I know you talked about a little bit of an improvement in 4Q and you talked a little bit last quarter. But it seems like Vegas really improved this quarter. So I'm curious what do you think creates that lag and do you think that's indicative of maybe some of the other markets to come as well?", "Steve G. Filton", "Josh, I mean, I'm not sure that I'm the macroeconomic expert on this, but I will say that the lag that we're talking about is one that seems to have existed for a long time. We have seen it in previous economic downturns. And by the way, I think we see it on the way down, as well as on the way up. So if you go back and you look at the Vegas results, I mean, the economy in Vegas, and the real estate market, really began to collapse in '07. And we didn't really feel that pinch in our Vegas hospitals until late in '08. So we definitely experienced that lag on the way down, seem to be experiencing it on the way up. I think from sort of an anecdotal perspective, we view it as, as people get employed or reemployed, they don't necessarily have their benefits kick in immediately. And even when their benefits do kick in, I think that there is a natural sort of human reaction that the first thing you do when you get your job back or you get to a new job is you don't necessarily take 3 weeks off to have a hip replacement surgery or some other, we'll call it, sort of discretionary surgery. So I think that's the dynamic that you're seeing. And again, that was our expectation in the Vegas market, and it seems to at least be starting to play out in Q2. Will we see the same thing in other markets? Again, that's our expectation. It's a little bit hard to predict, but that certainly is our expectation.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And I think last quarter, you mentioned that surgeries were still weak in the Vegas market. I guess that was -- some of that was calendar, we know, et cetera. Did you get a rebound in surgeries as well?", "Steve G. Filton", "Somewhat. I think we saw our inpatient surgeries, which have been, quite frankly, declining for a number of consecutive periods, sort of flattened out in Q2. So it was a relative improvement. And I think, along with payor mix improvements, that certainly helped to drive the strong revenue growth in the quarter.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And then just parsing out the 1.6 same-store add that's [ph] on the acute side of the business. Could you give us a monthly progression? Just curious, was a lot of it April? You guys spoke last quarter about a good April when you reported. I'm just curious how May and June looked.", "Steve G. Filton", "I don't have it in front of me, Josh. But again, I think that when we commented on April in our first quarter call, we were really trying to reassure people that the weakness in March seemed to be relatively transient. My sense of the second quarter is that there were not huge differences in the months. It might have got a little stronger as the quarter went on, but there were not huge ups and downs in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Management.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Steve, I'm not sure if I missed it. Did you quantify any of the buckets of sort of payor mix seemingly improved, but just wondering how specific you could be on each of the moving parts there.", "Steve G. Filton", "So I think, Tom, in the quarter, the improvements came in our HMO volumes, our commercial volumes, which, again, have been down pretty consistently for the last few periods and were sort of flat in quarter 2. Medicare, traditional Medicare, was still declining in the quarter, but by a little bit of a slower rate than it's been. And Managed Medicare was up pretty strongly in the quarter. So I think those were the big changes that, again, tended to contribute to the strong revenue growth in the quarter.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just following up on one from earlier. You mentioned sort of the cost from the physician practices and employment as being sort of a shorter-term issue. Can you just remind us on sort of the outlook in your strategy there? I mean, should we be expecting you to buy more of those over time or have you done a lot of what you expect to do? Any perspective on that would be helpful.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think what we've -- our comments in the past have reflected is that we, along with, I think virtually all of our peers, have a view that as we move forward into kind of the new health care landscape that physicians and hospitals will need to be and will be more closely aligned. Unlike, I think, some of our peers, we've not sort of taken the position that the only way to accomplish that is through physician ownership and employment. And so we really view it as a market-by-market kind of an issue, and we're pursuing different strategies in different markets. But bottom line is, I think that we are working towards closer physician alignment in all of our markets. I think in some of our markets, that will mean more physician employment. But I think our biggest focus right now is in integrating the physician practices that we've acquired or that we've -- the physicians that we've employed, getting those practices more efficient, reducing the costs and the losses, and then, just very judiciously, doing additional employment and additional acquisition where it's competitively required.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Steve, outside of exchanges, can you give us just a sense of how much your managed care book you've negotiated for 2014? Maybe what the rates you're getting compared to this year? And then, more generally, is there more pressure or changes that you're seeing on how contracts are structured, whether be in terms of more pay-for-performance or taking on greater risk, et cetera?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Ralph. So I think probably at this point, I would say a good 2/3 to 3/4 of our 2014 commercial book have been negotiated. I think our rate increases are sort of comfortably in that 5% to 6% range. And generally, I would say we're not seeing huge changes in terms of more pay-for-performance, more quality, more payments tied to quality metrics, narrower networks. I think it's more business as usual than not. Again, I think our expectation is that over time and over the next few years, we will see those kinds of changes implemented more frequently. But at the moment, it's not like we're seeing a big surge of activity.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then can you give any update on impact of DSH on guidance or how you're thinking about it? I think last time, you sort of sized it as a $50 million headwind when you issued guidance, which I think was before the proposal that was a little bit better. So any updated thoughts there?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. So I think you've described it in an understated way, Ralph. You're absolutely right. We had about a $50 million annual reduction embedded in our guidance. So about 1/4 of that was embedded in our 2013 guidance for the fourth quarter. In fact, at least the preliminary rule that CMS issued would reduce that impact for us from $50 million annually to something more like $5 million. We've chosen not to revise our guidance or reflect that in any way at the moment for 2 reasons. One is the rule remains a preliminary rule. And while we believe that the final rule will largely resemble it, we'd certainly feel better when it's actually issued. And then, finally, I mean, the other issue that we have that caused us to have kind of back-end weaker guidance is we have, as I noted in my opening remarks, the opening of a new hospital in Temecula in Q4. And while we, I think, have a pretty decent sense of what the pre-opening costs will be, the actual results of the hospital and its impact on our surrounding hospitals are always hard to predict. So given that unknown variable, I think we're comfortable leaving guidance where it is at the moment.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last one, if I could. Can you talk maybe about your cash flow expectations for the year? I know some of the bigger projects are somewhat behind. So just kind of wondering what the step up in cash flow this year and maybe into next year. And just your general appetite, debt paydown versus share repo and/or more aggressive on the acquisition plans or even perhaps, on expansion as you talked earlier.", "Steve G. Filton", "The -- again, the variable in cash flow, obviously, is our earnings. And then, given the fact that we're leaving guidance unchanged, I would say that there's no change in that outlook. I think we're on pace to spend something close to the $375 million or so in CapEx that we guided to for 2013. You're correct that our big project, Temecula, will be finished this year. But -- and we certainly have not, in detail, completed our 2014 capital planning process. But I would generally say that I think we would think about our 2014 capital expenditures as being fairly comparable, maybe a little lower than '13. But as we think about adding new bed capacity in behavioral, as I alluded to in a previous answer, as we think about continuing to invest, particularly in the outpatient business on the acute side of the business, I think just generally, I think we see our capital spending continuing at roughly the current rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could be any more specific with regard to the outperformance in the Vegas market or, on the flip side, just the relative underperformance outside of Vegas. I'm just trying to gauge the magnitude of what's happening in the distinct markets.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, Chris, I mean, I think we try and avoid real specific discussions of individual markets only because it really gets to be sort of a granular discussion that I don't know is terribly appropriate for a forum like this. I mean, obviously, we have the sort of unique dynamic of folks being able to look at our minority interest line, which includes both our Vegas market and our Washington, D.C. market, and have a little bit of sense of what's going on. And you can see from that line that there's a fairly significant improvement in both of those markets in the quarter. And obviously, what that suggest is, I think somebody mentioned before or maybe we did, that there's some offsetting weakness elsewhere in the portfolio. I think beyond that, we're not really anxious to get into real detailed specifics about the individual market performance.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then just over the last, looks like, 3 or 4 quarters, we've seen sort of this inflection between the charity care number and the doubtful accounts. I guess, has there been any -- since we've sort of seen that inflection on the collectibility of the AR, do you feel comfortable with sort of the reserving there?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think the change that really is being reflected this quarter and was reflected last quarter, and I think we commented on it last quarter, is we did make a change in our charity care policy, which quite frankly, had the impact of allowing fewer folks to qualify for charity care and thus, allowing us to try and collect from a larger number of people. And really, I think it results in this sort of cosmetic shift that you see, which is a big increase in bad debt and a reduction in charity care and uninsured discount. I think our comment in Q1 was that, ultimately, we didn't think that it would have a material impact on our collections. We just thought that, around the edges, it might help us just collect a few more incremental dollars here and there. And that's really what drove the decision. And I don't think that view has changed at all this quarter. So I think the dynamics you saw in Q2 were a repeat of Q1. And I think our comments would be largely the same.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A few things I just wanted to follow up on. First, as it relates to the same-store operating margin in behavioral. I'm assuming you're including the legal costs in the same-store group. So that would imply, excluding those, it was about a 40 or 50 basis point improvement. Is that how I should interpret that, Steve?", "Steve G. Filton", "That's correct, Darren.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just as it relates to the professional liability reserves, when you sort of back that number up to a pre-tax number, it is pretty significant, and we've seen some fairly consistent numbers like this over the last several years as favorable adjustments. And I guess the question here is, can you just maybe update us a little bit on your process for actuarial reviews and whether you think you need to embed a different assumption going forward, given the experience that you've been having?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Darren. I mean, I think that, as you note, we have now had a series of favorable adjustments to our malpractice reserves over the last few years. And I think they are driven by, really, 2 dynamics. One is our actual experience, which has tended to be good, obviously. And that's driven by our own quality improvements and focus on risk management and risk reduction, as well as tort reform in a number of the states, particularly in the important states in which we operate, including Texas, Nevada and Florida. And then, secondly, I think there is a methodology issue. Our actuaries, historically,, have used a combination of UHS-specific experience as well as industry data to do their calculations. Over time, I think they have shifted more and more of that emphasis to UHS-specific data. I think that with this last adjustment, they have completely shifted to 100% UHS-specific data. And because we have outperformed the industry, every time they have made that shift, we have benefited from that. So I think at this point, I think we feel like, from a methodology perspective, because we now are -- our actuary is now basing their calculations entirely on our own experience, we ought to be on a more steady and reliable trajectory. So I think our view is that we have probably seen the last of these large adjustments.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful context. And if I just put that number into perspective, I mean, what time period would it have covered? So if I think about just a quarterly run rate that might be lower, what is it?", "Steve G. Filton", "So I mean, I think most of the adjustment is related to -- I mean, the entire adjustment is related to prior year. The nature, as you might expect, of actuarial work is there's far greater confidence on the historical period, where they can really -- they see developed losses, et cetera. I think on an ongoing basis, we would expect our malpractice expense maybe to benefit by a few million dollars a year. But again, I mean, I think what the $65 million adjustment really reflects is just simply that, in prior years, we were overstating our provision for malpractice in those years. I think -- in other words, Darren, I think we think the current year is pretty properly stated.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a couple of other things. On your net leverage, you're below 3x based on our calculations, and we haven't seen you get below that since you did the PSI deal, I guess. Can you just comment a little bit more about how you're thinking about leverage and kind of, go forward, what you think the right level of leverage might be for the company?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, look, I think the context of your question is helpful in my answer, Darren, and that is I think we feel like we felt before we did the PSI deal. And that is to run at a leverage level that allows us sort of maximum flexibility to respond to compelling opportunities. We're about to enter into, we'll call it, the health reform era. We continue to look for ways to take advantage of that. We've talked about expanding capacity in behavioral. We've talked about investing briefly, we've talked about investing briefly in outpatient opportunities on the acute side. As far as other M&A opportunities, we are looking at all of those in both of our business segments carefully and closely. And we feel like we have the balance sheet flexibility to respond to those as they arise. And that's, I think, largely the way that we look at them.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Last thing, just on the Temecula project. I know you've guided us to some bigger start-up costs in Q4. I wanted to just ask how you feel about those numbers going into the opening, we're getting closer. And then, Alan, I know you guys put this project off a little bit. How do you feel about opening in that market at this juncture, given where the economy is there and where things stand?", "Steve G. Filton", "So I'll comment on the numbers first and then let Alan comment about more of the strategic approach with the project. But from a numbers perspective, and I think I tried to say this in response to somebody earlier, we obviously have a pretty good idea of what we're going to spend to get the facility open. And I think we're very comfortable about coming closely within that budget. The facility will then open in probably early September. And what happens after that, for the last 3 or 4 months of the year, that's certainly something that we have less sort of control and less visibility over, both in terms of what happens at Temecula, the new hospital itself, as well as what happens in our nearby hospitals. So that's the piece that I think we think has, at least in the short term, a greater degree of uncertainty. And that's why I mentioned that before. As far as sort of putting it into context strategically, I'll let Alan talk about that.", "Alan B. Miller", "Yes, well, there's a dance between when you have to build a hospital and when -- how long you can develop it. Also, with an eye to competition, you want to keep competition out. So that's what we've done. We have locked up this market a number of years ago. And we're very excited about the fact that we now have Inland, Rancho, Corona, Temecula, we have a very strong strategic market position, and the hospital will open. And we have developed it for as long as we possibly could. And now it will open in September, and we'll be off and running.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citigroup.", "Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I just wanted to revisit something from earlier in the call. Sorry. Just going back to length of stay on the behavioral business, Steve. Just want to make sure, is that still primarily RTC, I presume?", "Steve G. Filton", "It is, Gary.", "Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And has the situation evolved with respect to, at all, which states are primarily driving that?", "Steve G. Filton", "As I think is often the case with any dynamic, it's certainly there. It's a little bit by geography. I think we've called out, for instance, the State of Kentucky, which has moved to much more of a managed Medicaid system, as being particularly stringent. But it certainly is not something that we could only point to 1 or 2 geographies and say, look, this is very specific to this 1 geography, 1 or 2 geographies. It is a pretty pervasive dynamic. Certainly, there are some states and some managed payers that are particularly more aggressive about trying to limit length of stay. But it's a pretty pervasive dynamic in the residential space within Medicaid payers.", "Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And any sense, I guess, when we first started seeing this, we thought perhaps there would be some pressure on length of stay, but maybe some acceleration eventually in terms of readmissions, I guess, for lack of a better word, as some of these patients are sort of recycled through the system. That dynamic doesn't really appear to be happening.", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, admissions remain strong, both in our residential and acute segments. So I don't know if that's a result of the dynamic that you're suggesting. We do keep track of readmissions, but it's not entirely clear whether admissions are benefiting, if you will, from this sort of recurring admission, if you will. But just generally, I think our sense is that we're approaching, I think our clinical people would argue we've already gotten to the point of sort of diminishing efficiencies of having this length of stay reduced, again, particularly from a clinical perspective. So our sense is that we ought to be reaching the bottom of this soon.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Ryan K. Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "This is Ryan Halsted, on for Gary. Most of my questions have been addressed. So I thought I'd just ask, I'd be curious if you had any thoughts on the delay in the employer mandate. Just any thoughts in general or specific to how it might affect your business?", "Alan B. Miller", "Yes, the delay is probably not going to have a great effect because it -- the employers, most of the employers are going to -- or the large companies are going to have coverage anyway. But the only thing I want to mention here is that it is a long delay. And all we've been seeing in Congress about the delays and these votes that they're taking to overturn it, I just think it's -- it looks like a waste of time because of the Senate being democratic and the President. So I just think things are going to roll out a little more slowly, but it's going to happen. And whatever effect we expected will be happening.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There appears to be no further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton", "Okay.

I'm Brent Turner, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration for Psychiatric Solutions, and I'd like to welcome you to PSI's conference call for the fourth quarter 2007. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning today through March 6 by dialing 719-457-0820. The confirmation number for the replay is 6726941.

For this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.

Thanks for being with us this morning to review a strong fourth quarter performance for PSI and another great year.", "The continuing strength of the PSI business model is evident in the 27% growth in earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter and 30% growth in earnings for the year. These results were at the top-end of our guidance for each period and after we revised our annual guidance upward on two occasions after first establishing it in October 2006. In this respect, we are also pleased today to be increasing our guidance for 2008 as a result of the recent decline in interest rates.", "Our earnings growth was driven by a 44% increase in our revenue for the fourth quarter and 45% for the year, both of which established new records for the company. Consistent with our historical performance, we produced this growth primarily through the addition of beds through our operations, the great majority of which resulted from acquisitions of inpatient facilities.", "We also benefited from solid growth in same-facility revenues of 6.5% for the year. True to our business model, this growth generated additional operating leverage, which we complemented through our ongoing initiatives to improve productivity and efficiency in each facility.", "As a result, we produced a new record for same-facility EBITDA margin of 200 basis points to 22.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2006. This performance was primary accountable for the 49.1% growth in PSI's consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and its expansion as a percentage of revenue.", "We remain confident about our prospects to drive same-facility revenue growth for 2008 in our historic range of 7% to 9%. We are enhancing our ability to drive same-facility performance for 2008 as well as aggregate organic growth through the planned addition of nearly 600 beds in existing and new facilities during the year.", "In addition, PSI is well positioned to continue its long-term acquisition strategies by acquiring at least six inpatient facilities during 2008. We have a strong pipeline of candidates, a favorable pricing environment, and the financial resources to accomplish our goals.", "In summary, let me repeat that what you have heard before as we consider our strong prospects for long-term profitable growth. Our confidence in our future rests on our ability to continue implementing a proven business model and growth strategy and an industry's growth dynamics remain very favorable for PSI.", "Simply put, we are the clear leader in a highly fragmented capacity constrained growth industry. While we never take execution for granted, especially in terms of providing the highest quality of care for our patients and their families, we expect the PSI team to continue leveraging our strong momentum for future growth.", "Thank you again for your time this morning and for you support of PSI. I will now ask Jack Polson, our Chief Accounting Officer to review our fourth quarter financial results in more detail.", "Jack Polson", "Thank you Joey. Our revenue for the fourth quarter increased 44.1% to $403.4 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA grew 49.4% for the quarter totaling $72.3 million and increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 17.9%. Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $23.4 million, an increase of 29% over the prior year, while income from continuing operations per diluted share rose 27.3% to $0.42.", "PSI same facility revenue increased 5.3% for the quarter, primarily as a result of a 0.6% increase in patient days and 4.6% increase in revenue per patient day. We were extremely pleased with the 200 basis points expansion of our same facility EBITDA margin to 22.2% for the quarter, which compared to 20.2% for the fourth quarter of 2006, as well as with a 70 basis points expansion in total facility EBITDA to 20.8%", "As we've discussed with you before we are confident that overtime we continue to have several 100 basis points of margin potential remaining. As we successfully expand same facility revenue productivity and efficiency. As Joey indicated, our financial position at the end of 2007 and our continued strong cash flow from operations, positioned us well to pursue our expansion strategy during 2008.", "Cash flow of $125.7 million for the full year was 1.6 times income from continuing operations. The ratio of total debt at year end to pro forma annualized consolidated EBITDA for the fourth quarter again improved sequentially to 4.1 from 4.4 times for the third quarter and 4.6 for the second quarter.", "Turning to our financial guidance for 2008, and as described in yesterdays press release. We are increasing our previously established guidance range for 2008 by $0.10 to a new range of $1.93 to $1.97, which reflects the lower interest environment since we first provided guidance on November 1st.", "In addition, we today established our guidance for diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2008, in a range of $0.42 to $0.43. As always our guidance does not include the affect of any future acquisitions.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, please open the floor for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Hey, good morning, couple of quick questions on some of the financials. First, in the fourth quarter I noticed that CapEx jumped up nicely to about $25 million, which I think was a record for the company. Can you talk a little bit about what was in that number, and maybe give us a feel for what we should look forward for CapEx in 2008?", "", "Joey Jacobs", "Yeah, I can briefly talk about that. We did have, I don't have the number exactly in front of me, but we had about 1.7% of CapEx in maintenance CapEx, the remainder being expansion CapEx. And that continues to be our expectation going forward with maintenance CapEx.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay. And then if we think about the same-store margins as we look out to early 2008, I know that ABS will be in the same-store for the full quarter. And I know you'll be putting on some new beds, which I would assume will enter at slightly lower margin at least upfront. Should we anticipate that same-store margins might come down a little bit early on in the year and start to rebound throughout the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "Ryan, this is Joey. I do need to make clear that ABS is in the same-store numbers for month of December. I don't know if everyone realizes that. We do have them in there and they will be in there for the first full quarter of this year. Same-store that we had for the first quarter of '07 was 20.4%. Hopefully our margin will stay at that level or above. They are in there for one month of the fourth quarter and our margin was 22%", "So, hopefully for doing our job, growing our census that our margins will hang in there and ABS is partially in there for the fourth quarter. So, 20.4 is the comp for the first quarter and of last year that we did for '07, so we will just wait and see, but I do think we'll have margin improvements.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, and then anything with that being in there for month at ABS facilities on same-store growth basis to that, move the needle one way or another during the quarter, either up and down or is that fairly consistent?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely it hurt as the same-store metrics on patient days.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "I think as many of you all know, and we talked about last year. The largest facility in that transaction was the 400 bed facility, Pines facility in Norfolk, Virginia, which caused the price reduction to occur. When we acquired that facility, because we knew at the time that the state of Virginia. I don't know if it was provisional or conditional was the status of that loss and we knew that this was going to be a four-year project versus a three year project. So, when we acquired it we had roughly a census of about 275 to 200 patients a day. And quite frankly over the next twelve months we took the census down to about a 190 patients a day, fixing that facility. So that would be impacting the same-store patient day growth in the fourth quarter because you are talking about, nearly 90 patients a day.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Yeah.", "Joey Jacobs", "So, once again we are very bullish on the Pines, it's positioned well, its census is growing back. But once again this project is a four year project versus what we normally say when we acquire a facility, a three year project. But that's been fairly communicated out there, but it is in our same store numbers and the 0.6 is very disappointing. We wanted to have more than that and we think this year that we will. Please everyone needs to keep in mind the same the 9% same-store revenue growth, that's an annual goal. And we ended up with 6.5, through the first nine months we were there, we let it slip away in the fourth quarter and we will redouble our efforts this year to make sure we are in the same 9% range.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, that's helpful color, and then two more quick ones, and I will hop off or get into the queue. Just on the other operating expenses, I know that came in a little lower than our model. I guess looking back over last few years, it appears that, it actually always comes down in the fourth quarter sometimes as a percent of revenue it has actually come down even more sequential than we saw this quarter, but is there anything you need kind of seasonal aspect so that they push that down typically in Q4?", "Joey Jacobs", "Two things occur there and Ryan the things are going back and doing the research, other expense ended up at 9.3% of revenue for the year and 9.3% last year for 2006. So if I were modeling for 2008, and what our internal budget shows, we are right in that 9.3% of revenue for that category. The only thing unusual to is that we've acquired Horizon on June 1st, so the third of last year we would be conservative in our accruals for such things as insurance in other areas travel, entertainment, recruitment those things, repair and maintenance there.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Right.", "Joey Jacobs", "And our fourth quarter is always a quarter where we true those up for the whole year. And I think you saw in last year of '06 that it had been running above nine, drops below nine for the fourth quarter and it did it this year. So this is what occurred there, but as far as modeling for 2008, a little guidance there I would use 9.3, because it's been that number for the past two years.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Perfect, and then last one just got some questions about the [MedCal] cuts, that doesn't impact you because you have all acute there right. So you don't really have any California Medicaid, is that fair to say?", "Joey Jacobs", "That is fair to say that those cuts are not really impacting us.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Perfect. Alright, thanks, guys.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Adam Feinstein with Lehman Brothers.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Joey Jacobs", "Hey, Adam.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "I guess several questions here and just a follow-up on the question on the other operating expense line. So your point is always that you'll continue to see it run at about 9.3% of revenues. But even just looking besides the percentages the absolute dollar is being down, I guess is what I was having a hard time reconciling. So if we go back to 9.3 it would imply that the dollars will go up in the first quarter by about $6 million.", "Once again, can we just talk through that, I understand that [hordes] may have taken that number up in the third quarter. But just once again looking at the absolute dollar just trying to better understand that trend? And then I have a couple of follow-up questions.", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure Adam, now quite frankly I am optimistic that we can bring it in below 9.3 for this year. But usually we don't give guidance out for individual specific items like that. So though that may have been just a little overstatement in the accruals for the third quarter and we true them up in the fourth quarter, so if we were to take $1 million, just for an example, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the number or anything because I haven\u2019t gone back and done the detail or if you took $1 million and added, you know, took it from one quarter put it into the next quarter, it doesn\u2019t take a lot to move those numbers around there percentage wise so we\u2019re very comfortable with the 9.3. And the fourth quarter historically is a quarter where we do focus on expense management because between Thanksgiving and January 1st we know our census is going to drop and we\u2019re managing as much as the expense items as we can, and if that means postponing travel or some expenses that we can postpone we will do that. That\u2019s the reason you see the seasonality I think in the fourth quarter.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and then just a follow up on another cost line item is just the bad debt expense, you guys have made some progress there. So I guess just comments, how much of the improvement was just from the acquisitions getting better?", "Joey Jacobs", "We had a great bad debt month. We had a consistent great bad debt year. I think it came in at 1.9% for the year so and that\u2019s comparable to the previous year. I will say that ABS that our folks there have done a good job since that acquisition and so we are positive there, the facility that had bad debt issues with Horizon, we have been working hard on that facility too.", "So there has been a lot of work by our business office directors in all of our facilities, and our CFOs and our division business office people. So that's just a lot of effort on good work, and once again, with us, we've said it many times before, always use four quarters for us. Always use four quarters for us when you are looking at trends and whatever and we think bad debt came in right where it should have come in.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and then just, with respect to the first quarter, I guess, the Easter holidays little bit earlier this year, just trying to factor that in, but then you do have an easier comp in the first quarter because you had a very robust same-store revenue growth last year in the first quarter. So, can you just talk around that, in terms of any items that will impact Q1 that we should be thinking about?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, the only thing really Adam, the only thing Adam that you should really think about is the Pines facility. You do not grow 80 patients back in one month or two months or three months. We are growing that facility back, and I think its census now has tripped back over 200 patients there so, it will take us all year to get back to that 275-280 number so, that's going to hurt us during the first, second and third quarters, but we are going to go through that.", "Now, on the benefit side, we will have beds coming online at existing facilities. so, we are very optimistic, we think that 7% to 9% revenue growth and the 3% to 5% patient day growth is there for us this year. It's just going to be execution from us and we are, some people say how do you feel about the 6.5 for last year and the 5.3 I think for the fourth quarter, how do I feel? Mad, frustrated. It was there for us, it was our game to win, and we just let it slip away, so we are working very hard on that Adam.", "Easter is in March, absolutely and as folks that follow the company know we are very seasonal, because of child and adolescent population that when schools are out the census will be soft. So we are not the Easter spring breaks yet, so we don't know how much that impacts us but that will be a factor.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and it's one final question and then I will get back in the queue here. The 7% to 9% number, we've been talking about that for a long time as the company grows you did 6.5% this year, still pretty close in the same ballpark, but obviously a little bit lower. At some point do you started to thinking about a 6% to 8% type of growth number instead of always having to be 7% to 9%. I know for '09 you are saying that you still feel comfortable with the 7% to 9%, but you think as we look out past 2008, should we think about maybe a little bit different range or, I know it's hard to answer that but certainly just\u2026", "Joey Jacobs", "I will be glad to answer it Adam. We just had some bad luck last year, that 7% to 9% was well with in our grasp and we just had some bad luck. We're already off to a better start this year, with all these beds being built and with many of those beds being built in the third and the fourth quarter. I think it positions us well for 2009, even be more strongly in our determination to beat the 7% to 9% revenue growth. So we have too many things going our way, this year some of the troubled facilities will get better. We are building more beds and building more programs and so the 7% to 9% was in our grasp for 2007 and we have missed it by 50 basis points and I pissed about that, but we've regrouped and we're targeted for that for 2008, and we'll going to make it happen.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess just to follow-up on some of the comments you made about some of the enhancements you're making to get back in to the 7% to 9% organic growth range. So if you can just give us some commentary around some of the things that you're doing just operationally to enhance growth that would be helpful. I know obviously additional beds help in capacity constrained markets. But maybe just talk a little bit about what you might be doing differently on an operational basis? Thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure, Adam. Just like when you have a family of facilities and as I mentioned earlier the Pines is the one impacting at the most for us, but if you were just to take our bottom three facilities not the bottom ten just our bottom three facilities, and if we focus on them and get them on the right track, we would have done well about 7% for last year. So quite frankly we can get above 7% in '08 just by doing what we did last year and just working on these three facilities.", "Now in addition to that we have more than 600 beds coming online for us in 2008, and that's about a little over 140 in the first quarter and 160 in the second quarter and the remaining through the third and fourth quarters. So that is just, that's insurance for us on growing the patient days.", "So it's very unfortunate that we had some bad luck with a couple of facilities and the Pines. And are we working on those and are those on top of mind awareness, absolutely. That's the reason I'm so bullish that 7% to 9% is here for us, that we have to execute. We still have to execute and not have any other facilities get in trouble, but it is a small number of facilities that if we just fix. That 7% to 9% is there.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "And if you just, can you talk a little bit about anything you are doing differently in marketing, referral sources. I understand, maybe there is a few turnaround situations, but just on more portfolio broad basis, could you give us some color there?", "Joey Jacobs", "Something corporately that has occurred is that Terry Bridges has, now has a business development person at a senior level working for him in the Chief Operating Officer's office. So, we now have someone more coordinating with the divisions and with the facilities, and especially the troubled facilities on their marketing plans, there needs to build the beds, to new programs. So there have been additional resources during the past six months that we have applied to the program development and marketing side of the business referral development, and elevated that person up to Terry's office. So we have put more resources there Darren, to work with the facilities at the local level to make sure we are seizing all the opportunities. But the best thing we can do is to build our beds.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then just as far as the '08 outlook goes, you have given us some visibility on the first quarter. My question is can you provide, just some commentary about the earnings ramp over the course of '08. I know you have got some start-up, so which quarters would be impacted most by the start-ups and is there any unusual expense running through the first quarter that we need to be aware of.", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, in the first quarter we will be spending money ramping up the Illinois project in Springfield, Illinois. And that project is supposed to come online in the second quarter. So, we have the CEO hired, that we will be spending money there, that which is on our budget, which is in our earnings guidance. So we do have that project coming online in the second quarter so up until we get it open and even a little while after we have it open, it's going to be hurting their earnings and we have that built in our guidance.", "The interest expense that we raised the guidance on really works from April, a little bit in March but it's more of an April through the December thing, because the way we had laid off the debt and those tranches are coming new and getting renewed at the lower LIBOR. So that is a little bit backend loaded. Now historically, if you look at the company, we usually make in the first quarter what we made in the last quarter of the previous years, so we think we're reasonable there. So we're growing the business and \"Knock on Wood\"' we're working very hard and turning around some of the facilities that may have given us trouble last year. So we're doing all those things.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, just last question here relates to occupancy rates and some of the bed count numbers that we'd like to see in your the press releases. What was the occupancy rate same-store and total company and then can you just breakdown the license bed counts in each of the total company and same store bucket, so we can just know that? Thanks.", "Jack Polson", "Darren actually the occupancy was about 73% total for the company. We have 10,283 licensed beds for the quarter and we had about 9,700 operated in the quarter. I do not have that break down on the same store work on this call.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "You added how many beds in the quarter?", "Jack Polson", "Just right around 100.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Jack Polson", "Yes, thanks Darren.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Andreas Dirnagl with JPMorgan.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Hi guys good morning. I'm sorry I don't think we beat this horse enough. So I might as well try and get in a couple of blows myself. Joey, maybe can we just take a step back we had some weakness in that same-store revenue comp in the first quarter. We had the weakness again in the same store revenue comp in the fourth quarter.", "Can you maybe just provide a little more colored generically as to what you think went wrong and just to throw it out there, I mean some of the things you've said in the past are sort of bad luck. I mean, what does that mean? In the past you've talked about that perhaps you weren't prepared enough for expansion beds, and so you got caught behind the capacity issue this quarter. Maybe just provide a little bit more color and then why you don't think it's going to occur again next year?", "Joey Jacobs", "I guess maybe bad luck was bad terminology there. We did not like four weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That created too much seasonality for us so we now found out that we do not like Thanksgiving coming as early as it can in November, that you always worry about after Thanksgiving, kind of the census ramped back up before the holidays around Christmas and Hanukkah kick in and so we know we don't like four weeks in between Christmas and Thanksgiving.", "So I classify that as bad luck. We had one facility in August get in trouble with an infection control issue, which hurt us and that was bad luck, it should not have occurred and we paid a dear price for that but that facility has been fixed and is coming back in the first quarter very robustly. So Darren that was a little bit of bad luck. When I refer to bad luck, that is that we had 7% revenue growth through the first nine months, and so we had it there within our grasp. Could we have moved a little quicker? Could we have built a few more beds? Sure and that's what we're trying to make sure happens in 2008 that we get the beds built, that we get the programs implemented and that all our facilities do well on the clinical side. So that's what I characterize as bad luck.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Okay and then the 100 beds that you added in the fourth quarter, do those count towards the 600 beds that you're adding throughout 2008 or are those separate?", "Joey Jacobs", "They're separate.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "And can you give an idea as to sort of how those 600 beds are going to kind of come on line over the year? Is it sort of an even flow or is it front or backend loaded?", "Joey Jacobs", "It's about 140 in the first quarter. It's about 175 in the second quarter, and maybe 100 in the third quarter and then whatever the balance then will be in the fourth quarter.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Okay great and then one final question. I just want to confirm yet again despite the potential language confusion in the press release. Your discussions or your guidance for a minimum of six acquisitions that's still going off the clock there started when you completed the Horizon acquisition. So you're looking for that mid this year is that correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "That's correct.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Okay great. Thank you very much.", "Joey Jacobs", "Alright.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups hopefully, I guess just the first in your last response there, you mentioned you could have built some beds faster. Can you just describe for us sort of that process of planning new beds and getting them off the ground? Is that more corporate or local, and maybe if it's more local and you think it should have been done better is it becoming more of a corporate issue or?", "Joey Jacobs", "It's absolutely from corporate all the way down to the local CEO. The key is the local CEO through his division President to Terry and myself and also during last year we hired a Construction Project Manager to oversee all the projects that were doing now. The good thing here is I'm looking at a schedule and for 2009 we already have more than 400 beds approved to build in 2009. So I guarantee you, we're at a much better position on building beds right now than we were January of \u201806 and we're better organized and we do improve the process. We want to make it quicker and so actually, I think I approved a project this week that will be on the 2010 bed. So we're doing a much better job there.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "If you were looking at that list a year ago, did you have a bigger number and you just didn't get them done or was the number just small and it should've been bigger?", "Joey Jacobs", "It's a combination of both; should've been bigger and we should've done it quicker. Then on the other hand, I have to give our people in the field some credit here. Like in California, with that pent up demand, there was really nothing they could do. We just had to wait on the local zoning and the state approval. There's just so much you, how hard you can push those state officials and we just had to wait even though it was very painful to wait and we hope to have those beds, two thirds of those beds will come online in the fourth quarter and a third of those will come online in the first quarter of '09. So it's hard to wait when you know those beds, you're turning patients away and you're waiting on those beds.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "And then just speaking of occupancy and sort of what you were saying there about having some places where you actually turn people away. How do you sort of model new beds coming online on a same-store basis and what that occupancy is? Is it typically places that are pretty full so you get a high occupancy? Or is it sort of comes online over time? Or how does that work?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well if it's an RTC facility, that facility's probably running 95% to 100% occupancy. And we're building beds there. Unfortunately for an RTC bed the length of stay is 180 days. So if you brought on 20 beds, it may take you six months to get 20 admissions to fill those beds up. But once you fill them, they're full. On the Acute beds, like in California, when you're turning patients away, you can have a big impact on those beds the day you open them up. We do not; we expect that within 12 months we would be at the company's occupancy level on those. So on the Acute side, we're running about 73%, 75% level for those beds, that within a year they would be at the 73%, 75% level.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Do you have the breakdown of the 600 between RTC and the Acute?", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure I do. We've given out enough detail but yes we do have them by bed type.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "I mean is it 50-50? Or something that's skewed way one direction or the other?", "Joey Jacobs", "It is more acute. It's probably 60-40 Acute to RTC.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then my last question just on the interest expense and the raise of the guidance on that number. Can you just update us on what percent of the debt now at this point is variable? And in the assumption on your EPS raise, what are you assuming on interest expense? It's sort of the current rate or something gets better, something gets worse?", "Brent Turner", "Yeah Tom, this is Brent. We have about 43% of our debt that floats and as indicated earlier LIBOR is approximately 200 basis points lower today than it was in November when we had first established our 2008 guidance. So that's what we have based it on based on the interest rate outlook there. We will see some significant savings on our floating rate.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Ken Wekley with Credit Suisse.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, can you hear me okay?", "Joey Jacobs", "Good, Ken, how're you doing?", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Doing very good. I was just curious if you could give me the payer mix for both businesses in-patient and RTC, if that's possible.", "Joey Jacobs", "We can't give you the American payer mix on both of them, but we can give you the payer mix that has been updated for 2007, if you would like that.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Sure.", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure, Medicaid is 32%.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "Commercial is 33.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "Medicare is 13.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Is the payer mix very different for in-patient versus RTC or is it roughly the same?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, an RTC facility is going to be more Medicaid state driven. State agencies, other school departments state agencies, is 16%.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Okay, I have one more question. Have you had any facilities, you mentioned one facility I think you said had an infection control problem. Did you lose the ability to take patients in? Is that what happened or can you give us some detail there?", "Joey Jacobs", "I'm not going to give you any new detail, but it sure hurt the census. But it's been fixed, so we're very pleased with there, and no other detail than it's fixed and they're re-growing their census very quickly.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Is the problem sort of typical for a psychiatric hospital?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, not at all. It was a very unusual occurrence that was easily to fix, but people are very sensitive about infection control today.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Sure. And I guess just the last question, in terms of management ownership of the company, can you tell me where you are again in terms of senior management and how that's changed over the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, I can't give you the exact details. The proxy statement will be coming out pretty soon and you'll be able to see that. Senior management, as far as I'm concerned, most of senior management, if we choose to sell or buy, it's usually under a 10-B 5 1 plan, which is shown you can see my sales for last year. I can also tell you that the restrictive stock that I get this year that's just vested, you have the option of canceling the shares to pay the taxes or writing a check, and I wrote the check to keep the shares. So that's about as much as I can give in detail on that and the proxy statement will be coming out pretty soon.", "Ken Wekley - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks so much.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James & Associates.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Hi, good morning.", "Joey Jacobs", "Hi John.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Let's talk about the management business for just a minute. What's your outlook for that business in \u201808 when the PTS really starts to cramp on the Acute's and have you guys been able to pick up some new contracts off that kind of a natural run down in the that business?", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure, John. It's in our guidance for the, you know we did that budget back in October and November, so we did our guidance. So we knew we had pretty good visibility in what contracts would renew and what might go away and so it's in our guidance. It is a flat to declining business. Nothing has accelerated there due to the first 52 days of this year.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Right.", "Joey Jacobs", "There has been no acceleration there John that I can see, and that and quite frankly we've signed several new contracts and we've entered into a kind of preferred arrangement with a large med/surg company. So our folks there, [Mike Sol] heads that up for us and he's somebody we promoted back in December to that position and Mike and his team have done a fantastic job, along with [Cindy Sheriff] and the EAP Company. And so, as you can see from other, it's hanging right in there. And it's in our guidance and we have not seen any acceleration on possible re-negotiations or terminations.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay and then talk about your development. If I recall, you have a hospital opening what, first and third quarter? And we had thought about that as about $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share and that as you, as those hospitals open up, is that still a good assumption or has anything changed it?", "Joey Jacobs", "Nothing has changed. You are right, the Springfield project is open to come on line in the second quarter and the Rolling Hills project is actually in the fourth quarter.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "So it's back a quarter from what we understood?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "And quite frankly John, I think on Rolling Hills, we won't open that thing December 15 if it's ready, we will wait until January. And get through the holidays. If it's that close, if it's going to get completed between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we will just wait to let the New Year get out of the way and bring that thing and open in January.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "And as you look out, are there other development opportunities that might happen beyond \u201808 with your, now that you've got these [tie-ends] with your management contracts?", "Joey Jacobs", "There is one that we're having reasonable discussions with.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "But, no, no big pipeline?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, nothing there, no.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. And could you remind us, looking globally at the company, what the RTC acute split is?", "Joey Jacobs", "It is 53 acute, 47 RTC.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay and just one other kind of global area of inquiry. You guys had some operational issues with your RTC facilities; I know you've talked about doing some things differently there in terms of refurbishing the facilities and maybe taking them offline at times to refresh the facilities. Is there any other things that you are doing differently in that business and have you seen any positive operational impact from those changes?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, we are about to see the positive changes. We probably cost ourselves 100 basis points on the same-store numbers last year and especially in the fourth quarter where we have deliberately taken the patient days down like 20 beds a facility, and we have renovated the facilities. For example the one in Austin Texas comes to mind the Oaks. We've taken 20 beds offline since July of last year and the last of those 20 beds come online in March.", "So, once again, we have about three of those where we have been proactive in taking the census down, and renovating them and bringing them back online, and it probably costs us 100 basis points. So, maybe that's a little bad luck too, but it is the right thing to do versus as you know the Manatee Palms situation where we had to close the whole facility.", "So we are doing more of a proactive there and then Kathy Bolmer, who is our Executive and Vice President of Compliance and Quality. We have beefed up her staff, and they are doing a much better job assisting our facilities on compliance and quality issues, surveys being more proactive and so we done a lot there. We've made it a primary focus as it should be for the local team at the facilities. So, we have done a lot of good work in the last 18 months in that area. We will see the benefits of that this year. We will see the benefits, when Oaks comes online in March, you know, in April 20 more patients a day will be at that facility.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "And will that help the same-store numbers absolutely.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay, that's great. And looking at state Medicaid, budget is reset in the second half of the year and given some of the state budget issues are you getting any early visibility on what that's looking like from a pricing standpoint?", "Joey Jacobs", "We've no visibility yet other than we've seen nothing that would want us to change our mind on our guidance there. You know 3% to 5% pricing for us, the government payers probably in the 2% to 4% range for the Medicaid state budgets. That is a July 1, October 1 issues for the state. So, we are still a way out to see what is going to happen there. Remember child and adolescents are the type of patients that we take care. We do not take the Medicaid adult patients. So, once again, we believe that is a protected patient.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay, thank you.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Great, could you guys just remind us what exactly is included in all those other operating expense lines what might we expect would be included there?", "Joey Jacobs", "Okay. It is rents, utilities insurance, travel, repair and maintenance, recruitment and others.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Alright, okay. And when you look at your acquisitions I just want to confirm to you because it sounded like I guess the language made it sound like you were going to be fixed between by year end but I think you said earlier that it was going to be -- the clock has started with the Horizon acquisitions which were June 1st, so I understand that you still expect to do six acquisitions by June 1st of this year?", "Joey Jacobs", "That is correct and let me go back I mentioned rent is not in there that's leases. It\u2019s a separate item, sorry.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay, thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "And then our goal is to have six acquisitions by June 1st.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay. And what sort of multiples, have they started to come in and what are you really seeing out there right now?", "Joey Jacobs", "We see reasonable multiples looking back on trailing earnings in the seven to eight range for a single facility if it's more than a one facility transaction if you have four, five, six or seven facilities together you'll get a premium. But all the transactions we are looking at are very accretive to PSI, so once again once we announce the acquisition we would be raising if it's significant enough which, you know, I expect these six would be that we would be raising earnings guidance when we announce the transaction. So we are very excited and very close to having that done and June 1st is a big goal.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay. And then real quick on interest rates have you guys given any consideration to sort of locking in these low rates, is that something you are looking at?", "Jack Polson", "", "We constantly manage our balance sheet, net interest rate exposure quite frankly we are continuing to benefit with 43% continuing to float and some of the outlook. We like that differentiation with the 50, kind of, 60/40 floating and fixed. So we are comfortable where we are and obviously $0.10 is meaningful accretion from that interest rate exposure that we are realizing for 2008.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay. And then lastly, looking at the expansion, what sort of costs might we expect sort of in advance of those openings on either a per bed basis, or a total dollar basis? Might we see -- I know you said you were looking in the second quarter and fourth quarter when they\u2019ll be opening, so presumably you are going to have some costs in the first and third quarters. What might we expect and where exactly would that sort of flow through in the income statement?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Kevin, let\u2019s get closer to the opening of those facilities in the ramp-up for those costs before we just start closing those numbers. And if it\u2019s significant enough we will mention them. Now we opened up the Hughes Home in Danville, Virginia last year and never disclosed and we had operating losses there, so let us get closer to it. We\u2019ll give you the numbers as we book the expenses.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay. Alright, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll go next to Whit Mayo with Stephens.", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "", "Good morning. Can you give us an update on your divisional structure today? You know, how many hospitals per division? Any changes there in organizational leadership that you made there? Thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay. Sure. There is 11 divisions, and we have one opening, which we are about ready to make an offer to and we did trade out a couple of those positions during last year and we are very excited about the team we have and they are focused and I think Terry has done a good job in recruiting other division presidents and so the most recent one was Sharon Worsham, a long term CEO for us and she\u2019s off to a great start and she started December, I guess and she\u2019s off to a great start and she has kind of the mountain division region for us.", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "And those that you traded out, were those replacements or were those just you\u2019re filling a void there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Those were replacements.", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "", "Okay, alright. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks, guys.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks, Whit.", "Operator", "", "And we will go next to Jeff Englander with Standard & Poor's.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "", "Good morning guys, can you hear me?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes Jeff.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "", "First question, and Joe you mentioned the three, I guess, worst performing facilities, if you want to phrase it that way; first question is was the facility with the infection control issue one of those? And then could you give us more color on what types of things you\u2019ll be doing to those three facilities specifically to turn them around?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I am not going to get into a lot of detail here. Yes, the one with the infection control, the infection control issue is one of those three. Quite frankly it\u2019s the quickest of the three to fix and quite frankly as far as I\u2019m concerned give it 30 more days and it is fixed. And so, that one will be going away. The Pines is a long-term project, where we\u2019ve changed a lot of staffing at the local level and brought in new clinical directors and program directors and we took it down to where we knew the programming was very sound and now we\u2019re going back to open. As I mentioned earlier that\u2019s a four-year project versus a three-year project. So that is about much detail on those three that I\u2019m willing to give right now.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "", "Okay. The other question would be can you remind us again, I think in terms of residential, what the seasonal patterns are around vacation times and particularly at the end of the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Sure. Any time schools are out. Any time schools are out. As we mentioned earlier, spring breaks, because Easter is moving into March. There\u2019s going to be a lot more spring breaks and schools closings in March this year as compared to last year when Easter was in April. All the holidays, Thanksgiving, December for us, once December 22nd gets here, it\u2019s probably January the 5th before the census will come back or we see the trends coming back there that it will soften up and be there. ", "In the summer time, schools get out, usually now about June 1st, and June, July and August are summer months where schools are out and less incidents occur and then schools start back up usually around Labor Day. However, we are a company that positions full year around the school programs. We like that, but unfortunately for us most school systems take the summer off.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "", "And we\u2019ll go next to Frank Morgan with Jefferies and Company.", "Frank Morgan - Jefferies and Company", "", "Good morning. Two housekeeping questions. One, could you remind us what the actual number of management contracts are as of the fourth quarter? And then secondly, on these acquisitions that you expect to close in the first half of the year, do you think these will be six one-offs or do you think it\u2019ll be a small chain acquisition? Thank you.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Frank, we\u2019ll let Craig Hartman get back with you on the number of contracts that we have. I don\u2019t have that data here with me. On the acquisitions, stay tuned. I would expect an acquisition to have multiple facilities in it.", "Frank Morgan - Jefferies and Company", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. And we will take our final question from Mark Arnold with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "", "I just have one quick question. Just clarifying on the 600 bed addition this year, you mentioned Rolling Hills might be end of Q4. Is that included in that 600 bed number?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes, it\u2019s 80 beds.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then the renovations on the RTCs, when you take those beds down, are you including when those come back?", "Joey Jacobs", "No.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. That\u2019s just strictly all new beds capacity, not mothballed beds or anything you\u2019ve taken down?", "Joey Jacobs", "Correct.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Joey Jacobs", "I think that\u2019s the end of the questions, so once again thank you for your interest in PSI and to the 22,000 employees out there that many of those might be listening in. Thank you so much for a great 2007. We set many records for this company on earnings growth, revenue growth, quality of care, improving our facilities. 2008 once again should be a year similar to what we\u2019ve experienced and once again, I look forward to the 7% to 9% same-store revenue growth, our acquisitions, improving margins and delivering great care.", "So once again we\u2019ll talk to you at the next call.

Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "", "Good morning, I\u2019m Steve Filton, Alan Miller, our CEO is also with us and welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter end in September 30 2007. As discussed in our press release last night we recorded net income of $0.54 per diluted share during this year\u2019s third quarter. After adjusting for the various items disclosed and quantified in our press release and related schedules of non-GAAP supplement on consolidated statements of income information, our adjusted income from continuing operations with $0.64 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2007; as compared to $0.54 per diluted share for the quarter end in September 30, 2006.", "", "During this conference call we will be using words such as beliefs, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast projections in forward looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward looking statements, we recommend the careful reading of the sections on risk factors and forward looking statements in risk factors in our Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2006.", "", "I would like to highlight just a couple of developments in business trends before opening the call off to questions. Revenues for the third quarter increased 13% over the prior year. Exclusive of the impact of new facilities most notably Texoma and the revenues related to construction managements contract, where by we are building a new hospital for an unrelated third party. Revenues have increased by 7%. On as same facility bases in our Acute Care Division, revenues increased 7.6% during the third quarter of 2007. The increase resulted from admissions growth, and an increase in revenue per admission. Admission to our hostels owned for more than a year increased 2.5% for the quarter. On a same facility bases, revenue per adjusted admission rose 3% during the third quarter of 2007.", "", "We defined operating margins as operating income on net revenue, less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies\u2019 expense and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenues. On a same facility basis, operating margins where our Acute Care House owned in both the third quarter of 2007 and 2006, increased to 12.6% in the quarter just ended as compared to 11.8% in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Our Acute Care Hospital provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to a 149 million and 99 million during the 3 months period end of September 30, 2007 and 2006 respectively.", "", "On a same facility bases at our behavioral facilities, admissions increased 3.4% during the third quarter of 2007 over the comparable prior year quarter; and net revenue per adjusted admission increased 5.1%. Operating margins for our Behavioral Hospitals owned from more than a year were 22.4% in the quarter end in September 30, 2007, compared with 22.6% in the quarter ended in September 30, 2006.", "", "Cash flow from the operations for the third quarter of 2007 was approximately a $164 million compared to $61 million during the third quarter of 2006. Our cash flow from operations during the third quarter of 2007 was favorably impacted by a $48 million favorable change in other working capital accounts, primarily due to the timing of certain accrued pay roll and accounts payable disbursements, which were funded in early October.", "", "We also expect to disburse approximately $50 million of cash during the fourth quarter of 2007 for the payment of interest expense on our bonds and income taxes. Our cash flow from operations during the third quarter of 2006, was unfavorably impacted by the payment of 2005 income taxes, that were deferred pursuant to a hurricane Katrina related deferral and by certain Medicare and Medicate receivables that were collected during the fourth quarter of 2006.", "", "At September 30, 2007, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 37.1% and the ratio of debt to EBITDA was 1.84%. We spent $79 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2007. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to our new 170 beds Centennial Hills hospital in Las Vegas, that is scheduled to be completed and opened in early 2008  and  a new 171 hospital bed in Palmdale, California that is scheduled to be completed and opened in 2009.", "", "In California, we are on the way with a major expansion of our emergency room and women\u2019s services at our Rancho Springs campus. During the third quarter we acquired Foundations Behavioral Health in Dulles Town, Pennsylvania which has 54 acute Behavioral beds and 48 residential beds and cotton wood treatment center in Utah, which has 78 beds.", "", "Our Behavioral Facilities have operated at a very efficient 76% available occupancy rate for the quarter. These high occupancy rates are suppressing our admissions growth in certain markets, though we have multiple projects that add capacity  to our busiest Behavioral facility.", "", "We opened to a total of 50 new Behavioral beds and existing facilities during the quarter. As indicated in our press release last evening, the government\u2019s investigations of our South Texas health system affiliates remain active and on going. At this time we are unable to evaluate the existence of extent of any potential financial exposure, in connection with this matter and we are unable to provide any additional information beyond that, which was disclosed in our third quarter earnings release.", "", "We are pleased to answer questions at this time.", "", "Question and Answer", "", "Operator", "", "[Operator\u2019s instructions] We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.", "", "Sir you have a question from the line of Darren Lehrich.", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. Few things here I guess, challenges, wanted to ask you about the M&A environment, we have asked you this before but it looks like you were relatively quiet and from the buyback front, so just want to gauge, where you are, where you see the M&A opportunities now versus say, 3 to 6 months ago and whether there\u2019s reason to believe you will deploy more capital in 2008 to grow with Acute care acquisitions?", "", "Unidentified Company Representative", "", "We have capital, as you can see and we are just being careful and opportunistic. We made a couple of good acquisitions, in the psyche field and we are looking and waiting and talking to people but we don\u2019t really have anything on the horizon at this moment.", "", "There\u2019s been a lot of un-score turmoil at what is happening in the industry and we expect that opportunities will present themselves there.", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Okay and Steve just as it relates to the uninsured trend, obviously the charity care number was up significantly. Can you help us understand, what the actual self-paid volume growth was on the acute side and can you just talk about that trend if it was concentrated in any particular regions?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Sure Darren, as you know we had pretty favorable uninsured experience in the first quarter, we saw it spike up in the second quarter and we saw those trends continue again in the third quarter. In terms of where we saw it, I think it was largely throughout the portfolio as it has been these last few years but we certainly did see specific pressures in some of the markets that others have noted, in Florida , in California and Las Vegas. Markets I think that have been particularly hard hit by the housing and the real estate crises. We seem to be feeling that perhaps a little bit more pressure. But for the most part we just continued to see the uninsured trends and pressures that we saw in the second quarter continue on to the third.", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "And just the overall economic condition in your market as you look into 2008, how should we think about that debt and the uninsured and how are you guys thinking about it at this point?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "One of the challenges I think that everybody, both providers in the industry and those who follow it have had over the last few years has been and have been to find sort of leading indicators that will allow us to predict when we would see spikes or we would see stabilization in the uninsured volumes. And frankly I think no one has really done a great job of identifying what would be the best leading indicators. So we certainly are watching some of these trends like the, reduction in housing starts and the number of fore closures in some of our markets. But honesty Darren, I\u2019m not sure we know, exactly how that data relates to what we are going to see in terms of people coming to our hospitals and particularly to our emergency rooms, and the level of health insurance or no health insurance that they might have. So we are watching all that carefully but its difficult for us to predict what those relationships are.", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Okay and then just one last thing and I\u2019ll jump back in the queue here, but as far as 2008 goes, I know you typically provide your guides in, I think February. Looks like FY07 has progressed more or less in line with what you laid down in the beginning of the year. But just speaking about FY08 conceptually I guess you have some start up losses that gets pushed out in Vegas into 2008 and you may have, I don't know, we\u2019ll have to hear your view about the UPL situation in Texas that might be a pressure point for you. But just looking into 2008, do you think you can grow earnings? And I don't know if you could put a frame work around it, but that would be helpful just to get your thoughts on weather you think you can grow in a way.", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Well I think Darren, that the metrics in the both of our businesses have been fairly apparent and relatively stable for some time now. I think we think about sustainable, behavioral same store admission growth in sort of the 3% to 4% range going forward, sustainable pricing growth 3% to 4%. So I certainly see growth and as I indicated in my prepared remarks we continue to expand capacity in that division.", "", "On the Acute side, the same thing I mean 2% to 3% same store admission growth, is what we have been reporting. 4% or so pricing growth I think looks sustainable. And so again the wild card remains on the Acute side, the levels of uninsured and as it always does, any reimbursement challenges that we may face and you mentioned Texas UPL., we did reverse in the third quarter some prior year Texas UPL. just because we anticipate that there may be some challenges to the specific ways that, that UPL was funded. But we continue to recognize UPL for 2007. CMS has announced they are going to review some of the programs in Texas. We think some of the programs that we are part of have already been reviewed and probably won\u2019t be part of this CMS review. And we think other programs even if they are reviewed are likely to pass the CMS muster or criteria although there\u2019s certainly no guarantee of that so we\u2019ll have to wait and see. But we remain having all of our 2007 Texas UPL. recorded in the financial statements and continue to believe that that money is safe for now. So, yes that\u2019s the way we are thinking about the future and we continue to obviously watch it carefully.", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Okay. Even may be this one more here, the Behavioral margins anything to say about that, and if/whether on a consolidate basis, I think they were down a little bit but any pressure points there? Thanks.", "", "Unidentified Company Representative", "", "No, I think, I think we mentioned this last quarter, I mean we may be sort of past the period when people can expect those margins to go up 50 basis points a quarter. But as long as we can sustain the kind of volume growth that I just talked about and pricing growth, I think we should overtime continue to see increasing margins. One of the pressure points we do have is, we are opening new capacity and we can\u2019t fill that facility immediately upon opening. So there\u2019s little bit of a drag but obviously as you know those margins remains very strong and I think our outlook for fundamentals that business remain very good.", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Thank you.", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Thanks.", "", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from line of Christine Arnold", "", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Good morning. Continuing on kind of the same line of questioning on FY08, how do we think about the incremental serial volume that you got this year and what is likely to happen when United mergers with Sierra which is targeted by U. N.? Do we think that some of that volume could be lost, some of the volume trends could temporarily turn south?", "", "Unidentified Company Representative", "", "It\u2019s hard to say Christine obviously a United will have a big say, what happens to that volume so that we are certainly not the only opinion accounts in all this. I mean I think we have said all along that we thought that overtime, the Sierra-United network or the Sierra-United volume would probably gravitate back to a situation where all providers were in network in some form or fashion. So I think some of that Sierra business may be a risk, but those who follow us know, having that Sierra volume has not been a wholly positive issue, it has squeezed out some higher paying business and it has challenged our operators to manage their mix of business very carefully and in an environment of very strange capacities. So we have a contract that\u2019s come up, coming up for renewal with Sierra in the middle of next year, we will negotiate those rates carefully as I am sure they will. And I am sure market may undergo some changes but I think it\u2019s a little too early to predict exactly how that\u2018s all going to sort out.", "", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "And then, could you talk a little a bit about McAllen, and kind of what you\u2019re seeing there and when you expect Renaissance to what impact you think that might happen in terms of the extra capacity?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Renaissance has opened its OB service and OB capacity, I think sometime in October and we clearly have seen some impact of that. It\u2019s again too early to tell at the end of the day what sort of bottom line financial impact that will have on us. As we have said before we think that probably that, there will be a greater proportional impact on our competitor HCA Hospital, just because they have a better mix of business, historically than we have in OB business.", "", "But our expectations will have some impact where, used to that competitive environment now in the McAllen market and we are working hard to do a number of things on our end to regain some of the [BLANK] better paying commercial in Medicare business and we will continue to do that. But Renaissance continues to build and expand and open new services and as best as I can tell, they are going to continue to do that as well.", "", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay then final question. As we think about the volumes in the pricing here, looks like you got back some of that lost higher priced good business in Vegas this quarter. Is that true without overseeing in the better pricing and the better volume and is that sustainable, you think you can hang on to that?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "I think so, when we had fairly depressed pricing in the second quarter and we really attributed that to two factors, one was a higher level of uninsured and two, was to a less favorable mix of business in Las Vegas. I think in the third quarter we were able to correct the mix of business that were modified in Las Vegas so that we had better experience than we had in the second quarter; though probably not as good as we had in the first. Unfortunately our insured volumes continued to remain high. But I think that the better mix of business in Vegas is sustainable certainly for the next couple of quarters, until we get as we said you know the point where we renegotiate our contract, where the United-Sierra merger is completed, and there may be some, reconfiguration in the market and we will have to see how that all sorts out.", "", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary  Lieberman.", "", "Gary  Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Research", "", "Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to go back to, I guess one of the questions that was asked earlier in terms of usage capital and pay down of debt quarter. Sounds that you still fairly optimistic that there might be a, a deal out there that you would be interested in. So given that, should we expect that in the fourth quarter, I guess for the near term future that the use of cash would be similar in terms of paying down debt in favor of repurchasing stock?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "You know we had a similar conversation in the second quarter conference call. We clearly, I think entered 2007 with the notion that there would be more properties for sale at more reasonable prices, particularly on the Acute side than we have seen for a number of years. The reality is we haven\u2019t seen much of that and at the same time we continue to look at our own shares as an attractive buy. We did buy some $11 million or so of our own shares in the second quarter. And we are going to continue to sort go through this evaluation on a continuous basis and look at the opportunity to buy earnings streams externally as well as buy our own earnings stream, which we find very attractive right now, and I don\u2019t think we can sit here right now, Gary and say we are going to go one direction or another. It\u2019s going to be something that we continue to reevaluate literally, if not on a daily basis, certainly on our weekly or fairly frequent basis.", "", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group Company", "", "Okay and then one house keeping item. Do you have the bad debt, it\u2019s the Acute care hospitals, I didn\u2019t see that in the release.", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "We do. We will find it and I will provide that information as we continue to answer questions, Gary.", "", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group Company", "", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Erik Chiprich.", "", "Erik Chiprich \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Hi, good morning. A Question on the other expense that continues to creep up. Are you seeing any pressure there, is that professional fee, they are doctor recruiting or is it the seasonality that is going on in that line item?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Well I would just caution, there are a couple of things Erik and one is that we did in the quarter as we disclosed in the press release have a couple of non-recurring items that affect that line. The legal issue, as well as the write down of the joint venture asset, both on a combined basis provided about $6.2 million or $6.3 million of other operating expense, additional other operating expense in the quarter. I think the other item to keep in mind which we talked it about last quarter as well is that as part of this construction contract, construction management contract that we have. In the third quarter there is about $20 million of revenues and a similar amount of expenses which again, get recorded in other operating expenses that are inflating that line. So I don\u2019t know people why the people have that modeled in there but that\u2019s something to keep in mind. Other than that, the one other thing I will comment about other operating expenses is, we did see a big savings over the last year when we converted from our outside, an outsourced pharmacy to an in-house pharmacy and we are anniversaring that impact so I think that\u2019s somewhat muted as well. Other than that Erik I am not sure that we see any particular pressure on the other operating expense line.", "", "Let me just add in response to Gary\u2019s question, we had about a $103 million of Acute care bad debt expense in the third quarter 2007 and running about 11.9% of revenues.", "", "Erik Chiprich \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "And one additional question I think you mentioned you opened 50 additional side beds during the quarter, what is the potential to accelerate that pace going forward?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Well you know we\u2019ve talked about being able to open some where in the neighborhood of between 400 and 500 beds a year for the next couple of years and that being our plan, unfortunately it doesn\u2019t necessarily come on radically. So I think we will continue at that pace there will be quarters when we have more opening and quarters when we have less. But last quarter I think we opened 115 beds, the quarter before that we opened 88 beds, so 50 is kind of on the low side but again I think we\u2019re shooting for that kind of 400 as a target.", "", "Erik Chiprich \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Okay, thank you.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes for the line of Matthew Borsch.", "", "Shelley Nall \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Hi, thanks for taking our question, this is Shelley Nall for Matt Borsch. I have a follow up question on the Acute care bad debt, Steve I was wondering if you have available on the break out, into the co-pays and deductibles versus the uncompensated care buckets for this quarter? And then maybe as compared to last quarter and a year ago? And if you don't have those actual numbers, wonder if you could speak it directionally on what you are seeing and what the key drivers are in each of those buckets?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Shelly I think historically our sense has been that probably about two thirds of our uninsured expense comes from folks who have no insurance what so ever, and about a third of it comes from the portions that are due after insurance.

I mean we have certainly said before that probably our use of temporary nurses are higher in Las Vegas, than they are anywhere else in the country. We do have our own in house nursing, nurse registry pools in Las Vegas, as we do in many markets. I think frankly we use a lot less temporary nursing today than we did several years ago. And I think for the most part in today\u2019s environment we use it for the right reasons, which is, temporary spikes in volume etc. that  it\u2019s not productive to staff up permanently for us.", "", "We continue to look at that in every market ring, we continue to look for ways where we can to reduce temporary nursing, but we certainly don\u2019t view it to be the problem that we viewed it to be 5 years ago and there was a real drain on our earnings.", "", "Shelley Nall \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, great.

I guess its several questions here Allan and Steve; I guess maybe starting with Vegas, you still can\u2019t talk about the Sierra contract and what was going on there. One if you can talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in Vegas, outside of this year contract. And then at same time Centennial Hills opening up in early 2008, maybe just talk about what the expectations are there in terms of, I know you talked about this field initial impacts Steve, but may be just talk little bit more about what you are openly expecting from that hospital and I have a couple of follow up questions.", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Sure I mean in the competitive environment in Las Vegas is, it is competitive. I mean there are some pretty aggressive entities that we compete with in Las Vegas including HCA and Capital Healthcare West, both have expanded and built new hospitals in last few years, both continue to have some capacity expansion plans on the boards; although there are other than Centennial, no other brand new hospitals being built at the moment in Las Vegas.", "", "I think in terms of what the expectations for Centennial, I think it\u2019s worthwhile to go back and look at our experience when Spring Valley opened in fall of 2003. We had a couple of quarters where we cannibalized some business from our other hospitals when we first opened. So it caused a little bit of disruption in the market as physicians change, there practice patterns and patients changed there, patterns for seeking health care.", "", "But in relatively short order within about three or four quarters as Spring Valley began to earn healthy positive margins, approach the margins of our, the average margins of our hospitals in the market, I would think Centennial would have as good, if not a better experience, its probably and even a better demographically situated part of the city than Spring Valley was. And so our sense is much the same, we will have a couple of quarters that disruptions perhaps but in the long run Vegas remains an under-bedded market, one in which the hospitals operated very high levels of capacity. And I think that\u2019s going to continue the market even despite the references I made before to some, housing market, etc. The market continues to grow, people continue to move in, gaming projects continue to be built and capacity expands in that industry, which is obviously the heart of Vegas\u2019 economic health.

Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "No, I don\u2019t think, there is no P&L, a little bit of start up cost running through for Centennial Hills.

When we first got to see our volume drop dramatically in the second quarter and in the third quarter we are kind of in between.

We certainly don\u2019t view that as a good thing but we want to acknowledge that and keep people aware of that. But we remain largely in the dark about the substance of the issues that the Governor-Mayor may not be concerned about.

I was looking for an update in the Manatee [ph] market. If you see any, I mean any daylight in Florida or if it continues to get worse from a bad debt standpoint.

Unfortunately for the Florida market that\u2019s not the greatest timing so having the renovation for the summer is not really a good indicator of how, what sort of an impact it will have. Probably in our next call when we have gone through a busy season we will have a better sense of what that really has meant to us. Lakewood Ranch opened late in FY04, been opened for a few years. We continued to really wipe the Lakewood Ranch market. I know John that you are familiar with it, it\u2019s just a very demographically positive market, just a lot of good economics surround the market. The challenge that we have there is we are really obligated in order to succeed to take market share from some very large and successful hospitals in Sarasota. I think that\u2019s taking us longer to accomplish than we thought and so Lakewood remains, just a slightly profitable hospital for us.", "", "But I think our long term view of the market and that hospital remains quite positive. I know you have been down there and if anyone has been down there I think they would understand why we continue to have a very good feeling about the long term prospects of that market.

So I\u2019m probably jealous if anything. The other question I had was, the states have been in a pretty good medicate cycle and a good revenue cycle. The, obviously that\u2019s starting to turn, what are you hearing about any pressures from, I know we have just gotten through the gene budget cycle, but are there any states we need to be aware of that may be going in reverse from a medicate stand point?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "No I mean actually you are right I think we have gone through a few years of pressure in many of our states from the medicate program, I think actually most of the data that's out there shows that state budgets are actually looking better etc. So if any thing, I think we are expecting maybe a little bit of a loosening of purse strings across the country. Now having side that, our expectations in our modeling for the next few years, our medicate price increase is in 0% to 2%.

You did do some share repurchases in the quarter, but I might have thought it may have been a little more aggressive so may be just remind us there, where would you be comfortable going?

I think we have announced that before we are going to continue to evaluate, we are continue to watch we have been cautious, that\u2019s sort of been our history.

Is there anything you kind of characterized first quarters best of all worlds and the second quarter as specific sort of headwinds and I thought the third would kind of be in the middle, which looks like we are at sell out. Is there anything sequentially different in Vegas outside of just payer mix?", "", "Steve G. Filton \u2013 Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary and Controller", "", "Well I would say just two things Gary, I mean one is I think that the reference that you made to season out in Vegas. I mean there is some seasonality but just from a personal prospective I can tell you that, someone who is now been going to Vegas for some twenty years, used to go to Vegas in the summer time and it would be dead and that\u2019s just not the case anymore. The hotels are lot more busy and more occupied than they used to be in the summer time and so I think there is less seasonality in Vegas, than there was historically. But the other issue I think the whole Sierra issue really is not going to do with seasonality as much as it does with this. Major contractual change that was made at the end of the year.", "", "What happened there at the beginning of the year, in the first quarter is we got this incremental Sierra business and we were able to keep all of the, our other business at the same time and then as the year went on and certainly the second quarter went on, some of that business began to grab a take. So naturally I think in some cases to the less busy facilities, which I think handed to be the HCA facilities, which have lost their Sierra volume. And certainly HCA was proactively trying to attract non-Sierra business and I think they were successful in dealing it in the second quarter. In the third quarter our own operators responded a little bit more balanced, attracted back some of that business, just managed their business a little bit better and as I said to a couple of people in the call, I think that,  that\u2019s kind of a sustainable level where we are in the third quarter.", "", "Alan B.

About 3 weeks ago or so, Texas issued a press release saying that CMS was going to look at some of the specific county UPL programs; which is different than the disproportion share program.

We think that our programs in South Texas are likely to be looked at because they haven\u2019t been looked at before. But, our program in Amarillo where we get two-thirds of our UPL reimbursement is probably not likely to be looked at in this round because its been reviewed before by CMS in this past muster previously so that\u2019s our expectation. We don\u2019t know if payments will be made in November on the same, like I said on a timely basis.

(OTCPK:PSYS) Q3 2007 Earnings Call November  2, 2007 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Brent Turner - Executive Vice President Finance and Administration", "Joey Jacobs - Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer", "Jack Polson - Chief Accounting Officer", "Analysts", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Jie Bao - Citigroup", "Brent Turner", "Good morning. I am Brent Turner, Executive Vice President Finance and Administration for Psychiatric Solutions. I would like to welcome you to PSI's conference call for the third quarter 2007.", "Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning today through November 16, by dialing 719-457-0820. The confirmation number for the replay is 409-7401. The replay may also be accessed through November 16 at our website, which is psysolutions.com, and at earnings.com.", "To the extent any non-GAAP financial measure discussed in today's call, you may also find a reconciliation of that measure to the most-directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP on our website by following the investors links to news releases and clicking on yesterday's press release.", "This conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including statements, among others, regarding PSI's financial, expected financial performance for 2007 and 2008.", "For this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact maybe deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.", "You are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by important factors, among others, set forth in Psychiatric Solutions' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our third-quarter news release and, consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.", "The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Joey Jacobs.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks, Brent, and good morning. It is a pleasure to be here today with you today to tell you about a great third-quarter for PSI. We produced strong profitable growth for the quarter, with revenues up over 50% and earnings per diluted share at the high end of our guidance. Most of our revenue growth came to the edition of new inpatient beds through facilities acquired in the past year.", "These transactions included the nine-facility ABS acquisition completed in December last year and the 15-facility purchase of Horizon Health Corporation in June 2007, which together added more than 2500 beds to our third-quarter operations. We have been very pleased with the rapid integration of these facilities into our operations and with the contributions they are making to our growth.", "We continue to be confident that Horizon will be accretive to our operations in its first 12 months following the transaction by $0.17 to $0.20 per diluted share. Our third-quarter revenue growth also reflected strong same-facility revenue growth of 8.3%. We continue to expect to produce same-facility revenue growth in the same seven to 9% range for 2008, as well.", "Consistent with our long-term results, this growth in our same-facility revenue has enabled us to leverage our high fixed cost facility infrastructure. This leverage combined with initiatives to improve operating efficiencies drove a 150-basis-point expansion in our same facility EBITDA for the second consecutive quarter. This is exactly the type of performance our business model is designed to produce and we are proud of our team for the hard work that goes into successfully driving these results.", "We are confident we got several hundred basis points of upside in the same-facility EBITDA margin that we can continue to capture going forward. As a final note this morning, I will add that this strong same-facility EBITDA performance played a key role in the 62% growth in our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter to $68.9 million, or 17.1% of consolidated third-quarter revenue.", "The liquidity inherent in both the size and growth of our adjusted EBITDA provides fundamental support to our continuing evaluation of a substantial pipeline of potential acquisitions. Based on this pipeline and our financial position, we remain committed to completing the acquisition of a minimum of six inpatient facilities over the next year.", "Let me close by thanking you for your interest in PSI. I will now ask Jack Polson, our Chief Accounting Officer, to review our third-quarter financial results in more detail. Then we will be glad to open the floor for your questions. ", "Jack Polson", "Thank you, Joey. PSI's revenue increased 58.5% for the third quarter of 2007 to a record $402 million from $254 million for the third quarter of 2006. This growth was due principally to the edition of new inpatient beds through acquisition and we also continued to expand our bed counts in existing facilities, consistent with the goal for two to 3% expansion annually.", "Our revenue growth was also attributable to an 8.3% in same-facility revenue comprised of 1.5% growth in patient days and 6.9% growth in revenue per patient day. The economies of scale generated by this level of same-facility revenue growth as well as our ongoing programs to improve efficiency and increase productivity again produced an expansion in our same-facility EBITDA margin to 21.6% for the latest quarter from 20.1% for the third-quarter last year.", "The combination of strong same-facility growth and growth produced through our acquired beds drove a 61.6% increase in consolidated EBITDA to $68.9 million for the third quarter, which was 17.1% of consolidated revenue, compared with 16.8% for the third quarter of 2006.", "This substantial growth produced our ratio of total debt to pro forma consolidated EBITDA to 4.4 times for the third quarter from 4.6 times for the second quarter. PSI also continues to generate significant cash flow from operations, which increased 32.1% to $38.2 million for the third quarter and which was 1.8 times income from continuing operations.", "Income from continuing operations for the third quarter increased 33.2% to $20.8 million and income from continuing operations per diluted share rose 31% to $0.38 from $0.29. As described in yesterday's press release, we are affirming our guidance for 2007 in a range of $1.47 to $1.49 and have re-established our guidance for 2008 in a range of $1.83 to $1.87.", "As always our guidance does not include the effect of any future acquisitions for 2007 or the loss of refinancing related to the tender of our senior sub notes. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, would you please open the floor to any questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Quick housekeeping questions upfront. Can you talk a little bit about what is inherent in your '08 guidance regarding the tax rate? Is that going to still be around 38%?", "Joey Jacobs", "38%, 38.1% to be exact.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, then can you give us a feel, if you look to out to 2008, what's incorporated in your guidance on the pricing front? Maybe if we look at Medicaid or some of your commercial payor negotiations, what that looks like.", "And if you think the seven to nine growth will be a similar mix on patient admissions or total patient days in pricing next year?", "Joey Jacobs", "Ryan, this is Joey. Next year I would expect that patient days will be greater, the growth in patient days will be greater for next year, but pricing should still be probably in the 4% to 5% range, I think. With everything I know today, I would expect to be in a 4% to 5% range.", "That's with getting, governmental payors are going to give us two to four, commercial payors are probably going to give us six to eight. You blend it down, so, but I think patient days will be growing as compared to this year at a better rate than they did this year.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Is there anything in particular that's going to be driving the strength in patient days next year? Is it due to bed additions or just new marketing programs or any color there would be helpful?", "Joey Jacobs", "It is a combination of everything there. I am feeling good about that we're going to be better positioned for 2008 was new beds, new programs, getting ready for the year to grow our patient days. Once again, we have to come out of the holidays.", "We got off to a slow start this year just because we came into January and it just didn't rebound as quick it normally had in the past. But if it is a normal year coming out of the holidays, I expect patient days actually to be very, very good growth next year.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Great, that's helpful color. Then on your Q4 guidance, a quick question. I know before you had kind of laid out quarterly numbers looking at Q4 40 to 41, but your guidance range for the year, you're reiterating 147 to 149. Should we view that as kind of moving the Q4 numbers to $0.39 to $0.41?", "If so, is there anything specific in the quarter, maybe some startup costs from the de novos or things of that nature that might pressure it a little bit on the earnings side?", "Jack Polson", "Well, we are, and even in the third quarter there was some pressure from the de novo projects. We have about four of those underway right now. And we still were able to hit the $0.38 a share.", "No, the $0.41 is our target for the fourth quarter, but we are covering de novo projects that, once again, I think give us confidence that we will be having good patient day growth in 2008.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, great. Then last question and I'll back in the queue, it is a follow-up to that. It seems like you guys, I think you opened the Danville facility this quarter. I know you've got some bigger projects underway.", "Could you maybe give us a feel for -- that is obviously a great investment. I realize it is high return on invested capital, what probably does pressure earnings and margins a little bit during the period versus just acquiring a facility.", "Can you give us a little color for what might be incorporated in '08 on the development cost side, both CapEx and maybe earnings pressure for startup losses?", "Jack Polson", "I do not have the CapEx expense number there. The Hughes Home that we're doing in Danville and we have another one of those projects that you all are not aware of that we're doing in Chicago area.", "In both those facilities, we have and in each facility, we have roughly $4 million or $5 million in place and we will be bringing on 150 beds in total for those two facilities. So we are wanting to get them both on.", "Well, Hughes Center is now online. It did lose money during the third quarter and it did put a little pressure. The other project in Chicago will now start spending some money in the fourth quarter, but we are hoping to have it online by the end of the first quarter of next year. So, we're doing that.", "Those two projects together probably cost us $10 million in capital total, but they will be bringing on and if you bring on 150 beds, it is pretty cheap capital deployed in two very good markets for us. So that is -- but we are covering some of those startup losses right now for more than two projects, about four projects that we are working on.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay, Great. That is helpful color. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Could you give us some idea of and I'm try to ask the question in a way that I'll have a high probability of you answering it. So, can you give us some idea of kind of the effect of new beds coming online in '08 compared to '07?", "I guess I have heard some talk the maybe the '07 new beds were pushed back a little bit and will have a bigger year in '08. Is there some -- is it maybe a couple percent more in '08 versus '07?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes, actually we could actually do a little bit more than that, I think. It is, once again, we have got beds -- we actually may get some California beds online next year, which we really were not thinking was going to happen, that they were actually going to be '09.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "So, that kind of. I think there will be more beds online in '08 than compared to '07 and it is still just some timing of those last half of '08 beds. You know, it is construction and getting through the processing and getting them opened, so, but we will be opening more beds next year.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "And then my two follow-ups would be the old Horizon contracting business, I guess we've heard some talk that there may be a little more momentum in '08 than there was in '07.", "Could you talk about your expectations for the management contract business, realizing that it is a small piece of your total?", "Joey Jacobs", "Is a small piece, John, and once again, that is neutral to flat. We do think PPS is going to put pressure. January 1st starts the final year of peak that means we are fully implemented into PPS", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Right.", "Joey Jacobs", "So it\u2019s going to put some pressure on pricing and some contracts. However, I think during the last 60 days we signed three new contracts, so we are signing new contracts, but there is some pricing pressure on the other side. So if we can just keep neutral, that would hit my objective. ", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Are any of those acute care hospital partners prone to discussing moving that business out of the hospital into a freestanding location?", "Joey Jacobs", "We have three of those projects that we are talking with our management contract partners today.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "You have two in the works. You already have two underway, right?", "Joey Jacobs", "No. We have one. We brought Saint David's during the third quarter. It is a startup and we doubled the size of what they were managing there and just had the open house on October 25 at that facility.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "During the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we will be investing some operating losses starting that up, so, but we have about three more those projects where we are talking to the host hospital.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Great, congratulations. Thank you.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Adam Feinstein with Lehman Brothers.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. Good morning everyone.", "Joey Jacobs", "Hi, Adam.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Just a few things here. And I apologize, I got on a minute late, so if you touched on this, but I guess same-store revenue growth was very strong in the quarter at 8.3%, but just the patient day relative to revenue per patient day just jumped around a little bit more than what we were thinking.", "Can you just comment on what the specific item was that drove that in the quarter?", "Joey Jacobs", "You know, the third quarter is our most seasonal quarter, Adam and we just do not know about schools, how long they're going to stay out and when they go out and that sort of thing.", "The third quarter is always the most seasonal to us. We did not get enough new beds. We brought new beds on, I think about 72 beds on during the third quarter, but we did not bring enough beds online.", "We lost some patient admissions just because we did not have the programs there, and we expect and you might not have heard, but we do expect 2008 patient day growth to be much better than the 2007. That is our expectation.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, but was there any change in mix in the quarter, I guess, as to just the revenue per patient day?", "Joey Jacobs", "You have to be careful. On the revenue per patient day, the 6.9% increase, you have to be careful there because mix does come into play there and occasionally, PSI does have about 6% revenue per day.", "We did in one of our large states. We did get a very good rate increase July 1. Medicare gave us a 3.2% increase July 1, so some pricing was good for us in the third quarter, but also the mix can play with that number.", "And once again, our revenue growth expectation is seven to 9% and we know we getting two factors, volume and pricing. And so, it really does not matter to us how we get it, just as long as we get the seven to nine.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Sure, all right. And then just a follow-up question on mix, Joey. Just as we think about the RTC business, looking at the length of stay ticking up a little bit, was there, once again, just a little bit of a mix shift to more RTC in of the quarter?", "Joey Jacobs", "I did not see that. I think the length of stay can move a couple of tenths and there is really nothing going on just other than when the timing of the discharges or admissions hit. So, nothing to read into length of stay. It has been very stable.", "You know, what was it for the three months, 17.5 for same facilities, compared to 17.4 and year-to-date it's 17.5 to 17.5. You know, it is pretty predictable, but once again, no one should get alarmed if goes up 0.2 or down 0.2.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, okay. And then just on the bad debt expense, you guys did a great job of managing that. I know HORC was running at much higher levels before the deal, so you came in lower.", "So can you just comment on that? I know in the past you talked a lot about process, driving that, but certainly you got off to a good start there. I just want to make sure that you continue to have a good outlook in terms of improving the bad debt at the acquired facilities.", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes, we are making progress there. We probably have, at any given time, Adam, we probably have three to five facilities on our watch list or improvement list for bad debt issues, and we have been making progress at the Horizon facilities, especially the one that was causing them so much trouble.", "We have been making improvements there and I am very pleased with, I just got a glimpse of what their bad debt looks like it is going to be for October, so I'm very pleased about how we have addressed what was their worst facility. So very pleased with what we're doing their.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. All right, then just other contract management side, obviously not a big focus for you guys, but it is somewhat bigger pro forma the transaction. I guess it was little bit lighter than what I was looking for during the quarter, so just any changes therein terms of number of contracts?", "Maybe some contracts you got out of because they were not as profitable come I just want to figure out was going on their.", "Joey Jacobs", "As I talked to John earlier, our management contract expectation there is to hold it neutral, maybe to a slight decline there. We did exit a couple of contracts in the third quarter at our behest and, but then there is some pressure with PPS. We think there is going to be more pressure, which is good for owned side.", "We did convert Saint David's from a management contract to an owned facility. I think they were managing 24 beds and now we have all 48 beds opened up as of today I think, so there's two or three more those opportunities that we are working on.", "But once again, management contracts, small piece of business, but it is a very good piece of the business and David White does a good job running the group for us.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, then just final question for me. I know the guidance obviously implies very strong growth that you guys have done over the last several years.", "You have a history of being conservative with the guidance, so certainly from looking at it last night, it seemed that way, but just as we think about potential swing factors in the guidance, anything that you can highlight that would cause it to potentially be different?", "So is there any couple of items that you would characterize as a potential swing factor, Joey?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think the guidance, you know, many of you have all acquisitions in there and I think we're very comfortable with our pipeline and the letter of intents that we have out and the due diligence that we're doing that.", "We will make our acquisitions for next year, which will be accretive to us. As all of you know, our acquisitions are accretive once we buy them and so that looks good.", "The range of the midpoint to $1.85 at the growth is 25% growth in earnings per share just off of core businesses to date. Can it do better? Yes. Is it probably conservative? Probably, yes, I would characterize that, Adam, as that.", "I think if you followed our company for a while, which you have since the beginning. We are conservative company and the range of $1.83 to $1.87 is something we want to make sure we can put in the bank. And so we are working hard to make sure that happens and exceed it. Always we want to exceed our expectations.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "As I know you want to do. Okay thank you, sounds good. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll got next to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning everyone.", "Joey Jacobs", "Hey, Darren.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Hey. So I guess just a couple of questions here with regard to capacity and if you could just give us the spot numbers for your total licensed beds at the end of the period, and then the number of same-store facilities and licensed beds as well, just so we can track what's in that bucket?", "Brent Turner", "Darren, this is Brent. We don\u2019t have that number right in front of us, but we know that we opened roughly 70 net beds during the quarter. So the licensed bed count went up 70 from the number we gave on second quarter.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and that 70 includes the Hughes Center, is that correct?", "Brent Turner", "Yes, they only opened a portion of their beds, but it does include the 12 beds that are open their currently.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And if I follow up, you'll have the spot numbers then for the end of the quarter? We're just trying to track those.", "And then it looks like there was a small acquisition or at least some acquisition CapEx on the cash-flow statement. Can you shed some light on that for us, please?", "Brent Turner", "We bought Horizon had a small EAP company under contract when we acquired Horizon and we completed that transaction, very small.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So we should expect you guys to grow the EAP segments. Is that something that you have been negotiating or is that something you just inherited from the deal?", "Joey Jacobs", "We inherited from the deal, but we absolutely, we have internal sales force growing those numbers. And plus, we do look for potential acquisitions. Cindy Sheriff, who used to be with PSI, who is now back with PSI when we acquired it back from Horizon, does a fantastic job there and she keeps the lookout.", "Usually these are very small acquisitions out there and usually they are mom-and-pop EAP companies and they are very small. But if she finds one, we have the capitals to make that happen, they have good margins, very predictable earnings, so not an issue to occasionally make those acquisitions, too.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's great. And I guess just as far as the schedule of bed openings, I know you have been asked this question a few times and it sounds like the 3% or so bed expansion you have been looking for will be exceeded next year.", "But what I was hoping to get a rough sketch of is just the next few quarters of bed openings. It seems like that is going to be a major factor in seeing that patient day growth come back, so it would be helpful just to get a sketch of that over the next few quarters of new beds coming on-stream.", "Joey Jacobs", "Darren, I don\u2019t have that information here with me in detail, but we will think about maybe on the next earnings, we'll think about internally maybe we should start giving those kind of numbers, but we have not in the past.", "But we will think about your request about the total number of beds coming online. We will think about that for the first-quarter earnings call, I mean the year-end earnings call and maybe think about giving you some quarterly help on the number of new beds coming online.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "That's great, we appreciate that. My last question here is just as it relates to the Horizon integration. Joey, I guess I just want you to talk a little bit about some of the opportunities you see in their facilities over the next 12 months.", "I know there were a number of facilities that were due for some expansions, etcetera. But I just wanted now you're, I guess, six months into, so get a sense from you as to how you think you're coming along there.", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, I will give you one specific number. One of their biggest projects was approximately a 25-bed expansion for our facility in Virginia.", "And that is on track to come online first quarter of next year and so we do have expansion plans at the Horizon facilities, but that is a good 25-bed expansion that we have got coming online for our facility in Virginia, the Poplar Springs. So we're very pleased about that, but we are deploying capital, having plans to grow those facilities.", "For example, the Board of Directors, we had a board meeting at one of our facilities yesterday and during the presentation there the CEO of the facility was very pleased to announce that he thinks by the end of the year he needs 40 new beds and that's 40 new beds we really were not aware of but we will be building and working towards that.", "So this facility can have 40 new beds. So we are aggressively adding beds, several hundred a year. And the Horizon facilities have similar characteristics of needing beds built for them and so we will just keep doing that. ", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Kevin Campbell with Avondale.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "I want to ask you just a quick question on those expansion beds. If you have several hundred coming online over a period, how long should we expect those to get up to a normal sort of occupancy level?", "Is that going to take to quarters? Is a 12, I'm sorry, for quarters?", "Joey Jacobs", "The normal occupancy would be 75% occupied, for us I think would be the target there. We would think that by the end of 12 months, we would be there once they happen.", "Now, for building the beds at a facility, where there's lots of deflections, for example one of our facilities opened up 12 beds and I think within two weeks they had 10 patients. So sometimes you can fill them just about as soon as you open.", "But I would use give us four quarters to get the occupancy up to 75%.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay, then looking at some of the expenses for the quarter, professional fees and other operating expenses were up year-over-year as a percentage of revenues, was modestly 50, 60 basis points each.", "Was there anything in those numbers the will cause that to go up? Is it just sort of a quarterly, say, one-time thing or guess?", "Brent Turner", "Kevin, it is Brent. That is just the impact principally of the EAP and management contract business that came from Horizon, full quarter affect of that is really the major shift there in those expense lines.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay, so we should expect those maybe to be a little bit higher because of that going forward.", "Brent Turner", "Correct, on a consolidated basis.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay, great. In terms of shifting to the Mental Health Parity law, is there anything in addition to that pending on the state or federal level that there could be some legislative changes that we should be aware of?", "Joey Jacobs", "I know no other legislative changes going on right now, other than the Mental Health Parity Bill at the federal level. You know, hopefully that will get signed. It's very promising.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay, great. And then lastly, on the acquisition front, have you seen any changes to multiples or anything like that given the sort of change in the credit market, since you have last reported?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think on the previous conference call or two I have talked about maybe that the multiples have peaked and I think that is the case and that going forward, we could see decline in multiples.", "We have some letter of intents out that have lower multiples than what we have seen in the last couple of years, but, you know, we need to get them acquired and put them bed. Then we will be able to share with you, hopefully, those successes.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And will go next to Jeff Englander with Standard & Poor's.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Good morning guys. Quick question. First, Joey, on the California beds, if my memory serves me, you seem a little more confident this quarter maybe than last quarter that you may be able to get some of those on-stream in '08 and I'm wondering if you could give a little color there?", "Joey Jacobs", "I'll give a little color one time.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "That's good. I will take that.", "Joey Jacobs", "Our facility at Canyon Ridge has just broke ground or in the process of breaking ground for that facility and if the weather was to go right, this time next year we could have that thing open. I am optimistic about that, but could awaken to January 1 of '09 to open up?", "Sure. But I met with the CEO last week, he was here in Franklin; of the facility and we're pushing them to get it opened by November 1 of next year, so the big success there is we have got it through the planning process and that we're ready to build it.", "So, very, very optimistic bear that Canyon Ridge and quite frankly Canyon Ridge will be doubling its size, that the demand deflection is there, so we will be building those beds. So that is the one in California I'm very, very excited about. We have other plans in the works, but I am very excited about that one.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Great. And also, Brent, on the provision for doubtful, is the rate you have seen this quarter, given the progress you've made in the troublesome Horizon property, something that we can extrapolate forward or do you think we're going to come back to a more normalized rate going forward?", "Brent Turner", "We're going to always sort of range in that 1.7 to 2.5% so we would not advise to take your model write down to that. It is jut going to be in that range, which we're very pleased with. We will manage that closely, but would want more expectations did it is always going to be sub 2% going forward.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Great, thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Andreas Dirnagl with JPMorgan.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Yes good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Just two things. Joey, when you talked about pricing for next year, I think I heard you say that you thought government pricing would sort of come out at about two or 3%. Is that a blend of sort of the Medicare, the last increase, plus sort of flat on Medicaid or are you expecting Medicaid to sort of be up a little bit?", "Joey Jacobs", "Actually, it's two to 4% and I think it could be three to 4%. That does include the Medicare. We expect Medicare will give us rates January 1 and then we would expect one again July 1 of next year, but we think Medicaid programs across the Company, we think next year will get a cost of living from those contracts and for those patients and that is going to be in that 3% range. So, today we feel good about that and\u2026", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "That is a little bit stronger than what you've been seeing over the past couple of years, correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes. That was more than we have seen best it\u2019s in line. Once again, we have already had government payors two to four. So, it is okay. It is maybe towards the higher end just a little, but nothing substantial.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Great. And then can you just give a little bit of color? We've spent a lot of time or you have made a lot of comments just in terms of how the Horizon integration is going. What about ABS? How is that going sort almost a year into it now?", "Joey Jacobs", "Is done. Both the Horizon and the ABS integrations have gone really well, really well. And the ABS transaction, if you all remember that transaction, there one facility that was causing them so much trouble, we have adjusted that.", "We took the census down there to improve the treatment programs and we've right-sized it. We now need to grow it back and we will be doing that. And so hopefully it will get that back to where it needs to be.", "And but as far as Puerto Rico and the other ABS facilities, they have done very well, met our expectations. The Pines is the facility in Norfolk, Virginia. Scott Cardenas (ph) has done a great there, but we have got the programs.", "We have adjusted them, made some changes there with management and have a new CEO there. The CEO at Poplar Springs took that job there and Frank, we have great expectations for Frank and Scott. We're now in the marketing program to grow the census aggressively but because we did consciously take the census down to get our hands around the programming and those sort of things.", "So, very bullish, but they need to have a good next 60, 90 days on growing the census there. But as far as the integrations, they have gone extremely well, exceeded our expectations. Both the folks that came over from the companies we acquired and our team have done a great job.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Great. And you made the comment on the facility that was problematic at ABS. There was a similar sort of very problematic facility at Horizon and then I was just wondering if you could make any comment in terms of now that you are really in there, is it basically what you thought was and you're working towards correcting that. You seem to have identified the problem sort of going into and I just wanted to see what the track record is so far.", "Joey Jacobs", "It is in similar stages there. We have a new CEO and they are working on the programming there and we will be able to grow the census quicker there because the deflections this is more of an acute this is actually an acute facility.", "So we will be able to ramp the census up there quicker and we made many of our major changes on September 1 for the facility, in the facility. We're monitoring it daily, but we think we have a good plan there and I'm very optimistic about what it can do in 2008.", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Matt Riperger with Citi.", "Jie Bao - Citigroup", "It is Jie Bao (ph) for Matt Riperger. A couple questions. On the organic side, organic growth side of the business, can you just give us an update in terms of what is the current cost trend of the business on the same facility basis so that we can see the operating leverage when compared to your four to 5% pricing and seven to 9% revenue growth?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think the quick way to measure that is how our margin is improving and if you go back and if you look at our slide presentations where we do a lot of quarterly comparisons there, PSI on its same-store facilities, through the revenue growth, and managing expenses. For the third quarter, I think the margin was up 150 basis points to the same quarter last year.", "So, that is the best way to measure how we're doing there and once again, we think there is more to do there and especially with the 24 facilities that we have acquired during the past twelve months. So, that is the best way to measure how we're doing there.", "Jie Bao - Citigroup", "Okay. And in terms of Horizon, I know that you have an estimated accretion of $0.17 to $0.20 12 months after the transaction closing. Do you have an estimate in terms of the accretion for '07 versus '08 on a calendar-year basis?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, we do not. Sorry.", "Jie Bao - Citigroup", "Okay. But is the accretion more significant in the first half of the year or second half of the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "When we gave our guidance on Horizon, we said it was going to be I believe, I do not have the exact number, but at around your $0.09 to $0.10 for 2007, so the balance is going to be in 2008 that nets to the $0.17 to $0.20.", "Jie Bao - Citigroup", "Okay, lastly on the Mental Health Parity legislation, can you maybe just give a little more color in terms of the opportunities you see from there? Is it more patients, new patients and patient volume grows, or length of stay expansion, more cash collection or maybe even new businesses? Can you just give more color in terms of what opportunities you see from that?", "Joey Jacobs", "I can just give you; it\u2019s very hard to measure, but the biggest benefits in the Mental Health Parity Bill at the federal level is that for the large self insured companies that it will help eliminate the discrimination between physical benefits and mental health benefits.", "For example, if you are a large self-insurer and on the medical side you have a $1000 deductible for a hospital admission, you might have a $2000 for mental health. What would require is that they would have to bring that deductible down to the $1000. They would have to be equal. That is just an example.", "That is not a real world example. I just picked two numbers out of the air to talk about that example, but what the Federal Mental Health Parity bill will do will be the large self-insured companies would have to quit discriminating between the benefits. So, it is a positive for us, a positive for us, but it's something you cannot measure. We do know more people will have better coverage for mental health illness.", "Jie Bao - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take final question form John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "My question has been answered, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Having no further questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Joey Jacobs.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thank you and once again thanks for you listening in to the earnings call for us today. As you can see, the third quarter was a great quarter. You can see our earnings guidance for next year has great growth in it and we feel good about the acquisition pipeline.", "But most importantly, I feel good about going out and visiting the facility. We were at Laurel Ridge Hospital yesterday with the Board and Dan Thomas, the CEO there, a terrific tour, overview of the facility, the need for more beds, and the services he is providing there.", "Also last week for the first time, we brought all of our CEOs to the Company, into the Company, to Franklin for our meeting and it went extremely well. Once again, I feel good about the teams we have out there and the Company's 2008 opportunities, so once again, thanks for listening in and we will talk to you on the next call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Hamilton, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter 2007 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you, Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you and good morning. I am Steven Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. And welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full yea rand fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded income from continuing operations per diluted share of $3.18 for the year and $0.75 for the quarter. After adjusting for certain operating and recovery expenses of our acute facilities in New Orleans resulting from damages sustained from hurricane Katrina, our adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was $0.74.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors, and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, which we filed with the SEC last night.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. Revenues for the fourth quarter increased 12% over the prior year. Exclusive of the impact of new facilities, most notably Texoma and the revenues related to a construction management contract, whereby we have built a new hospital for an unrelated third-party, revenues have increased by 8%.", "On a same facility basis in our Acute division revenues less provision for doubtful accounts increased 7.4% during the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in revenue per adjusted admission. Admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year were flat for the quarter. As we have previously indicated that we expected during the fourth quarter of 2007, newly constructed capacity at the physician-owned hospital in the McAllen, Texas unfavorably impacted our admissions in that market.", "On a same facility basis, revenue per adjusted admission rose 4.8% during the fourth quarter of 2007.We define operating margins as operating income or net revenue as salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenue.", "On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 13.9% during the fourth quarter of 2007 from 12.1% during the fourth quarter of 2006. Our acute care hospitals provides charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates, amounting to $130 million and $117 million during the three-month period ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 respectively.", "On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 9.5% during the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase resulted from admissions growth and an increase in revenue per adjusted admission. Admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 7.3% during the fourth quarter and revenue per adjusted admission rose 2.8% over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 23.4% during the quarter ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 22.8% during the comparable prior year period. Our cash flow from operating activities was approximately $26 million during the fourth quarter of 2007, following the third quarter when it was $164 million. As we discussed last quarter, we were favorably impacted in the third quarter by a $48 million change in other working capital accounts, due primarily to the timing of certain accrued payroll and accounts payable disbursements, which were funded in early October.", "At December 31, 2007, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 40% and the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA was 1.98. We spent $76 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to do our new 165-bed Centennial Hills Hospital in Las Vegas, that opened in January and a new 171-bed hospital in Palmdale, California, that is scheduled to be completed and opened in 2009.", "Also in California, we are underway with a major expansion of our Emergency Imaging and Women's Services at our Southwest Healthcare Campuses in Riverside County, California. Our behavioral facilities have operated at a very efficient 77% available occupancy rate for the year. These high occupancy rates are suppressing our admissions growth in certain markets, but we have multiple projects to add capacity to our busiest behavioral facilities. We opened the total of approximately 400 new behavioral health beds during 2007 and expect to open a similar number in 2008.", "During the fourth quarter of 2007, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our Class B common stock and we repurchased another 1.7 million in the first quarter of 2008. We currently have 3.9 million shares remaining under the previous authorized share repurchase program.", "We will be pleased to answer any questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from line of Justine Lake.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, on the behavioral health side, the admission there were probably much hard then I think most of us were looking for. Anything you can tell us as far as what you saw thee right in the quarter and how sustainable you expect that to be -- that run rate to be at 2008?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, obviously, we were extremely pleased with that growth rate, Justine. I don't know that I would venture to say, we're sustainable at that level. But our admissions have been strong. They average there a little over 4% for the year. We've talked about being able to sustained behavioral same-store admissions in the 3% to 4% range.", "And I think that, we should be able to -- I mean that 7% number I think reflected the strength throughout the portfolio. It wasn't really just focused on a few markets. I think it reflects the benefit that we're getting from this ongoing capacity expansion program that we've been talking about now for several years. It reflects our efforts in certain cases to convert residential beds to acute beds in one of that Keystone facilities we did that with great success. So, I think it's a function of just a lot of the strategy execution that's been in place for a number of years and just general strength throughout the portfolio.", "Alan Miller", "Let me add something to that. The business since it's largely directed by managed care and various governmental authorities, it's a trust business in part. People have to get to know you and trust that the company is a solid company. It does a very good job quality wise and that's how I view this. It's just a compliment to the professionalism of all of our people and the trust that they have in their markets.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "That's all from me. Just may be a couple of bigger picture questions. I mean the 10-K you put out last night gave some color around Las Vegas and so and McAllen obviously Vegas is doing extremely well given that the Sierra impact that benefited '07 as well as some Centennial of that maybe you have a little bit of a drag in 2008, at least in the first half.", "Can you tell us if that built up facility base in Las Vegas has been growing for something like 20% a year over the last couple of years given what you saw in '07, which you know, it's going to happen in '08? Can you tell us what kind of growth do you expect to see out of Las Vegas when you put out your 10-K last year?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think you've touched on sort of the moving parts in the market Justin. We've talked for sometime in our 2007 guidance, we had anticipated that San Antonio would actually open a little bit earlier than it has and we had included in our 2007 guidance $0.08 to $0.10 of dilution for San Antonio. We've probably realized a couple of cent of that in the fourth quarter just with pre-opening cost and now I think have shifted $0.07 or $0.08 of that into 2008.", "San Antonio has gotten off to a fast start in its first few weeks. We were very bullish about its prospects. But it's certainly is going to incur operating losses in the first half of the year and we fully anticipate that and we've embedded that in our guidance. But again, generally feel very bullish about its long-term prospects.", "As far the Sierra situation, that's a little bit much more up in the air. We need to renegotiate our contract and we're in the process of doing that with Sierra by late spring, early summer. And I think our view is we're relatively well positioned regardless of how that turns out. If we renew our contract at reasonable rates and HCA remains out of the network then I think that will be a positive for us.", "If however, Sierra and HCA decide to renew their historical relationship and HCA gets back in their network, I think we feel there is an opportunity for us to go out and replace some Sierra business with other Medicare, Bluecross, other managed care business that we had lost by accommodating that Sierra business. And frankly, as we've talked about for a while now, that other business is better paying business.", "So, we'll have to manage through all that. And we don't know at this point exactly how that's going to sort out, but we're relatively pleased with our position. Now, obviously we can't replicate in 2008 the same earnings surge that we had from the incremental Sierra volume that we got in '07, but we think we can maintain that profitability. And then, we've talked about the dilution we'll get from San Antonio in the short-term.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Okay. Just one last big picture question for Alan, the other piece that you disclosed in the K is the McAllen facility and obviously about seen its share of issues, and it looks like it continues to deteriorate is there anything you could tell us as far as a timetable for when you expect some of the initiatives you put forth to see improvement or when you would make a decision as far as whether you want to continue in that market given that it looks like it's now at a net operating loss for you in 2007 and probably continues that way in '08?", "Alan Miller", "Justin, let me try and answer that question. I think that as we've talked about before there is still a great deal that we like about the McAllen market. It remains a fast growing market. It is not necessarily an over bedded or a market that has an excess of capacity. The facilities there operate relatively full.", "So, the challenge for us is to regain some of the better paying commercial and better paying and better margin Medicare business has been lost over the last few years. We think we've strategies in place to do that. But we're very conscious of the fact that McAllen has turned into a negative contributor for us and is something we're watching very carefully as we employ these strategies and execute our plan.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Okay. So, no specific thought that you could share with us?", "Alan Miller", "No. I don't think so. I mean I think that in general we rarely said to the firm, hard and fast deadlines for ourselves. But I can assure you that in terms of the dynamics that you've noted, we're very well aware them and following them closely and they are refracting how we think about investments in the market etcetera.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "All right. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Weakley.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I was curious, we spend a lot of time on bad debt over the years, but in looking back at my model, labor cost of 43% is, I think relatively high over history. So if I went back to 2000, your labor costs were only about 39%. I know some of that's going to be because of pricing deceleration in some of the gross charges issues. But can you maybe disentangle the pricing declaration versus what's ever happening on the labor side? Help us understand that 400 basis points of erosion, if you will, on labor margin?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, Ken, it sound to me like your question is more a long-term question, I think you rapidly....", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "Yeah.", "Steve Filton", "Going back to 2000, I think, clearly, few things that happen since 2000 more so sort of from the 2003 time period, we've seen as an industry kind of a deceleration in volume and as well as an increase in uninsured that has driven revenue down and that has made it more difficult to gain the sort of efficiencies that we're regaining in the 2000, 2001, 2002 time period. Clearly, that's also a time period in which there has been significant wage inflation.", "Again, to remind everybody, I think the industry really saw an explosion in its use of temporary nurses and registry nurses in that kind of 2000, 2001 time period. I think those pressures have at least moderated, but they certainly have resulted in just higher base level wage rate structure for our nurses.  I'd also point out to people who are sort of following us specifically that when we brought our pharmacy services in house in the middle of 2006, we obviously moved to significant salary expense from other operating expenses to salary expense.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "All right. ", "Steve Filton", "But I think the other factors that we have mentioned certainly has all -- had a factor in squeezing those margins in that time period.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "Do you have any expectations or goal to get that back down over the next few years or is it something that's sort of gets embedded into the cost structure and you just have to learn until revenue growth accelerates?", "Steve Filton", "I think that some of the factors are probably beyond our control in terms of the nursing shortage and the shortage of other clinical personnel. And while I think that those are factors that should again moderate as the years go on and we see that nursing enrollment figures have increased. And so, we'll see a greater pipeline of nurses coming into the system. None of that I think happens immediately. I think we're back to -- and I think you see it in the periods when we have decent volume growth and better payer mix or salaries as a percentage of revenue look better. And I think that will be the dynamic that continues to, sort of, be visible at least in our results.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "One last question on the acquisition side, it has been a while since you have acquired an asset or done, or at least had an active profile in that regard. Do you, I mean, is the cost per bed getting to a range where you're comfortable looking at more assets? Is the marketplace more interesting? I know there are a lot of companies out there trying to sell assets. So just curios about your Acute care expansion plans going forward.", "Steve Filton", "Our last acute care acquisition of note was just about a year ago when we bought Texoma. And we were pleased with that and like the prospects of that asset. But, I think, you know our history, Ken, we are pretty disciplined and opportunistic acquirer. We're going to acquire assets either acute or behavioral when we think they make sense, when we think they fit our profile, when we think there are reasonably priced. And we're not going to acquire assets that don't fit those criteria. So, we continue to look for asset potentials and asset opportunities. Most of the assets that have been for sale but you kind of alluded to have been other for-profit assets.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "Yeah.", "Steve Filton", "Historically, that has not been a great interest of ours. We just don't view them as having great opportunity. Though, there has been a handful for-profit deals that we've done over the years like in Aiken and Rancho Springs, California that we've done quite well with. But generally, we prefer to look not-for-profit assets. So we'll continue to look, but part of the reason that we became aggressive acquirer on shares again in the fourth quarter of '07 and the first quarter of '08 was that, we viewed the acquisition of our own earnings stream to be the most -- certain prudent economic investment that we can make. So, we're constantly sort of reevaluating all of our opportunities and we'll continue to do so.", "Alan Miller", "And you're really talking about growth as well and in Las Vegas, San Antonio and -- we're going to really this. Other than being concerned about your bedroom with fees for the acquisitions, this a 165-bed acquisition developed, no fee and you're going to like the results.", "Steve Filton", "", "I am very excited about it.", "Alan Miller", "And next year we have another one.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "Yes.", "Alan Miller", "Service at Palmdale. So, we view it as both. We view it as either development or acquisition as long as there is growth in the company. And you also know that we made a few acquisitions in behavioral health end of this past year. But we do that again, very selectively. We're not looking to just pile in numbers. We do it very selectively.", "Ken Weakley - UBS", "Thanks so much. Take care.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Darren Lehrich", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, Alan and Steve. This the second year in which you've commenced slightly above your annual guidance and I guess, in fact, both years you left that guidance untouched unlike most of our peers. My question is do you think this is the result of any kind of improving visibility in your markets and just Steve could you help me think about whether there has been any noteworthy changes to your budgeting or planning process that gives us anymore precision than you had before?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think, you know Darren -- some of what has caused the volatility in our space in general over the last few years certainly has affected back in 2003, 2004. We saw our volumes decline on the acute side. And we certainly have seen an increase in our insured and our volumes have come back, I think stronger than just about any of our peers. But we still, although we did well in the fourth quarter, we still have some unpredictability and volatility that occurs with our uninsured volumes.", "Some of the stuff that's been specific is cause of volatility. I think has clearly moderated or mitigated itself. We've lost significant profitability in the McAllen market in '04 and '05. But it has been relatively stable in the last couple of years and that's been helpful to our result. We obviously had a significant loss of EBITDA in '05 in the New Orleans market, when we lost two facilities as a result of hurricane Katrina. We obviously view that as a nonrecurring item.", "So, I think things have stabilized in the acute portfolio, and then half of our earnings are thereabout come from the Behavioral business, which has been more stable. So, I think in that sense, as you point out I mean we've met or slightly exceeded our annual guidance in '06 and in '07 and are just feeling generally that the business is a little bit more stable and predictable at least on a longer-term basis. There may still be quarterly bumpiness, but on a longer-term basis I think we sense greatest stability than we did a few years ago.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks. And then with regard to your new group purchasing organization, how quickly do you expect to convert and can you give us a sense for some of the higher value supply cost items like implants that what kind of percentage savings might be possible?", "Steve Filton", "We'll change our group purchasing organization affiliation effective April 1. And as you suggest Darren it is driven almost entirely by an expectation in our part that we'll get improve pricing by doing so. It will be a little bit of transition to do that. I think we're making every effort to transition as completely as possible, but it does take a little while to do so.", "So, we think -- I think we'll enjoy some modest improvements in our supply pricing in 2008, but probably get the full benefit of that frankly in 2009 and going forward. But I think is largely across the board, I don't know that in any particular supply category or any particular service line.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And that's helpful. And just back to Las Vegas, Alan, I know, it sounds like you're there. When it comes time to renew the Sierra contract do you have a sense from your people there whether United will bring you the combined business and products to re-contract or is it still just the Sierra business at this point?", "Alan Miller", "Most of the current conversations and as you know obviously the merger was just effective in the last few days. Most of the current conversations however have really been about the legacy Sierra products. United does not have all that bigger presence in Las Vegas and our expectation I think, Darren quite frankly what will happen overtime is that the United products will probably sort of face out and most of those people will move into Sierra products in one form or another and that's the way that the United-Sierra entity will achieve their savings and achieve their goal. So, we see that as kind of more something that takes place over a little bit of an extended timeline rather than something that kind of -- there is an on and off switch to.", "Steve Filton", "We've a very good relationship with Sierra and they are going to be driving the combined business here. So, we feel good about that.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "How is the San Antonio, how it's ramping Alan and I'll jump back here?", "Alan Miller", "I'd say ahead of expectations. And I think this is extraordinarily well placed in terms of growth of the community and generally all around everybody, who has been involved with this very bullish.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good Morning. May be just following up on the last part of that last question, Steve, obviously when you open a new facility there are some probably cannibalization from some of your existing. So, can you, is there anyway to sort of put in perspective or measure the ramp up at San Antonio how much of an impact that's having as we think about same store numbers for your volume trends versus maybe you just taking market share from others?", "Steve Filton", "Our expectation Tom is that there will be some cannibalization, but probably not as much, when we opened Spring Valley four years ago. When we opened Spring Valley the nearest hospital to us was one of our own Summerlin. Whereas when we opened San Antonio the nearest hospital I've noticed is an HCA facility. So, I think we're just in a better position this time around not to cannibalize quite as much, but there will be some of that.", "It's little hard to tell, San Antonio has been open for few weeks. There is no sort of precise way to know exactly where your business would have gone, had it not come to San Antonio. We're seeing a little bit of softness in the market all around in Vegas in the earlier part of '08, I don't know that it's due to San Antonio's opening. Some of it is -- we are seeing record ER volumes throughout the market, but not necessarily seeing that all convert into admissions. And I suspect that may just be a temporary issue and maybe a function of a flu season that's resulting in lot ER traffic but not in kind of admissions.", "Also, another dynamic is that, there is Blue Cross contract in the market that now includes Catholic Healthcare West as a provider and they were not a provider before. I think we feel like we've lost a little bit to Blue Cross business to that. But, generally as Alan said, the San Antonio volumes are very strong. They don't seem to be affecting our other hospitals in any great way. And so, that's pretty consistent with our expectation. And we're pleased with the way it's gotten off the track in the first few weeks.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Good. Maybe just on the behavioral health side, two things there. You're obviously adding significant amount of beds and that's fostering the growth, is there any particular services or programs that there is a real demand out there for or it is just sort of vary by market? And then I am wondering what you're seeing on the pricing side in that business?", "Steve Filton", "Well, as far as pricing goes, our pricing in the fourth quarter was pretty strong. And frankly, throughout the year, we've been pleased with the admissions, but there've been few quarters where we would have liked the pricing to be a little bit higher. But certainly the pricing in the fourth quarter is well within, kind of, what we think are the sustainable levels for the next couple of years. So, we were pretty pleased with that.", "I think as to your first question, it is really a market-by-market issue. I mentioned in one of our Keystone facility, we converted residential to acute bed and have seen a really dramatic increase in admissions as a result of that. But we've got other residential programs that are doing quite well. And quite honestly, I don't think you can have 7% same-store admission growth amongst 85 inpatient facilities unless you don't have relatively strong performance across a pretty wide slot of facilities. And I think that's what we've got.", "So, I don't think it's specific to any particular program and I would echo what Allen said, I think we feel like we've got some real solid franchises. And in a quarter like this, we just feel like all that blocking and tackling that you do, and choosing the right facilities, etc etera pays off. ", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "And maybe just one last one. The investigation down in Texas, and I am sensing, sort of, maybe some progress there?", "Steve Filton", "I mean as our 10-K disclosure indicates, we are having conversations with the government and I would say, probably for the first time really since the investigation began, Tom, we feel like we maybe at least seeing light at the end of the tunnel. Meaning that, I was saying, maybe we're at the beginning of it, says, of trying to bring this to a conclusion. I think it is still way too really for us to predict precisely or even remotely what the outcome would be. But we at least seem to entering that phase where the government is ready to talk about a resolution and we're anxious to do so under the appropriate term.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold.", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. A couple of questions. Earnings progression, a moral challenge, where it looks like behavioral health year-over-year, kind of, first half of the year looks strong, San Antonio with some dilution but looks good. Do you see first half earnings in kind of in a way you're looking at things up year-over-year in the first half of '08?", "Steve Filton", "I think you raise the couple of issues, Christine. We will have that San Antonio dilution. It will clearly be front half loaded in 2008. Particularly in the first quarter our comparisons with last year are difficult. We had a very, very strong first quarter in 2007, largely as a result of surge in Sierra volume at our facilities without sort of any commensurate losses or other volume, which occurred later in the year. And we had a very positive bad debt performance, which then kind of weakened in the second and third quarter and then approved again in the fourth quarter.", "I think our underlying guidance presumes that uninsured volumes will rise again modestly in 2008. But we don't give quarterly guidance and we are not about to start, I think particularly in this environment where sort of quarter-to-quarter changes can be a little bit tough to predict et cetera. So, we're sort of comfortable with our annual guidance, obviously and would caution people that we do have tough comparisons in the first quarter. And just to keep that in mind, the San Antonio dilution will be front end loaded. But other than that, we're not going to give a whole lot more precise guidance about how the quarter is going to look or how the first half is going to look.", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay. And then coming out just from a different angle and so far you say that you don't want to comment, it's just something that I'd like to know. As you look at kind of your guidance for '08, you're kind of guiding up relative to consensus expectations. Where do you see the upside relative to that models that you've are seeing from the sale side?", "Steve Filton", "And I'll answer the question I think a little differently Christine, in that. When we give our guidance and we're doing our budgeting, our models in deference to you all, we're not paying much attention. I rarely look at sell side models. We've enough trouble running our own business well alone keeping track of how other people view it in that sense.", "So, the way I think about it is, we've got two businesses and our behavioral business, we've said we kind of expect and our guidance implies 3% to 4% same store volumes, 3% to 4% pricing on the Acute side, 2% to 3% volumes, 4% to 5% pricing that I think translates to the sort of right around double digit EBITDA growth that was embedded in the guidance and that's how we're thinking about the business.", "With the San Antonio dilution in there etcetera but that's how we get comfortable with the guidance that we've given and again not we don't do a whole lot of reconciliation. I'd venture to say we do really do no reconciliation with what the sell side models are.", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, fair enough. And then final question on the economic outlook and what we're seeing in terms of the consumer restricted access to credit, the housing crisis, the economy, how do you think about that when you put together your expectations?", "Alan Miller", "Well, we certainly are watching the overall -- watching economic situation nationally and then in our local markets closely. But so far, feel like it has not had in most of our markets, a terribly significant effect, I'd say probably the markets in which we've seen the most softness so far have been in Florida, where we've a couple of markets.", "But even though Vegas has been kind of very visible sort of nationally with headlines about leading the foreclosure rate crisis and everything else. And the Vegas economy seems to be holding up and at least from our perspective, we don't seem to be suffering as of yet. We're doing okay in California even though that's also started as a market that's been hard hit by the credit and housing crises.", "So, we're watching carefully. I mean one suggestion has been and I think it's too early to tell whether it was true or not, but one suggestion has been that if there is a softening economy and people loose their jobs that some of those people, who loose their jobs in industries like construction and related businesses are people who probably are most likely, who have lost their health insurance over the last few years anyway.", "And so, we maybe somewhat more insulated in this economic downturn has an industry than we've been historically. But I don't know if that's intuitively that makes sense to me, but we'll wait and see. But at least so far, and again, I think our fourth quarter results will speak to that we've not seen a tremendous correlation between softness in the housing markets and the subprime crisis in our results.", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Erik Chiprich.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of an update on Manatee, how's that's ramping up and the accretiveness of the Texoma assets now?", "Alan Miller", "Erik, I think as far as the Manatee market goes, we talked about a fairly disruptive construction project there that finally finished up at the end of the second quarter. As I just mentioned to Christine or in response to Christine's question, the Florida market is one in which we sense some of sort of underlying softness. Interestingly in that Manatee market when we talk to our peers down there, we feel like we're probably doing a little bit better than most of the other sort of reported numbers we get from our peers.", "So, we feel like that's clearly a benefit of this construction project it's finally finished. As far as Texoma, I think Texoma is pretty much meeting our expectations. Again, the structure in the Texoma deal is that -- we acquired a profitable hospital and expected to make some modest improvements there but the big improvements we expect to occur when we open a replacement facility, which at this point is probably in early 2010. So, we're improving a little bit there but expect the opportunity to take real amounts of incremental market share, when we open the new facility.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Great. And then could you talk a little bit on the construction projects that you guys were conducting during 2007. How the revenues and costs matched up? Was there anything in the fourth quarter that allowed more profitability to flow through on that project and maybe early in the year.", "Steve Filton", "I don't think. So, I mean I think that ultimately we round up recording maybe $6 million or $7 million of EBITDA in connection with that project most of it in 2007. But I think pretty ratably -- pretty much ratably over the year.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then finally on the San Antonio Hills. Could you talk about expectations, where you think maybe in a year's time target for revenue or EBITDA margin on that facility?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I think our expectations Erik are that, again we've said a couple of times in the call that San Antonio will be EBITDA dilutive in the first half of the year and maybe through the summer and then by the backend of the year probably becomes EBITDA positive. If we sort of go back to our Spring Valley experience and even our Summerlin experience 10 years ago. I think within 18 to 24 months, we think that the facility is operating at market-wide average EBITDA margins and that's kind of been our experience in the market. And I think as Alan's remarks sort of indicated anything, we might be hopeful that San Antonio gets there little bit earlier. But I think it gives you a sense of what sort of timeline looks like.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks for the information.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from line of Adam Feinstein.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay. Thank you. Good morning. I guess Steve just a question here. I am just trying to think about the fourth quarter. I heard your outlook and everything for Vegas, but was there kind of thing about the overall volumes for Vegas in the fourth quarter relative to the flat number you reported. I assume Vegas would have been higher than that, but just want to get confirmation.", "And I guess in answering that question, I guess my thought just being hear that your revenue per adjusted admission accelerated. So, I was just wondering if you had back held some of the non-Sierra patients and maybe saw less Sierra volume which help to be higher revenue per adjusted admits, so any comments there?", "Steve Filton", "As I kind of alluded to in my opening remarks, probably the single biggest driver of the flat admission was our experience in the McAllen market in the quarter as we have talked about expecting now for any number of quarters that the physician owned facility in McAllen opened up their OB service early in the fourth quarter, and we have seen our OB volume declined. Now, most of that decline is in not all that profitable business, so it hasn't really affected our profitability as much as it does be just the visibility of admissions.", "But if you take out the McAllen admission for the quarter, we were up about 1.5%, and I think the Vegas admission were sort of consistent with that, probably up by about that amount. We didn't really see any shift in Sierra volume during the quarter. And I think that your question about what really contributed to the better revenue per unit in the quarter is a function of their payer mix, which we've talked about a few times now.", "And then, a couple of other small things, some better Medicare management, Medicare utilization in a couple of markets are more effective. At Manatee, we're actually in the back half of the year. We had a Medicaid rate increase that was specific to the hospital, not broad rate increase in the state. Actually, we've seen a rate decline over on the state, but so we see -- there were couple of other things that really push that revenue a little bit but payer mix is probably the main issue in the quarter.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And with respect to bad debt expense, I guess, clearly, you saw some improvement here in the quarter relative to the third quarter. So just as -- we think about the run rate going forward, just trying to think about, what your expectations are? And I am not sure if you had an uninsured volume number for the quarter, I heard you say something about, but I didn't hear a number.", "Steve Filton", "Uninsured volumes are actually down in the quarter. I think our self-pay or non-pay admissions were actually down about 2% in the quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay.", "Steve Filton", "Adam, I think I was getting into this -- I think in my answers to Christine, I mean it's a little bit hard to do this with great precision, certainly on a quarterly basis. But at the end of the day, I think our 2007 uninsured experience was relatively consistent with what our expectations were and that was we said going into 2007 that we expected a modest increase in uninsured volumes, not nearly as dramatic as we saw in '05 and '06 but still going up a little bit. And I think that that's how we go into 2008 with that same expectation and we'll see a modest increase in uninsured, probably along the lines of what we saw in 2007, but not nearly as dramatic as '05 and '06.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then on the psychiatric side, just I guess a couple of questions. In term of adding new beds -- you guys are adding some new beds, psychiatric solutions is also, what are you seeing, are you seeing other providers adding new beds? I am just curious in terms of whether you think you're going to see a big increase in beds in the next couple of years, so any thoughts there? And then, at the same, I want to know how the schools that you guys purchased a couple of years ago are doing, that was a new business for you. So, I am just curious in terms of how the numbers have shaped up there?", "Steve Filton", "Right. As you know, Adam, because I know you followed the behavioral industry pretty closely, I mean, there was virtually no new capacity added to the free standing behavioral industry for probably 15 years, from the early 90s until 2004 when I think we really sort of were on the cutting edge of providers who started to add capacity for the first time.", "Yeah. There are as you suggest now some other providers who are jumping into that as well. But I don't sense that it's having a significant effect on overall capacity in the behavioral industry, certainly in our markets in which we operate we don't sense. Frankly, as we do on the acute side, there is just a general upsurge in capacity additions all around. So I think people are still doing it relatively selectively and the fact that it's occurring after so many years of no expansion at all, means that it's not really being overdone the way that it was 15 plus years ago.", "Alan Miller", "Adam?", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Yes.", "Alan Miller", "Let me add in also that every provider is not exactly the same. And there have been couple of startups that have looked at how well we've being doing over the past few years and what we're seeing is that they are buying up facilities to get started that we've no interest in at prices that we would never pay. So, that's what they are doing rather than adding capacity. It's really a change of ownership.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "I got you, I got you.", "Alan Miller", "I'm sorry Adam. I was just going to try and answer your school question.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, please. Thanks.", "Alan Miller", "So, we acquired some day schools in California as part of the Keystone acquisition back in October of 2005. I think we've said a few times that was a business as you indicate Adam that was sort of new to us. We're experimenting with it. It has been not something that frankly we've found and particularly successful and I certainly don't think we've any desire to expand that business. It was a relatively small part of Keystone's business and obviously as a result is a very small part of our overall Behavioral business. But again not something that I think we'll look to expand in any significant way.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you for the comments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Hi, good morning. Behavioral health bad debt was up a little bit, is there anything to note there?", "Steve Filton", "No. I don't think so, John. I think bad debt in the Behavioral business it's a little bit different dynamic than it is in the Acute. We sometimes make decisions to take patients who don't have insurance as an accommodation to referral sources or because we think we might be able to qualify somebody etcetera and we can't. But now, I mean I think we're very judicious about how we handle that. I looked at bad debt expense for the quarter it wasn't up in any particular market and it didn\u2019t seem to be a bad result in any event obviously given the overall result.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. Can you remind me I guess you've taken a $0.07, $0.08 hit this year for the San Antonio? What is your expected hit '08 over '07 for your construction management revenue on those kinds of little line item? But do you have a little pressure there this year?", "Steve Filton", "Not much -- not too much measurable. I mean I mentioned before that we probably recorded $6 million or so of EBITDA related to that contract which will finish up in the first quarter of '08. But we're in the process and I think pretty far long in negotiating a second contract, which we'll have going in 2008 or we expect to have going in 2008. And while I don't think we'll be able to replicate those exact same EBITDA numbers. We should be able to replicate probably at least half of that may be a little bit more. So, there shouldn't be any real material fall off in the contribution of that little business.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "May be a couple of million?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. Thirdly, what's your share count assumption for 2008 and how much do you've left under your buyback?", "Steve Filton", "As I said in my opening remarks we bought back approximately $3 million shares between the fourth quarter of '07 and the first quarter of '08. We've included those buybacks in our assumptions. We've a little under $4 million left on our authorization and as is our practice we've not assumed any of those shares that bought back as part of our guidance.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "All right. So, if we were to do end of the quarter share count fourth quarter end of the quarter share count first quarter just based on what you've announced, what -- can we just -- can you just get some numbers there make sure we're straight?", "Steve Filton", "$51 million at the end of the first quarter with the $3 million shares bought back between fourth and the first quarter.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "$51 million, okay. And but no further just to reiterate no further buyback I assume given the $4 million left you're not assuming any further buybacks in your guidance?", "Steve Filton", "Right and that's consistent with the way we've always done guidance.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. Two other things these are getting less and less important. I guess in Florida the governors proposed to eliminate CON and also we've been reading about Sarasota Memorial trying to cross the accounting line and encourage a little bit on your Manatee, any comments on either of those two?", "Steve Filton", "I think that we're sort of evaluating the position to take vis-\u00e0-vis CON and although probably our position at the end of the day that will make a huge difference in the grand scheme. I think it cuts both ways. I think you actually know our Florida facilities pretty well, John and we think obviously CONs provide some protection and a barrier to entry. But at the same time, I look at our Wellington Hospital it has prevented us from adding capacity over the years that clearly we felt was needed etcetera. So, again I think it cuts both ways. I don't know that it's going to have a huge impact on us one way or the other. You're right,", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "But you guys are making some pretty -- pretty scary comments in the papers that's good positioning.", "Alan Miller", "But don't believe all that paper stuff. The issue with the CON, we're in two markets and we've some pretty good competition there right now. So, I don't think there would be anymore people coming into those markets and you're very familiar with them John.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Sure, sure.", "Alan Miller", "And Wellington -- Wellington has HCA up the street Sarasota -- and Boca and a couple of others down the street. So, the only thing that I'm looking at frankly is a couple of opportunities that I've been looking at for years in terms of new construction, great growing markets that would enable us to get in, but that's speculating.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. And then I don't had a chance to go through your 10K, but is there any update of note in disproportionate share or any state Medicaid developments that you kept your eye on?", "Steve Filton", "Disproportionate share, I think at this point has largely been renewed for in the states were it's important to us, most notably Texas and secondarily South Carolina with perhaps some amount of that slight decline in '08 but not dramatic. And again all that's embedded in guidance. What we don't know at this point is what happens at the end of '08, since the state fiscal year is kind of restore at that point.", "And as you know, we've been talking about this Texas UPL issue now for three or four months in Texas, where CMS is reviewing the programs in our south Texas counties that we participate in. We've said all along that we think that we're fairly confident that the programs will be upheld and will continue to receive this money, but we still don't have any sort of definitive feedback from CMS. So we await that, but we feel pretty good about that.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. Well, I mean I just want a, as general comment, in a tough industry, you guys have certainly exercised a very good judgment every time, especially relative to your peers?", "Steve Filton", "Thanks, appreciate that, John.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Englander.", "Jeff Englander - America's Growth Capital", "Good morning, guys.", "Steve Filton", "Good morning. ", "Jeff Englander - America's Growth Capital", "I'm wondering if you can just give a little more color on the other operating expense line and the supplies line, and in particular sustainability of that improvement? I apologize if I miss that, I hop in the call a little late.", "Steve Filton", "No, I don't think anybody has specifically asked that question. I mean I think, again, the reason that supplies and operating expenses look as good as they do in the quarter is because revenues look good. It was a good pricing quarter on both ends and good volume quarter obviously on the behavioral end especially.", "But I think generally, we think the risks, if you will, are on the topline in terms of volumes and in terms of uninsured volumes and uninsured risks. I think we feel pretty good about most of our expense categories. Darren Lehrich asked the question earlier about a change in our GPOs and we certainly think that will help us to continue to sustain some improvement in the supply line. And again the other operating expense line is largely our fixed costs. And so I think how that line looks is very much dependent on how revenue looks more than what's happening on the line itself. So, we're feeling generally good about expenses and our ability to control expenses in general.", "Jeff Englander - America's Growth Capital", "Anything in terms of the supply line, in terms of that's going on -- a number of your competitors have reported similar experience, maybe in terms of your implantable devices or anything like that that's going on, that you're seeing there?", "Steven Filton", "No. I think we saw for a while a decline in drug-eluting stent usage that I think was being reported industry-wide. And then, in recent months that volume has started pick up again. But I don't know that that's significant enough to really move the needle. Other than that, I mean, again, I think acute care hospitals in general have really, because we've faced a lot of competition on the less sort of intensive side of the business.", "We've intended to focus on more supply intensive parts of the business, in cardiology, cardiology surgery, orthopedics, neurosurgery, and all those are supply expense and intensive lines of business. And I think we'll continue to see that trend occur, but I don't know that it will necessarily put pressure on our supply as a percentage of revenue. I think we feel pretty good about our ability to improve that relationship.", "Jeff Englander - America's Growth Capital", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Next, we have Kemp Dolliver.", "Kemp Dolliver - SG Cowen", "", "Thanks. Main question relates to your self-pay trends. Have your outpatient self-pay volumes deviated much from what you've been reporting on inpatient?", "Steven Filton", "Kemp, I don't have those numbers in front of me at the moment. But historically, we found that I think they moved pretty similarly, mainly because the real outpatient volumes from a self-pay basis is a emergency room and usually, however, that volumes moving or inpatient or admission volumes tend to move the same way.", "Kemp Dolliver - SG Cowen", "Okay. The other question relates to there is something structural in your market because you are in state such as Nevada and Texas and Florida, which have above average uninsured population yet once you got through the issues in McAllen your uninsured volume growth sounds have been nearly dramatic. There are many of your peers who overlap with you geographically. Have you looked at what it may account for those differences? Is it just simply better zip codes or something more subtle?", "Steven Filton", "I mean always you think -- and you already mentioned why that come to mind at least in the last few years is obviously, we benefited in Vegas market by obviously a very significant increase in Sierra volume. So, we have this kind of unusual increase in paying volume, that's not accompanied by commensurate increase in nonpaying volume.", "And then in McAllen we had an unfavorable payer mix trend in '05 and '06, where we lost paying business but that kind of as leveled out in '06 and '07. And so, I think on both those scores we're probably have maybe perhaps a little bit more moderation in the last year or two than perhaps our peers have had in their markets.", "Kemp Dolliver - SG Cowen", "That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we've Bill Bonello.", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities", "Just a couple of big picture questions. The first is, can you just comment on the managed care contracting environment outside of the Vegas market is it pretty much status quo or are you seeing any change in behavior?", "Steve Filton", "No. I mean, I think Bill that generally managed care sort of contracted pricing has been pretty strong remained in that sort of 6% to 8% range of increase probably less of a concerned in contracted pricing because I think -- we think we're doing pretty well there. We're certainly seeing in all markets, a continued focus and attempt by both payers and employers to move subscribers and employees to -- from more generous plans to less generous plans etcetera.", "And so, to some degree that can undercut what our contracted price increases are. But you know managed care pricing generally even with those trends are holding up pretty well and so no great changes other than like you said. I mean in the Vegas market and I think anyplace where we see payer consolidation that could threaten to disrupt sort of what is happening in the normal course. But we don't see that happening in too many markets.", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. That's helpful. And then the other question is just -- you mentioned a couple of times your own stock maybe being your best use of capital right now. And I guess would you guys pretty much executing on all fronts and I might make the argument that stock is not really reflecting that. Would you consider a more aggressive repurchase? I mean you still have a lot authorized, but would you consider doing something at a bigger pace or levering up a little to buy more stock?", "Steve Filton", "I think honestly answer to that Bill that we always are considering sort of all of our alternatives and one of the things that we should have talked about with the share repurchase in the fourth quarter and the first quarter -- fourth quarter of '07 and the first quarter of '08 was that we would should of complete that what we had planned. And then we kind of sit back and take a breather and look at where we were and what our opportunities were and make some judgment at that point.", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we've Gary Lieberman.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Research", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess maybe just continue the last question on the share repurchases maybe ask you just in another way. In the past you've been or I guess relatively rapidly completed the authorizations that you've had. Is there anything that I guess is changed either from a stock price or from a leverage perspective that would make you less aggressive in terms of repurchasing the shares at this point than you were in the fourth quarter and so far in the first quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I'd make just a couple of comments, Gary. I mean, the last time that we were very aggressive in buying back shares in '04 and '05 when I think between the two years, we bought back something like $11 million shares. We were largely using proceeds from asset sales to do that the sale of our branch in Puerto Rico facility. So, there is no similar dynamic at the moment. So, my only point being, I think you can perhaps read too much into what happened back in '04 and '05.", "Other than that, I mean again, I think we try and evaluate and we'll evaluate our opportunities. I'll also say this. I mean if we were to borrow money at this point to do anything to do share repurchases or acquisitions, any material amount, we would see a pretty significant increase in our borrowing costs from where we are now because we remain at the moment in investment grade credit. But a whole lot more of leverage and we'd loose that rating and in this credit environment that would have a pretty significant effect on our borrowing costs. So, it's just another factor that we certainly have to think about as we decide how best to use our proceeds.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Research", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the AR securitization that you guys have done. Is there any impact at all on what you're carrying from a receivable perspective because of that and therefore would any of it actually impact the bad debt line on the income statement.", "Steve Filton", "No. I mean those receivables are not factored. They are not sold. They are simply used as securitization for the issuance of that commercial paper. So, it has no impact on sort of the underlying level of receivables or our accounting or anything else.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Research", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Steve Filton", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch.", "Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks. This is Shelley Gnall on for Matt Borsch this morning and just a couple of quick questions. Understanding there is variability quarter-to-quarter in the bad debt and did it come in better than our expectations. And I'm just wondering can you give us an update on your collections, are you seeing some traction there in your upfront cash collections or anything you're doing definitely on the bad debt?", "Steve Filton", "No. I mean, I think we're doing a lot of things, Shelley and have focused in the last few years on, as you suggest upfront collections and making sure that we do our best in terms of credit analysis upfront and that helps us direct our collection efforts appropriately in all those sort of things. But the reality is when we have a good quarter like we've had this quarter. I think it has more to do with an actual reduction in the number of uninsured patients than it does with improved collection rates et cetera.", "So, I think that cut both ways. In the quarter where we seen our bad debt or charity care rise it's because we've seen an increase in uninsured patients, and the quarter like the fourth quarter when we see cut down, I think it is primarily because of reduction in the number of uninsured patients.", "Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And then on the CapEx guidance it looks like it's implying an uptick from 2007 levels, can you talk a little bit about what's driving that largely at the construction cost?", "Steve Filton", "No. It's really a timing issue. For those of you recall we had originally said that we were going to spend upwards to $450 million of CapEx in 2007. And we spent considerably less than that, $110 million or so less than that. So, it's mostly a shift of committed dollars really from '07 into '08.", "Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And sir, you have no further questions at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. We would like to thank everybody for their time and we looks forward to speaking with you at the end of the first quarter.

My name is Bradley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter 2008 earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "", "Steve Filton", "Thank you. Good morning. I am Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning, and welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income per diluted share of $1.20 for the quarter.", "During this conference call Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors, and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. Revenues for the first quarter increased 8% over the prior year. Exclusive of the impact of new facilities, most notably Centennial Hills in Las Vegas and the revenues related to construction management contract, whereby we built a new hospital for an unrelated third-party. Revenues have increased by 7%. We anticipate that the second construction management contract will be finalized shortly.", "On a same facility basis in our Acute Care division, revenues increased 6.9% during the first quarter of 2008. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in revenue per adjusted admission. Adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year were up 1.5% for the quarter. These admissions were clearly supported by a busier than expected flu season. As we have previously indicated that we expected during the first quarter of 2008, newly constructed capacity at the physician-owned hospital in McAllen, Texas unfavorably impacted our admissions in that market. Additionally, the opening of the Centennial Hills Hospital in Las Vegas negatively impacted our same-store admissions comparisons to the extent that it cannibalized some of its volume from our existing facilities.", "Finally, we remind you that admissions in the first quarter of 2007 were particularly strong due to the termination of the Sierra/HCA contract in the Las Vegas market. On a same facility basis, revenue per adjusted admission rose 5.3% during the first quarter of 2008 for our acute hospitals. We defined operating margins as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages, and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expenses and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenues.", "On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 17.1% during the first quarter of 2008 from 15.1% during the first quarter of 2007. The margin improvement results from an increasing flu-related and commercial payor volumes, the opening of several new projects and capacity additions in Florida and California, and the reduction of registry malpractice expense and overall operating efficiencies.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates, amounting to $151 million and $124 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. As a percentage of net revenue, bad debt charity expense, and the uninsured discounts for the first quarter were consistent with those levels we experienced for full year 2007.", "On a same facility basis, revenues at our Behavioral Health division increased 9.2% during the first quarter of 2008. This increase resulted from admissions growth and an increase in revenue per adjusted admission. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 6.4% during the first quarter and revenue per adjusted admission rose 2.6% over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 23.7% during the quarter ended March 31, 2008, as compared to 22.7% during the comparable prior year period. Our cash flow from operating activities was approximately $132 million during the first quarter of 2008, as compared to $99 million in the first quarter of 2007. At March 31, 2008, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 41% and the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA was 1.95. We spent $82 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to our new 165-bed Centennial Hills Hospital in Las Vegas, that opened in January and a new 171-bed hospital in Palmdale, California, that is scheduled to be completed and opened in 2009.", "In California, we are also underway with a major expansion of Emergency Room Imaging and Women's Services to our Southwest Healthcare campuses in Riverside County, California. Our behavioral facilities have operated at a very efficient 77% available occupancy rate for the first quarter. We have multiple projects to add capacity to our busiest behavioral facilities. We opened a total of approximately a 140 new behavioral health beds during the first quarter and anticipate opening a total of 350 to 400 new beds in 2008.", "During the first quarter of 2008, we repurchased opportunities 1.8 million shares of our Class B common stock at an average price of approximately $50 per share. We currently have 3.8 million shares remaining under the previous authorized share repurchase program. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Christine Arnold of Morgan Stanley. Christine your line is open.", "", "Steve Filton", "Next.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Feinstein of Lehman Brothers.", "", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and I am actually here. So, great quarter looks phenomenal. Just a couple of questions here, Alan and Steve. Just may be if you could just talk a little bit about the operating leverage. I mean clearly a big benefit to margins from better pricing, Steve you mentioned better job of managing registry costs and malpractice. But clearly the operating leverage is very impressive here. Just wanted to get some more thoughts there, and was just curious if you can quantify just the improvement in our registry and I've a couple of follow up questions?", "", "Steve Filton", "Okay well, I mean again I think its does start with the same store revenues. Obviously we had same store revenue growth of 7% on the Acute side and 9% on the behavioral side Adam. And frankly I think with those kinds of same store revenue growths, we would anticipate that leverage is available\u2026 operating leverage is available to us, and I think our operators deserve a lot of credit in the first quarter for making that happen.", "We announced that adjustment to our malpractice reserves back in, I think, the second quarter of 2007 and said we'd have an ongoing benefit from that and clearly that has been the case. Our malpractice expense in the first quarter was $4 million or $5 million lower than it was in last year's first quarter. Our registry expense was about $3 million lower than it was in last year's first quarter, which is pretty I think impressive given the fact that I think other providers have decided sort of the unexpected severity, the flu season as a reason why their registry cost has increasing now.", "A good portion of that decline in fairness is due to the Las Vegas market, where we were experiencing some significant registry cost last year as a result of the kind of lingering result of the strike we had in December of '06, and we had some registry commitments that extended into the first quarter of '07. So there is a positive comparison there.", "But even in hospitals that didn't have great revenue performance like McAllen where we lost as we discussed on previous calls, significant amount of OB business. That facility did a good job of adjusting their cost downward, and as a result raising their margins even on lower revenues. And in facilities like Texoma which we acquired in the first quarter of '07, we've made some of the operating improvement that we anticipated making when we did the acquisition, and that's reflected in our expanded margins as well.", "So, again I think a lot of credit to the operators for doing a good job in the quarter and taking advantage of strong same store revenues in both of our segments.", "", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay and just a follow-up question here. May be talk a little bit about new hospital in Vegas, about the ramp up, just curious in terms of what the impact wise in other quarter. And may be if you could just let us -- may be it will be interesting just to compare and contrast the ramp up of Centennial Hills to Spring Valley?", "", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean - if those of you recall at our year-end call at the end of February, Alan was actually in Las Vegas and provided some commentary on Centennial Hills, which was rather bullish. Centennial got off to a strong start, our volumes have been better than we expected. It still was dilutive for the quarter as we would have expected it would be, probably contributed about $0.05 or $0.06 worth of dilution to the first quarter, although that's probably a couple of pennies better than we expected.", "I think as I said it got of to a strong start from a volume perspective, better than we expected. That was kind of our experience with Spring Valley as well. I would say probably the major difference and to some degree we anticipated this was the quality of the payor mix, and Centennial looks like it is better than when we got started at Spring Valley. And again, I think Alan talked about just really good demographics of the neighborhood surrounding Centennial, and so we are just extremely bullish on its outlook. It will be dilutive probably for another quarter or so, but the long-term prospects of Centennial in our mind are as good as any hospital we've opened in quite some time.", "", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And just one final question and I'll get back in the queue. Just on the side piece things weren't real, so at 9.2%, so that's too straight quarter of over 9% growth and you haven't seen that in a while. Just may be you can just provide any commentary there in terms of what's going, and you mentioned the benefit from new beds but certainly pretty impressive growth, just any thoughts in terms of anything going on there?", "", "Steve Filton", "You are right, and we obviously talked in our year-end call about the fourth quarter growth which was impressive and obviously it's continued into the first. And I think just as it was in the fourth quarter, it is relatively widespread throughout the portfolio. We are benefiting from the new beds where we've added, but we are benefiting frankly in markets where we don't necessarily have new capacity. In some of our large like Atlanta and in Chicago. We're definitely taking market share from competitors. In some places, I think we mentioned at the end of\u2026 at the end of the year call, we converted one of our facilities from residential to acute and have really increased our profitability at that facility. And again the strength is really throughout the portfolio which is credit to our operators.", "", "Alan Miller", "As Steve pointed out, the operators have really shown their capabilities certainly all alone. But in behavioral, we have been very disciplined. There have been a number of acquisition opportunities that we have passed because of pricing and because of our valuation of the market opportunity. So consequently, our portfolio is tight, the facilities are needed and I think our operators and our development people in that area have really been exceptional.", "", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you very much. Great quarter.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Weakley of Credit Suisse.", "", "Kenneth Weakley - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Steve, I was curious on the flu if you had the sense of whether it was dilutive to the margins. Your achieved margins are actually pretty good rationally this quarter. But I was just curious, would they have been without flu, if that's something you can actually tell us?", "", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. It's a good question Ken. And to be honest, I think we have always been a company that has not necessarily stressed the impact of the flu, but this clearly was one of the more severe flu seasons in a number of years, particularly in some of our markets. We calculate based on the incremental increase sort of respiratory discharges that there was probably a $0.05 or $0.06 benefit in the quarter from the flu. But again I am going to go back and give the operators credit because the flu by its nature is not sort of a high margin, high revenue business and the way you make it work is you have to control your length of stay, good throughput, control your expenses. And I think our operators did all that. And that's what sort of turns the incremental volumes into a $0.05 or $0.06 benefit. So, that's not a given when you have that flu volume that you are going to do well with it, but we did in the first quarter.", "", "Kenneth Weakley - Credit Suisse", "Okay. I guess question number two, I guess for Alan. There has been huge heard General Electrical couple of weeks ago talking about the\u2026 it sounds like the CapEx spending of not-for-profits [ph] is coming under some pressure for a lot of good reasons. And I was just curious if you had a sense as to whether that was developing in your market in particular and most probably then just not might be allowing for as you go forward into next year or two?", "", "Alan Miller", "We haven't really calculated it. I am not aware of any of things like that in our market but it will work to our advantage.", "", "Kenneth Weakley - Credit Suisse", "Okay. All right. And then lastly, on Medicaid as we get into the\u2026 going into the second quarter, we'll have a lot of the stage coming up, any comments from either of you on Medicaid risk in Texas disproportionate share payments?", "", "Alan Miller", "We have not seen any proposals to reduce disproportionate share payments. I think Medicaid in many states is kind of on the table as budget item. We said a couple of months ago and I think it's still true that right now with the proposals that have essentially been implemented or been committed to in Florida, in California which will have later in the year, I think that our Medicaid pricing that's embedded in our guidances which is only about zero to 1% increase blended for the year is still good. Obviously if some of the states that are considering it to make more draconian cuts to Medicaid, it could be challenging to us. But that's something we'll have to continue to watch, as it moves along. And obviously, I think it's very dependent on exactly how severe or precisely how severe the economy or the weakening in the economy gets. If I think it extends only for another quarter or two, the states probably I think handle it. If not, there are certainly going to look at their own budgets and their own spending.", "", "Kenneth Weakley - Credit Suisse", "Okay. All right. Good enough. Thanks so much.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Gallucci of Merrill Lynch.", "", "Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. The leverage obviously was tremendous down to the bottom line. So I am a little bit curious to try and dive a little deeper into the volume side if I could Steve. You are 0.8% on same-store growth, but Centennial has cannibalized some business I guess on same store, did that another 50 or 100 basis points if you were sort of to try normalize for that?", "", "Steve Filton", "I mean our guesstimate of that is that about a third of Centennial's admissions came from our existing facilities. And so if you added that back to our same-store volumes, it would add probably about 70 or 80 basis points of admissions back. We get to about 1.5 or so, 1.6 from 0.8. The other thing that we talked about at the end of the year and the dynamic is the same is that we are down quite a bit in the McAllen market in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year in OB volumes because the competitor\u2026 physician-owned competitor hospital opened an OB service. That is not very profitable business to us. So if you add those admissions back, if you add McAllen back and you add a third of Centennial's admissions back, you probably get to about a 3% same-store acute admission growth for the quarter and we attribute about half of that increase to the flu. So that's I think the biggest moving pieces of admissions for the quarter.", "", "Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "And then of course I think you mentioned earlier, you had a pretty tough comp given sort of some other dynamics a year ago in Las Vegas. So a very strong volume now. What was there, what about was in the payor mix sort of. Was there - Medicaid I think might have been down you said with COB [ph], the last OB volume in McAllen? What about in Medicare and managed care, but it was skewed towards managed care?", "", "Steve Filton", "Yeah I think that the other sort of significant trend in the quarter beyond flu on the the Acute side was, we saw a pretty sizable increase in managed care volumes. Some of that is flu related, but clearly a portion of it is not. And we can go sort of market-by-market and identify some new contracts that we have or specific market where we know, we are taking managed care market share from a competitor.", "But in general, I would say that our managed care volumes were up probably close to 6% for the quarter, and I think may be 3% of it is clearly attributable to flu or specific contract, but half of it is just general strength in managed care volumes. And obviously I think it's the provider side of what many of the managed care companies have been reporting over the last few weeks, we certainly had been experiencing that trend and obviously that as helped pricing.", "So in a quarter in which we have seen, compared to last year, a fairly significant increase on insured charity care etcetera, although it was comparable to the full year of last year it was quite a bit over last year. So to have that number quite a bit over last year and still have 5.3% pricing increases in Acute care, I think it reflects the overall strength in that managed care volume.", "Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Right. So it's still not your best payor mix, your best payor grow the fastest. And what about the sustainability, was it spread across market fairly evenly or is it really concentrated, let's say in Vegas?", "", "Steve Filton", "No. I think it was spread. We had a good quarter in Vegas, there is no doubt. Obviously as point out, there is a tough comparison, but if you look at our minority interest line, you can tell that the greatest portion of that relates to Vegas and you can see that it's up and we had a strong quarter in Vegas, but with every strength throughout the portfolio as well in the number of other markets. So that managed care dynamic especially we felt in a number of our large numbers, and frankly even in some of our small markets.", "Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "And I guess just last one. Absolute pricing for managed care is pretty steady or is that gotten better or worse?", "", "Steve Filton", "No, I think it's been pretty steady from our perspective. I mean again to me the story of the quarter is managed care volume, 6% is sort of the best that we have seen in some time. Managed care pricing I think is still on that 6% to 7% range, which has been pretty consistent for a couple of years now.", "Thomas Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erik Chiprich of BMO Capital Markets.", "", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Nice job on the quarter. Wondering though in regards to McAllen, I know you talked about some of the challenges there. Is the profitability up year-over-year in that facility with lost volume? And then I know you guys have been pretty patient in that market, just curious if you can give us an update on what  your strategy is going forward there?", "", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean the profitability of the McAllen market is definitely better than it was in the first quarter of last year, and I think there's a couple of factors to that. One is our uninsured expense is lower. We made some changes frankly in our uninsured accounting in the McAllen market specifically last year's first quarter. I don't think it much affected our consolidated results, but it was specific to the McAllen market, and so the comparison to this year looks like a favorable one.", "But as I said earlier in response to a question, even with significantly reduced volumes in that market, the operators in that market have reduced their expenses in such a way that our margins have actually risen and so we are doing better in that market, although in fairness a good portion of that was built into our own expectation and our own guidance. So McAllen is well ahead of last year, a little bit ahead of our own internal result.", "", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Got you. And then can you give us an update for the contract renegotiations with Sierra in United and Las Vegas and what then anything you are hearing on HCA getting back in the contract?", "", "Steve Filton", "To the best of our knowledge HCA is not back in the contract and/or back into the Sierra network. And from what we hear from both Sierra and HCA, there is no imminent plans to have them back in the network. We have signed a three year renewal with Sierra that will extend, will take effect that I think in May and extend out for the next three year. So we feel like we've just gone a long way to cement what is a very good market position from our perspective and a very strong relationship with the biggest payor in the Las Vegas market.", "And that is basically based on the legacy Sierra business, and I think specifically provides for the fact that it does not apply to the legacy United business. So at some point when the United contract is up, which is not for some time, that contract will either separately be renegotiated or United will try and fold it's subscribers into other products and it's other products in the market.", "", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "And what type of increases did you see on the three year renewal?", "", "Steve Filton", "I think as is historically being the case, they are a little bit lower than the average increases that we mentioned or I just mentioned in response to Tom's question of 6% or 7% just a little bit lower than that, but in our mind well worth it for the significant business that we get from again what is the largest payor in that market.", "", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks very much for the update.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mathew Borsch of Goldman Sachs", "", "Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs", "Hi thanks for taking our question this is Shelley Gnall in for Matt Borsch. I guess our first question is on the bad debt, looks like it was up sequentially into the quarter. I was relating [ph] to the comment, are you seeing any, could that be related to job loss or I guess specifically insured job loss in any of your market.", "", "Steve Filton", "Shelley what I said before, I said in my prepared remarks as well was that the total of bad debt and Charity care and uninsured discount and I think you need to look it all three together, is running at about the same percentage as it ran for full year 2007. Frankly that's well within our expectations, we actually expected that number to tick up a little bit in 2008 and so far it hasn't and we are obviously grateful for that.", "In all honesty while the economic news coming out of many of our markets including Las Vegas is not great, we have not felt a pinch in too many of our markets. Other than in Florida which we mentioned in our year-end call, and particularly on the East Coast of Florida. And it's not something that we are feeling as yet in our markets. We certainly are watching it very carefully and its possible that I think if the economy continues to weaken, we will, but so far our fingers our crossed, we are not getting pinched a whole lot.", "", "Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. And then I guess a related question. In surgical does the (inaudible) expense looks like it was little bit better. Clearly there's a lot of flu in the market, but can you talk a little about the demand in the utilization you are seeing in surgeries.", "", "Steve Filton", "Our surgeries were relatively flat for the quarter. Yeah as you point out because of the emphasis on flu, which is not a supply intensive diagnosis that will drive it down a little bit. I think the other the only others sort of notable dynamics is that in the Las Vegas market, we saw a decline in some of our very highly intensive supply type surgeries, spine surgeries etcetera. And frankly at the end of the day I think that probably wasn't a bad thing for us because of the cost of those procedures I don't know that we make much of margins so their essence really didn't hurt us and certainly make margins probably look a little better.", "", "Shelley Gnall - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Gurda of Bear Stearns.", "", "Jason Gurda - Bear Stearns", "Good morning. Steve, I think you had said that your case mix was up. Do you have a sort of indication of what type of - since your surgery volume were flattish, what was sort of procedure are driving the increase in the case mix?", "", "Steve Filton", "We did have a small, I would say, may be 2.5%, 3% increase in our case mix which is pretty strong especially given the fact that we did have so many more flu cases. As we look at cost that diagnosis group there is no other sort of diagnosis group that tends to dominate that. And again I would sort of tie it back to increase in managed care utilization. Those managed care patients tend to be younger patients who are in the hospital for some sort of procedure as oppose to Medicare patients who are more weighted toward medical cases where they are in four, in many cases longer length of stay etcetera and not necessarily severe illnesses. So I think it's tied to the kind of slant towards more managed care business in the quarter.", "", "Jason Gurda - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And if I could -- Alan if I could ask a couple of questions just related to your experience in the industry. Your thoughts on how a recession would impact volumes or if you have thoughts on how it would impact volumes in the past and also nursing cost?", "Alan Miller", "Interestingly the beginnings of our recession or slowdown, people tend to use hospitalization more because they had coverage. And coverage extends for 18 months and cover [ph]. So usually this industry does a little better when the economy slows down. Obviously if it continues for a long period of time, you are not going to be able absorb it, but in the shorter run you do pretty well. And obviously we haven't seen anything there. There was an earlier question on that.", "With regard to nursing, I don't see any differences other than perhaps people move from an industry that is laying off workers and you get some people who go into the nursing field. The best I could do on that.", "", "Jason Gurda - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks, good morning everyone. I do have a follow-up question regarding the Sierra renewal. Steve just two things there; first, were you able to secure annual inflators in the contract or is there just a one time increase that you've negotiated?", "", "Steve Filton", "No Darren. We will get an increase kind of as I described Mr. Eric just little bit less than our average in each of the three years of the contract.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then were there any bells and whistles in the contract relating to quality or you are doing anything along those lines which we have pay for performance?", "", "Steve Filton", "No in all honestly other than the increase rates, I think the contract looks very much like our last contract, and there were no major changes.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough. And then Centennial Hills, you've spoken about the impact in and I guess we can go back and figure out where you might be senses wise. But can you just give us a sense for where you thought you would be by the end of the year in Centennial Hills with senses and where that squares with, the first quarter just to put your comments about it being a little bit better than expected in the context.", "", "Steve Filton", "Sure I mean, I think and to be honest I don't remember sort of with in our guidance where we pegged Centennial for later in the year. But for the first quarter we sort of thought Centennial would open in its first quarter and kind of a 34-40 ADC range and they have been more in a 55 -60 ADC range. And I think just as important as I mentioned before, the quality of the payor mix is probably little bit better than we anticipate. Although we anticipated frankly it would be a little bit better than Spring Valleys experienced, but I think its been even lower better than we expected.", "I don't want to read too much into a couple of months worth of results, but again I mean we just love where Centennial is positioned in the market, we just think that its cannibalized less business than Spring Valley did when it opened and so the trends it is very encouraging, we feel better after more quarters and we feel better if we get to where we thought we'd be at the end of the year which is EBITDA positive, and we think we will get there. But we feel more confidence certainly at that point.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "And your MOB is at least up to this point?", "", "Steve Filton", "It is up and a good portion of space is committed to it.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, just a few other things here. CapEx you didn't comment at all about any change in your guidance. I think you were a little over $400 million projected. Is that still a safe range?", "", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, I mean, obviously our guidance for the year is 400 to 425 of CapEx. We spend about little over 80 in the first quarter, so we are at somewhat slower rate than we projected. You can peg that to a couple of big projects. We got a little bit slower in Californian Palmdale then was our schedule. The pace is picking up and Texoma will get started in earnest with real construction spending in the back half after this year, it's clearly back half weighted. So, I think right now we still think we probably get to that number, we certainly are not going to exceed it but we are going to leave that guidance out there the way it stands, because we think the pace of our capital spending is going to pick up.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And Alan I know you responded to Ken's question, but I guess I will ask in a different way about CapEx. Is it fair to say that you and may be others industry are pushing out a little bit with regard to projects? It seems like that the budgeted spending is there, but the point of CapEx is gone a little bit slower, is that a fair observation Alan?", "Alan Miller", "It's gone slower, but it's not anything that we did by design. It's just a question of timing as the projects move along. So Steve pointed out, we are going to probably spend what we had announced earlier. It's just a timing question.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Fair enough. And then on Steve you had a couple of closures in behavioral, what was that?", "", "Steve Filton", "We closed two very small facilities in the Behavioral division in the first quarter at a total of I think 28 license beds, and I think which is the function of sort of a niche programs that when they were not sort of meeting their demand, there was no point in keeping them operating. So they look to be significant in the number of facilities, but in terms of the actual capacity it's pretty immaterial.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and that's fair. And then last thing here. Are there any major systems or IT initiatives we should be aware of for the next two to three years at UHS?", "", "Steve Filton", "No I think information technology like any of our capital investments it's something we are evaluating all the time and trying to make sure that we are competitive etcetera. So I wouldn't say that it's not possible that we wouldn't have a significant investment in IT clinicals or something down the road, but at the moment there is no such commitment. But the process is kind of a continuing one that's underway all the time.", "", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks nice job.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justine Lake of UBS.", "", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Thanks. Good morning. Just looking at a bead of this size and just would love to spend a minute going through some of the pieces. I mean I know you've identified flu is $0.05 of the bead. I'm just curious if you can walk us through; versus your plan I think you said that the bead was $0.25 better than your plan. Can you tell us how much of that came from the different components, whether I guess like kind of look at the business and say how much came from Vegas, from Syke [ph] and then just from better operating expenses and then maybe the rest of the acute is?", "", "Steve Filton", "Sure I mean I think Justine some of this is not absolute precise science, because some of these issues overlap. We would say, I think I answered Ken weekly before that the flu contributed probably $0.05 or $0.06 bead. I think that the performance, the overall performance of the Vegas market contributed probably a similar amount. We probably got $0.04 or $0.05 from the rest of the Acute division and $0.04 or $0.05 from the Behavioral division, $0.03 or $0.04 just from interest expense being less then we expected. And those are probably the major components of it.", "", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Got it. I mean it looked like there was a lot on the margins and I know you talked about lower nursing cost. Any other may be malpractice or anything else that you saw in the quarter that might not be sustainable? Or might have been kind of may be more one-time in nature other than the flu.", "", "Steve Filton", "I think that the other the piece that, we our challenged in explaining and predicting at sustainability is this, the nature of the increase in managed care utilization. And just as I know you know as well as anybody that managed care companies have struggled mightily in the last few weeks to explain that and there doesn't seem to be one single cohesive explanation. We obviously as a provider are benefiting from that, and so we are not as pleasured to explain it as they are, but it's hard to know how sustainable that is.", "And as you know, I mean obviously the managed care companies are certainly going to alter their behaviors I assume over the next ensuing quarters to try and get their spending under control. Now a lot of our contractual pricing is fixed for a extended period of time, but certainly from a utilization perspective and those sort of issues, I assume the managed care industry is going become more aggressive and so the that's a little bit hard to predict.", "Obviously, I think the behavioral results you been sustained already for a while, I don't know we can stay at that 9% revenue growth rate but got to be able to keep some where in that neighborhood. And you know interest expense is hard to predict, but obviously it helps that we are generating more cash and spending less of it for CapEx, so we'll certainly have that benefit going forward.", "", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Got it. To the extent that you have visibility, can you give us update on how April's running versus the first three months of the year?", "", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, I mean the only problem was sort of giving that intra month call is, that it's almost purely based on volumes and volumes in April looked strong in both size of the business in both segments. Obviously, it's hard to get a meaningful read on payor mix or some of the other issues or quality of the payors. But volumes themselves were pretty good in April.", "", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on CapEx and not in a short term but just taking longer term. I look at your CapEx for '08 and '09 and there is a fair amount of new construction going on there in the Acute base. And correct me if I am wrong, but I kind of targeted around may be $200 million a year of just purely new construction.", "", "Steve Filton", "I would say between 150 and 200 has been the number in '06,'07,'08.", "", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Okay. You've got that spending for '09. Is there any spending that you've got, that's kind of\u2026 is there any plans for 2010 or I think we've spoken offline about the fact that you might be reevaluating the level of CapEx you put into the Acute business especially outside Vegas given the performance. Anything there or do you still expect to become materially more cash flow positive from a free cash flow standpoint in 2010?", "", "Steve Filton", "No, I think your first point is the relevant one, and we've talked of quite a bit publicly about the fact that these three new hospital projects being Centennial, Palmdale and Texoma are probably a total of a little over $500 million of capital spending over essentially a three year period. That certainly affects the look at the capital numbers. Once Texoma is finished in early 2010, we at the moment don't have any other commitment of that magnitude on the table and our expectation is short of that or our capital spending will progressively decline as we get there.", "", "Justine Lake - UBS", "That's great. Thank you very much.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Frank Morgan of Jefferies & Co.", "", "Frank Morgan - Jefferies & Co", "Good morning. Two questions, Steve you mentioned about taking market share, it's a great think but do you have any good theories on why you are able to take market share. I think you mentioned it particularly on the table [ph] side mentioning Atlanta and Chicago. Any more color that you can give us on that. And then secondly on the MedMail side were there any releases of MedMail from prior periods, and kind of what's the current run-rate on that. Thanks.", "", "Steve Filton", "No I mean there were no prior period impacts. Again I think we took back some reserves back in the second quarter of '07, which were well highlighted in that press release and we didn't count it in our sort of income from continuing operations that we disclosed, but in the quarter absolutely not. As far as the market share goes, I mean I think it's a function of having a preeminent market position in the markets that I cited, Atlanta etcetera. And I think that it's just easier to operate from a position of strength. And I think in some of our markets, some of our competitors have had some quality issues and that obviously provides an opportunity for us unfortunately for them to step up and where we have a strong reputation to go to referral sources and take market share. And again I think that's happened in a few markets. So much credit again goes to the operators. There's just not enough credit I think that can go the operators this quarter. This is a quarter in which they've really shown.", "", "Frank Morgan - Jefferies & Co", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Englander of Standard & Poor's.", "", "Jeffrey Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Good morning guys. Steve just back with me if you can on the other operatives, since I believe last quarter we had the same discussion in terms of them coming a little better than expected, and I know you in your earlier question didn't see anything specific there. But given this is two quarters in a row, and another competitor had a similar experience, is there anything you can put your on trends wise that may be happening there?", "", "Steve Filton", "Well let me say couple of things Jeff. One it's just kind of a mechanical thing that I know at least some analyst have in their model. We've had over the last probably four or five quarters about $20 million a quarter in other operating expense on average related to this construction management contract. And if that's what people had modeled in, in the first quarter, we only round off with about $5 million, which is just really a timing issue. But probably there is about $15 million of, I would say $10 million to $15 million in our own internal modeling and I think in what a lot of other people had related to this construction management contract that destroys that a little bit. By the way they probably\u2026 If you have that, you probably have that in other revenue as well.", "Other than that, again we touched on these things; malpractice expense is down, registry is down, we are getting some benefits from the integration of Texoma which has now been in the portfolio for five quarters, we are getting some benefit in the Laredo market from a transaction in which we combine a surgery center that we were joint ventured in, in the market with our hospital and consolidated the two physical entities and that produces some economies.", "And then as I just said, I mean, I think when you have 7% same-store revenue growth in Acute, and 9% in Behavioral and two businesses that are largely fixed cost businesses there is operating leverage available. And it's incumbent upon the operators to execute their plan in the first quarter. And frankly in the fourth quarter last year they did so.", "", "Jeffrey Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "So, the other question would be. Can you talk a little bit about may be the economy between what's happening in the economies particularly in Las Vegas? And what you are seeing in your operations and any thoughts on why you might be seeing that?", "", "Steve Filton", "Well, the one thing that I would say is that most of the economic news, let's start by saying that. Historically, I think the economic metric that has most affected hospitals is unemployment rates and as people lose their jobs, as Alan indicated with a lag that creates a problem for us because they lose their health insurance; eventually, they loose their health insurance associated with their job. But actually as you know, I mean unemployment rates have not gone up terribly dramatically. There has been lots of talk about foreclosure rates and housing starts and all the signals of the economy is weakening but in most of our markets, that hasn't translated yet to a measurable increase in unemployment rates, and I think that may well be why we are not feeling a pinch yet. I don't know whether it will ultimately translate and if does, as Alan said, we may not feel that for at least a couple of quarters, but I think that's probably why when you pick up the newspaper and read some pretty grim stories, that's why it's not translating directly to our business just yet in most our markets.", "", "Jeffrey Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "Great. Thanks very much.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Bonello of Wachovia.", "", "Alan Miller", "We are not a discretionary business, I mean to a large extent.", "", "Operator", "Bill, still your line is open.", "", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia", "Can you guys hear me?", "", "Steve Filton", "I can hear you, Bill.", "", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia", "Okay. Steve, you talked about the April trends and that the volume is pretty strong, and but be careful to read too much into that and it's hard to tell on the payor mix. So, just to be perfectly clear, can you not tell yet whether that exceptionally strong managed care volume growth has continued in April. You don't know where the volume is coming from?", "", "Steve Filton", "It's a little bit hard to get that sort of clarity of the data kind of on an intra-month basis, I mean, again Bill it seems that a lot of those trends are continuing to April but it's very difficult to say that with definitiveness.", "", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia", "Okay. And then totally separate subject and maybe a question more for Alan. But it seems like at least that what we were hearing out there was maybe at one point in time earlier in the year, you guys were pretty actively at least considering some of the acquisition opportunities that were out there. And I am just curious what your thoughts are on acquisitions these days? What the marketplace is like? Is that something you would bite off if the right opportunity came along et cetera?", "", "Alan Miller", "Yes, we would. We have consistently said that our acquisition activity relates to the opportunities. And we are in a good position. We have available capital and if we see a good opportunity we are very actively looking. But, as I said earlier, we also have a disciplined approach to it. There have been a number of opportunities coming by in the behavioral end, and we have passed on them because of price or because of what we felt the future growth of those facilities might be. But we are very actively out there, and we would be happy to make acquisitions and are capable of doing so.", "", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia", "And just in terms of the competitive environment or the type of opportunities you are seeing in both Behavioral and Acute, is anything changing there? Is there, maybe less competition that multiples might start to come down or starting to see any sort of better looking properties coming up for sale?", "", "Alan Miller", "Frankly, in the acute end of it, I think it's fair to say surprised that there haven't been more acquisition opportunities, and there just haven't been. We expected competitors to be selling more facilities and the good ones, and we haven't seen that. But we are continually looking and we are in the market. In the behavioral end, I think it's about the same, maybe pricing has moderated a little bit as our competitors are realizing that if you pay up, you don't get as good return or you don't get the return you should be getting. But we are patient and we are particular.", "", "Bill Bonello - Wachovia", "Okay. Thanks a million.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ransom of Raymond James & As.", "", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Hi, good morning. Just looking at some individual states, are you hearing anything about Dish programs? I know, Texas is off cycle. But is there anything going on with discussion about disproportionate share program in the state, fiscal year back half of calendar '08?", "", "Steve Filton", "John, I mean, obviously as you point out, Texas is the state where we get the lion share of our disproportionate Medicaid [ph] portion of share payments. And we've really not heard anything about their state fiscal year or our disproportionate share payment is locked in now and through August of this year, and then their fiscal year begins in September of '08. And I think that they haven't even to the best of our knowledge sort of put that on the agenda yet. So, the one thing that I always sort of point out to people is that because the lion share of disproportionate share of monies go to public hospitals and hospitals that treat a large share of indigent patients et cetera. It's a politically sensitive area and so there is a fair amount of political cover that goes along with it. And I don't know that the state is out to protect UHS but I think they are generally \u2026 there are a lot of underlying constituencies that are out to protect the hospitals that receive disproportionate share of funds. So, we have been getting disproportionate share for many, many years and it changes year-to-year and there is some tweaks in the system but it's never been dramatically cut back and we don't have the expectation that it will be dramatically cut back this year.", "", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. Great. And my other question, I mean, just make sure this is clear in all the noise. The biggest change with respect to your expectations this quarter was the commercial volumes is that correct? Plus the cost controls?", "", "Steve Filton", "I would say the impact of the flu season and the commercial volumes are two of those issues.", "", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. Now, that the flu season has receded, are you still saying similar commercial volume trends, so far this quarter because the only thing your guidance up $0.05 or so this quarter. Is there anything you've seen so far this quarter that suggest that was just a blip?", "", "Steve Filton", "And that's \u2026 I know Bill Bonello asked the question, I think in a slightly different way. I think it's hard to say John, I mean, we can say that our volumes overall look relatively strong in the first \u2026 in April. But we don't have enough sort of deep-dive information to know the real payor mix the way that slices from a payor mix perspective just yet.", "", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay. Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Bachman of Longbow Research.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Hey, good morning and nice quarter guys. I think most of my questions have been answered here. But just back to interest expense, that was a little bit better. What should we be looking at through the rest of the year, just generally on that?", "", "Steve Filton", "I mean, obviously, I think that the run-rate for interest expense, I mean, I am not about to predict what direction rates go. I'll leave that to people who are smarter than me but from our own internal perspective, our borrowings will increase to the extent that our capital spending raise pick-up if in fact they do obviously the flip side of that is we generated a lot more cash in the quarter than we expected. So, I think that we probably will have a little bit of a favorable variance going forward on interest rates, is what we would expect and frankly bake that into our revised guidance for the year.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay. So, your guidance reflects at least directionally something positive there.", "", "Steve Filton", "I think that's right.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay. And then you've got to nitpick here to look for anything negative. On the behavioral side, obviously, strong volumes pretty happy with where the pricing came in or is there, is that looks like it might have been slightly less than we thought it might be?", "", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I think we've said for the last few quarters that Behavioral pricing is on a low-end of the range of our expectation, but you are right I mean it's a little bit of nip. And also I would say this, I think that the two dynamics go together. When you got 8% same store admission growth, it gives you little bit leeway about picking patients etcetera. And you are trying to get patients in and out and just meet your demand, and I don't know that you can be quite as selective as you would otherwise be, so think the tow go together. It's tough to have great pricing when you've got such strong admission growth.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Sure. Okay that makes sense. And then you've given a lot of credit to your operators for last and this quarter and performing to play in. On the cost side, what's the key metrics that they have to meet? Is it really staffing or is that biggest thing under their control?", "", "Steve Filton", "Well staffing is our probably biggest variable cause. But I think again the issue is, what I tried to stress is that, when you have 7% same store growth of Acute, 9% same store revenue growth in Behavioral. It provides an opportunity for leverage, but what the operators have to do is control their staffing and make sure that their semi-fixed and fixed cost remains fixed and that their cost don't slide, and that's, that's a battle every single day. They've got a very complicated job, and again, I think in the last couple of quarters they performed exceptionally well.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay, and then just one last follow up on that. It seems to me that in a weakening economy, it may be a little easier to squeeze, coverage - those coverage out of your existing staff that you would have otherwise people's willingness to a pick up extra hours or extra shift. I mean is that a safe assumption?", "", "Steve Filton", "No I think it's fair, and I think it was Jason Gurda who asked kind of similar question before. If you look back on at the last time that registry expense peaked, was sort of in the summer of 2001 and it's starting to go down after that and not coincidently that was in the middle of last recession that we went through. So, I think it is true and Alan kind of alluded to it before, when we are in a recession nurses some of them return to work or take more hours if their spouses are laid off or whatever the issue is. But it's easier to deal with it. So, I think actually, that aspect of our business may get a little easier in an economically depressed time period. There may be other aspect of the business that are more of a challenge, but I think the labor side may provide a few opportunity for us.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "And obviously there wasn't a flu running rapid among your staff which cut the lot of mischief as well.", "", "Steve Filton", "And again here is another place we give the operator credit. We had a severe flu season that surprised most people; and its easy to have the registry expense go up in an environment like that. And as I said our registry expense was actually down considerably for the quarter. So, just a good job by those who staff arsenals [ph].", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "I am going to try to squeeze in one other quick question here. On the CMS recovery audits, do you guys have any comments on that or looking any thoughts on how to handle that when that gets rolled out and I guess January '09 now?", "", "Steve Filton", "No. And look this is just revenue enhancement, revenue raiser for the government. They are going to try and raise as much money as they can, and if they can't do it by lowering Medicare rates, they'll do it by trying to recover previously made payments and we just have to make sure that all our eyes are dotted and T's are crossed and that the government isn't doing anything or trying to recover money in violation of their own rules. So it's kind of a hassle for us, but we just paid closer attention to what we are doing in those areas that they are auditing.", "", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. Nice quarter again. Thanks.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo of Stephens.", "", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "Thanks guys for squeezing me in at the last minute, I'll make it quick. Steven the 300 to 350 to 400 beds that you are adding this year in your Behavioral division, does that include the 140 that you added this quarter.", "", "Steve Filton", "Yes.", "", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "Okay. And of all those beds that you are adding this year, are all of those additional beds you are adding to current facilities or some of those or are any of those De novo projects.", "", "Steve Filton", "No I don't think we have De novo projects on the current facility.", "", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "Okay. And can you comment just quickly about how maybe the Easter shift impacted your business at all. I mean over 9% same store is really strong, but just any adverse impact there.", "", "Steve Filton", "No. We saw maybe a little softness right in the couple of days before Easter and right after Easter, but I would say it didn't have a meaningful impact on the quarter.", "", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "Okay. And one other quick question, you talked earlier about the construction project. Can you give us an update on when that trails off, how much contributed in the quarter, and do you guys expect any other contract at some point?", "", "Steve Filton", "We probably had about a $1 million of EBITDA related to that project in the first quarter. Probably as we close, that facility is now open and so we are just sort of closing out the accounting and final billing for and there's probably maybe another $1 million of trailing EBITDA next quarter perhaps.", "As we talked about in our year-end call, we have a second contract that we - and I mentioned in my opening remarks that we feel likely to finalize. There's probably given the timing out $3 million or $4 million of potential EBITDA to be had in the back half of '08 related to that contract, but in fairness we'd already included that in our even our original guidance and obviously in our revise guidance as well.", "", "Whit Mayo - Stephens", "Okay that's it. Thanks guys, good job.", "", "Steve Filton", "Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andreas Dirnagl of JPMorgan", "", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Good morning guys. At this point most of my questions have been answered, so just a couple of subtleties may be. Alan when you were talking about the acquisition environment on the both sides of the business. I guess, I would characterize it as sort of may be a little bit of head scratching, that there isn't enough or there aren't a lot of assets for sale. On the Acute side and on the Behavioral side its more pricing oriented. On that point are you finding that you're sitting at the table with people who are outbidding you, or are you finding that sort of seller expectation have gone up.", "", "Steve Filton", "Andreas let me take a shot at that. Interestingly I think as Alan said, on the Acute side, we're just not seeing very many opportunities. I mean the reality is, I think most of the deals that have been done recently have been other for-profit sellers, selling to for-profit sellers. And generally, I won't say you make a blank statement, but generally those are properties that are not necessarily of great interest to us.", "On the Behavioral side, I think that, there has been over a number of years, a lack of sort of interest in that business and then over the last three or four there has been kind of renewed interest and so I think there is sort of a backlog of demand for those properties, and therefore we haven't seen and obviously that's the business that hasn't faced some of the headwinds that the Acute businesses has faced.", "I think we still see that the multiples in that business can be pretty high, and again as Alan indicated we take a look at most just about every opportunities that's out there. And if the bidding gets to a point where we think it just doesn't make sense anymore, we are okay, we are dropping out. But again I think on the Behavioral side it's more of a pricing issue, on the Acute side I think it's just the availability of properties themselves.", "", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then may be trying to yet again sort of slice and dice this whole managed care increase that you've seen in terms of volume. I guess the concern that's running through a lot of the question, let me state it out right is. Is this sustainable or not or are we seeing an acceleration of elective procedure sort of prior to sort of recessionary or an economic downturn. And may be the question I have is, how do you think your operators are preparing for that, because clearly you staff differently depending on what you think it is?", "", "Steve Filton", "Well, yeah. And by the way I mean Andreas I appreciate you are being upfront about it, but we are certainly not trying to hide the notion that some of this increase may not be sustainable\u2026.", "", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Absolutely.", "", "Steve Filton", "I think our guidance is realistic in terms of not, our not taking stand that is absolutely is sustainable. I don't know, I mean like I said before, the managed care companies who frankly I think probably should have a better handle on this than the provider themselves, I think have been struggling with why some of these utilization data points have increased pretty dramatically pretty quickly. And I am not sure that I have any great explanations beyond what has sort of offered out there already.", "So, all I can say about how we are handling this is our operators are certainly not behaving as if this is volume and this is payor mix that's going to continue indefinitely, and we are not staffing up or ramping up for a wholly different business model or anything like that. And again I think we are in a position to react relatively, flexibly to whichever way this goes. If the business is sustainable, I think, we are prepared to deal with that and if it's not, I think, we are prepared for that as well.", "", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Okay Great. And then you have been very upfront about the uncertainty surrounding this. But sort of just one more quick one maybe just to confirm I mean, you are really seeing no specific trend on that sort of extra managed care volume in terms of, I mean, is there any ability to sort of characterize it as more elective in nature versus acute or there is a lot of orthopedic in there, which has a lot of elective procedures in it; anything along those lines?", "", "Steve Filton", "No, again. I think some of is flu related. That sort of fits if it's into what, obviously, others have reported but we saw an uptick in our patient surgeries in our managed care business and in some other diagnoses, so I don't know that there is a kind of a single comprehensive explanation to point to.", "", "Andreas Dirnagl - JPMorgan", "Okay, great, Steve. Thank you.", "", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Christine Arnold of Morgan Stanley.", "", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for fitting me and sorry I was sort of delayed coming back from presentation. It seems like the real issue here just to probe on the commercial volumes is whether or not sustainable, which is what everyone is asking about. So, what's really astounding is that the volume was so good in the first quarter, which is when deductibles generally reset and meet volume kind of seasonally for the managed care companies. And managed care companies aren't admitting to an increase in volume. They are saying that the pricing perhaps just are getting better. So, couple of questions here. Give a sense for how many \u2026 as you look at your employer base in your market, is it mostly large employers who had reset co-pays and deductibles in January and mostly small employers where it kind of renews throughout the year?", "", "Steve Filton", "My general sense to that Christine is that, both small and large employers have gone down the benefit plan design route in '05 and '06 and increase co-pays and deductibles dramatically in those years. And we clearly saw a less of it in '07 and I haven't seen real hard data in '08 but my guess is we probably saw less of it in '08 because we know this is an employer of 40,000 people. There is only so much you can push those co-pays and deductibles before you create real dissatisfaction among your employee base. So, like everybody else, I think we raised ours in '05 and '06 and then kind of mute it in '07 and '08 and it just strikes me that that's the pattern that we've seen with most employers.", "", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So, part of this could be a wear-off of a deductible effect?", "", "Steve Filton", "No. I think that's an element of it for sure.", "", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then have you highlighted, I thought as I missed a bunch of this, have you highlighted the profile of the ex-flu admissions which is 5 to 6 volume from managed care, half of that was flu, but that still leaves you with strong 2% to 3% volume ex-flu and which is above baseline. So, is it dialysis? Because re-insurance companies are saying it's dialysis and premies that they are seeing driving kind of volumes or is it something else in terms of the procedures?", "", "Steve Filton", "I think its \u2026 I mentioned this to Andrea, I mean, I think it's across the board. I don't think it's specific to a single diagnosis. It's into an out-patient surgeries and it's in other in and out-patient diagnosis, so. In some ways I think that, kind of, is encouraging that it may be sustainable but because it's not in a one particular place, but it's not easy to pinpoint from our perspectives.", "", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "I appreciate that. Then last question, you have great cash flow, you showed CapEx restrain. This quarter you repurchased shares. Do you target being cash well positive like operating cash flow minus CapEx or is that something that doesn't even enter kind of your process as you look out and look forward, as you want that levered, so it's not like as a challenge to get more leverage. How do you think about that?", "", "Steve Filton", "Right. I mean, I think that our original projections for the year assume that we would be in that bar or given the fact that we already bought back $90 million worth of shares in the first quarter. And we had a $400 million to $425 million capital budget. Obviously, if we are able to sustain the operating performance that we have, that should improve some but, no. And then, I think getting back to so I think Justin Lake's question before. I think after 2008, we assume that we would become a net re-payor of debt as our CapEx started to skinny back a little bit.", "", "Christine Arnold - Morgan Stanley", "All right.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter Universal Health 2008 earnings release (Operator instructions).  Thank you.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton.  Sir, you may begin.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Thank you, Hamilton.  Good morning, I am Steve Filton.  Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning and welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter, date June 30, 2008.  ", "Hamilton, I think that static is from Mr. Miller\u2019s line.  Perhaps you can mute it until he is ready to answer a question.  ", "Operator", "", "Yes, sir.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Thank you.  ", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income per diluted share of $1.07 for the quarter, representing a 35% increase over the adjusted net income per diluted share earned during the second quarter of 2007 as calculated on the supplement schedules included with last night\u2019s press release.  Combined with our better than expected first quarter earnings, we earned $2.27 per diluted share during the six months ended June 30, 2008, representing a 34% increase over the adjusted net income per diluted share earned during the first six months of 2007.  ", "During this conference call we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.  ", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments in business trends before opening the call up to questions.  ", "Revenues for the second quarter increased 8% over the prior year\u2019s quarter.  Exclusive of the impact of new facilities, most notably, Centennial Hills and Las Vegas, and the revenues related to a construction management contract whereby we have built a new hospital for unrelated third party, revenues have increased by 7%.  A second, smaller construction management contract has recently commenced.  ", "On a same-facility basis in our Acute Care division, revenues increased 7.6% during the second quarter of 2008.  The increase resulted primarily from a 7% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.  Admissions to our hospital owned for more than a year were up .8% for the quarter.  In the Las Vegas/Nevada market, although the opening of the Centennial Hills Hospital has negatively impacted our same-store admissions comparisons to the extent that it cannibalized some of its volume from our existing facilities, the better-than-expected operating results at Centennial Hills contributed to a greater than 10% increase in total admissions in the market during the second quarter of 2008 over the comparable quarter of 2007.  ", "Also, as we have previously disclosed, newly constructed capacity at the physician-owned hospital in McAllen, Texas opened during the fourth quarter of 2007, unfavorable impacted our admissions in that market.  We define operating margins as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenues.  On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 14.6% during the second quarter of 2008 from 12.7% during the second quarter of 2007.  ", "The margin improvement resulted from continued increases in commercial payer volumes and pricing, the favorable impact of our change in group purchasing organizations, and an increase in overall operating efficiencies.  These favorable operating trends were manifested by increased margins in a variety of markets including our South Texas markets, Florida, Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, Nevada.  ", "Our Acute Care hospitals a charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates, amounting to 143 million during each of the three month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007.  As a percentage of net revenue, bad debts, charity expense and the uninsured discount in the second quarter were consistent with those levels we experienced for full year 2007.  ", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 7.8% during the second quarter of 2008.  This increase resulted from increased patient volumes and an increase in revenue per adjusted patient day.  Admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 8.5% during the quarter and patient days increased 3.1%.  Revenue per adjusted day rose 5.1% during the second quarter of 1008 over the comparable prior year quarter.  ", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 24.8% during the quarter ended June 30, 2008 as compared to 24.6% during the comparable prior year period.  ", "Our cash flow from operating activities was approximately $67 million during the second quarter of 2008 as compared to 60 million in the second quarter of 2007.  ", "At June 30, 2008, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 40.6% and the ratio of debt to EBITDA was 1.95.  We spent $75 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter.  Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to our new, 165-bed Centennial Hills Hospital in Las Vegas that opened in January.  And a new, 171-bed hospital in Palm Dale, California that is scheduled to be completed and opened in 2009.  ", "In California, we are also underway with a major expansion of emergency room, imaging and women\u2019s services to our Southwest Healthcare campuses in Riverside County, California.  ", "Our behavioral health facilities have operated at a very efficient 77% available occupancy rate for the first half of the year.  We have multiple projects to add capacity to our busiest behavioral facility.  We opened a total of approximately 70 new behavioral health beds during the second quarter and anticipate opening a total of 350 to 450 new beds in 2008. ", "In connection with the government\u2019s on-going investigation of our south Texas health system, we have received notification that at this time, the government will not be pursuing criminal prosecutive action against the company or our south Texas health system.  The Department of Justice is still investigation whether or not any individuals independently obstructed justice.  The government is continuing its civil investigation of our south Texas health system.  We expect to continue our discussions with the government in an attempt to resolve this matter.  ", "We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Our first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of Merrill Lynch. ", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Good morning.  Thank you, Steve.  You mentioned the strength in Vegas on the volume side and the count, I suspect, was down with the new competition earlier or late last year.  Can you talk about, sort of, how the volume was spread throughout the rest of the portfolio?  Was it fairly even or were there other extremes, either up or down?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Tom.  Obviously, you always have some ups and downs, but we saw strength.  I kind of alluded to profitability in my opening remarks.  But we saw strength in admissions in the Washington, D.C. at GW.  We saw it in Florida in the Bradenton market where, as we disclosed, for the past three or four quarters, I think we have benefitted from a major construction renovation project that we completed at the end of the second quarter last year.  So, I think we saw that strength again throughout the portfolio.   ", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay and then on the out-patient side, can you discuss the trends you are seeing there? ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure.  In the first quarter we talked about the fact that surgery volumes were actually a little bit negative in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, they turned sort of slightly positive, not a huge change, but we did see a little bit of a rebound in our surgical procedures, particularly out-patient surgery.  And we have seen relatively busy ER visits throughout the year; busier in the first quarter, just because of the flu impact, but still busy ER in the second quarter as well.  ", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, final question, just wondering how you are sort of viewing the Medicaid landscape at this point, given the state of the economy and state budgets.  Thank you.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure, well we have seen--and I think we have talked in previous calls--about Medicaid, announced Medicaid reductions in Florida, which took effect on July 1.  California\u2019s was supposed to take effect on July and there is some legal wrangling that has sort of enjoined that for the moment, but may well be retroactive to July 1.  Both those changes are worth, probably, a couple of million dollars of negative impact, each, to us in those states.  ", "Since, I think, the second quarter call, the state of Nevada has passed Medicaid reductions which will take effect on September 1.  We do not have a huge exposure to Medicaid in Las Vegas or Reno and again, probably worth a couple of million dollars in negative impact to us.  ", "The best news, I guess, from a Medicaid perspective is that the state where we have the biggest Medicaid exposure is Texas.  And at the moment, Texas is not talking about any Medicaid reductions.  They are talking about some tinkering with disproportionate share programs and moving that money into the regular Medicaid program.  But as we, I think, have articulated in the past, our expectation is that the impact of that will largely by budget-neutral or revenue-neutral to us.  ", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Thank you.  ", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein of Lehman Brothers.  ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay, thank you.  Good morning, Steve.  Good morning, Alan.  Maybe just starting with Vegas, maybe just talk about how would a 10% growth number.  Just curious, if you could just comment just about overall profitability in Vegas in terms of margin trends there and then, just curious, in terms of the Centennial Hospital, just sounds like ramping up much better than anticipated.  ", "You had initially talked about $0.07 to $0.08 of dilution for the full year, just curious in terms of how you are thinking about that and I have a couple of follow-up questions.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure.  Well, the Vegas profitability was good for the quarter.  On a same-store basis, our profitability was up and, as we have discussed before, for the first half of the year, Centennial has out-performed our own expectations.  It was actually close to being EBITDA break even in the second quarter, which is probably about three months ahead of when we thought they would get to that level of profitability.  So we are just pleased with general developments in the Las Vegas market.  ", "But, our profitability, again, as I sort of commented to Tom, from an admissions perspective, but it is also true about profitability, was relatively strong throughout the portfolio.  To have a beat as large as we did, you need to have both portfolio-wide strength as well as, obviously, strength across the two businesses and I think we had that in the second quarter.  ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay and then, I guess in terms of the dilution for the year from Centennial to, I guess, just how do you think about that $0.07 to $0.08 that you talked about earlier in the year.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think that we will probably, in the end, do better than that, Adam.  As long as trends continue, the balance of the year ought to be a little bit accretive at Centennial.  And, like I said, we are probably--at the end of the day--about three months ahead of sort of our ramp-up schedule there, which we already thought was a pretty accelerated schedule.  But I do not know how much less than the 7 or $0.08 we will be, but we should be a least a few pennies less than that.  ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay and then, just a follow-up question to hear, I guess, as we think about the operating leverage in the business model.  Clearly, you guys have been showing upside on the margins.  So, just curious, in the last quarter Steve, you talked about some improvement in salaries in benefits.  And this quarter it looks like you saw a similar improvement as well as on the supply line item.  Just curious, if you could comment on that, any items that really stand out in terms of the cost management.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure, Adam.  What we said in the first quarter and I think it is equally true in the second is that when you have the strong revenue performance and we had same-store revenue growth in our two business segments in the 7.5 to 8% range, that is obviously pretty strong same-store revenue growth and I think it provides an opportunity for a lot of operating leverage.  ", "And I think you saw, again, in the first half of the year, that our operators have taken advantage of that.  I think that it is also true that in a little bit of a weaker economy, we have seen some of the pressure come off our wage rates.  Our usage of temporary nurses is clearly down over last year for the first six months, which I think is a good indicator of sort of how much pressure there is on wage rates.  ", "We mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are getting some benefit from our change in group purchasing organizations, which was effective April 1.  So I think we had a few million dollars of benefit from that in the second quarter.  ", "And the only other comment that I will make is we have seen a little bit of a bias toward more medical procedures and less surgical procedures and a little bit more acuity on the medical side.  And just, generally, medical procedures are less supply-intensive than surgical procedures and so, I think that is driving down our supply expense as well.   ", "", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay and then just a final question here.  On the pricing side, has anything changed, Steve, there?  It seems like you guys are seeing some acceleration, just curious, I know you finalized the new Sierra contract.  You highlighted on the last call, so just curious in terms of--as you think about the pricing environment--have there been a few contracts that have changed or how are you thinking about that? ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think that the dynamics, there are a few dynamics, Adam, that are contributing to what has been a relatively strong pricing environment in the first half of the year.  As we anticipated would be the case, I think we have benefitted modestly from Medicare switch to the MSDRGs.  So, that has been a modest help to us.  ", "I think that, in general, our managed-care pricing, which we have said over the last few years has been going up at a rate of somewhere between 6 and 8% that for the first half of this year.  We are kind of on the high end or high end of that range, rather.  ", "And then, finally, as we talked about, again, in the first quarter and I think it is true again in the second quarter our just general mix of payers has been good.  And it has been weighted more toward managed care and less towards indigent, non-pay patients, and Medicaid patients.  And I think all those things together have contributed to the stronger pricing.  ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Last quarter, you gave a commercial volume number, since you were talking about mixed there, do you have that number again?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Yeah, we talked last quarter about commercial volumes being up about 6% year-over-year in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the numbers were pretty similar. ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay, great.  Thank you very much, great quarter.  ", "Operator", "", "And next we have Jason Gurda of Leerink.  ", "Jason Gurda \u2013 Leerink", "", "Good morning, Steve.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Hi, Jason. ", "Jason Gurda \u2013 Leerink", "", "Do you have a sense for what the uninsured admission trends were during the quarter?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think our uninsured admissions were growing at about the same rate as our overall admissions, which I think was the case in the first quarter as well.  So, overall, uninsured admissions were growing at about the same rate.  Managed-care admissions were growing a little faster.  Medicaid admissions, largely as a result of the loss of OB business in McAllen were down and that is kind of the way the mix looks.  ", "Jason Gurda \u2013 Leerink", "Okay, you had mentioned in your comments earlier that you had started a second construction project.  Could you, maybe, add a little color on that? ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure, our fist construction management project was initiated in \u201906 and between \u201906 and \u201907, we recorded probably, $10 million of EBITDA related to that project, which is now largely completed.  The project, itself is completed and we are just finishing the construction accounting and little bit of clean-up in that regard.  ", "We have commenced a second contract with actually, the same not-for-profit system, on a smaller scale that will result in EBITDA to us of probably a couple of million dollars in the back end of 2008 and another couple of million dollars in 2009.  And we continue, at the same time, to look for other opportunities for these construction projects.  We think we have a particular skill set in this area and we think that it adds value to others and so, we continue to try and market those services.  ", "Jason Gurda \u2013 Leerink", "Interesting.  One other thing I wanted to touch on was you were going through a little bit of the state Medicaid exposure and some of your expectations.  Do you have a sense, overall, what you are expecting for Medicaid in the back half of the year into \u201909? ", "Steve G. Filton", " ", "Going into \u201908, we said that our pricing guidance presumed that Medicaid pricing would go up like 0 to 1% and the changes that have been announced so far do not really change that very much, so I think we are sort of still in that range for \u201908 and although we have not been very precise about it, my guess is that that is sort of the outlook for \u201909 as well. ", "Jason Gurda \u2013 Leerink", "Okay, well thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "And next we have Ralph Giacombi of Credit Suisse. ", "Ralph Giacombi \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Great, thanks, morning.  Just in terms of the guidance, it sort of raised it about $0.10 on a $0.16 beat and just wondering if there is anything in the second half we should be aware of.  Obviously, you have talked this in the Medicaid cuts and I guess, just whether guidance assumes sort of the first have trends continue into the second half. ", " ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure, Ralph.  Two things, and we mentioned this in the first quarter as well, it is a little bit difficult because we do not give quarterly guidance, but I think it is fair to say that, while our full-year guidance at the outset of the year was pretty consistent with the Street.  Our guidance was a little bit front-end loaded than the Street\u2019s and obviously, by definition, the Street\u2019s was a little bit more back-end loaded.  ", "So, I would say that in both the first and second quarters or in the first half of the year, our internal beat, if you will, was somewhat lower than the Street had it.  And therefore, when we raised our guidance, I think in both the first and second quarter, I think we were raising our guidance to some degree, more than the beat in each quarter or to accommodate the beat in each quarter, but that is largely sort of an allocation issue across the year.  ", "I think the other aspect to be noted is, as everybody knows obviously, we are watching the news about the weakening national economy and some of our local economies carefully and increased unemployment rates in some of our markets, et cetera.  And while I think the second quarter results demonstrate this that we have felt little impact from that economic weakness thus far, we certainly cannot guarantee that there will not be some impact later in the year.  And so we have tried to be relatively cautious about how we might feel that impact in the back half of 2008.  ", "Ralph Giacombi \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay and then I think you mentioned case mix, but I do not know if--did you give a percentage for case mix in the quarter? ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Actually, I am not sure I mentioned case mix, but I appreciate you saying that because our case mix is up a little bit.  Not a whole lot, but I would say probably 3 or 4% our case mix is up. ", "Ralph Giacombi \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay and I guess in the first quarter I think you mentioned sort of 2.5, 3% so tracking still, do you think that is sort of a sustainable number or what are seeing, what is driving that?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I wish I could that with some precision, Ralph.  As I mentioned before, we have taken sort of a hard look at our mix of procedures and we have noted that, again, there has been a little bit of a bias towards more medical and less surgical procedures.  And frankly, that is not necessarily the environment where we think that our case mix would be going up.  So, other than to say, I think just in general, I would say that the acute care hospital environment is such that patients who get admitted over the last few years are just sicker and more acutely ill and that trend continues.  I do not know that I could point to any other rationale for why we are seeing a little bit of a creep up in our acuity.  ", "Ralph Giacombi \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Okay and then just the last one.  Can you remind us again sort of the difference between, on the behavioral side, seeing kind of a flattish revenue per adjusted admit stat versus kind of that 5.1% increase in the revenue per adjusted patient day.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Sure.  That is almost entirely a function of about a 5% length of stay reduction in behavioral in the quarter.  Unlike acute, in behavioral, virtually all of our reimbursement from all payers is on a per diem or per day basis.  And so when length of stay contracts as it did in the second quarter, revenue per admission goes down.  So, just very simply, if this year we are seeing--or let us say last year we were seeing a Medicare patient on average for ten days at $500.00 a day and this year our average Medicare patient is staying for nine days at $500.00 a day, we are obviously going to have a decline in revenue per admission, but revenue per day will be going by the normal pricing so--", "Ralph Giacombi \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Is there something that sort of lower length of stay? ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I do not think so.  Obviously there are some states where you may see a little bit of pressure from Medicaid, managed Medicaid, but I think, in general, probably more than anything else, Ralph, is the idea that this is the third quarter in a row where we have had same-store admissions increases in behavioral in kind of the seven, eight, 9% range.  And those numbers, I think, are so significant that our operators have changed their practices a little bit and in order to accommodate the tremendous demand for our services and our capacity.  We are doing the best that we can to turn patients over and even if utilization review and clinical practice would allow us to keep the patient an extra day, et cetera, I think sometimes, if it is clinically appropriate, we are discharging that patient just so we can satisfy our waiting list and our demand for referral sources to get patients into our facilities.  So, I think you are seeing a little bit after now three quarters of very strong admission growth.  ", "", "Ralph Giacombi \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great.  Thank you.  ", "Operator", "", "And next, we have question from the line of Matthew Bush of Goldman Sachs", "Shelly Knoll \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.  ", "", "Hi, thanks this is Shelly Knoll (ph 00:30:25) in for Mat Bush this morning.  If we could go back to the Las Vegas market.  I was wondering, Steve, I think you have mentioned in the past that the economic metric that has most impacted hospitals is unemployment.  Can you talk a little bit about your sense, just anecdotally, what is going on in the Las Vegas market?  The 10% admissions growth you guys have seen, is that market share that you are taking from other hospitals or what is the market dynamic in Las Vegas?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Well, let us talk about market share first.  Clearly, we talked throughout 2007 about a significant shift in market share, largely as a result, obviously of Sierra\u2019s cancellation of their contract with the HCA facility, so there was a significant shift in market share in 2007.  ", "We also talked in 2007, however, that as a result of that shift, losing some other business like Medicare and other commercial payers, et cetera.  One of the positives for us in the first half of 2008 and particularly in the second quarter is we saw a nice recapture, for instance, of some of that Medicare volume we had lost.  So, I think if anything, literally every quarter as market share data comes out, and the nice thing about the Vegas market, is that that data is available on a pretty real-time basis.  We are just seeing our market share continue to strengthen and the gap between us and our nearest competitor continues to widen.  So, we are very pleased with market share in the Vegas market.  ", "As far as the overall economy.  Obviously, there is much that has been written, as you well know, about weakness in the Vegas economy, but I think we have been pretty open about saying that we are not feeling a great deal of that thus far.  Unemployment rates did go up in Vegas earlier in the year, I think in March or April, but I think in May they actually game down by .10 of a point, so I am not sure that there is a clear continuing progression of upward pressure on unemployment in the market.  It is kind of a mixed bag.  Some of the gaming properties have announced layoffs, et cetera, but others have announced major hiring.  ", "The Winn Properties announced that they are hiring 4 or 5,000 people and there is this city center project that is underway that is going to employ a significant number of people as well.  So, we are seeing--and there are still a significant amount of people moving into the city.  Even the most recent data from May or June indicates that there are about still--people are moving into Las Vegas at the rate of about 50,000 a year.  So, we are carefully watching the metrics in Las Vegas, but as I indicated in response to other questions earlier, our business there remains strong and we are hopeful we can weather whatever weakness may exist there.  ", "", "Shelly Knoll \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. ", "", "Okay, I really appreciate the color, thanks.  And if I could just do one quick follow-up on maybe Ralph\u2019s questions on the behavioral health.  Can you talk a little bit about what services are seeing the strongest growth in behavioral and maybe, update us on your mix of inpatient and outpatient.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Well, first of all, from an inpatient/outpatient mix, our business has always, on the behavioral side, been heavily weighted toward inpatient.  And even in most markets where we have outpatient, with a few exceptions, the outpatient business that we have is largely designed to compliment and ultimately, feed our inpatient business, so it is very much an inpatient-oriented business that we have.  ", "In terms of the mix between residential and acute, those numbers remain about the same.  We are still, I think more heavily weighted towards the acute side than the residential side and as far as individual service lines, chemical dependence, et cetera, I do not know that we are seeing the strength in admissions focused in a particular service line, et cetera.  We are seeing that strength pretty much spread throughout the portfolio service wise, geographic perspective, adults and adolescents.  So obviously, I think when you are growing at 7-8-9% pretty consistently for the last few quarters, you have got to have some pretty widespread strength and I think that is what we are seeing. ", "Shelly Knoll \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co. ", "Okay, great.  Thanks, I appreciate it.  ", "Operator", "", "Next, we have Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks, good morning, Alan and Steve.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Morning.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "I wanted to just go back to the question with regard to the outlook for the second half of the year.  We clearly hear what you\u2019re saying Steve about what your internal budgets were and how they were weighted.  ", "I guess I just wanted to get your comments on a couple things.  If you had to break down what really changes in the second half relative to your earnings levels and perhaps your revenue, how would you frame that for us?  Is it weighted towards your bad debt rising?  Do you have volume softening?  Could you just maybe hit us with the high points that would help us frame what looks to be an unusually lower-weighted second half relative to what you have done in the last at least two years?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, first, I will preface it.  Alan and I spoke before the call this morning and he reminded me of something Yogi Berra once said that predictions are very hard to make, especially about the future.  And I think that is certainly true here, particularly in the volatile environment that we have been operating in the last few years.  And now layer on to that the economic uncertainty.  ", "I think, in general, Darren, just mechanically what we have done is we had guidance out there for the year.  We have beaten that guidance and we have discussed that we have beaten it a little bit less internally than we have beaten perhaps the street\u2019s guidance in the first half of the year.  ", "But just generally, we have taken the approach that for the balance of the year; we will meet our original guidance, say for things like interest expense, et cetera, that we adjusted early on in the year and have not really necessarily said that we are anticipating a reduction in volumes or an increase in bad debt.  And as we have indicated up to now, we really have not experienced that, but we have taken, as I characterized earlier, a fairly cautious approach to it and we hope to deliver on what we have promised and that is just the position that we have taken.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that is fair.  And you did at one point have a revenue target of 5.13 billion, is that roughly the level you are still looking at, or does the centennial ramp change that outlook in any way?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don\u2019t\u2019 know that the Centennial ramp has enough of an impact on our consolidated results to really make us rethink that.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough.  And then a couple other things.  Just going back to the labor cost management, it has look quite good and I know you are discussing the easing of labor relative to the economy.  Can you just give us maybe a spot number at this point where you are and temporary labor cost per patient day?  Or however you might measure it where that is in the second quarter and where that\u2019s come from relative to last year?", "Steve G. Filton", "That number I don\u2019t have in front of me Darren.  I\u2019ll be happy to provide it offline.  But I do know that our use of temporary labor in total is clearly lower in the first half of \u201908 than it was in the first half of \u201907 despite the fact that we\u2019ve had pretty strong revenue on both sides of the business, et cetera.  So, again, I will be happy to provide more granular detail offline, but the big indicator, I think, is that our overall expense is lower than it was last year.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, I will follow up offline there.  And then just back to pricing, maybe to peel back a little bit further there just to make sure I\u2019m hearing you correctly.  Have you seen any shift at all that would show up in your pricing trends relative to a shift from inpatient to outpatient catheterizations?  And maybe some growth and observation days which get reclassified and maybe paid as lower than inpatient.  Is there anything palpable there that you want to highlight to us relative to that pricing number?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that both of the trends that you mentioned, which is a shift from in to outpatient, particularly in the cardiac area and more observation days are trends that we certainly have seen over the last few years.  I cannot tell you with any precision what our experience has been in the first half of the year.  I cannot tell you right this minute.  We certainly know that.  ", "But obviously, with our pricing strength, I think it is fair to say that we are not experiencing a tremendous amount of pressure from either of those issues or otherwise we would not be able to see the pricing strength that we have seen in the first half of the year.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and remind me, the Sierra contract renewal took effect, was it May or June?  So we saw some of that increase in the quarter.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean it was either late May or early June.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then Alan, I just have a question for you about Texoma.  Can you just give us some comments about that acquisition and how it has performed?  And then one specific question about Texoma is just the physician model which you inherited with that acquisition.  Can you talk about how that model may translate to other markets, whether you found any success in that physician group there?", "Alan B. Miller", "Well they happen to be good at managing a physician group and so we have been studying what they have done.  They have been very successful with it and there is a shift now happening with more physicians seem to want to be employed.  So we are looking at how they have done it and seeing what we can learn from them.  ", "We are bullish on the market.  I would say it has been uneven, but we are going to be building in a very good location and it is a growth community.  So we are happy with the acquisition.  I think that if you look, for example, at what the returns have been, not only centennial but in Bradenton, we did a big construction project there that has really turned the hospital into a wonderful projection, positive earnings, really growing.  So we are excited about it.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "One of the things that your competitors all seem to struggle with is just the physician employment model and how to really implement that through a portfolio.  Is something like Texoma, can you translate that to other markets do you think if you have to do more employment?", "Alan B. Miller", "I would say we are studying it.  We have not been, never got into the buying practices and employing physicians other than the house-based physicians.  We never thought it was, and this is over a period of time, very productive.  A lot of people retired on our dollar.  ", "But the trend now seems to be that with all of the paperwork and the government involvement, a lot of physicians, typically the younger ones, they like to be employed and not be bothered with anything else.  And go home and not be concerned about running a business at all.  So we are looking at that and we are employing physicians on a very selective basis, but it is a trend that seems to be happening and we all have to deal with it.", "Steve G. Filton", "Darren, I think that the Texoma experience is actually instructive in the sense that Texoma had a physician employment model for a long time before we bought them.  And we know from their sharing their history with us that they struggled with it for many years in the beginning.  They lost a lot of money in the beginning on their physician ownership, et cetera.  ", "Once the model was developed and the physician ownership and practice built et cetera, we think it is a very effective tool.  But as you alluded to our competitors and I think all hospitals rarely implement a physician ownership model without a lot of bumps in the road to get there.  So the challenge that we all have is to get to perhaps an effective end game.  You know, can you do so without losing too much money and being too disruptive, et cetera.  And as Alan said, we are trying to learn from the Texoma experience both before and after our ownership as we think about how we are going to handle this issue in all of our other markets.  ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great thanks a lot.  I will jump out of the queue here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Leiberman of Stanford Group.", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "Thanks, good morning.", "Steve G. Filton", "Hey Gary.", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "I am not sure if you gave a number about what the bad debts were at the acute care hospitals?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think our same-store bad debt in acute was 12% in the quarter, roughly.", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "Okay, do you have a dollar number?", "Steve G. Filton", "I do.  It is right here.  It was $114 million in the second quarter.  ", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "Okay, and then I guess just to maybe beat the horse completely dead here on Las Vegas, could you talk a little bit, I guess, about whether or not visitors to Las Vegas account for any significant portion of the hospital volumes or any significant portion of the revenue at your hospitals.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, let me make two comments about that.  One is that only a relatively small percentage of our market revenues come from the tourist business.  When we have attempted to clarify this in the past, it is somewhere in the 3 to 4% of our revenue comes from the tourist business, which is not, frankly, unexpected.  Obviously most people are taking a vacation are doing so in what they think is good health and it\u2019s only usually an emergency that would cause them to seek medical treatment while they\u2019re away.", "The other comment I would make is for those who follow the Vegas and the economy and the gaming industries.  Tourist volumes are not really down very much.  What is down is the amount of money spent by the average tourist on the average night, et cetera, which is, frankly, as you can imagine, a bigger challenge for the gaming industry than it is for the hospital industry.  ", "So two things, we are not overly reliant on the tourist business to begin with other than indirectly as the strength of the gaming industry.  And secondly, the amount of tourists visiting the city, which I think are projected to be 37 million this year, it is not really down.  ", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "Okay, and then you had benefited I think earlier in the year from some favorable trends on malpractice insurance.  Can you update us on terms of has that changed at all I guess in terms of what you\u2019re reserving or what your outlook is there?", "Steve G. Filton", "Right, so actually I think that that adjustment to our malpractice reserves goes back to the second quarter of 2007, so this quarter actually, the comparison is probably not as favorable as it has been, but in general, the favorable trends that caused us to reduce our malpractice accruals a year ago have generally continued.  We think we are benefiting in some of the most important states in which we operate by malpractice tort reform that has been passed in states like Nevada, Texas, and Florida, as well as improvements that we have made to reduce risk, particularly in certain service lines like OB.", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "Okay, and then maybe just a follow-up question for Alan in terms of what your thoughts are on the acquisition environment both maybe in the acute care business and also in the psych business.", "Alan B. Miller", "Well, I will start with the acute business.  We are active.  We are always looking at evaluating.  There are a number of players now.  We thought it might decline fewer players, but there are people out there.  When something good comes on the market or people know about it, there have been a number of players.  One came up recently and my understanding was they had 10 or 12 people that were active and had some capabilities.", "The psych business, you have to be selective.  There are a number of startup companies and I am interested in seeing whether funders are going to be as willing to fund new companies as they have been.  There are a number of tem out there but we are being selective.  We have made, as you know, acquisitions every year.  And there are not a lot of them, but we are interested in the ones that have a future, can be productive, we can buy them.  The rates are higher than they have been, but they are there.  It is not a great number of availabilities as there have been in the past.  ", "Gary Leiberman - Stanford Research", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And next, we have Justin Lake of UBS.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Thanks, just a couple quick questions.  One on share repurchase, for the last call you mentioned you were going to take a break to look at the M&A opportunities out there.  When do you expect to kind of have that evaluation done and kind of make your decision whether you are going to be active in M&A or get back to buying back stock?", "Steve G. Filton", "Justin, I do not know that we set any sort of timeframes or deadlines for ourselves.  As Alan just indicated in his response, the acquisition evaluation process is sort of ongoing and constant.  And, frankly, the evaluation of the opportunities to repurchase our own stock are also ongoing and to some extent dependent on how our stock price moves, et cetera.  ", "Obviously, at the recent levels, we think our own stock is a fairly attractive buy.  But we are always going to look at the opportunities to repurchase our own stock in connection with any opportunities that exist to buy other earnings streams and decide the best way to employ our capital.", "Justine Lake - UBS", "Okay, great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And next, we have Frank Morgan of Jeffries & Co.", "Frank Morgan - Jeffries & Co", "", "Good morning.  A couple questions here.  Steve, you mentioned dish payments in Texas.  Any other updates on other states like South Carolina and then back to Texas, what about other kind of state or county programs have been a source of funding for you in the past?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, we have talked in previous quarters about the UPL programs in Texas.  And I think in essence we have gotten within the last few quarters sort of the all clear on our current UPL programs in Texas.  They all seem to have met CMS muster, so I think we are square on that.  As I said, Texas is the state where we received by far the most significant amount of Medicaid disproportion in share.  And Texas continues to sort of look at kind of a remodeling of their regulations but continue to say, informally at least, that this is intended to be budget neutral.  And in the informal conversations we have had with the state of Texas, we do not believe we\u2019re likely to be impacted in any material way either positively or negatively although we should get those rates and know with some certainty this month, meaning August.  ", "South Carolina is a much smaller number in terms of our exposure to disproportionate share.  I do not believe we have gotten our fiscal \u201909 numbers yet.  But again, our expectation there is it should not be material, but in general, our exposure to South Carolina is much less, than it is to Texas.", "Frank Morgan - Jeffries & Co", "Okay, two more and then I will hop.  First, were there actually any medical mal released in the prior period reserves in the quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "No.", "Frank Morgan - Jeffries & Co", "Okay, and then finally, any explanation for the weakness in surgical volumes overall?", "Steve G. Filton", "In all honesty, Frank, we have not been able to do the real deep dive that we did in the first quarter.  When we did it in the first quarter, most of the reduction was in cardiology, and within cardiology, it was in stenting procedures.  It looked, at least on a preliminary basis, that those volumes came back some in the second quarter.  And again, I think in the second quarter our surgical volume sort of moved in line with our overall admissions and I would say that is kind of what we expected.  The first quarter they were a little weaker and like I said, that mostly looked like a cardiac stenting issue.  ", "Frank Morgan - Jeffries & Co", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Next we have Kemp Dolliver of Cowen and company.", "Kemp Dolliver - SG Cowen", "Alright, thanks.  One question that relates to the earlier acuity discussion Steve, and then what spill-over effect, if any, do you think unless the MSDRGs have had on your commercial business?  At least one of the plans has noted that they what they\u2019re seeing is that essentially the coders that learn MSDRGs, they code it for Medicare and then they basically just code everything else the same way just out of human nature and the absence of any double check on it by the payer or even the hospital.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "Kemp, I think that for us the vast majority of our managed care reimbursement remains per diem based and so it is not dependent on coding.  You know the only large payer quite frankly that we have that has tried to mirror the Medicare MSDRGs frankly has been Texas Medicaid and frankly they struggled with it.  We have benefited, not to any great degree, but they have made some retroactive payments, maybe a couple million bucks in the second quarter as a result of not getting it right when they first implemented it.  But other than that, I would say the vast majority of our managed care contracts are not subject to reimbursement that would be coding sensitive.  ", "Kemp Dolliver - SG Cowen", "Okay, good and the acuity increase you mentioned is 3 to 4%, my impression is that is probably relatively strong compared to your history.  Is that right?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, actually for a long time, we did not see much movement in our case mix index for the last couple of years, so this modest improvement in the last quarter or two is something that is relatively recent for us at least.", "Kemp Dolliver - SG Cowen", "That is great.  Thank you.", "Alan B. Miller", "Steve, I am going offline now.  Bye everyone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Emander of Standard Imports (ph 00:55:28).", "Jeff Emander - Standard Imports", "", "Good morning Steve.  Quick question, I believe it was last quarter, but correct me if I am wrong, that you gave some commentary that business was more impacted, not so much by weakness in housing, but by weakness in employment.  And you made some comments this morning about the Vegas market.  Can you just color on any of the other markets and what you are seeing either anecdotally or otherwise in terms of employment and what impact that might be having in your results.  ", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, I think that the conversation that your are eluding to Jeff is that the first quarter people were asking about whether we were feeling any pinch from a weakening economy in Las Vegas.  And I think we talked about the fact that most of the metrics three or four months ago that were negative were housing related.  Foreclosure rates were up.  Housing starts were down, et cetera.  ", "And we speculated that we did not necessarily think that those metrics would have a direct immediate impact on us.  And the more likely impact that we would have in any market is frankly the number of people who were unemployed went up mostly because the concern would be that people who lose their jobs would lose their health insurance that came along with their jobs.  So at the very end of the first quarter I think we were seeing an uptick in unemployment in Las Vegas and noted that and said that we would watch that carefully.  ", "Obviously national unemployment rates have gone up.  We have seen them go up in some of our local markets.  As we\u2019ve indicated a few times now, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re really feeling that pinch anywhere, and as a matter of fact, frankly if there was market that we\u2019ve acknowledged we\u2019ve probably felt some of the local economic weakness, it\u2019s been Florida.  And frankly we did well in the second quarter in our couple of Florida markets, so we continue to say that we are not seeing much of an impact.  And as you know unemployment has risen on a relative basis fairly dramatically, but it is not at terribly high levels compared to what we have experienced historically.", "Jeff Emander - Standard Imports", "Okay, can you make any comments about what you have seen in Texas at all?", "Steve G. Filton", "The Texas markets I think in general have done better than the national average.  I think Texas generally has weathered the storm a little bit better, probably because of the oil industry.  In the second quarter, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our south Texas markets which are primarily in the gallon, but also Laredo and Eagle Pass did well in the second quarter.  Alan indicated in one of his responses that Texoma, which is a north Dallas market, has been a little more uneven.  Amarillo has been a little more uneven.  But we are not seeing any particular weakness and again in the south Texas area we have probably seen some strength actually.  ", "Jeff Emander - Standard Imports", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next we have David Beal (ph 00:58:32) with Morgan Stanley.  ", "David Beal - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks.  We have heard anecdotally for example that June was a pretty tough collection month for some providers.  I wonder if you could just call out any trends that may be notable in terms of month-to-month variations in the key metrics.", "Steve G. Filton", "I do not have the month-to-month results in front of me David. But my general sense is there are always some ups and downs in the quarter but volume wise, collection wise, it strikes me that our performance was relatively stable throughout the quarter.  It is not like we saw things get steadily better over the quarter or steadily worse either way and frankly I think for the most part, we have seen that stability for the entire first half of the year.  ", "David Beal - Morgan Stanley", "And just one follow-up, any impact at all from Hurricane Dolly in the south Texas markets?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "We were hardest hit in the McAllen market.  But even that is sort of a three or four day event mostly rain, leaks or whatever in the facility.  And a couple of days of diminished ER and elective volume, but as I recall, I think Hurricane Dolly hit on a Wednesday and by the following Monday I think we were very much back to normal.  ", "David Beal - Morgan Stanley", "That is great.  Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Next, we have a question from the line of David Bachman of Langbow Research.", "David Bachman - Langbow Research", "Good morning Steve.  Couple of questions on the managed care pricing, let me get back to that.  It has obviously been strong.  You said 6 to 8% and sort of what you have been looking for this year.  Can you talk about how that varies across the portfolio?  Are there certain markets that are above or below that, just in general terms?", "Steve G. Filton", "I do not have enough sort of granular detail in front of me to answer that question sort of accurately David.  The answer is I am sure that is the case.  And I have mentioned before probably what determines our success in managed care negotiation is probably our relative market strength and market share and the availability of excess capacity in the market and the payers relative market strength and market share more than probably any other issue.  But it is not like we are getting 10-12% increases in some markets and 2- 3% increases in other.  I would say that the variability is more narrow than that.", "David Bachman - Langbow Research", "It would be more narrow than that.  But we can assume that given what you have just said that the Las Vegas market, you would be in a stronger position with capacity coming online and a larger market share there to be at the high-end or slightly above the high end of that range then.", "Steve G. Filton ", "Well, I would not necessarily sort of jump to that conclusion only because the sort of countervailing argument to that is we probably have the strongest managed care player that we negotiate with in that market.  And I think we have indicated previously that our renegotiated contract with Sierra was at rates lower than our average rate so you can\u2019t underestimate the strength that that particular payer has in that market.  ", "David Bachman - Langbow Research", "Okay, well that is helpful.  Then just back on the operating leverage front, hopefully you can give us just a little bit more color.  I see in the same facility metrics here, average daily census is up about 130 basis-points year-over-year.  Can you talk about how much that kind of move just really helps profitability?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I think our results in the first half of the year are reflective of the fact that it is very helpful.  This remains both in the behavioral and in the acute business largely a fix cost business.  A lot of our expense is wage related.  And a lot of that wage expense is fixed and semi-fixed other than sort of a nursing care or on the unit.  I would say most of our remaining labor cost is fixed or semi-fixed.  ", "The only other real variable cost associated with each incremental patient is the supply expense that patient generates and other that that, again, it is all very fixed and semi-fixed.  So when we have an increase in ABC as you framed it, or as I framed it before 7.5-8% increase in same-store revenue, I think there is a significant opportunity for operating leverage.  Again, I think the operators have to do their job in order to enjoy it.  And in the first half of this year, I have said over and over again I think our operators I think have done a really remarkable job.  ", "David Bachman - Langbow Research", "Okay, great, and just one last question.  You have not talked as much about recruitment of referring physicians as some of the other operators do.  Can you give us any metrics on that in the quarter and strength on that front?", "Steve G. Filton", "Historically we, you are right, have not talked about physician recruitment the way that others have.  I think, largely because the companies that really talk about physician recruitment tend to be those that have more rural facilities where literally the recruitment of a single specialist or an orthopedic surgeon or cardiac surgeon or neurosurgeon may well be the only one in the market.  It really affects their ability to deliver a service in that market.  ", "We tend to operate in markets where we have kind of a broader ability to deliver the service.  It is rarely dependent on a single physician.  Obviously physician recruitment is an important function to us.  Occasionally we will run into problems with recruiting a particular specialty in a particular market.  But generally the markets we operate in, in particularly those most important to us, Las Vegas, south Texas, et cetera, these are markets that have been growing.  They are growing faster than the national average.  And frankly physicians want to practice there and they have not been terribly challenging to recruit to.  ", "David Bachman - Langbow Research", "Okay and just one last question, on the behavioral side, 350 to 450 beds in \u201908, how many of those are online through the second quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think, I am not remembering the first quarter number exactly, but I think we are sitting at about 200 for the first half of the year.  ", "David Bachman - Langbow Research", "Okay, so about halfway through.  Okay, great.  Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure.", "Operator", "Next we have questions from the line of Gary Taylor of Citigroup.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Hi, good morning Steve.  Thanks for taking all the questions.  A few quick ones on the construction contract, the new one.  How much revenue do you think that adds in the back half?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I\u2019m going to guess at this Gary because I haven\u2019t seen a real sort of construction timeline, but I\u2019m thinking maybe 25 to 35 million of revenue and obviously a like amount of operating expense.  ", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "In just the back half, right?", "Steve G. Filton", "In just the back half of \u201908.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Centennial Hills, can you talk about occupancy rate there, even ballpark?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think Centennial has been operating probably for the full six months at 40% occupancy, something like that.  It is 175 beds, roughly.  ", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Still got a lot of room there.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "And on the Medicaid reductions you had commented on Florida, Nevada, California, were those 2008 amounts or were those annualized amounts?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "When I talked about a couple million dollars affecting each state, those were annual amounts, so obviously we will only be getting a portion of that in 2008.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "And then my last question, the one place where if you look at your metrics versus your peers, you have just blown them away year-to-date on is on the commercial admissions growth in the first quarter.  I think every other company, including HCA, had negative commercial admissions year-over-year.  You are up six.  You were up six again.  I think we have asked this question before or maybe other people have asked it in a different way on the call but when you look at that 6% growth, do you see a single geography?  Do you see a particular service line?  Is Vegas a disproportionate driver of that?  Could you see a strategy such that you foresaw that you were going to see such a nice pick-up in commercial?", "Steve G. Filton", "I guess a couple things, no, I do not think that there is a particular market that is really driving that and to be honest, I do not think it is Vegas.  I think if anything, Vegas may be a little bit lower than that largely because we saw such a large commercial shift in \u201907 in that market.  ", "But in the McAllen market, really just as an example, I think we are recapturing some of that commercial business that we have lost over the last few years and then in other markets, we are gaining as well.  I think when you talk about individual strategies, Gary, it is a lot of blocking and tackling.  I do not think it is the kind of thing that you sort of have an initiative and in one quarter you are able to increase that number.  I think it is the result of a lot of, we talked about in the first quarter, the things we have been doing in the last two, three, four years, I think are starting to bare fruition.  And I think we are benefiting from that.  ", "We are benefiting from being in some strong local markets as well.  We have always talked about that.  And we are also benefiting from being in and I think this is always a little different than the rural companies.  We are in markets where there is a lot of commercial payers and we are not reliant purely on Medicare and Medicaid.  But in south Florida and southern California, these are markets that have a very strong commercial bias and we have done well in those markets.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "You must really be.  I mean certainly nationally commercial admissions are not up anywhere close to six so you must really be taking share even in that commercial mix.  Just my last question, when you look at on the acute care side, I think the net revenue for just admission was up approximately 7% or somewhere around there presuming that commercial payers by and large pay you better rates than Medicare or Medicaid, have you attempted to kind of ballpark of the 7%?  2% of it is coming because commercial is growing six and Medicare is growing one?  Do you have a though of just how much that might be quantifying in that revenue for adjusted admissions growth?  ", "Steve G. Filton", "I do not have it at that level of precision, Gary.  I think in answering somebody\u2019s similar question before, I would say that we have identified probably three or four dynamics which we think are really bolstering that overall pricing.  I think it is the impact of MSDRGs.  I think it is just strong managed care contractual pricing.  I think it is just the payer mix as you just alluded to, and so I think it\u2019s all those things combined, but no, we have not necessarily attempted to kind of segregate each item and identify what its impact is.  ", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Okay, perfect thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James & Associates.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Steve, you have got to be worn out by now.  Just a couple of quick questions, a small company, PRSC, is having a tough day and they are talking about some of the things states are doing to cut costs.  Are you seeing anything other than just pure rate?  Are you seeing anything on the behavioral health side, vis-\u00e0-vis narrowing networks, reducing eligibility, reducing length of stay that is unusual at that state budget cycle?", "Steve G. Filton", "I would not describe it as anything unusual.  We may have mentioned in the first quarter some pressures here in Pennsylvania where the Medicaid program is sort of tightening their eligibility and their utilization to reduce length of stay and issues like that and we are responding to that.  I may have mentioned that.  I think in some cases we have just stopped taking some of these patients because the state is making it so difficult.  But overall, I would not say that the gross rate reductions that I mentioned before that we are seeing a pervasive initiatives on the part of the states to reduce spending.  ", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay, and my other question is if you look at uninsured and co-pay collection rates, have they stabilized?  Have they deteriorated with the economy?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think we are finding that collection rates have remained pretty stable at least for the last few quarters.  I think we have seen collection rates particularly on sort of the portion after insurance, the co-pays and deductibles over the last three or four years, they have declined some.  But I do not think in the last two quarters we have seen any material change.  ", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay, then I guess one other thing.  If you look at Vegas, forgetting kind of the unemployment rate, have you seen any projections about just the sheer number of employed people?  Even if the unemployment rate goes down, are the number of people with jobs going to continue to go up?  Have you seen any projections around that?", "Steve G. Filton", "I am not sure I have seen that specific data point, John, but to your point, unemployment\u2019s going up a little bit, but so is the number of people moving into the markets.  I am not sure that the amount of employed people has actually declined, but I have not actually seen that?", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Is that  the number we should look at is the number of people with jobs who have health insurance?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that is an important number.  I think if there are more people without health insurance, that is a challenge for us as well to the event that they present themselves in our emergency room or whatever, but your point is well taken.  I think if the number of people with jobs and with health insurance remains relatively steady that is an important metric as well.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "And as far as you know, is HCA still not back in the Sierra network?  You mentioned that last quarter, is that still?", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean there certainly not back in the Sierra network right now.  I cannot necessarily comment on whether there are any conversations about getting them back in, but they are definitely not in now.  ", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay, thank you.", "Steve G. Filton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we have Whit Mayo of Robert Baird.  You have an open line sir.  We will move to our next question.  I am showing that we have not further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton", "Okay, we would like to thank everyone for their time and we look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter.", "Operator", "Thanks for attending today\u2019s conference.

The company undertakes no obligation update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joey Jacobs.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks, Brent, and good morning. I am very pleased to report that we had another great quarter at Psychiatric Solutions, which follows our strong first quarter performance. Total revenues rose more than 28% for the second quarter driving an increase in adjusted EBIDTA of nearly 35% and growth in earnings per diluted share of more than 40%. Consistent with first quarter growth and same facility revenue of 7.7%. We produced a 7.8% increase in same facility revenue for the second quarter. We also continued to expand our profit margins through greater operating leverage and enhanced productivity. Our revenue growth was mainly driven the addition of inpatient beds including the impact from the Horizon Health transaction, which brought approximately 1600 beds to PSI in June 2007. We also purchased 5 facilities with more than 400 beds from United Medical Corporation in first quarter of 2008. And during the second quarter added a third EAP acquisition to the 2 we completed in the first quarter. Complementing the expansion of our beds through acquisition, we have added and will continue to add hundreds of beds in new and existing facilities. As of the end of the second quarter, we have completed more than 300 beds during 2008, and we expect to complete about 600 by year-end.", "We remain on track with this plan and expect to have them all operational by late 2008 or early 2009. The addition of new beds to existing facilities over the past year contributed to our substantial same facility revenue growth for the second quarter. In some cases, these beds enable us to serve patients who might otherwise have been turned away and in other cases the beds have enabled us to ramp up our initiatives in each individual facility to expand market share. Same facility patient days for the second quarter improved 2.7% from the second quarter last year, which is our second consecutive quarterly improvement, and revenue per patient day increased 5.1% consistent with comparable quarter growth in this measure for the first quarter. The additional same facility revenue drove further operating leverage within our same-facility base, which we also enhanced through ongoing programs to improve facility productivity and efficiency. As a result we have continued to expand our same-facility EBITDA margins, which increased to 170 basis points to 21.8% for the second quarter from the same quarter last year. We are pleased with this margin expansion since the Horizon facilities were included in our same-facility base for the first time for the month of June. This improvement is another indication of our ability first to acquire facilities in attractive markets and second to integrate them quickly in a relatively seamless fashion. As we make further progress, we continue to target long-term growth in our same-facility EBITDA margins of several hundred basis points. The expansion of our same-facility margins drove a 110 basis point increase in the EBITDA margin for all our facilities. PSI has consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins for the second quarter increased 34.7% to over $81 million or 18.1% of total revenue. Before closing my remarks, I will add that many of you are aware of the story that was published in a Chicago newspaper on July 17th about incidents that occurred in 2007 and 2006 at Riveredge Hospital. This is not the first story about incidents at one of our facilities and it won't be the last. So, I would like to share my perspective. First, these types of unfortunate incidents do occur in this patient population. Minimizing and eliminating these types of incidents is one of PSI's top priority. We take continuous improvement of quality, safety, and risk management very seriously and we have built a very effective infrastructure over the past several years. As a matter of fact at all in facilities we thoroughly report incidents to relevant agencies as soon as possible and work directly with agencies to continuously improve safety and quality in a timely manner. The incidents referenced in the newspaper story were reported to the relevant agencies and appropriate corrective actions were taken in 2006 and 2007.", "Second, it is also important to understand that we operate in a highly regulated industry with nearly continuous oversup [ph]. Our facilities are surveyed multiple times each year on average and less than 1% of these surveys result in serious deficiencies, a testament to our diligent efforts to continuously improve risk management, safety and quality. We are pleased with this track record in light of the fact that we are providing more than 2.7 million patient days of treatment annually. Just before the story was published the Department of Children and Family Services placed an admissions hold on Riveredge. Riveredge is currently in discussions with DCFS and expects to conclude those discussions soon. As a result, we don't expect a much adverse financial impact from the admissions hold.", "In closing, PSI continues to be well positioned in an industry whose key growth dynamics remain intact in spite of the challenging economic environment. Among those dynamics demand for inpatient psychiatric care continues to rise as evidenced by the expansion of the industry's patient days and revenue per patient day even in challenging economic conditions. In addition, capacity growth is limited and the industry remains highly fragmented. As a result of our skill and expertise we had an ongoing opportunity to expand our capacity to meet this demand and expand our market share. Our confidence in leveraging these opportunities lies in our proven business model, which has produced a strong long-term record of profitable growth and increased stockholder value. With a highly quality management team focused on the continued strong execution of this model we expect to expand both through additional acquisitions and through the development of beds in existing and new facilities. We are confident in our ability do drive enhanced profit margins through growth and same-facility revenues at a target rate of 7 to 9% annually. Thank you again for your time this morning and now Jack Polson, our Chief Accounting Officer will review our financial results in more detail.", "Jack Polson", "", "Thank you, Joey, and good morning. PSI\u2019s revenue for the second quarter increased 28.4% to $451 million from the second quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34.7% to $81.5 million or 18.1% of revenue from 17.2% for the prior year period.", "Income from continuing operations for the second quarter increased 44.2% compared to adjusted income from continuing operations for the second quarter last year, which excluded the loss on debt refinancing or earnings per diluted share on the same basis rose 40.5% to $0.52.", "Cash flow from continuing operations increased for the second quarter to $41.5 million, which is almost one and a half times our income from continuing operation. ", "Our maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $9.9 million or 2.2% of revenue and expansion and growth capital expenditures totaled $15.9 million or 3.5% of revenue.", "Based on our results for the second quarter and the prospects for the second half we have updated our guidance for earnings from continuing operations to a range of $2.02 to $2.03. As always this guidance does not include any impact from future acquisitions.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, please open the floor for any questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) We will go first to Adam Feinstein with Lehman Brothers.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay. Thank you. Good morning. A very strong quarter. Just a question on the quarter, then I want to ask on Riveredge. Maybe, just \u2013 you know, it looks like in terms of just length of stay, just want to see what is going on there in terms of, you know, the trend being down slightly, I know that is similar to what we saw in the back half of last year but just want to get any updated thoughts in terms of just patient mix and then a couple of follow up questions?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "In the second quarter the patient mix was more acute, Adam, versus RTC. But, I personally, this is just my opinion, I think the length of stay tracks at \u2013 maybe ticks back up a little bit as the Pines facility and some of the other RTC facilities ramped back up. So, it is pretty consistent you know, if you look at year-to-date and we are at we see nothing unusual there and also that we have bought more acute beds. The UMC transaction had more acute beds versus RTC beds versus the company's average.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay, great. And then with HORC moving into the same store, just curious in terms of how you think about that, I just wanted to get updated thoughts in terms of how those assets are doing. It seems like things are going very well but just wondering if you could just provide additional color there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We have done a terrific job with those facilities, Adam. And if you can see it in the metrics for the same store numbers in the second quarter. You know, there are in for one month. And so, we are very pleased with that. There is more work to be done with those facilities but we are very pleased both with that and with the unit management and EAP company. All three pieces of that business are doing well. There is more work to be done, but we are very pleased that the same store facility EBITDA margin is worth that and we have done a great job, knowing that HORC is really just 13 months old to us and ABS quite frankly is only 19 months old to us. So, bringing in a $0.5 billion of revenue into the company that was having historical lowered margins, we are very pleased with what operations has done.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay, great, and just on the Riveredge Hospital, maybe just comment a little bit more about just you know, what the impact has been since some of this noise first surfaced with the Chicago Tribune article, just to the extent you can provide any commentary I would appreciate it?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Adam, there is not lot more I am talk about it. You know, it did create noise for us and the article was visible enough, quite frankly, we expected that all parties whether it is the State of Indiana or joint commission or the department \u2013 DOJ we expect them to take a look in review and if they find something that we can improve on absolutely we will improve it. As I mentioned in the comments, these incidents actually occurred back previous years and we have made considerable improvement there and so we will get through this and as my comments mentioned we have weekly meetings with DCFS and we have got our fingers crossed here and if it was material we would disclose that. Right now we do not think it is. And they are working hard up there taking care of the patients and working through the process.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay, and then final question, I will get back on the queue here, maybe just if you guys can talk a little bit about your compliance program, just likewise some of these \u2013 in other words just be helpful to hear just about how you guys managed that. I don't know if you can provide any commentary but would like to hear more just in terms of your overall compliance program?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Sure, absolutely. Our compliance for us, we have 23000 employees. So, compliance for us starts at that single employee taking care of that single patient, and if the responsibility of the CEO at that facility to make sure there are in compliance and great quality there. We also have a risk management process improvement person in each facility and that is where we begin gathering data for the corporation both to our risk management department, which has I think about 10 employees and to our quality compliance department which has about 25 employees and we are capturing real-time incidents that might be occurring and especially if we internally classify it as a grave incident that is real time to us and that we immediately began a root cause analysis to either way we can improve the facility, improve the process there and it is \u2013 then the compliance quality department reports back to the board of directors, those two board members, Dr. Bill Petrie and Edward Wissing. That gets to see the value lines call the incident, what we are doing, how we are doing, and there is multiple indicators that we track real time for example, medication errors we track that real time, and so \u2013 and that is something we have really built over the past 3 years and we will continuously be putting more resources to that and unfortunately the story dealt with past years where we made processes improvements. You know, I am much more pleased about yesterday's email from one our facilities in Indiana, David Bell, they just went through their children services survey and quite frankly, score was quite frankly perfect. There was no point of plan correction needed for that facility. The state was very complimentary of their inspection and that is what we want them all to be and we are getting close but there is more resources, more work to be done. But internally, that is how we handle it, Adam; and we constantly are improving the safety looking at ways to improve the safety, quality, meeting standards and regulations.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "All right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", " We will go next to Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Good morning, thanks. Just couple of questions here, first, I guess if you could address cash flows seasonally it was a little weaker in the first quarter seemed to have bounce back nicely, any particular driver there in terms of working capital or how should we put that in perspective?", "", "Brent Turner", "", "Tom, this is Brent. This is just like clockwork. You know, first quarter for us due to the reason we talked about, the interest payment on our senior sub notes, is a little lower, but as you see in the second quarter strongly re-bounced, and you know if you look at our free cash flow right in line with our net income for the first half of the year. So, it is really nothing you need happening in the quarter just the normal recovery in the second quarter for us.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. The question that has gotten a lot of attention or an issue that has got a lot of attention, especially in the last week or so has been Medicaid, and I know you have addressed Medicaid at a high level in the past, maybe you can \u2013 can you talk a little bit more specifically, I know, a lot of states have it July or June fiscal year. So, we are just starting a fiscal year. What is on the table as far as your concern in key places and what percent of your business really is sort of locked up for the next 12 months given that sort of fiscal year timing?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "First, Tom, people need to keep in mind that even though we are only located in 31 states we are getting patients from more than 40 states. So, it is very diverse from a lot of states and that gives us protection. I think that will be probably be less than 7 states that probably haven't settled their Medicaid budgets for July 1, '08 going into '09. Some \u2013 there are few what have October 1 dates and there is a few that have lingered over from the July 1 date. As you can see, the revenue per day was 5.1% and you know that is nearly 3 years in a row that we have been able to average between 3 to 5%. We feel okay about what Medicaid has done overall for us, as you know, our internal goal there is a 2% to 4% increase for Medicaid from the state and we have seen states hold, we have seen states give us reasonable rates in that range of 2% to 4%. We have had some states give us more than 4% and quite frankly we have done good about any state wanting to cut our rates. So, right now we feel good. We do monitor it and we do have a process about where we keep up with all the states and, for example, I will just give one example, in the state of Indiana which in total, I think for their Medicaid population were total managed Medicaid first part of last year. This year we probably have averaged a little bit over 5% increase for them for this year. So, we feel good and as the ones that follow the company now, our real goal is to go revenue 7 to 9% and we get that from 2 places, patient days and pricing and in the early part of the company's history we got more from patient days than we did pricing. The last 2 or 3 years it has been more a little bit more pricing than patient days and I think you will see over the next 18 months \u2013 you could very well see patient days because of all the beds we built that patient days will continue to ramp up and it could be at their higher end of their range. So, we are very optimistic and comfortable with the Medicaid environment that we have today. You know, we watch it just like you all do and hope for no more surprises or reactions to that, and we hope the economy rebounds. So, that is where we are at.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, final question, I just wanted to come back to Riveredge briefly if I could, first, I think I recall that the same article had been mentioned that 2 state run facilities had been shut down. So, can you just sort of describe the market and what are the options there, relatively for people that are in your facilities?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, there is a shortage of beds in Illinois just like in many states across the country, and states have for the past 10 years been closing their own facilities, and so those patients are coming over to us. An example of that, a positive example of that is in the state of Illinois where we have opened up Lincoln Prairie in Springfield, Illinois. We opened that up, took our first patient in the mid-May but really started ramping up the center in June there and so that was an area that really, quite frankly had no psych services or very limited psych services and we are stepping in and meeting that need there. There is limited options in Chicago and so there is an acute shortage of psych beds, not only in Illinois but throughout the country, I think just about every time that when you pick up the paper or an industry paper they are talking about the shortage of beds.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, just to be clear of the focus of the matter is more about, I guess, the adequacy of control as opposed to whether the people should have been there, any sort of reimbursement related issues, is that right?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We think it is focused \u2013 it was focused towards those 3 incidents that they talk about concerning quality of those in the story. And so, it is \u2013 and we welcome them. We have taken action back in '06 and '07, but once again if they want to come in and take a relook at it that is okay with us.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "We will go next to Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Thanks for taking my call, wanted to ask on the 8-k filing from this morning, obviously \u2013 I don't know how much detail you will be able to provide at this point, but have your experienced similar types of requests directly from the Department of Justice or other state agencies in the past and how has that played out. So, what might we expect here?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, on the Department of Justice, we take that very seriously and there is absolutely no more comment I can make about that. And very limited more going forward about Riveredge. So, if you have got a Riveredge question you could very well get no comment here going forward. Absolutely, other states come and look at us constantly. As I mentioned earlier, states are constantly looking at us asking for information. Most of the time it is real time that. Back in 2006 and in 2007, the appropriate authorities were contacted and they came over whether it was the police or DCFS or licensing, joint commission and looked at us. So, that goes on, on a continuous basis. Today in PSI, we have 96 hospitals probably 8 of those, probably 8 facilities today we will have some sort of regulatory body and whether it is doing an annual survey at Valle Vista, which came up terrific or you know, looking at another facility that might have an issue. So, it is part of our business.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay, I think looking at the acquisition that you guys made the EAP, when did that occur in the quarter and what sort of revenue impact did that acquisition have this quarter and what might we expect it to have going forward?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It happened on April 1st, revenues quite frankly immaterial to the company, it was several million dollars, but you know \u2013 and we have got one more EAP acquisition that we made July 1st. And quite frankly that is end of acquisitions for this year and so I don't have any \u2013 ", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "On the EAP side?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "On the EAP side, and I don't have the details of the revenue with me.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "And on the facility based acquisitions, any commentary on the pipeline and pricing would be helpful?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "The pipeline looks good and pricing is appropriate to fit our model and just there is some information we said no to a couple of things during the second quarter. So, pricing is more disciplined, I think and are tighter and \u2013 but is busy, we are very busy. We are very busy looking at acquisitions.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "And then getting back to the state reimbursement, I mean, I guess there are 7 or 8 states that you said haven't settled their budgets yet. You know, it is likely that those are the states where you might most likely see some cuts though given that if they haven't settled them, probably they are having some issues. So, are you already making any cuts in those states in your 2% to 4% expectations?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes, absolutely. When we said that 2% to 4% expectations we are looking at 40 plus states and what will occur there. And so we will have to wait to see now once again people need to keep in mind that Medicaid to us in the child and adolescent population and if someone needs to cut their Medicaid budget many times unfortunately it is the adult that get cut. So, we are just going to wait and see but it is in our 2% to 4% and year-to-date I think we are at 5%. So, I think meeting \u2013 having the goal of 3 to 5% for this year is absolutely pretty good.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay, and no changes to your commercial expectations of 6 to 8%?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No not really. Just enough, you know, salary wages are going up 3 to 3.5% and you know, in supply costs, utility cost. So, we just want to be there.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "We will go next to Dawn Brock with JPMorgan.", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Hi, good morning guys. How are you?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Good.", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Great print [ph] last night. I think I've got a follow-up question to Tom\u2019s. Just the sustainability of the same store growth based on the current demand trends and you know, to Tom's question asking about Medicaid as well as the last time, are you seeing any flow or overflow from state run facilities that have added capacity or shutting down or do you anticipate will shut down and then generally just the demand picture overall?", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "First, yes we do. And I can give one good example of this is our facility in Raleigh, North Carolina. Holly Hill, I think it is approximately a 100 bed facility, we are adding 44 beds there, because the state is closing a hospital and they are in Wake county and the Wake county residents, the county commission there absolutely did the right things that we are going to take care of our Wake county residents and they worked with us on building the 44 beds knowing that some of the beds are going to be dedicated to the patients that would have been going to that state hospital and those beds will come online probably in the next 6 to 9 months there and absolutely that is prime example for the state I think is closing 3 and they built 2, but the private side of the business is absorbing the other patients. So that goes on throughout the country, but that is the first example that comes to my mind about that actually occurring and then the demand you know, we have built our beds, and if you go back, which I know most of you do, when you go back and look at the quarterly trends we trended up from the \u2013 well, the first quarter trended up from the fourth quarter last year, the second quarter trended up from the first quarter. I would expect that the third quarter would trend up from the second quarter even though it is our most seasonal quarter. We have good color, good visibility on July, and there is another 60 days to go with \u2013 you know, I have got my fingers crossed whether we trend up from the second quarter on patient days demand. Another example is we opened up 22 beds in our facility that needed those beds, brought them online and they ramped up rather quickly. So, we see demand for services and unfortunately in economic hard times there is more demand for services.", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Joey just taking that a little bit further, how are the economics, how do the economics work if you could as far as opening new beds at the point of where demand is, are you providing the supply where the demand is versus making an acquisition in that market. Can you just give us an idea of generally how much it costs to build a bed and will do that math on the acquisition side?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay, well let us take the example of Springfield. I think that cost us $170,000 a bed or roughly there. We opened it up in May. All our certifications and inspections were done by early June. They are now tripped over 30 patients a day. So, as I have told, many people \u2013 as when we bring on a new bed whether it is a de novo project or an expansion project we think the demand is there that after 12 months of operation is going to be over 70% occupied. So, and we see that occurring. So, and then if it is a freestanding bed. The one at Holly Hill is a little tougher building site there. I think those beds are a little bit over $200,000 a bed there, but prior to building the beds, we had negotiated rates with the county there. So, once again, we were comfortable about the revenue what we are going to get. The patient days that we were going to get there. So, that is kind of the process when we look at same store beds or we are adding to existing facilities or de novo projects. ", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Okay, excellent. And then lastly looking at length of stay kind of trending down a little bit. Can you just talk about the fact that you know, at least of peers as though, you know, with the volume being a little bit stronger the mix is definitely acute. Are you building more acute beds or RTC beds? Is seems although there are two?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Absolutely we are building more acute. Last time I looked at a number of things like 75% acute done, and 25% RTC. So, of the 600 beds that we are building I think it is 75, 25 roughly.

Few things here \u2013 I just wanted to just go back to Adam\u2019s question about your risk management function and Joey just wanting to get a little bit more commentary, I guess, it sounds like you have invested a lot of resources there and as you look at what you have been able to do, I guess, I am curious to know is there anything more than you were evaluating in terms of adding to that infrastructure, have you considered adding a medical director perhaps. I just want to get your sense on where you think that organization is going in the future?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We will add more resources, quite frankly, you know, I don't want to disclose all of the things we are going because other people are listening to our conversation but we are putting more resources. I have just approved an additional five FTEs to Kathy Bolmer\u2019s department and this is first something we're going to a little bit differently than they have in the past and what it does? It just gives us more insurance that we're picking up in all the indicators and that we're implementing corrections as soon as possible to the facilities, but once again quality care happens at the local level. Our expectation is that the CEO with our resources at the corporate office that they have good quality that they are in compliance with the state regulations. We put a lot of responsibility on the CEOs.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay that is great. And just a question that is a little further out there, as it relates to the joint commission\u2019s core measures that what I think is kind of going into place in October. Are you guys prepared to begin publishing your results on the seven core measures? I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you think you may start reporting them. I don't think CMS is requiring it but I don't know if you plan to take the lead on anything there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Dan that is one of the things we're looking at \u2013 we have some data that we can put out there on our web site so people could go to it we're thinking about that. We absolutely worked on the core measurements with the joint commission and we are going to be ready for those core measurements and that is something we might do to separate us and share more quality data on our web site. So, we're working through that as we speak but we're very pleased with the core measurements and endorse those and support those the industry does. So we are working through that.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. In just a couple more here.

Dan, I want us to trend up from the 2.7% patient day growth and the visibility for July, (inaudible) doing that. So, both Horizon and ABS, the UMC facility. We have three active construction projects that we're looking at for the UMC facilities that we bought back on March 1st.

We obviously we opened Lincoln Prairie during the quarter. So it kind of peaked for that facility and then later in the year you're going to see the opening of our Rolling Hills hospital here in Franklin.

First, EAP, it's hard to really sort out just the way it's growing up into one line, how all these acquisitions are contributing versus organic growth. Can you just give us some flavor for your organic growth in the EAP segment and then secondly can you give us some comment on your contract retention and kind of where you are now with \u2013 it seems that you've been able to maintain a similar lever of contracts where Horizon let off, but \u2013 I know, it's hard to really know for sure.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I will give you a little commentary here the EAP company is still under a run rate of $50 million in revenues. So, I did not know off the top of my head what the organic growth is. I do know on the management contract side because it is much bigger. Actually, Darren, I think as of June 30th we were up plus six contracts from the start of the year. So as I had mentioned on earlier calls, the unit management company has done a \u2013 Mike Sol [ph] and those guys have done a terrific job. Now we'll lose, we will not be as good in the third and fourth quarter on retention, but we could very well end up 2008 plus upside. We would have more contracts at the end of the year versus what we had at the beginning of the year.

Couple of quick macro questions up front, first I saw a special report on the AMA about a week ago calling for more of a focus on the psychiatric bed shortages and kind of a call for action to allow more construction there and I'm curious if you see any ramification for that in allowing your facilities to get a little bit easier licensure to start building beds or anything on the construction front that you think that can lead to?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I really don't. California is not going to change their rules. It takes two years to get you through the process. In Texas, where there is no ceilings, we can do that pretty easy in states. I'm glad they made \u2013 the awareness that there is a shortage of psych beds in psych services and that this illness needs to be treated exactly like any other illness. ", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, that's helpful color and then if we look at the Medicare physician fee fix, I know there is a little ad on with regards to mental health parity and taking on the copays and understanding Medicare is a big piece of your business. I am curious if you think that'll have any impact may be lowering your bad debt or helping on a little bit more in the Medicare front. Do you really see any changes with that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well changes to the outpatient \u2013 and as you know we do very little outpatient. What we are waiting is the big mental health parity bill to get passed which would really impact the inpatient. It is a slight positive to a \u2013 you know, I don't think I could even quantify what the impact would be to us. But it to be the slight positive to some of our facilities would benefit from that. But the big benefit is going to be broadly so mental health parity, mental health almost needs to be treated just like any other illness.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, good. Now a few more specific questions. I know on the last call you talked about a little bit about some of the efforts you're putting in place to control pharmacy costs more effectively this year, and I know that it just started at the time of the last call, but I'm curious if you could give us an update there. I think you had a target of trying to get to $3 million in annual savings, maybe how that is trending towards that level and what kind of progress you've seen? ", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It's off to a terrific start. Jack Crump is doing the super job for us. Like the management company he's probably going to exceed my expectations. He's off to a great start.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay great. And then in the quarter, I know that non acquisitions CapEx looks like about $25 million, is there any new facilities, is there some land in there, is that Springfield coming in there, any color on what was involved in those investments during the quarter? ", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Sure, Ryan. That is going to be a combination of finishing of the Lincoln Prairie facility, but also we are doing expansions as well as the Rolling Hills facility is well underway on its construction phase. So, just a combination of the expansion and a couple of the de novo construction projects.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, great. And then last question I guess it is for you Brent, I know LIBOR rates have come up, a little bit of a slug since the last quarter and with your floating rate data, I am curious if the impact of those rising rates is in your updated guidance , are you kind of buffering a little bit higher interest costs then we may have thought last quarter?", "Brent Turner", "", "Well, of course, we tried to have the conservative outlook across all of the business, but certainly you know there is a chance that the interest rates could start rising in the second half and so LIBOR right now for us are all in revolver is around 4.25% on that side. So, we certainly were conservative in looking ahead with the uncertainty around just the interest rate environment.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, and one quick follow-up, any thoughts given more to fix that given the fact that you know we may see these increases, have you thought about fixing that or are you still onto flexibility for pay downs?", "Brent Turner", "We think with the roughly 60% of our debt currently fixed and 40% floating, we we're comfortable with the risk benefits to that mix, because we're going to continue to enjoy the floating before anything changes. So, we think that is the right mix for our balance sheet really going forward.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, great, thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "", "We will go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Hi, good morning.

Between the Pines and Manatee, how much of an affect there was this quarter?", "Brent Turner", "", "No, I don't. Manatee wouldn't impact us at all because we took it out of \u2013 it goes back in the same store numbers this quarter. The Pines \u2013 no, I don't know that number John, but it did hurt, it probably hurt us probably I would estimate 10 to 20 basis points maybe.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Okay, so not a big number, okay. Then, I know you talked about Medicaid but if you have to guess today your overall Medicaid book you think it'll be I mean the same budget most of them are July 1 to June 30th. If you look it over the next twelve months is that a flat to up number, is that a up number, if you had to guess what does your kind of overall Medicaid pricing look like and we know California today the court is not going to stop the 10% cut, so I don't know if you factored that in. but what does that look like?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "If we were to take all the Medicaid increases that we've got this year and kind of normalize them, annualize them, I don't like to do that.

Remember, once again, our children that we take care of under Medicaid, you know, once again that criteria would not get those kids. History of positive \u2013 we talked about mental health parity but probably that is going to occur you know if the Democrats take over the Presidency.

Have you seen any step up in inpatient bed closures in your market?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes, we\u2019ve seen bed closures.

I guess the one everybody knows about is Risperdal. It is one off, I think, and so it is less than $100,000, I think, but more than 50.

What we do expect is for that occupancy after one year to be back to where it was if not better. So, we will catch it monthly, and we will catch it a year from now, but as far as putting all those beds together in a basket and monitoring that we did not.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And on the Pines, I got your comment and your anticipation census is building to be same store positive in 3Q, can you give us a ballpark on where occupancy is at that facility now, I think it has come down and presumably it is coming back up?

The facility in the fourth quarter actually average dropped down below 190, was in the 180s. Probably in the beginning of the second quarter it was in the high 90s slipping into the 200's, it is now slipping into the 210s, we hope by the 220s, 30s maybe by the end of the third quarter. So those lines cross in this quarter about where last year it was going down and now this year it is coming across, but when you get to the fourth quarter, I think the Pines actually averaged right now 190 patients a day, may be a little bit less. This year obviously we're hoping that our plans work and that they could have a census of 220, 230 there, and they would also have the opportunity next year Gary at this facility. It is a very large facility. They have the opportunity next year to add 50 patients a day to that facility. So obviously next year we will \u2013 you know, we will be looking for them to continue to grow.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And that is helpful. On Horizon, obviously those margins have come up since the acquisition given what your same store margins looks like now, what is going to lift Horizon, is that just continuing to build up the referral base and driving the revenue and census there?

The remaining facilities, they have the same expectations as any facility in this company is, your revenue should be growing 7% to 9% and patient day should be growing 3% to 5% and pricing should be 3 to 5, and so we're building beds for those facilities. So there's probably two to three of those facilities where there is some more immediate upside if we execute real well there. And then on the other ones, it is \u2013 there in the family now and they are in the family of same store facilities and we expect them to act like the ABS facilities or The Brown School\u2019s facilities or the (inaudible) facilities.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "My last question, you know, I appreciate the comments you made about the corporate risk management structure and also how much you rely on the local CEOs, and I want to give you a chance to respond to me, kind of the short story or the negative story on the company as you have grown so fast that you have lost span and control and the qualities issues are systemic because of the growth, and so you know we've talked to some referral sources. We don't believe that is true and I think obviously your volume growth might indicate that is not systemically true, but can you talk about how you incentivize those local CEOs for quality, you know, and risk management. Is there any part of their comp that is tied to it, I am sure it is part of the reviews, but anything you can add on what you do to incentivize them, I think, might be helpful to both?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Gary, first absolutely the incentive plans have 20% allocated over to that. And there's probably less than \u2013 there is a handful of facilities that for some reason, you know, we're not in a newspaper business, and for some reason the local newspaper wants to continue to write stories about that facility and you know I have seen \u2013 went all the way back to 1991. In 1991 as with HCA and the central group taking care of Med/Surg Hospitals, you know we bought the facility in 2005 and we made a lot of improvements there? Yes. You know, I wish I could raise the past that they keep bringing up in the stories, and those stories \u2013 in the Chicago, those were 2006 and 2007 incidents and the quality is better there, and the management team is better there, and will continue to get better, and unfortunately we take care of very difficult patients and, you know, I want them all not to have incidents, but some of the incidents will occur and we do our level best to go back and put the resources back to correct it. But as far as noise from the (inaudible) or a negative newspaper article, as I mentioned earlier, we could have one today or we could have one 30 days from now. If somebody wants to write a story about us, but I know the heart of PSI, I know the intent of PSI from my position all the way down to the mental health tech or the dietary employee. We want to take care of our patients and keep them safe, and that's our goal. But when you're taking care of today, we will take care of between the management company and our own facilities today we will take care of probably 9,000 patients, and I want everyone of them to be safe. And that is the reason why I'm so much personally involved in getting resources and I mentioned earlier, we're hiring five employees to embark on a new initiative and we're going to just see how that works. So, as you know, it's top of mind for me. If you follow the company and someone asks you says, Joey what do you worry about? I'll worry about our 9,000 patients today, and one of our employees is taking care of them and taking good care of them, but will those incidents occur, yes. Now from the risk management side, when you take up these incidents and put them through the actual our own process and through our risk management we have great results there.

Can you give us more enlightenment there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "A lot of it is state specific.

There is not a standard there. States are much different from state to state to state but we are in compliance with those states on reporting. We know when to report, how to report, and also PSI captures incidents that you don't report. We are looking for minor incidents. We want to fix those so those don't become major incidents. So, for PSI, we capture much more than we actually have to report, but we do diligently report anything that an agency needs to see.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "", "Can you talk about it at all in the paper or in the article about Riveredge, there was an allegation or there were allegations if the appropriate authorities were not notified in an appropriate and timely manner, could you comment about that at all?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I would just briefly \u2013 and then I do know how many more people are out here for questions. This is the last one on Riveredge. In Chicago and in Indiana they had set up a crisis hotline, and if something occurs you call this hotline you report it. Sometimes, we additionally call you know the agency itself directly but the procedure is you call the hotline and report it and that is supposed to notify. It's a great concept and just like 911 is a great concept, but sometimes you know everything doesn't go well or maybe we didn't fail to report something. I'm not saying about this case, and just talking generically, but we think we have reported appropriately and the intent was to absolutely to always report and then when you're dealing with a child or an adolescent, you know you take the patient's well being into effect. Sometimes, you know, you take that into effect and it is dealing with the social worker, the referring agency, and the fire department or the police department, whatever you work together for the betterment of that child, and you look for the best outcome there, but it varies. And that is the last about the article.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "", "One last question and then I'll hop off. In terms of the acquisition environment, the UHS commented that they have seen some new players with some new funding coming into market and I wondered if you have seen any of them in any of the deals you have looked at and possibly you noted things, you refused some?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think that is old information.

In the second quarter we were notified that in Puerto Rico one of juvenile justice facilities there that came through the ABS acquisition, we thought the Prax [ph] facility was the leased facility, but that program was rolled back into the Puerto Rican government operations, so that \u2013 the patient day changed there. We lost that facility more of a juvenile justice management contract in a facility that we owned/leased and that impacted the patient days in the second quarter and actually year-to-date. ", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Looks like the revenue for patient days there was pretty low though, so it is not a huge? ", "Brent Turner", "", "That is right. That is not the core psychiatric inpatient hospitals that we run, but we do have capabilities there and have other places like that but there are much lower revenue per day.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay, and then just finally on the last earnings call we talked about increasing demand for services to treat military personnel returning from abroad. I know you guys have had some discussions with the government and with the bases located near some of your facilities. Can you give us an update on kind of how those are progressing and will you have to build even more beds in some of these markets to meet that potential demand here over the next couple of years?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "The most recent in example of this is that we did build beds in Virginia and we have opened up that military program for them. So that is the most recent example. I know that our facilities where bases are located are looking at this but the one that is real time now online is what we have done in Virginia and we're very pleased with that. It is going to be highlighted in our company newsletter that we send out, and this program and what they've done there. We know there's a lot of need there, so we're looking at that.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Great, thank you guys, great quarter.", "Operator", "", "We have time for one final question, which is a follow-up from John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Hi, my question has been answered. You are free to go.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks, John, (inaudible). Before we close, there are 23,000 employees in this company that work very, very hard today and I want to thank them. I want to thank David Bell and his team, Jeff Caplan [ph] from Gulf Coast was back here today and he had a great \u2013 does a great job, him and his team. But Riveredge, Carey and the folks up there, we are behind you and have all the resources of the company, and we will get through this and thanks for all you are doing. Thanks for taking care of our patients and their families and we want to be perfect and have good outcomes. Thanks.", "Operator", "", "This does conclude today's call.

J. Rice. - Merrill Lynch", "Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "Dawn Brock - JP Morgan Securities", "Operator", "I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services third quarter 2008 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you. Good morning. I am Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is traveling this morning, and due to some logistical difficulties could not join us. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income per diluted share of $0.73 for the quarter, representing a 14% increase over the adjusted net income per diluted share earned during the third quarter of 2007, as calculated on the supplemental schedules included with last night\u2019s press release. We earned $3 per diluted share during the nine months ended September 30, 2008, representing a 29% increase over the adjusted net income per diluted share earned during the first nine months of 2007.", "During this conference call, I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.", "I would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. Revenues for the third quarter increased 7% over the prior year's quarter. Exclusive of the impact of new facilities, most notably Centennial Hills in Las Vegas, and the revenues related to a construction management contract, revenues have increased by 5%.", "On a same-facility basis in our Acute Care division, revenues increased 2.5% during the third quarter of 2008. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.7% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. Admissions to our hospitals-owned for more than a year were down 0.8% for the quarter.", "In the Las Vegas, Nevada market, although the opening of the Centennial Hills has negatively impacted our same-store admissions comparisons to the extent it cannibalized some volume from our existing facilities, the better than expected operating results at Centennial Hill, contributed to a greater than 10% increase in total admissions in the market during the third quarter of 2008, over the comparable quarter of 2007.", "In addition, as we have previously disclosed, newly constructed capacity at the physician-owned in McAllen, Texas; opened during the fourth quarter of 2007, unfavorably impacting our admissions in that market.", "We define operating margins as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenues. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our Acute Care hospitals decreased to 11.8% during the third quarter of 2008 from 12.6% during the third quarter of 2007. The margin decline resulted primarily from the slightly negative admission growth, and increases in uncompensated care expense.", "Our Acute Care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $154 million and $148 million during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. Even adjusting for certain re-classes between charity care and other discounts, the percentage of net revenue, bad debts, charity expense and the uninsured discount in the third quarter were at levels higher than those we experienced for the third quarter of 2007.", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 9.5% during the third quarter of 2008. This increase resulted from increased patient volumes and an increase in revenue per adjusted patient day.", "Admissions to our Behavioral Health facilities owned for more than a year increased 8.5% during the third quarter, and patient days increased 3.9%. Revenue per adjusted day rose 5.3% during the third quarter of 2008 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our Behavioral Health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 23.7% during the quarter ended September 30, 2008, as compared to 22.3% during the comparable prior year period.", "Our cash flow from operating activities was approximately $197 million during the third quarter of 2008, as compared to $164 million in the third quarter of 2007.", "At September 30th, 2008, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 38% and the ratio-to-debt to EBITDA was 1.69. We spent $84 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter. Included in our capital expenditures were the equipment costs related to the new 165-bed Centennial Hills Hospital in Las Vegas that opened in January, and construction costs related to a new 171 bed hospital in Palmdale, California that is scheduled to be completed and opened in 2009.", "In Las Vegas, we are also underway with a major bed tower expansion of our Summerlin Hospital and in California; we are in the process with a major expansion of emergency room, imaging and women's services to our Southwest Health Care campuses in Riverside County, California.", "I am pleased to answer questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Adam Feinstein.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Just, maybe to starting with Las Vegas, I assume I heard that the numbers that you highlighted before, as you said with Centennial Hills but to a 10% increase in total volumes but on a same-store basis. I just wanted to make sure, I got the right number?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I didn\u2019t give the same-store number but on a same-store basis the Vegas admissions were up modestly better than our overall Acute Care performance but, obviously still depressed somewhat by the Centennial cannibalization.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "As we think of that kind of EBITDA growth or EBIT growth for Vegas, just wanted to figure out if margins moved higher in other quarter? So if admissions were up slightly was EBITDA up slightly as well?", "Steve Filton", "No I think, over all profitability was relatively flat meaning that their operating margins were down slightly. I think as we would expect with the opening of the Centennial, clearly our operating margins in Vegas prior to the opening of Centennial were better than our average Acute Care operating margins. Once Centennial opens, even though Centennial was very slightly EBITDA positive in the third quarter, it clearly drags the margins of the market down.", "Again, I think those are dynamics that we saw when we opened Spring Valley in late 2004 or  2003, I'm not remembering exactly, but I think what we saw is within four or five quarters of its opening its margins and the margins of the market got back to normalized level and we would expect the same with Centennial early in 2009.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. All right and just one more question on Vegas. Clearly it seems like you guys are holding a pretty well even with the economy being some what tough out there. So it seems like your market share growth is not really helping.  What else are you guys doing out there? Are there opportunities to cut costs? Are there still some pricing opportunities? Curious as how you guys are thinking about weathering the storm in terms of how we should think about that important market?", "Steve Filton", "I mean in fairness, Adam, I don't know that we are doing, our approach in Las Vegas is wholly different and then it is everywhere else. Our volumes as we discussed with your sort of opening comments and questions are actually holding up fairly well. So, it's difficult to cut expenses in a very significant way.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Sure.", "Steve Filton", "We are seeing, again as we have seen throughout the portfolio, little bit in the third quarter, some incremental decline in payer mix quality. There's not a ton that we can do about that, beyond what we are already doing in terms of upfront collections etcetera.", "So, I mean the interesting dynamics in Vegas are all negative statistics. It's leading the nation and foreclosure rates, unemployment is higher than the national average, but the absolute amount of employed people in the market has remained relatively steady, which mean that, I think people continue to move into the market, perhaps not at the same rate as was happening a year ago, but there's definitely a positive population growth factor in the market, and I think that's helping us support overall volumes.", "As I said earlier, I mean I think we'll benefit just as Centennial continues to ramp up, its margins will improve to market wide margins as we experienced with Spring Valley, and I think that will all be helpful as that occurs.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. My final question just on the psychiatric side, things were very strong on the quarter. Just curious to get your thoughts in terms of what was driving that and how much of a benefit you guys would have received in the quarter from new beds?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, actually, the amount of incremental new beds in the quarter was relatively small. We don't add beds ratably, so we had a fair amount, a couple hundred added in the first half of the year, not too many in the third quarter. We'll add some more in the fourth quarter. But we are still benefiting from beds that have been added over the last few years, and again, we had 9.5% same-store revenue growth.", "We have talked about a sustainable number being in the 6% to 8%. So obviously, we are exceeding our own expectations there. At those levels we would expect and we did improve margins. I think if we continue to sustain that kind of growth for even a couple of quarters we'll continue to expand margins.", "Demand in that business continues to grow. Pricing holds steady. Probably the single greatest risk in the behavioral business is the threat of Medicaid price reductions investment in various states. We have seen some already, but obviously even to the degree we have seen some, our pricing is holding up fairly well. Results in that business, I would say, seem to be proving to be if not recession proof, certainly fairly recession resistant.", "Adam Feinstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate the detail.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Lake.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Thank, good morning. Just a couple of questions on the volumes first. Steve, can you f walk us through the trajectory of volume growth, monthly for the third quarter and then maybe give us an update on October?", "Steve Filton", "I think as we had discussed in various conferences, etcetera during the quarter before our quiet period, it was a little bit of a volatile quarter. It started off in a fairly, normal way in July. August volumes were quite weak. I don't know if that was a function and just of the calendar, but then volumes rebounded in September, and finished as you can see obviously slightly down from where we were in the first half of the year but not terribly off.", "October also started off a little bit soft, but seems to be strengthening as the month goes on and my sense is we'll finish October with same-store volumes, that are relatively as good as if not a little better than the third quarter comparisons.", "Let me just make a couple of comments. I think we touched on this before. We've disclosed previously that we've seen a significant decline in volumes in the  McAllen market mostly OB related volumes since the fourth quarter of '07.", "We attribute somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points of overall volume decline to that change. That change will anniversary at the end of the third quarter and so we'll get back to the same-store numbers in the McAllen market beginning in the fourth quarter.", "And then the Centennial cannibalization, we estimate its worth about 50 basis points. So our general sense is that rather than a 0.8% decline that we report, actual admission growth throughout the portfolio is more like 1.5% or so for the quarter, Which is still a little bit less than it was in the first half of year but not really too bad. I think once we anniversary McAllen in next quarter and we anniversary Centennial in the first quarter of '09, we will start to get back to hopefully the 2% to 3% same-store admission growth that we have really kind of been basing our models on.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "That's helpful. And can you kind of walk us through the inpatient volumes by payer type which was a big help in the first half of the year and may be moderate it a little bit. Can you just give us those numbers volumes by commercial versus Medicare, Medicaid and uninsured?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So we discussed, I think in fairly a great detail in the first two quarters, that one of the things that drove our outsize and better than expected performance in the first half of the year was the fact that our commercial volumes were rising faster than our overall volumes and our uninsured volumes in the first half of the year were rising a little slower than overall volumes.", "I think what we saw in the third quarter was a bit more of a reversion of all volumes to the mean; and all of our volumes seem to sort of track fairly consistently. So Managed Care volumes were going up at about the same rate as overall volume, uninsured were going up at about the same rate. As a result, you can see that clearly in the decline in revenue per adjusted admission was down to 3.7% from a number that was in the 6% to 7% range in the first half of the year.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Steve, what does that mean for next year? Can you give us an idea of what we think about '09 and its little early to give guidance, but with all of those, with little benefiting  in the first quarter and first half benefiting significantly from what seems like a significant payer mix shift to the positive. Can you give us an idea of what kind of headwind that will create as far as earnings growth for the first half of '09?", "Steve Filton", "When I think that, we have sort of thought about our Acute Care model for some time now. The sustainable model being same-store admission growth in the 2% to 3% range and same-store pricing growth in the 4% to 5% range and obviously I think that $64,000 question for us and for the industry is to what degree those metrics might be impacted by deepening recession. Will we see lower commercial volumes? Will we see more uncompensated care? Will we see so more uncompensated care? Will we see some greater pressure on elective or discretionary procedures?", "I think that we saw incremental effects of that in the third quarter, but not terribly significant and to be honest, part of why we don\u2019t normally give guidance during this quarter. We normally give this in our fourth quarter call. But partly why we wouldn't do it in this year is trying to get a better sense of really how confident we are in those metrics that I just outlined and how much we think it is likely that they will be affected by the overall and overarching economic conditions.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Okay. Just a last question on cash flow, I think you bought back a lot or paid down a lot of debt in the quarter. But given where the stock is now versus where it was in the third quarter, can you give us an idea of what your capacity would be as far as share repurchases and what you are thinking there as far as how aggressive you want to be once, and let us know when the window opens for you to start buying back again? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I do - I will make one point as somebody did ask me this question earlier today about why we were not more active acquirers of our own stock in the third quarter. And I just reminded somebody that when we entered our quiet period in mid September our stock was trading in the mid-60s. So, over the last six weeks as our stock valuation has declined considerably along with everybody else, we have been unable to buy shares because we were in our quiet period.", "Our quiet period will end two days after the press release. We certainly have not made any commitments about how we are going to spend our free cash, but we do have slightly less than 4 million shares under previous buy-back authorizations. With our stock trading, depending on how you want to look at it, but somewhere in the 4.5 to 5 times EBITDA range. I would say that it is hard to imagine.", "We will find a lot of other opportunities to buy other earnings streams at more economic prices. So, certainly share buy-backs are going to be something we are going to look at and consider very carefully in the fourth quarter and going forward.", "Justin Lake - UBS", "Great. Thanks a lot, Steve.", "Steve Filton", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Gallucci.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. First, Steve, I guess I'm not sure if I missed it there, but did you comment on guidance at all?", "Steve Filton", "No, we did not mention guidance in the press release. I thought that it was made clear that we were simply reiterating the guidance that we've given at the end of the second quarter, but I'm glad you asked the question because clearly some people were a little confused. So, we are simply reiterating the guidance we have given at the end of the second quarter which was 380 to 390 for 2008.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "You can never be too careful in this market. So, obviously relative to consensus you were a little bit lower in the quarter, can you comment at all how you were versus your internal budget in the quarter and thinking and sort of how you are think about the fourth quarter then as a matter of perspective?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean again, before our quiet period began in mid September and a couple of times that we spoken, the third quarter we obviously note that we don't give quarterly guidance but intimated that our own internal projections were generally lower than the street in the third quarter and higher than the street in the fourth quarter. We actually met and frankly exceeded our third quarter internal expectations by a couple of pennies and again to be purposely honest with you I have not checked recently given all of the volatility, but at least a month ago or so our own internal expectations for the fourth quarter were a little higher than the streets.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. On Medicaid you mentioned before, obviously there's some risk there given state economies. Can you talk about anything that's on the table right now in the states that are meaningful to you and maybe also remind us in order of magnitude what the couple of top states are in terms of your Medicaid exposure specifically?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. Well I think the good news is that our state with the number one Medicaid exposure is Texas. It is primarily acute care exposure in that state. The good news is that amongst the 50 states, Texas is generally ranked among the highest in terms of its economic performance and lowest in terms of budget pressures and budget shortfalls.", "Texas has talked little about needing to do any budget cutbacks and in fact while we haven't seen our Medicaid rates and disproportionate in dollars finalized for the fiscal year beginning that actual began in September of 2008. Our general sense is that we are doing pretty well and we'll do pretty well from a Texas Medicaid perspective.", "The states that follow that in order of exposure or maybe not necessarily exactly in this order but California, Florida, Nevada, every one of those states has implemented Medicaid cuts, all I think in July of '08. We have commented before that each of those states have an impact,  the cuts in each of those states have an impact of a couple of million dollars a year annually each.", "At least California and Nevada have talked about going back and having special legislative sessions and taking another crack at further budget cuts, presuming that, again their order in the same order of magnitude, you have a sense of how meaningful that is to us.", "Obviously, we have a lot of Medicaid exposure in a lot other states. Most of the other states its behavioral exposure. There have been a lot of states that have looked at their Medicaid budgets. Some have implemented cut backs. I don\u2019t think anywhere else that is either had Medicaid cut backs or contemplating them will prove to be individually material.", "Obviously, from a cumulative perspective if 25 states go back and cut Medicaid pricing, it\u2019s likely to have an impact on us, but not in sort of way that if Texas went and implemented a 10% Medicaid reductions.", "Tom Gallucci - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks a lot, Steve.", "Steve Filton", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, morning. So, just going back to the pricing, you mentioned obviously a big drop off on the Acute Care side of the business and you talked a little bit about payer mix contributing to that decline or that deceleration. Can you maybe just talk about acuity mix in the quarter if there's anything there?", "Steve Filton", "Ralph, I think our acuity mix has been pretty stable and as we looked at it in the third quarter it seemed to be within about a hundred or two hundreds of where it has been running in the first six months. So we are not sensing any significant change in acuity.", "Ralph Giacobbe- Credit Suisse", "So, I think for the first half of the year it was up a couple of percentage points in terms of the acuity mix.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah.", "Ralph Giacobbe- Credit Suisse", "So that sustained in the third quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Well, it is like my same comment about payer mix. I think you kind of reverted back to the mean in the third quarter maybe dropped down those couple of hundred of points  that we saw rise in the first-half. It dropped a little, back down to sort of where we have been running in the third quarter, but nothing terribly material.", "Ralph Giacobbe- Credit Suisse", "Okay. Was there any material hurricane impact for the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "No. I mean we had a few hurricanes come by in  facilities in Florida and Texas. I don't think that certainly in any one market it was material, probably measured more in the hundreds of thousands, rather than millions of dollars and even cumulatively I would have to say I don't think it was material.", "Ralph Giacobbe- Credit Suisse", "Okay. Then just in terms of going back to the margins, same-facility margins obviously saw a little bit of a decline both sequentially and year-over-year. I guess, is there something that we should think about that maybe skewed that number or is this, is that the type of sort of margin we should expect if volumes sort of maintain in kind of a flattish range?", "Steve Filton", "I think it is absolutely the function of having same-store acute revenue rise by 2.5%. I think it is very difficult to have margin expansion at those levels. I think our hope as we move forward is that both volumes and payer mix could improve a little bit.", "Again back too the metrics, I think, I outlined when in answering Justin's question before. I think it will level of say 2% to 3% same-store admission growth, which is a level we've sustained for most of the last four, five years, and 4% to 5% pricing growth, which again is a level that we've sustained for most of the past four, five years.", "I think we ought to be able to have margin expansion or certainly keeping margins at least steady. I think the reason you didn't see it in the third quarter was we fell short of both those metrics by at least just a little bit.", "Ralph Giacobbe- Credit Suisse", "Okay. My last one. Going back to sort of use of cash, it sounds like share repurchase would be a top priority if the shares held in at these types of levels, but I think last quarter you talked about \u2013 you were talking more about acquisitions and there was a sort of fairly large number of players out there looking to acquire. My guess is that number is significantly down now. Can you maybe talk about if you have seen anything, maybe early but in term of where valuations are out there in terms of acquisitions? How much that dried up just given the market?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean, I think you captured our mood correctly Ralph. We were fairly active acquirer of our own shares in the first quarter of this year, and then after that we said, we were going to take a breather and take a look at the M&A market. We certainly were conscious of the fact that credit markets were tightening at that point. We thought that being as to how we are, we were in pretty good shape and that the tightening of the credit markets would cause not-for-profits to struggle a little more than they have been over the last few years, and would cause them perhaps to think more about potential sale alternatives. It would eliminate some of our more highly levered competitors from participating in that M&A process, which has been fairly competitive over the last few years.", "The reason, I am a little less enthusiastic about those opportunities today is obviously public valuations of hospital companies which have come down dramatically, and my experience in history shows that those sorts of changes in valuation don't necessarily percolate their way to the not-for-profit sector quite as quickly.", "I am just guessing and it is purely a guess at this point that there's going to be  an expectation gap between what sellers think their EBITDA streams are worth as they go to sell them and what we or others might be willing to pay and so that\u2019s why, I suggested in a response earlier that at 4.5 or 5 times EBITDA, at least in my own mind, its going to be hard for us to find other opportunities, again more attractive or more compelling than our own shares.", "Ralph Giacobbe- Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "We are certainly open to it, but -- and that's just my gut reaction.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mathew Borsch.", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "Hi. This is Shelly Knoll on for Matt Borsch, just a quick question, Steve if I could on Las Vegas. Can you confirm that you are taking market share from your competitors in Las Vegas or what is driving the 10% growth?", "Steve Filton", "Well, yes, Shelly, I think clearly, there is publicly reported data out there. I am sure there are a number of sources we use in Telemed data and I think the Telemed data shows that we took a significant amount of market share when Sierra terminated their contract with HCA back at the end of 2006. I think even since then we've really seen our market share continue to increase, obviously a little bit more incrementally, but every quarter since then we have continued to take additional market share. Now the gap which for many, many years was very small between our market share and HCA, is now probably a good 10 percentage points.", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "And do you see that opportunity continuing to present itself,  can you see further market share from here?", "Steve Filton", "You know, again I think that the growth of Centennial and the continued ramp up of Centennial will help us. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are doing some major expansion, the third major expansion of our Summerlin facility in its ten-year history. I think volumes at Summerlin at the moment are depressed a little bit because of all of the construction activity on the campus, but I think it will l be helpful.", "I mean, think essentially we're really doing all of the capacity expansion in the market and so I do think that will help us to at least try and increase our market share. Obviously our competitors are certainly going to work hard to keep market share but I do think we are very well positioned in the market.", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Just one follow-up if we think about margin expansion or pressure. If we do see admission slow down from here, can you talk a little bit about fixed versus variable cost especially in the SG&A and other operating expense line?", "Steve Filton", "Again Shelly, I think that we run what is largely a fixed and semi-fixed cost business. And so like in the first half of the year we saw the positive leverage that one gains from that when you have same-store revenue growth in the Acute division in the sort of 65 to 7% range and in the Behavioral division at the 8% to 9% range. You saw how much operating leverage there is in the first half of the year with expanding margins etcetera.", "In fairness, you have the same dynamic working the other way. If you can't have some modest same-store admission growth and some descent pricing growth, which is not generally been a challenge in the last few years, you're going to have trouble. We certainly have efforts underway at every one of our hospitals that is facing some either volume or payer mix softening, to look at any cost that we can to reduce or try and eliminate.", "But in fairness it is not like we have a universe of variable costs that can easily be cut. There's a certain amount of supply costs that is easily associated with every incremental patient and there's a small amount of salary expense, that's clearly incremental but after that it becomes a lot more challenging.", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erik Chiprich. Your queue line is open.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Just want to see, if you could, give the breakdown on the $154 million, how much was charity care and versus the uninsured discount?", "Steve Filton", "I will find that. If you have any other questions want to go ahead.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "I sure do, thanks. I was curious on the pricing side, can you talk a little bit about managed care rate, renegotiations? What percentage is done for 2009? When does 2010 start and what kind of rates are you seeing or would you expect to see?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. Well, a couple of things. I think that the vast majority of our contracts for 2009 are fixed at this point. I am guessing, I don't actually have the information in front of me but I am guessing somewhere between probably a quarter and third of our rates for 2010 are fixed.", "I think from a managed care pricing perspective, the environment remains very positive, we've talked about getting managed care pricing rates in the 6% to 8% range for some time now and I think we'd been on the high-end of that range for a while now, and again, I don't necessarily see that changing as we move forward.", "I certainly think that managed care companies will attempt to control utilization and reduce medical costs in other ways, but I think pure contractual pricing is not likely to be a pressure point. Let me also just give you those numbers while I have them in front of me Eric. So charity care for the quarter was $123 million, and the uninsured discount was $31 million.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit on the supply expense as a percent of revenue that looks like that was flat year-over-year. And I think, you guys have entered into a new group purchasing agreement. I want to see if there's still room for savings there or kind of what was offsetting that in the quarter if acuity was kind of holding steady?", "Steve Filton", "We entered into a new group purchasing organization arrangement in April of 2008. I think we have benefited from that to the tune of probably a couple of million dollars in each of the second and third quarters. As I look at operating expenses broadly, meaning salaries, supplies, other operating expenses in the third quarter, exclusively of bad debt expense they rose about 3.5% per day. And I think that's pretty good.", "And I don't know that we can do a whole lot better than that. So, this sort of gets back to Shelly's previous question,  the reality is the way you get operating leverage is with more volume a little better pricing but in term of sort of absolute costs, 3.5% per day increase in cost is going be hard to better.", "Erik Chiprich - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. That's helpful. Just one last bigger picture question. I was wondering if you can just discuss what is different in this recession versus the last recession in your opinion that would make volumes fall greater or be more resilient?", "Steve Filton", "Well, first of all, Erik I mean you are asking me to be smarter than most in terms of telling you exactly what this recession is going to be like. I certainly am not sure that I am nearly that smart. I would say though the one difference that I see, between this and the recession in 2000-2001, is that in those intervening five or six years from a hospital provider perspective, we've seen a dramatic decline in the number of people who have health insurance through their employer.", "Either there are far less people who have it through their employer and those that have it, certainly have responsibility for a much larger share of the hospital bill, meaning they have higher co-pays and deductibles. So, I do think it is possible that as we enter into this recession, that the amount of incremental impact from having people lose their health insurance from their employer or have less health insurance to their employer may be less than it was in the last recession just because I think the underlying market infrastructure and benefit plan infrastructure has changed some.", "I think I've mentioned this to many people who I've talked to, like in the Las Vegas market where a lot of the weakness in that market at least initially was in the construction trades and the construction industry. Our own operating folks have said to me, they don't necessarily view that as incrementally impactful to them, only because these are people who for the most part didn\u2019t have health insurance through their employers anyway.", "So if they got laid off the incremental impact on us was not going to be wholly different. Again, I'm not smart enough, Erik to tell you how that dynamic translates into what we might expect to happen on compensating care or what we might expect to happen to volumes. But I do see that as the one significant change from the last recession that we went through six or seven years ago.", "Erik Chiprich- BMO Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks for the perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Group Company", "Thanks. Good morning. It sounds like you have about 144 million of potential stock you could buy back, the number of other capital budgets, can you just remind us on the credit lines that you have available, that you might, you would be willing to use to potentially repurchase the stock?", "Steve Filton", "Well, again, Gary I'm not going to make any commitments about what we might repurchase or not but at the end of the quarter we had at least $0.5 billion, $500 million of unused credit facility either under our revolver or under our commercial paper facility. We have approximately $1 billion under those facilities and only about half borrowed maybe little bit less in that at the quarter.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Group Company", "Do you think you are likely heard or not you likely but your potential willingness to use it has changed at all in the tighter credit market?", "Steve Filton", "We've talked about these dynamics before, certainly one of our overarching goals is to keep a close eye on our investment grade credit rating. We feel frankly more comfortable than ever that we have worked hard to keep that investment grade rating and I think we would be reluctant to give it up in this environment, because I think this is the argument we have made all along, that the difference between the investment grade credit and a non investment grade credit is generally meaningful.", "It hasn't necessarily been meaningful over the last few years, but over the long-term it has been meaningful and I think in this market is now become very meaningful again. So we are going to be anxious to watch that. Other than that, like I said we will evaluate share buyback opportunities versus any other opportunities that come along both in terms of internal and external development.", "But we feel good about the fact that because of relatively de-levered position we have a lot of flexibility and this is why we have always kept that sort of de-levered position to afford us this sort of flexibility and we think it is going pay off now.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Group Company", "Are there any thoughts on how much of the revolver you would have to tap before you would risk the investment grade credit rating?", "Steve Filton", "The problem, Gary as I am sure you can appreciate is in this market what you thought of as your operating metrics under your rating agency agreements or rating agency reviews, a week ago maybe different than they are today. So, it's a very fluid situation. So I'd be reluctant to sit here today and say, we know we could borrow this much and not lose our investment grade rating.", "So, it is something we'll work closely with the rating agency, and we will watch the credit markets very closely. But again, I think at the end of the day we will have a fair amount of flexibility and view that as a very positive thing.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Group Company", "A quick follow up. You have talked about I guess, a number of the pressures that potentially you could see because of the economy. On the flip side can you talk about any potential benefits you have either seen or might potentially see, and obviously, has your access to labor improved or have any commodity cost or anything else had any material benefit on you so far?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. Well, again, I'll go back what I was saying to Erik was that our operating costs even in a relatively soft volume environment, we are only up about 3.5% per day. And I think, as you I think sort of intimated in your question, that's probably a function of the fact that we have seen a little pressure relieved from our labor costs, which I think is sort of typical of a recessionary environment.", "We have seen supply costs really now for a couple of years after going through a few years of a lot of pressure on particularly our high-end cardiology and orthopedic supplies, we have seen supply costs have ease off, even before we switched our GPOs.", "So I think we see that sort of thing. I think we will see as you often do in a recessionary environment as well, some easing up of competition. We have seen a huge amount of capital investment from our not-for-profit peers over the last few years and I certainly believe that that level of spending will decline.", "I think we will see some of these niche providers, small physician-owned entities suffer some, if we see pressure on volumes or payer-mix. So, there are some advantages to being a strong, solid player in a difficult environment and we certainly think we're positioned to enjoy those advantages as we go through what I'm sure will be a challenging, at least few next few quarters.", "Gary Lieberman - Stanford Group Company", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "A couple of questions.. I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about your 2009 budgeting process. Maybe if you just step back a little bit for us and give us a sense for where you are in that process, how you see it being different than the prior years, just given the economic backdrop and want to hear from you guys how you are approaching your budgets any differently.", "Steve Filton", "Well, we've just started the process. Our budget cycle really starts at the end of October, goes through November and early December. Almost through the holidays. It's interesting, Darren, I mean I think, what we ask our operating folks to do is obviously to tell us what they're seeing in their markets in terms of economic conditions, how it is affecting physician practices and what I was saying, just Gary, in terms of the competition and how they're being impacted by the weakening economy.", "But again it's a lot to ask, I was saying to Erik before, it's a lot to ask me to project what the impact of this recession going to be on the company. I think it's a lot to ask an individual hospital CEO or CFO to really factor through what they think is going to happen to volumes and payer mix in their markets.", "We do ask the question, we try and get the best read that we can and then I think we'll sit down as we accumulate and consolidate and compile all of our budgets and try to make some judgments, at a macro level in terms of how realistic and how accurate those projections are.", "It gets back to what I was saying though before, we would certainly love to have a couple more of months of operating results under our belt to have a better feel for it ourselves before we make those projections for next year.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And just to get inside your head and maybe senior management, you've heard what your local operators have to say and what they're seeing I mean, what kinds of things do you think you will be challenging differently in this cycle? I just want to get a sense for, how you might be seeing the world differently than what your local folks might be seeing?", "Steve Filton", "It is like the movie Being John Malkovich, I don't think you really want to get inside my head. I mean again I think what you get from our local operators is sort of a lot of anecdotal stories about physicians talking about, seeing some slowing down of activity in their offices. Obviously, in every market we'll get stories of some amount of disruption in the market in terms of layoffs etcetera. And obviously, that varies market-by-market. ", "We've talked about kind of feeling that pinch now for a good three or four quarters in the Florida market, but not so much in Texas. We felt the payer mix decline, I think a little bit more acutely in California in the third quarter than we have felt it before. But not so much from a volume perspective in those California markets. So, it's again, every market sort of has a little bit different narrative.", "Obviously, it is hard to find a market anywhere that\u2019s untouched by what's happening. We are trying to take all of these separate and discreet data points and accumulate them in some meaningful way to come up with a more cohesive narrative and ultimately a cohesive budget and financial model for next year. So, this will be more challenging than in it is in a normal year, but everybody is very focused on it.", "I think the good news from the third quarter is that, despite all of the overarching disruption, our business continued along well at a relatively steady pace. We saw a little weakness in the Acute business there, we made up for in Behavioral and lower capital cost or interest but generally the business remained steady in the third quarter.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Right. Two more quick items, please. The other segment where we have these management contracts, I guess that was a little bit higher than what we were looking for. Can you just give us a sense for how long that new contract lasts, if its more than one, if you could just identify that and then I guess the pass through cost. We should those going forward at the other OpEx line; is that correct?", "Steve Filton", "Also I think in the third quarter that was about roughly $25 million or so of other revenues and $22 million of other operating expenses in $2 million or $3 million the EBITDA associated essentially with one construction management contract, we had maybe we had a little bit of profit as we closed out the first contract that we had.", "Right now that's all we have, is this one ongoing contract. We continue to work to get some others but nothing firm at the moment. The one contract we do have probably continues in a material way for another material meeting at the revenue and expense line for another two or three quarters from an EBITDA perspective. I'm not sure that it's enough to move the needle in any of those quarters.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Sure. Great. Last thing for me here. Your comment about Vegas is that the earnings were it was roughly flat, the minority interest line that was, also, I guess it was a little it was pretty flat, actually down year-over-year. Can you just comment on GW and how that may have impacted that line item and this performance here?", "Steve Filton", "I think actually GW had a positive quarter. So I think that whatever weakness you see in our minority interest line other than the flat Vegas results is really just a function of the others sort of miscellaneous minority interest. We have a small minority interest in a hospital in Texas and then a bunch of surgery center ventures that we have probably a dozen or so and I think that business was off a little bit.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Very good. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Fishbeck", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just want to follow-up a couple of things, you said about Vegas. How much capacity are you adding to Summerlin?", "Steve Filton", "Ultimately 140 beds, what we have added right now Kevin is a new emergency room  doubling the capacity of our emergency room, but the bed tower itself won't be open until 2010 but it's 140 beds.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Okay and then you said that your competitors are not really building new capacity in the market right now?", "Steve Filton", "To the best of my knowledge there are no other, substantial capacity additions that are underway in the market.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Okay and then you talked a little about a negative payer mix shift in Las Vegas in the quarter. Was that the same as you are seeing in the other markets or is that better or worse than you are seeing in other markets?", "Steve Filton", "I think it was pretty comparable. It was again, I forget whose question I was answering when I said it, but I mean, I think we saw very strong commercial payer performance in Vegas in the first half of the year, very good in uncompensated care performance. I think both of those metrics would have gravitated more toward the mean in the third quarter. Meaning uncompensated care rose a little bit, commercial business came down a little bit. I think our experience in Vegas was pretty comparable to what it was throughout the portfolio.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Okay. When you talk about Centennial being flat or slightly positive in the quarter operationally. Does that net out the negative drag on the other hospitals or is that just an isolation?", "Steve Filton", "That just on a stand alone basis.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Then I guess Vegas is been a pretty big driver to the company historically and your 10% growth is a good number, but Centennial adds about 15%, 20% to your capacity in Vegas. At what point does the ramp up in Centennial get you to the kind of 15% to 20% increase in volumes? Is that end of the year, early next year? Give me a sense on that ramp up?", "Steve Filton", "Well I don't necessarily think that the Centennial's volumes will continue to improve, but  the real impact of the ramp up is that as those volumes improve you will start to see Centennial just as Spring Valley did four year ago, start to gravitate towards the market operating margins. So I think the issue is, and I don\u2019t have Centennials financial statements in front of me. But if they had 65 or 70 patients a day in the hospital in the third quarter, the point is that those 65 or 70 patients in Centennial were far less profitable than had those 65 or 70 patients been spread among our other facilities.", "Obviously that is a short-term dynamics, and as Centennial grows volume and continues to achieve operating efficiencies, then I think they will get to the operating margins that the other facilities in the market have. Again I remember having these exact same conversations when Spring Valley opened and our margins in the market came down and everybody got very nervous and we kept saying just give us three or four quarters, and you'll start to see those bounce back and I think it happened then and I believe it will happen again with Centennial.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Last question. If you look at bad debt at the company level, year-over-year it is up 80-90 basis points year-to-date. With the economy going the way it is, is there a reason to think you won't see a similar type increase going into 2009? Is there reason to think it might be better than that or might be worse than that?  Is there anything, I guess, unusual going on in 2008, any reason to feel better about it in 2009?", "Steve Filton", "Well, two things. First of all, I think it is inappropriate, inappropriate is probably the wrong word, but its far more accurate to look at uncompensated care with all of the buckets together meaning bad debt, charity care, and uninsured discount. There's no question that when you look at all of those buckets together, we are probably 30-35 basis points higher than we would have expected in the third quarter. I think led to some of the pressure on the Acute care performance in the quarter.", "I think it is, na\u00efve to assume that if we go through as it appears we're going to a relatively significant and somewhat prolonged recession that we won't continue to see those pressures. What I don't know, and this is what I was trying to say before, are those pressures going to be incremental the same as they were the last time we went through a recession?", "That I'm not sure about because I think that some of the very significant uncompensated care expense that we experienced in the last three or four years and as did all of our peers, I think may mute the incremental affect of this recession but, as people lose their jobs, there are clearly are going to people who'll lose their health insurance, after they exhaust co-pay benefits et cetera. I think that will prove to be somewhat of a challenge. I don't know that we are in a position, I don't know that anybody has been in a position to predict the precise impact of that.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Okay. Last question on the site business. Have you guys done any work about what mental health parity as it has been outlined might mean to you, I guess 2010 is when that really starts to kick in?", "Steve Filton", "The reality Kevin is, I think it's very difficult for us to do the work that you talk about, I think frankly the payers are in a much better position to know in essence, if they redesign their benefit plans to make behavioral benefits comparable to acute care benefits, how many more behavioral occurrences or treatments will be covered that weren't covered before?", "It is really impossible for us to know in essence how many patients we didn't treat because they didn't have insurance. I mean it's just not it's really not a number that we can have. I've seen difference to the macro analysis. Some project a fairly significant impact of mental health parity, others are more muted. We are clearly taking a wait and see attitude. Obviously demand for that business has been good without mental health parity. So mental health parity, I think can only be a help but it's just impossible for us to quantify that with any precision at this point.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America", "Okay. Makes sense, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Gurda", "Jason Gurda - Bear Stearns", "Hi, Steve. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to see if you expected any change in CapEx trends for either in the fourth quarter and also '09?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I know Jason, I mean we went into '08 with the expectation that we spend $420 million to $425 million. We will spend considerably less than that. Certainly it looks like we are in the pace to spend more like $325 million in 2008. I do think some of that shortfall if you will or reduction is a shift into 2009, but I also think just given the economic environment we've just been more prudent about our spending as well. So, my guess is we will spend probably a little bit more in '09 than we did in '08 but not a significant amount more.", "Jason Gurda - Bear Stearns", "Okay great thank you, Steve.", "Steve Filton", "Take care.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from A. J. Rice.", "A. J. Rice. - Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple of quick questions. First of all, I wanted to make sure one thing you said I understand, you are down 80 basis points in Acute Care on a same-store basis, you said Centennial Hill probably cost you 50 basis points on that admissions number, and Centennial and McAllen OB exiting you would have been at 1.5. So is the McAllen costing you about 1% or even almost 1.5%? Is that right?", "Steve Filton", "I think I said that before. Yes, that's correct, I think maybe, somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points. The reason that we have identify that in the previous quarters and in this quarter too, is that it is a lot of volume we have lost, but frankly very little profitability. It was not very profitable business for us and as a result and I think I we have said this before I mean, McAllen's profitability is actually up in the quarter and up for the year and its performance has been a pleasant surprise in 2008.", "So we thought - we think is appropriate to sort of adjust those volumes because we don't think they're really reflective of softening of our profitability.", "A. J. Rice. - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Y ou have commented already on the enviable position with your balance sheet right now, which still has about $950 million had debt. Anything, you are doing strategy wise relative to fixed versus floating, any comments on where you stand with that?", "Steve Filton", "So, our debts $950 million approximately of debt that we have, at the end of the third quarter, about $600 million of that are fixed rate bonds. Of the $350 million that is extensively floating, another $150 million is hedged through interest rate swops.", "So there\u2019s a only about 20% of our debt is actually floating at the moment. We watch it everyday; we could clearly fix additional amounts of our debt at fixed rates. I think right now, the market sort of tells you that may not be the most prudent course. But we will follow that pretty carefully. We certainly don't feel like we have a great deal of interest rate exposure at this point.", "A. J. Rice. - Merrill Lynch", "Then just finally, you mentioned you're most likely inclined to use your free cash flow to buyback stock at the current price levels of your share. I am just curious on the non-profit side. Obviously, you would be a go-to person to get the call, if nonprofits are selling and given that you have got financial capacity right now. Are you seeing an increase in the number of inquiries you are getting regarding nonprofits that maybe you have faced in a credit squeeze?", "Steve Filton", "No. I wouldn't say, we are seeing an increase. I mean, there are clearly a couple of deals out there we have looked at. I mean, again I think, the challenge in the short-term and again I forget, whose question, I was answering before. But I think there is going to have to be some rationalization or management of expectations, as the equity markets have contracted.", "I think not for profit sellers, they are going to have to narrow their expectations of what their businesses and their EBITDA streams are worth. And my experience, it\u2019s just been that takes a while. They go into a process thinking that their businesses worth X and if there has been a 40% decline in valuations in the equity markets, they are not adjusting for that", "So I am just guessing that it will take a while before buyers and sellers gravitate to what I would considered to be a more reasonable sort of market pricing mechanism. So, I am just thinking. In the interim is we are going to find our own stock to be pretty compelling value.", "A. J. Rice. - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kemp Dolliver.", "Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company", "Hi thanks. Steve you are putting a lot of capital into riverside over the next year and I just want to get your perspective on how you are approaching that market given, I think, a lot of the economic statistics people look at and Las Vegas look almost as bad as riverside. So, are you in parts of riverside that [I would] say better than the average or how are you evaluating your expansion into that market now?", "Steve Filton", "Well, Kemp I think one of the overarching dynamics of the For-Profit business in general is that the companies are heavily invested in states like Florida, California, Nevada states that have been fast growing states and I think over the long term will continue to be fast growing states. The challenge in those places each one of them is that they are on the leading edge of the real estate weakness and the credit weakness.", "I think, what we think about more in riverside rather than sort of what the next few quarters look like is the reason we like riverside so much, as we just have a very strong franchise in that market. I mean in the market that we are in. Riverside County is a huge market. There are dozens and dozens of hospitals in Riverside County. But in the sort of Inland Empire market, which is where we are located.", "We have a very significant market share. We are expanding as I indicated in my prepared remarks with significant service expansion and I think our view you is that over time we are just very well positioned and the whole approach for UHS for the last 15 to 20 years has been to really capitalize on those sort of franchise positions, high market share presence in growing markets.", "I think, that Inland Empire market is exactly that kind of market. It maybe challenging for the next few quarters, but over the long term, we very much like our positioning in that market.", "Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company", "All right. Then Steve, how about the ramp up of the new hospital there compared to say Centennial Hills and I know that this is a hospital that\u2019s not going to open until the middle of next year. But in terms of say drag on EPS and the like, how would you compare it at this point?", "Steve Filton", "Just to clarify a little bit. Our new hospital in California is in Palm Dale, which is in northern L.A. County sort of the opposite direction from Riverside. It\u2019s a replacement for our hospital in Lancaster, California. I mean as a replacement facility it doesn't have the same sort of startup drag that a brand new facility has.", "Certainly, we feel, we will move all of our business from the existing Lancaster Hospital over to Palm Dale, when it opens in, probably just about a year from now. But beyond that I think, we also think we take a significant market share certainly over time if not immediately from our one competitor, not For-Profit competitor in the market.", "The other sort of issue, we have is that in that market currently a lot of business migrates down to the metro L.A. area and we think with a brand new facility, state-of-the \u2013art facility, we keep a lot of that business in the Palm Dale market. I think, we are aided by increasing gas prices and things that are going to have people just naturally want to stay closer to home. So, I don't think it\u2019s as much a drag, a brand new startup by any means. The really question is how quickly we can gain market share when we open.", "Kemp Dolliver - Cowen & Company", "That\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Bachman.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Thanks for as always for all the color and detail. Can you just provide a little bit more color on the bad debt in regards to co pays and deductibles and that patient responsibility, after insurance versus pure self-pay, any changes there, any kind of developments worth highlighting?", "Steve Filton", "I don't know that I have enough good detailed information to tell you exactly what happened in the third quarter David. But clearly the trend there has been that we have seen over the last few years that insurance companies and that includes the government payers as well are responsible for less of the bills and individuals are responsible for more of it.", "Meaning there are individuals, who no longer have health insurance from a government or from a commercial insurer or they just have a bigger co pay and deductible. We have just seen those numbers increased fairly steadily over the last few years. We saw big increases in '05 and '06 less so the rate sort of declined a little bit in '07 and '08.", "Again I think that the wild card at the moment is what's going to happen to that rate in '09. I think absent or without a recession, we would have seen that rate of patient responsibility increase less or at a rate that again was relatively slowing in '09. But a recession may speed that up or accelerate it again. So that's I think, one thing we are waiting to see and watching pretty carefully.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay. Great. And then just on pricing, I think you had mentioned a while ago maybe it was in response to Erik about that contractual rates may not be the issue as much as other sorts of backdoor efforts to try to control cost reutilization with commercial payers. And then we also have the recovery audits coming on line for everybody here soon.", "Can you just talk about sort of absence that top line rate increase. So how many basis points potentially are there, can you clarify it all what's at-risk from some of these other measures that if payers are just really clamping down on utilization and so forth?", "Steve Filton", "I think that's difficult to do in a precise way, David. I mean I do think and now let's put the economic pressures aside for a second. I mean, I think, we were headed into an environment, where the overarching seem in our industry over the next few years is clearly going to be an effort by payers of all kinds, meaning government and private payers to try and reduce their spending on healthcare costs.", "That will be done through all kinds of mechanisms. And I think the question is from a provider perspective, how well are you positioned to sort of weather that? How well are you positioned, that I think in some cases to partner with payers to help them control their costs in exchange. We are seeing more of their business. I think that the acute care hospitals in general and our acute care hospital specifically are probably better positioned than most.", "We are very focused on that. We are very conscious that employers and payers and the government are all looking to spend less money on healthcare and are looking for providers, who are providing the most cost efficient services and cooperating the most with them. And we are doing everything we can and it's probably a whole separate conversation, a lot of our efforts to position ourselves to be the most responsive providers and they are continuing to do that.", "But I think it\u2019s very difficult to sort of precisely say okay, managed care companies, I have heard managed care companies a few of them say, look, we are  going to try and reduce length of stay. If you were to say, I mean, what sort of impact will that have? I don\u2019t know didn't have much of an impact in the third quarter. I think we saw length of stay go down by 1% over last year. But I don't exactly know what it\u2019s going to be like in the future. But again, I think we are certainly focused on it. We are thinking about it and we are prepared to respond.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay. Are you seeing those sorts of pressures or expect to see those sorts of pressures on both the behavioral and acute care side?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean, I think that the reality is we saw probably 10 years, 12 years ago an enormous initiative on the part of again payers to reduce behavioral spending and they were quite successful.", "I think in terms of inpatient providers, the real crux of those measures, reducing length of stay, reducing the rate of inpatient admissions, we felt years ago, not to say that there is still not going to be some effort to do that. But, and I think that our growth in that business is reflective of the fact that those sort of savings are probably not available to the payers anymore in a very measurable way.", "So, I think we maybe a little bit more insulated on the behavioral side. But certainly, the behavioral spending piece of the pie is certainly less for all payers than it is for the acute care. So, I think, there is just some less pressure in that regard. But I think, we will see the same at least order of magnitude pressure on the behavioral side.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay. Great. That's it from me. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Englander.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "Just a quick question, you talked a little bit about what's happening in Las Vegas and kind of inability with volumes there to do more sort of pre-qualifying on the AR front. I am wondering if you could give any color in terms of some of the other states particularly Florida and California, if you are doing anything differently and if you are seeing anything differently anecdotally there in terms of, what you are doing.", "Steve Filton", "No. Look, I think that the dynamics have been present for sometime. As we have mentioned a few times in this call as more of the responsibility for the ultimate bill shifts to the patient, we have shifted our focus to collecting those amounts from the patient.", "We do a lot more as you indicate to collect what we can upfront to understand the creditworthiness of the patient as they entered the hospital either in the emergency room or in an outpatient diagnostic setting to get amounts out to effective collection agencies where as quickly as possible where that\u2019s appropriate. We have been doing all that. As by the way I think most providers are in all of our markets and all of our states and I think we will continue to do it.", "Look I think that our collection experience in the third quarter was very positive. We had a very strong collection quarter and cash quarter and I think that's a tribute to our operating folks obviously in a difficult environment. But it\u2019s a reflection of all of these blocking and tackling things that have been on going for sometime.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "Are you seeing anything, you have mentioned people in Las Vegas, who typically had not had insurance. Since this has been going on for a while, are you seeing any sense that even people without insurance rather would put things off now or no longer at the point that some of these things can be put off and they are trying to find a way to get some things done or is it just none of that?", "Steve Filton", "Jeff again, as I responded to a previous question, it's difficult, I mean that makes intuitive sense. But when somebody comes to the hospital with gallbladder disease, we have no way of sort of going back through some review of our own records saying well this is somebody who really should have been treated six months ago but wasn't because of insurance issues etcetera. So, it all becomes kind of anecdotal. We don't have any real objective way or quantitative way of saying this is the impact of people, who have deferred care.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's", "All right. Thanks. We appreciate it.", "Steve Filton", "", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dawn Brock.", "Dawn Brock - JP Morgan Securities", "Hi Steve. Just two quick questions on the behavioral healthcare business. You went over the acquisition environment for the hospitals. Could you just talk a little bit about the targets or the available targets out there on the pricing for the behavioral side of the business?", "Steve Filton", "I mean the behavioral business has been a bit more fragmented. There are more small entrepreneurial owners of individual facilities or very small multiple facility companies. We have obviously been more active in terms of the M&A on the behavioral side in the last few years then on the acute side.", "And my sense is that it\u2019s going to continue although again I mean at the end of the day some of the same dynamics exist and that it's been a long time since we were able to buy behavioral earning streams at 4.5 or 5 times and I am not sure that sellers are going to be of that mindset. So we are just going to have to think hard about what's an appropriate valuation for any earning stream whether it's behavioral or acute given the environment over the last month and a half or so.", "Dawn Brock - JP Morgan Securities", "Right of course. Secondly there is a lot of [talking] in the market about the impact of the anniversary of the four year PPS phase and for the behavioral healthcare guys. Can you talk about your pricing outlook today with regard to that and the expected annual rate update from CMS?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean we talked earlier in the call about sort of our underlying operating assumption as we move forward in the acute business. On the behavioral side, I think we have thought about the next three to five years span or time horizon to realistically include 3% to 4% volume growth and 3% to 4% pricing growth. Obviously, we have been beating those volumes metrics for sometime now. And I suspect we may beat them for another few quarters. Although again, as I look from a long term horizon, I think that 3% to 4% same store growth is realistic.", "Pricing wise, the 3% to 4% going forward presumes that we don't get the benefit we have had for the last four years from the Psych PPS. But it does assume that we get 3% to 3.5% market basket increases from Medicare. It assumes we do a little bit better on the managed care side. It assumes quite frankly that we don't get a lot of increases from our Medicaid payers at least for the next couple of years. So, I think that 3% to 4% pricing on the behavioral side again which we clearly beat in the third quarter is certainly realistic.", "Dawn Brock - JP Morgan Securities", "That\u2019s excellent. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Taylor.", "Gary Taylor - CitiGroup", "Okay, good. Two quick questions, I don't think you gave the acute care bad debt number. Typically we can get that on the conference call.", "Steve Filton", "We will find it, acute care bad debt number. Do you have any other questions?", "Gary Taylor - CitiGroup", "My second question is also on the acute care side in terms of FTEs. How do you look sequentially and/or year-over-year ex-seasonality. Have you attempted to do anything with FTE count at all?", "Steve Filton", "No, and this is what I was saying before. I mean, certainly we prepared ourselves for some economic weakness and softer volumes and a little bit less favorable payer mix. I am not a hospital operator. So I'm going to be a little bit soft on the details.", "But I know that our operators are working in a lot of cases really reviewing the processes etcetera to try and see how we can best increase efficiencies with a little bit softer volumes a little bit less favorable payer mix etc cetera.", "I was just trying to be realistic in answering somebody's question before and saying that I do think what we can do is somewhat limited. I mean at the end of the day this is still largely a fixed and semi-fixed cost business. But I think that we can make some improvements around the edges. And then, Gary just our same-store acute care bed debt percentage was 12.5% for the quarter?", "Gary Taylor - CitiGroup", "And Centennial is the only one that's not in there, I think?", "Steve Filton", "That's correct.", "Gary Taylor - CitiGroup", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. We thank everybody for their time and we look forward to speaking with everybody on our fourth quarter call.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "At this time, for our opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joey Jacobs.", "", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks, Brent, and good morning. As you know from our release, PSI continued to perform very well for the third quarter. We produced growth of 8.7% in same-facility revenue for the third quarter, the third consecutive comparable quarter increase. This growth drove a 13% increase in revenue for the quarter and also a margin improvement that resulted in a 38% increase in earnings per diluted share. As a result of this growth, we are on track to achieve our earnings guidance for the full year 2008.", "We are very pleased with our same-facility results. Earlier this year, we discussed our focus on expanding same-facility patient days. For the third quarter, patient days increased 3.7%, a rate, which is now also increased for the third consecutive quarter. This improvement helped us produce our highest rate of same-facility revenue growth since the fourth quarter of 2006.", "As expected, the operating leverage created through this substantial growth resulted in higher profit margins. In addition, we are continuing our initiatives to improve quality and efficiency in each facility. As just one example, we are currently engaged in a process to standardize our automated dispensing machines for medication and to add these ATMs to facilities that don\u2019t currently have them.", "ATMs have already proven their ability to enhance the quality of care, increase efficiency by automating the distribution, tracking management and security of medications. They contribute to a greater patient safety and reduced pharmacy cost. This initiative is representative of our continuous efforts to identify and implement best practices within our facilities of within the industry that are relevant to all of our facilities.", "Through our combined focus on growth and increased efficiency, both same-facility EBITDA as a percent of revenue and the EBITDA margin for all facilities increased 60 basis points over the third quarter last year. In addition, consolidated adjusted EBITDA grew 18% quarter-over-quarter to $80.6 million for the third quarter. This growth represented an 80 basis point increase as a percentage of revenue to 18% versus 17.2% for the third quarter last year.", "In an industry with steady growth in demand, a significant portion of same-facility growth reflects the addition of new beds to existing facilities. We are currently continuing to make progress on our plans to add nearly 600 beds to existing and new facilities during 2008. We continue to have many opportunities to expand our beds organically.", "Complementing the impact of these beds on total revenue for the third quarter, we also benefited from the acquisition of five facilities with more than 400 beds from United Medical Corporation in the first quarter of 2008. Industry dynamics remained favorable for the continued success of our proven facility acquisition strategy through which each year we seek to buy at least six inpatient facilities that are leaders in their markets, and that have long-term growth potential.", "The industry continues to be highly fragmented. A majority of the facilities that we operate and we evaluate for purchase are the sole providers in their markets. While new beds are coming on to the market primarily through additions to existing facilities, we expect the industry to remain capacity-constrained. At the same time, demand has increased steadily for more than a decade. The long-term prospects [ph] for continued demand growth are strengthened by the recent passage of Mental Health Parity legislation, which will become effective in the fall of 2009.", "Our scale and expertise positions PSI well to (inaudible) in this environment and to benefit from growth in demand. Despite the condition of the credit markets, we also retained our financial ability to act. With our substantial cash flow from operations, $45 million of cash on hand on our balance sheet and our existing revolver ability, we are positioned to fund our anticipated growth for 2009.", "Before closing, let me update you on a few items of interest. First, Hurricane Ike that struck the Houston area did impact three owned facilities and two management contracts. We estimated a $0.01 earnings per share hit because of the loss of revenue and additional expense for Hurricane Ike.", "We have received questions concerning the $2.2 million charge to discontinuing operations. During the third quarter, we reached an agreement to sell our Compass facility operations. Compass is a 36-bed LTAC, not a core competency of PSI. We expect to receive $2.5 million in cash at closing in the fourth quarter. $1.8 million of the $2.2 million charge is a write-down of the assets of the Compass facility. The remaining $0.4 million loss is the operations of the LTAC through 09/30/08 and final settlement of two discontinued juvenile justice contracts that we recorded in the second quarter of \u201908. Compass generated $2.3 million in revenue for the third quarter. I hope this detail helped you in your analysis of the third quarter.", "Bad debt as a percent of revenue was 2.3% for the third quarter and 2% year-to-date. As I have stated previously, you should model our bad debt expense at 2%. PSI has budgeted bad debt expense for 2009 at 1.9%. Our payer mix is very stable. A contributing factor in the third quarter was billing issues that were a result of two new provider numbers.", "Riveredge Hospital in Chicago, which as we\u2019ve discussed in our conference call last quarter, had an admissions hold placed on it by the Illinois Department of Family Services in July. During the third quarter, our same-facility patient day growth was negatively impacted by approximately 70 basis points due to the lower census levels resulting from this DCF admissions hold. This hold is still in place, however, we expect it to be lifted in the current quarter.", "The financial impact of the admissions hold in complying with the DOJ investigation caused us approximately $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share hit in the third quarter.", "To conclude my remarks today, I will repeat what you\u2019ve all heard me say, our confidence in the long term growth potential of PSI remains very strong. We are the leader in a growing capacity-constrained industry. Our business model and growth strategy have been continuously refined and successfully proven over the six years that we have implemented them as a public company.", "As a result, our scale, our resources, our management depth and capabilities have all increased, enhancing our ability to execute. With continued strong execution, we expect to expand through both additional facility acquisitions and through the development of beds for existing and new facilities. We also expect to drive enhanced profit margins through growth in same-facility revenue at a target rate of 7% to 9% annually.", "Thank you again for your time this morning, and now Jack Polson, our Chief Accounting Officer, will review our financial results in more detail.", "Jack Polson", "", "Thank you, Joey, and good morning. PSI produced revenues of $448 million for the third quarter of 2008, up 13% from the third quarter last year. As a result of the margin improvement Joey discussed, income from continuing operations increased 39.1% to $28.5 million for the latest quarter from 20.3% for the third quarter of last year. Income from continuing operations per diluted share increased 37.8% to $0.51 from $0.37.", "On a same-facility basis, for the comparable quarters, revenue increased 8.7% due primarily to a 4.8% increase in revenue per patient day, and a 3.7% increase in patient days.", "For the first nine months of 2008, same-facility revenue increased 8.1% versus the same period in 2007 on a 5.1% increase in revenue per patient day and a 3% in patient days, all three of which are within our longstanding targeted annual increases.", "Same-facility EBITDA increased 60 basis points to 20.6% and EBITDA for all facilities increased by the same amount to 20.5%. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter rose 18.1% to $80.6 million for the third quarter of \u201908 while the margin increased to 18% of revenue from 17.2% for the third quarter of 2007.", "Cash flow from continuing operations for the latest quarter was $36.4 million. PSI completed the third quarter with $45 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect to continue producing solid cash flow from operations, which combined with our cash and the availability under our (inaudible) positions us to fund our anticipated growth for the next year.", "Based on our results for the first nine months of 2008 and our outlook we are affirming our guidance for 2008 earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.02 to $2.03. In addition, as the news release indicates, we are establishing our guidance for 2009 earnings from continuing operations in a range of $2.40 to $2.44. Our guidance does not include any impact from any future acquisitions or for any change in interest rates associated with refinancing the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility that matures in December of 2009.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, would you please open the floor for any question?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Yes, thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) We go first to Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Alright, thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Good morning.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Just a few questions here and I guess just may be start, same-store growth was really solid in the quarter and then you (inaudible) that Riveredge brought that down some as well. So, seems like you\u2019ve seen a nice acceleration there so \u2013 and this is the first quarter with (inaudible) same-store number. So just trying to understand in terms of what\u2019s driving that. I know the number bounces around from quarter-to-quarter, but anything that would have really benefited the numbers this quarter, anything to highlight there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, no, really it was just \u2013 as we\u2019ve been building the beds over the past year, I think you are seeing the impact of the beds that we have built and it was just good operations and once again the demand for the services is there and we have great markets that we operate in and great facilities.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Alright. And then there were a few facilities that were having \u2013 I mean besides Riveredge that you guys talked about over the past year such as The Pine, just curious, did some of those sites ramp back up?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes, in the third quarter, Adam, The Pines contributed about 30 basis points to the same-store patient day growth. They are now about 20 patients a day over what they were this time last year and ramping up. And West Macon is doing a fantastic job for us there. Also, I was going to mention at the end, but I will go \u2013 I will mention it now, our Manatee Palms facility has come back very strong for us and is doing a great job and Dave Guymon, unfortunately for his death, but Dave and Manatee Palms just received the TRAUMA award from the University of South Florida for being the best in Florida. And it\u2019s just a terrific story about where we took a facility that had some issues and now we\u2019ve turned it into the best.", "So, those things are happening and in Riveredge hold we expect to get it lifted in the fourth quarter and so we are doing well and whenever we find an issue that we need to address, we are addressing it.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay, great. And I guess on the reimbursement side, obviously it\u2019s a little bit early, but just curious in terms of what you guys are hearing, clearly with state budget issues there are concerns about Medicaid and other state programs. Anything that you are hearing from any key states suggest \u2013 kind of a broad question I know but just curious to \u2013 if you have any feedback.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, there is no new activity I guess in the third quarter, Adam. We are reading and hearing the stories with the states and their budgets and we are just waiting like everyone else to see what happens there. Fortunately for you the \u2013 for the ones that know our story, about 60% of our patient days are child and adolescent patient days and our Medicaid business for that book of business is very stable. And I don\u2019t really see them, this is just my personal opinion, I don\u2019t really see states going after children in their budget cuts. Could they go after the adults? Sure. But I think the kids, the child and adolescents, especially for mental health issues, they need to be with us, they need to be in a safe environment. And that need doesn\u2019t go away. So, we\u2019ll just watch as everybody else watches and we\u2019ve completed our budget because of the guidance that we put out for next year and we think we have been somewhat conservative in walking through the revenue increases, but once again we expect 3% to 5% revenue increases next year and 3% to 5% same-store \u2013 I mean patient day growth. So, once again, we are going to look for 7% to 9% revenue growth for us next year. So \u2013 but we do watch and read and listen about what\u2019s happening with Medicaid.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Sure. Absolutely. Alright. And then just since you had mentioned the guidance, just a quick question there, may be for Brent, but just with the revolver coming due next year I know it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s early to know the impact. But maybe just talk about your thought process in terms of that item for 2009.", "Brent Turner", "", "Sure. We do have the revolver maturing at the end of December next year. So, at some point between now and then we will be refinancing and extending that revolver. And given the changing dynamics in the credit market, I think it\u2019s absolutely obvious that it\u2019s going to be a more expensive revolver for us. And so therefore we were just disclosing that. When we do that, the cost of that revolver is going to be a little higher in terms of our interest rate. However, it\u2019s not certain whether we make that extension April or June, so we would just update the impact of our refinancing at the point where that event occurs next year.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay, great. Okay, and final question, I will get back into queue, just on the bad debt side, just saw it kick up a little bit but clearly off a very low base. But just looking at the balance sheet, the reserve on the balance sheet has been moving higher. So, are you guys just being a little bit more conservative there based on the current environment or just in terms of \u2013 how are you thinking about that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, Adam, we think we keep our books conservatively, so nothing special there on the third quarter there. We book our bad debts as we think it\u2019s appropriate. But to the \u2013 I think to the conservative side, so nothing unusual is of costing people about other items inside PSI. One quarter for us does not make a trend and we\u2019ve stated \u2013 2% is about where our bad debt runs and we budgeted 1.9% for next year. If we thought it was going to deteriorate or get worse, we would have budgeted that way, but we think it\u2019s going to still be about 1.9%-2% bad debt for next year.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Alright, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "We go next to Tom Gallucci with Merrill Lynch.", "Thomas Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Good morning. May be just following up on that last question regarding bad debt because just given the economy we\u2019ve got some questions about it. Is there a way to sort of measure even the percent of your business that would be exposed to sort of individual cash pay, whether it\u2019s co-pays, deductibles, things like that in this sort of environment?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, Tom, we don\u2019t have that information, but what people many times forget is once again when we talk about 60% of our business being child and adolescents, and the vast majority of those are Medicaid or state agency, there is no co-pays and deductibles. So, once again, our payer mix and the patients we take care of support us having an experience rate of 2% bad debt. I know nothing about co-pays or deductibles on the commercial side that are causing us any unusual issues as compared to this time last year.", "Thomas Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "So, you are basically saying 50-60 something \u2013 not less than 60, but 50% of your business or something doesn\u2019t even have any co-pay or deductible?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Correct.", "Thomas Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Right, okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "People (inaudible).", "Thomas Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Right. And then I guess acquisition outlook, you tend to be very optimistic typically on that, just want to confirm A, what you are seeing in the environment today, B, your capacity there to do some deal still, given the credit environment and, well, I will leave it at that.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay. We have capacity to make the acquisitions. Our Board met yesterday and we have an active pipeline and transactions and we have several over (inaudible) out in various due diligence negotiation stages. So the ability to make the acquisitions are there finding the opportunities and also our balance sheet and access to capital we believe gets us there to where we \u2013 our target is six \u2013 at least six facilities a year and I think it\u2019s there.", "Thomas Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "And just to clarify, no unannounced acquisitions in guidance, right?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Correct. There is no acquisitions in the guidance. This is existing business today.", "Thomas Gallucci \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Right, okay, thank you.", "Operator", "", "We go next to Gary Lieberman with Stanford Group. Well, Mr. Lieberman, your line is open, please go ahead, sir. We\u2019ll move to Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Thanks for taking my call. I want to ask if you guys will go into a little more detail just on the expansion bed numbers, the number that you did in the third quarter, what you expect to open in the fourth? I think 2009, you\u2019d previously talked about 400 beds, is that still the same? And do you have any early outlook on 2010 at this point?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Kevin, I can give you some updates there. As you know, for the first six months we\u2019ve done over 300. We did not complete construction on any new beds in the third quarter. We do have high covenants of at least 163 beds that will be coming on in the fourth quarter with some of those beds already on. We do have three projects \u2013 our Holly Hill project, our Canyon Ridge, and our Sierra Vista project. Those things could hit in December or hit in January of the first year \u2013 of \u201909. So, we\u2019re hoping to have a good construction period during the next 60 days but weather, delay of material, workers, we have those three big projects there that would put us well over 600.", "Our 400-bed goal for next year is well in place. And, quite frankly, two days ago I was visiting one of our facilities and we just approved a 24-bed expansion in that facility. That will actually get done in \u201909, might lead into 2010. So \u2013 but we have already projects on board for 2010. So, I think 2010 could be another 400 plus year for us on beds, as it looks right now. But, once again, expanding our facilities, meeting the need is a good thing to have.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Yes, absolutely. Could you talk \u2013 you\u2019ve talked a little bit about budgets and mainly looking at the Medicaid side. Managed care, I know you guys have historically talked about roughly a 5% to 8% sort of annual rate increase there. Has there been any change in your negotiations over the last couple of weeks as the economy clearly has soured? Has there been any, again, change from managed care and what they are willing to accept in terms of a typical rate increase.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, Tom, well we right now \u2013 our outlook for next year is 2% to 4% on governmental payers and that 6 to 8 \u2013 5 to 8 on the other payers, and we still see that, but as everybody we watch it and worry about it and \u2013 but our negotiations have been pretty positive so far with managed care organizations. So, I think they know that there is 3%-3.5% inflation out there on the souring wage line, which is our biggest area of expense. So, I think they recognize the need to \u2013 we would get a reasonable rate increase.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "And are there any thoughts on limiting utilization either coming from states or managed care, is there any push back there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Not at all, not at all, not at all.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay. And could you talk about the Compass facility that you are selling, what was the \u2013 what would have been the impact of that facility in the same-store mix, it would have been marginal at best?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Oh absolutely. I think the difference in the patient day was may be less than 12\u2013", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay. And you said the revenues associated with that were roughly $2.3 million?", "Brent Turner", "", "Yes.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "And it\u2019s only 36 beds and quite frankly it had done \u2013 we, quite frankly, when we started selling the facility, operations dropped off a little bit in the third quarter, but we didn\u2019t start trying to sell it in the third quarter. So \u2013 but it\u2019s immaterial.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay. And are there any other facilities that you are at least considering selling such that there might be goodwill write-offs that we might be prepared for down the line at this point or not?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I do not see any more this year. I think as we did the previous year, we sold Desert Springs, Compass this year, I think we will probably fine tune our portfolio of assets and could we sell one to two facilities that really don\u2019t \u2013 paid us well, could that happen? I think it could. So I would think that we \u2013 for the past two years, we have sold one facility each year. So I think we could sell one next year, may be two. But it would be facilities that we thought we \u2013 that would not be meeting our criteria. So I think that\u2019s the outlook there.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay. And lastly, could you talk about the provider number issue, I think you attributed that as part of the pickup in the bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues, is that just new facilities where you are applying for provider numbers and you are having trouble getting those and so collections are being delayed?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, we\u2019ve got the numbers. They were delayed \u2013 they took a few months to get the numbers. And we still would be conservative in recording the AR even though we think once we get it all billed and whatever that \u2013 some of this bad debt may come back to us in recoveries. So, it took a few months to get those numbers. So we are now being conservative, but we do have the numbers. Lot of people working on the billing process. So, once again, I think our bad debts are 2% for the Company.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Can you explain why those facilities need a new provider number because one of them was one that you recently opened.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "New facilities.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Yes, okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Now we\u2019ll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James and Associates.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "", "Hi, good morning. In the fourth quarter, what effect do you expect from Riveredge?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Probably $0.02, John. I\u2019ve just \u2013 I haven\u2019t \u2013 comfortable a lot to that $0.02. May be up to $0.03, but it could drop down to $0.01. So, our range is $0.01 to $0.03, I guess.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "", "Okay. And what about for calendar \u201909? What are you putting in for that or is that too\u2013?", "Brent Turner", "", "No, no, no, no. We have that coming back strong in \u201909. So, we would not have any talks [ph] there.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "", "And I guess the other thing, if you look at the third quarter versus fourth quarter, what effect are you getting positively from Manatee and The Pines in the third quarter and what effect do you expect in the fourth quarter?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We expect both of those to continue to grow their census and that is probably 50, 70 basis points may be for us.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "", "Okay. Okay, an I guess lastly, have prices come down at all yet, are buyers still wanting eight times EBITDA or\u2013?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Buyers may be wanting that, but we are \u2013 our offers are less than that.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James & Associates", "", "Okay, alright, thank you.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "", "We go next to Mark Arnold with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Good morning guys. I think most of my questions have been answered here, but just a few more. Just coming back to the patient days, they seemed a little light in the quarter. You\u2019ve explained, I think, a good part of that with Riveredge, a little bit with the Compass facility. Is there anything else in the quarter that may have had a little bit of a drag on patient days because I know the same-store numbers look strong, but the overall revenue just seemed a little light and maybe Riveredge explains it all here, but anything else in the quarter?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think everyone needs to make sure that they realize that the third quarter is our seasonal quarter and that both July and August schools are out and schools start back at different times throughout the country in our markets. And that would be the only other thing. Now if add 70 basis points back to the 3.7, you are talking about same-store patient day growth of 4.5. 3.7 is fantastic. The 4.5 would\u2019ve been absolutely terrific, but the 3.7 we are very proud of. Once again, it\u2019s sequentially up from the second quarter, so \u2013 we do not perceive a weakness there.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. And then on the Compass facility, you kind of addressed this before, I just want to clarify, so you are saying it\u2019s not really going to have much of an impact on volumes or pricing metrics here or didn\u2019t have it in the quarter. But how do we look at the impact? That business is a little different than the rest of your business. How much higher was the average revenue per diem and\u2013?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think when you watch [ph] 30 patients through a base of \u2013 same-store base of 7700, you can't tell the difference.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. Okay, couple of others. Just on the bad debt, the higher doubtful accounts, why didn\u2019t that just impact your receivables instead of the doubtful account number just given that you didn\u2019t have the provider numbers? I mean do you expect that you are not going to be able to collect\u2013?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, no, no, no. No, not all. We are working hard to recover that money.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. So, we may see a little reversal in Q4?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We are not giving you the Q \u2013 the quarter, but we do expect some of that money \u2013 that billing process will recapture some of the money we\u2019ve reserved.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Perfect. Okay. And then, just on the interest rate, regarding the revolver, does the guidance assume a higher interest rate for next year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We\u2019ve budgeted these rates \u2013 our interest rate for next year under our current ratios. But it assumes some conservative outlook, so we are assuming the \u2013 we are assuming the same spreads on our current revolver and obviously both LIBOR and prime have come down since we \u2013 just in the last week, so they are down from where they were when we were putting the budgets together, but they don\u2019t assume any (inaudible) it\u2019s not assume any refinanced cost.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. So, it\u2019s possible we could even see our interest rates next year slightly lower depending on the interest rate outlook is even if the spread is higher. Just one last question, prime, did you \u2013 have you converted any of your term loan or revolver tranches to be based off of that alternative base rate using prime instead of LIBOR?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Absolutely, yes. When the \u2013 when LIBOR exceeded prime as well as even now when LIBOR is lower than prime, but the spreads are different by 100 basis points, under which we borrow. We have the \u2013 almost all of our floating rate debt is at the prime option, which is prime plus 0.5% spread on the revolver and prime plus 75 basis points on the term loan.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Great. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "", "We go next to Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Yes, good morning guys. Joey, want to have a follow-up on the commentary you made on Medicaid. It\u2019s my impression that most of the states have done their budgets now for fiscal \u201909, so I am presuming you actually have pretty good visibility kind of over the next three or four quarters and then the Medicaid question doesn\u2019t really arise again until midway through \u201909, is that safe assumption?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "That\u2019s the assumption we use. The majority of the states have July 1st year-end, now it\u2019s beginning years in October 1, so we think the vast majority of \u2013 well, what we know, the rate increases that are up through June 30th of next year and some through September 30th of next year. What you worry about is a state doing something out of budget cycle, but those budgets have been put to bed, and we have our rate increases.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay. And have you seen any states in the past whether it\u2019s \u2013 here with PSI or before, (inaudible) did that mid-budget cycle or is that pretty unusual?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think it would be extremely unusual. We try to go back and think about the year 2003. 2003, I guess was the last big year for the state budgets to be in a crisis, and we came out that okay. So, that\u2019 our latest reference point.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay. Now, that\u2019s helpful color. And then if we think of \u2013 go forward to \u201909, I know you are \u2013 assuming the nine holes intact. Do you envision it being a little more skewed going forward on the volume side given the success you\u2019ve had in new bed additions? May be the somewhat counter-cyclical nature of the business and then pricing being pressured a bit by PPS, the tail one there running out and little more Medicaid pressure, should we expect that mix, if you will, or sorry growth to may be shift a little bit?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes, yes, yes you do. I think that patient days will be at the higher end of our range and that revenue will be in the range, but it could actually end them up being a little bit lower, but it\u2019s in our range. So, once again, any combination of those two get us to seven to nine and I think patient days absolutely has the best chance of exceeding expectations.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay, great. And then if we look at \u201909, a follow-up on the bed growth, if you think of those 400 beds, do you know how many, off the cuff, will be going into same store versus they are going to be de novo facilities?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Quite frankly, I think all of them are same store.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay, so a similar or even bigger amount to this year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "And then the last question I had, there is obviously a lot of discussion on S chip [ph] expanding especially with more democratic power in congress. Is that something that you guys see as a big potential benefit next year, may be even larger than the Metal Health Parity, given your amount of RTC and kind of child and adolescent business?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We think that could very well happen in the first quarter of next year and the S chip [ph] expansion be a positive for us. We can't quantify it yet, but it would be a positive for us and it would impact quicker than Mental Health Parity.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Right, so safe to say there is nothing in your guidance kind of considering any upside from that or parity bills or anything of that nature?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Once again, when you are $2 billion of revenue even though you might get a little bit more extra money from the S chip [ph] it\u2019s hard \u2013 we are now so big, that money, it\u2019s hard to get it \u2013 to say all that money went right down to the bottom line. It gets washed through $2 billion of operations.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Right, okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It is a positive, it will be a positive.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay, great. Thanks for the color guys.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go to Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Thanks, good morning, everyone. I wanted to just follow up again on the \u201909 guidance just make sure I understand some of the key components much of which I think you\u2019ve mentioned throughout the call. Can you just may be highlight what your thoughts are, what you built into the guidance for legal expenses related to the investigation, if there is any at all that you\u2019ve built in?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We built in some, but it\u2019s a lot less than we had occur in the third quarter.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Okay. And then you gave us your same-store revenue outlook and that continues to be good, what is the outlook for same-store margins or what kind of margin expansion have you included, and if it\u2019s a range, that\u2019s fine, but just want to get a sense for that for \u201909?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "You know, we\u2019ve never really given numbers like that out. We\u2019ve always given the 7% to 9% revenue number, but what I will everyone is that we budgeted off of what we\u2019ve done for the past five years. And for the past five years we\u2019ve had margin improvement and you all can go back and look at \u2013 see the number of basis points. We would continue that to happen in 2009. So, there is margin improvement in our budget, and we expect it to be similar to what we\u2019ve seen in previous years and so I think that\u2019s probably something you can easily model. But we \u2013 once again, we have not given those numbers and I don\u2019t want to start that today.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "That\u2019s fair. I mean you\u2019ve been doing about 150 basis points year-over-year in the last few years. I guess this quarter was hit by the hurricane a little bit.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "And then as far as the quarter itself goes, can you just give us your occupancy rate, maybe Jack has that number, and the same-store base, and the total, what the occupancy rates where.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Sure. I am going \u2013 before I do that though, Darren, about (inaudible), I do not agree that\u2019s 150 basis points. Just want to make sure that\u2019s clear for everybody, but Jack, give him the occupancy.", "Jack Polson", "", "Total occupancy is 74.1% for the quarter. I don\u2019t have it broken out between same store and other, but obviously most of it is same store.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Sure. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Joey, we heard you \u2013 about your acquisition outlook, I guess I wanted to just kind of square that with the refinancing and may be Brent if you have a comment here that would be great. Just what leverage ratio do you think you want to try to manage to going into a refinancing of that, if it\u2019s lower than where you are currently are, what would it be?", "Brent Turner", "", "Sure. Our current leverage for the quarter on a net basis, you saw we had $45 million of cash, so if you look at the current quarter, net debt to our cash flow, it\u2019s 4.1. So we\u2019ve brought that down once again by a couple of \u2013 20 basis points. And so we would see our leverage here be below 4. And really when you look at transactions, even though we are looking at transactions, Joey emphasized that prices are changing, and we are more at a 4 multiple and you are looking at a transaction that really isn\u2019t much higher than that multiple. And especially on a relative size basis, when you are buying something much smaller it has no incremental impact on increasing our leverage.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Great. Okay, and then I guess my last question would just be \u2013 you talked a little bit about quality, and we noticed the new feature in your website that looks great, you are putting some more information out there. Any updates on your plans to broaden \u2013 what you publish about your quality, any updates there? And since you mentioned that how far along are you in installing these automated dispensing machines? Thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay, good. Darren, on the automated dispensing machines, we are probably a third of the way there. And so that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be doing over the next 15 months, probably 12 to 15 months that will be implemented there. Yes, we are expanding our website to include more quality points there \u2013 data points there. The next big thing that will be going on the website is that the industry has adopted core measurements and we participated in that pilot, and we are ready to start reporting those out January 1st, just against our sales. So you\u2019ll be seeing core measurement going up on our website and how we are doing there. So, any time we can put more quality oriented information on our website we are going to do that. And an example of something that we\u2019ve just done is an education tape on the prevention of suicide and awareness that\u2019s going out to all of our employees taking care of our patients that was \u2013 that we\u2019ve done a terrific job on. Kathy Bolmer, her department has done a good job on \u2013 and then also we\u2019ll probably do an announcement or put it on our website that we are about to go \u2013 next year we will be going on line with continuing education so that if we need to focus in a certain area we can put those questions, that information, that test out there and have our employees go online and take the test and they are continuing education there. So, we are doing lots of things to continue to improve the quality and \u2013 for our patients and the safety of our facilities. So \u2013 but we will be sharing more of those highlights on our website and so we are making great progress there.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Great.

Question just on the recent announcement of the creation of the Co-COO role. Joey, can you just kind of talk about your decision to do that, kind of how this segregation of responsibilities works out and just any benefit or decision kind of really what the impetus was there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay, you know with 95 facilities that\u2019s a lot of direct reports to one person when you have 10 facilities per division. And we thought to keep \u2013 Chief Operating Officer is closer to quality and financial initiatives that we have going on under the Company that it made sense to put approximately $1 billion and to \u2013 under Terry Bridges, and $1 billion under \u2013 of revenue under Ron Fincher, and to goals there, I think response to safety and quality issues will improve and implementation of our plans there. And also that financial performance so that now these people five maybe six people reporting to them versus Terry had 12, 13 people reporting to him. I think it makes absolute sense because of our low span of control and Terry and Ron are both very, very seasoned executives. And I think it\u2019s nothing but a plus for the shareholders.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay, well, great, that\u2019s helpful. And just looking at the cash flow statement, it looks like you guys acquired something for a couple of million bucks in the quarter. Just any commentary around that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes, we bought a small work-life product to round out our EAP services and that occurred I think July 1st, and it\u2019s an add-on to our EAP products that we sell and it\u2019s a work-life product and so we made that acquisition. That will be the last acquisition that \u2013 for this year for the EAP company. But it was something to round out their \u2013 for all services of products that they are offering.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay. And just one other question because you ended with a lot of cash on the balance sheet, just any bias for repaying debt? Just a little surprised you guys didn\u2019t pay more debt down in the quarter and just any thoughts around that? Thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Sure. Good question, Whit. I think most folks know that our revolver is committed to us through about 10 different financial institutions, one of which is \u2013 was Lehman Brothers. And due to them being in the status \u2013 the bankruptcy status, we are not paying down our revolver like we normally do. We are keeping that outstanding until hopefully somebody steps in and takes their in the revolver. The good news is \u2013 in that context is Lehman was committed to us for $25 million on a revolver and we have over $19 million of that outstanding. So, it only impacts us on \u2013 access in terms of $6 million. But we do not want to pay down our revolver incrementally because every time we pay down the revolver we would their portion of the request when we want to re-borrow. So, that\u2019s why you are seeing cash billed in the current quarter and probably into the fourth quarter until that\u2019s resolved.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "", "Okay. So, have you assumed any debt repayment implicitly within your guidance for next year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We assume that it\u2019s status quo with what we are seeing now.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W.

So, I guess my first question is just kind of moving or digging a little bit deeper into the bed expansion, can we anticipate that the acute-RTC split focus will remain 75/25?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Dawn, looking at the schedule, yes, it\u2019s more like 70/30.", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Okay, that\u2019s\u2013", "", "Joey Jacobs", "", "70% acute, 30% RTC.", "", "Dawn Brock \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Joey, is there anything to read into \u2013 on the acute focus as limiting your \u2013 limiting or reducing your Medicaid exposure a little bit simply because we know that the RTC business or I should say the adult business, which is going to be the acute side is not Medicaid at all.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We are not \u2013 these projects are not driven by payer mix changes or enhancing the payer mix. These projects are driven by, quite frankly, the facility having a waiting list or trying [ph] away patients.

One of our facilities just did have a person that is in the venture capital area that who knows, maybe the crisis did make him need service.

Whether it\u2019s deals you\u2019ve done or deals you\u2019ve passed on. I mean, a lot of these companies, highly levered where access to capital really could have a huge impact, thereby creating some significant opportunities in the next couple of months or next year or so?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think two things are driving some of these \u2013 three things. So many owners have put their money at risk and due to these uncertain economic times are looking to liquidate and how can they make that happen and \u2013 there\u2019s only a few buyers out there that can make them happen for them. Well, second is that some of these facilities are worried about the debt that they have borrowed on their facilities and that also creates an interest. Also, the outlook on tax increases. If these people have taken a risk and generated value for their facilities and more than likely it\u2019s capital gains to them, how they\u2019ve set up the company, those people \u2013 those individual owners are thinking to their tax strategy for their families. And so we have seen comments. We\u2019ve gotten comments and feedbacks both on that \u2013 being able to liquidate their facility and then also on the tax structure. So we see those \u2013 we get those comments.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay, okay. That\u2019s interesting. Second thing is with the recent Mental Health Parity legislation, the congress does have a cause to associate with this to the tax payers. And it\u2019s over $1 billion for the next five to six years. I was wondering if you guys have thought about how that could impact you. Whether you can quantify it or how should we think about that trickling through to mental health providers?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "First, it\u2019s not effective until the October of next year.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Sure, sure.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "But I think, one way we could measure it is that the large self-insured employers \u2013 I think there\u2019s a possibility that we could track the number of patients from those employers. There might be some \u2013 I go back and think about getting whether our IT people \u2013 because you could probably take 10 of the large employers. If we could do that \u2013 I don\u2019t know if our IT system would let us do that, but that\u2019s one way we can measure it.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay. But it\u2019s sort of this nebulous thing where congress is going to cost them \u2013 I think it was $1.5 billion \u2013 so they\u2019re paying more money out to providers and \u2013", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how they cost it. What they cost was loss of revenue that these companies are going to be incurring more mental health benefit cost so they will have less money, and this would be a loss tax revenue to the government.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think that\u2019s how some of that scoring occurred. It wasn\u2019t that they\u2019re paying more money, it\u2019s that they would be getting less revenue because these companies across the country \u2013 these loss of self insurers or \u2013 would be paying more on mental health benefits, which would have be a tax deduction, so tax revenues would be less going back to the government.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay, okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "That\u2019s how it was explained to me on the scoring of that. It wasn\u2019t so much that the federal government was going to pay more. That it was going to be \u2013 they would lose revenue.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay. Well that\u2019s great color. And last thing, you had said, I guess, some of the legal expenses or litigation expenses around Riveredge are going to come down in the fourth quarter and \u2013", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I didn\u2019t say fourth quarter, it was for \u201909.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "For \u201909, for \u201909\u2013?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes. But in the fourth quarter, I think will be less than the third quarter but most of the \u2013 most if not all of those legal expenses are due to document production. And that\u2019s just a one-time event. So\u2013", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay. So I guess \u2013 how should we think about where things stand today? I mean, if your expenses are going to be coming down, what\u2019s sort of the next step the investors or data point that investors should be looking for other than a resolution of the issues? Is there something that we just ought to look to?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No. The next thing to look to is the admission hold lift.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "And then after that \u2013 many times an investigation \u2013 they get into it and then it never reaches a resolution, they just close the file. So \u2013 but once again, through our due diligence, through our looking back at Riveredge, we think we\u2019ve done a very good job there. Whether it\u2019s a couple of unfortunate incidents? Yes. But we take care of very sick kids there and adults and \u2013 could the things we do better? Yes. And have we done them better? Yes. And so \u2013 but weren\u2019t looking back to the incidents that have occurred. We feel good about the quality of care at Riveredge and it\u2019s been revalidated by numerous people since the admissions hold. We just basically have one more agency that needs to come through and approve it and lift the hold.", "Chris Rigg \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go to Gary Taylor with Citigroup.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Hi, good morning. A few questions. First, it sounds like you\u2019re optimistic to lift the admissions hold at Riveredge in the fourth quarter and I know you\u2019ve had some optimism that it was going to be resolved sooner. What\u2019s your level of confidence around that, Joey?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think it\u2019s 80%.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think it\u2019s 80%. I think it\u2019s 80%. It might be January 1st, it\u2019ll be the date. But it could be next week\u2013", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Would you guys announce that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "This is out of our hands.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Will you do a press release when that\u2019s lifted or how will we know?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I\u2019m looking at Brent. Yes, we\u2019ll do a press release. Yes.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay. Hey, Brent, can you just remind me on your current revolver, you gave us the prime spread, but the LIBOR spread is what?", "Brent Turner", "", "On the revolver, the LIBOR spread is 1.5% over LIBOR and on the term loan it\u2019s 1.75% over LIBOR.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay. And, Joey, I didn\u2019t quite understand what you said, I didn\u2019t catch it. On your \u2013 I think you\u2019re saying, overall for pricing in your \u201909 guidance is 3% to 5% with commercial at 6% to 8%, then you said a government number, and I didn\u2019t catch what you said, 3% to 4%\u2013?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "2% to 4%.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "2% to 4%. My last question is, one of the nurse staffing companies last night was talking about their locum tenens business, their temporary position placement business, and they had suggested that the behavioral demand was up 20%, it\u2019s small part of the business, but it was kind of the fastest growing physician specialty where they were seeing demand. Is there anything \u2013 you think that\u2019s just being demand driven or is there anything happening on the supply of behavioral specialties that would be impacting that? I mean sounds like it\u2019s a good thing. I suppose it\u2019s demand driven but is that a surprising number to you? Does that make sense in any way?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It makes sense. It\u2019s not surprising to me. I think the 20% is probably is a very low base that they\u2019re calculating their percentages off. There is a need of psychiatrists and there is a need of inpatient psychiatrists and absolutely we support the universities that are training \u2013 that we need more good psychiatrists, but it\u2019s not any different from other positions. And it\u2019s not surprising me that those \u2013 that placement agency is having an increase in people needing locum tenens for psychiatrists.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay, sure, actually one more last question. Going back to Kevin\u2019s question. Going back to Kevin\u2019s question I think just on the potential for mix shift, if we have some increase in unemployment it may not move the needle much in terms of commercial days turning into Medicaid days, but what\u2019s the revenue impact to you? How material is it if a commercial patient that lost their job and instead of having commercial payer they come in and they are a Medicaid payer? Is there a pretty significant per diem hit that you take on a revenue side?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Usually there is not. It\u2019s usually probably $50 a day. And on a 10-day stay that\u2019s $500. We normally would have been getting $6,500 dollars. We might be getting $6,000. It varies by state but fortunately for us in this industry per diems for Medicaid and commercial payers, they\u2019re pretty close. They\u2019re pretty close in what we\u2019re getting in receivable there. And let me assure you that if we do see \u2013 if we do see and if we can quantify our \u2013 or document that something like this is occurring in the industry or with PSI, we\u2019ll tell you about it on the next call. We don\u2019t see it now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen but if it does we will tell you.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go to Andreas Dirnagl with Stephens.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Yes. Good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just a few sort of little cleanup thing. Joey, when you talked about the new beds, I guess what you were saying is that you have 300 so far year-to-date. You were thinking about adding probably about another 165 to may be 200. Focusing in on those 300 that you\u2019ve done year-to-date, can you give us some idea as to \u2013 given that these are capacity or expansions at facilities where you are pretty close to capacity, any idea how these beds sort of run in terms of startup? Did they fill relatively quickly?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We\u2019ve told everybody here, Andreas, that you give us 12 months \u2013 our goal is once we bring the bed online hat 12 months from now it would be at our occupancy percent, which Jack gave out at 74. So a year from now, we would hope that bed is 74% occupied for the next coming year. So that\u2019s what we do. So that\u2019s how I would ramp them up. Could we build 20 beds and have 15 patients in them the next week? Yes, that does occur. But could we also build 20 RTC patients and it takes us 18 months to ramp it up. That does occur too. So, on average, our guidance here is that once we build the bed and it comes on line, then give us 12 months and we\u2019ll move that occupancy to that bed towards that 74% level.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Right, okay but the beds that you are building in general are more skewed to acute than they are residential, correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Correct. The 2008 number looks like it\u2019s a 75/25, acute versus residential and going forward it\u2019s about a 70/30 split, acute versus residential.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Right. Okay. And then, Joey, maybe just quickly, we kind of touched on every other payer and maybe the one we haven\u2019t touched on is sort of Medicare. As we roll off the transition period, can you sort of give your thoughts as to kind of what\u2019s going to occur? How, if that at all, you\u2019ve sort of prepared yourself for what is likely to be a drop in reimbursement growth?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay. As we know, the final year patient [ph] was this year. Our expectations for Medicare is this. That July 1st of next year we will get a cost of living cost adjustment that will be announced I think at the end of April, first of May. I expect it to be in the 3.5% range. So Medicare \u2013 once again, we talked about governmental payers next year paying us 2% to 4%. I think Medicare is going to be 3.5% \u2013 may be \u2013 we will be between 3% and 3.5%. It\u2019s the best data we have today, and I think \u2013 the offers, I think, will be closer to 3.5% in July of next year. And that\u2019s the only thing that we see happening to Medicare next year, is that we\u2019ll get the cost of living increase July 1 next year, 3.5%.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "And to just be clear, I mean, given the current fiscal environment, so even with the current fiscal environment, you don\u2019t \u2013 I mean that your 3% to 3.5% appears to be the market basket flat idea. You don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to be a target for any cuts off of market basket.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I don\u2019t think mental health will be a target. Now, could we get swept off in to an all encompassing deal? It says we\u2019re going to cut all across the board. I think it would be something like that, that would catch us, Andreas. But if it\u2019s a stand alone, they know the mental health cost. This program \u2013 Medicare team has done an excellent job of implementing this PPS system for us. They kept their budget neutral. The expense rates, and the expectations that they see, I think, are right on track; and so we\u2019re due, we should be due by 3.5% cost of living increase July 1. I mean, we\u2019ll take us getting caught up in something you\u2019re doing across the board in healthcare at the federal level. I mean, that could happen but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening today, and I don\u2019t see that today.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay. And then one final question. Maybe you\u2019ve said this and maybe I\u2019m just not under \u2013 didn\u2019t hear it right but in terms of River Edge, you\u2019re expecting the admission\u2019s hold again to be lifted sometime, let\u2019s call it, soon. I guess what I\u2019m asking is if an admission\u2019s hold, so in other words, there\u2019s not going to be any ongoing census restriction at that facility; once the admission hold is lifted, you can go full bore again?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go to Jeff Englander with Standard & Poor\u2019s.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Good morning, guys. Just two quick housekeeping questions. One, Joey, on the hurricanes, you basically said that was a $0.01 earnings per share hit, is that correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Correct.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "And just to \u2013 I\u2019ll just clarify, all those facilities are now back online and fully repaired?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "All the facilities are back to full capacity. There are still some fence-building, some \u2013 there are some cosmetic fixing going on but that does not impair any beds.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Okay, but they are back to full capacity; that\u2019s the biggest issue.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes, they\u2019re back. Yes, absolutely.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Okay, and then just to clarify on Andreas\u2019 question. In terms of getting the new units up to the corporate average occupancy, is that fairly linear or is that somewhat lumpy?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I would do it \u2013 I\u2019d divide it by four. That\u2019s how I would model, a fourth each quarter.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Okay, great. And one last question since everybody has asked two last questions, I might as well get my second last question in.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "That\u2019s okay.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "In terms of the sale prices from what you\u2019ve said about people looking for multiples, I get the sense that you\u2019re still not seeing distress. Was that the correct assumption?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I wouldn\u2019t use the word distress. We\u2019re still sellers that have good reasons to sell.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Right, but you are not seeing sellers that are feeling extreme pressure to sell that have been \u2013?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor\u2019s", "", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Good.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll go to David Bachman with Longbow Research.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "All right. Thanks for taking my call and spending all the time. I know you got a company to go run. In terms of length of stay, I appreciate that that\u2019s come down a bit because of the mixture between acute beds and residential beds but is there anything else going on there with, perhaps, just tighter utilization management from, on the payer\u2019s side?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "There might be a little but we\u2019ve had tough utilization review for years. That appeared when the length of stay went from 30 to 10, and then it\u2019s been 10 for the commercial pay \u2013 I mean, for the acute patient since 1994. And so there might be a little but there\u2019s nothing \u2013 if we thought it was significant, we would talk about it; but I don\u2019t see anything significant there. Perhaps with the mix change.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay, so it was mostly mix change. And then for unit management revenue and EAP for next year, I\u2019ve been thinking about the run rate of the last couple of quarters. Is a ballpark number there?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay, and then my final last question. Just in terms of the calendar of 4Q, anything to think year over year in terms of where holidays and things are falling this year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, still got those bad gum holidays out there. I\u2019m willing to do away with them.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Again, your way of doing business. All right, that\u2019s it. Thanks again for all your time and nice job in growing volumes.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "We\u2019ll move on to our last question from Gary Lieberman with Stanford Group.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group", "", "Thanks. Sorry, I had some technical problems before. I\u2019m not sure if you answered it in the last question but in terms of length of stay, do you anticipate it as staying at the third quarter level or do you expect it grow a little bit from here?", "Brent Turner", "", "Gary, this is Brent. I think it\u2019s very hard to predict because again, given that it\u2019s predominantly moving based on the mix; and our absolute goal across this company is to grow volume, whether it\u2019s RTC or acute. Our goal is \u2013 so right now, we\u2019re 52%. There\u2019s volume and same store was acute for the last quarter and 48% RTC; and that was up about 2% on the acute. If that maintains year over year for the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that the ALOS go down a little bit begin. As long as it is predominantly mix- base, we\u2019ll deal with it as it comes. It\u2019s just the nature of which type of bed is being utilized more heavily.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group", "", "And as Riveredge comes back online, how should that impact it?", "Brent Turner", "", "It\u2019s the same. I don\u2019t see \u2013 there are two things here, Gary. The third quarter is our most seasonal quarter. That wasn\u2019t changed to the acute, and as River Edge coming on board, I don\u2019t think it bothers the number. I think it would be the same.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group", "", "And then any benefits from generic drugs in the quarter?", "Brent Turner", "", "Well, there are benefits. I don\u2019t have the number, but there are benefits. I just don\u2019t have that number.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group", "", "But since it\u2019s in the quarter and so you wouldn\u2019t expect it to increase from here going out.", "Brent Turner", "", "No.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Stanford Group", "", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Brent Turner", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "", "And with no other questions, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Jacobs for any additional or closing comments.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes.

It\u2019s a pleasure to be here today to discuss our operating performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2008. We produced in same-facility revenue of 7.8% growth for the quarter with a 6.5% increase in same-facility revenue for patient day and a 1.3% increase in patient days.

For the fourth quarter, we generated earnings of $0.44 per diluted share.", "As discussed in our press release the fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were impacted by one of the company\u2019s facilities in Chicago and an increase in the company reserves for general and professional liability coverage. The Chicago facility suffered a decline in operations of $0.03 relating to admissions hold and professional fees of $0.02 relating to an investigation.

PSI grew its total net revenues by 20.9% for 2008. Income from continuing operations per diluted share increased 38.1%. And as adjusted for 2007 loss on debt financing, income from continuing operations per diluted share grew 28.9%. ", "During 2008, we acquired five facilities opened a 120 bed de novo hospital and added 380 beds to existing facilities. We had total bed growth of over 900 beds in 2008. Our revised 2009 earnings guidance of 224 to 232 represents earnings growth of 17% to 21% before the effect of any future acquisitions. ", "We are lowering our guidance to reflect the financial impact of the following three issues; the current economic environment and the continued admissions hold at our Chicago facility resulted in lowering our revenue goals for 2009.", "Same store revenue growth is expected to be mid-single digits for the year 2009 and lower single digits for the first quarter. As we saw a softening inpatient days that began in October. Number two, our guidance reflects the trending of general and professional liability expense that we experienced in 2008. And three, the impact of successfully amending our current revolving credit facility.", "There are bright spots for 2009 we expect positive patient day growth and revenue per patient day growth. We expect to add 400 beds to existing facilities and to complete selective hospital acquisitions. ", "Mental Health Parity will have a positive impact when it takes effect October 2009. And PSI will be positioned well for a successful 2009. Now that I have given you an overview of our financial performance for 2008 and guidance for 2009, I want to give a similar overview covering quality initiatives. ", "Last year we admitted 164,670 patients generating 2.8 million patient days. During 2008 we had approximately 700 regulatory surveys, less than 1% of these surveys resulted in significant findings or deficiencies. Approximately 250 resulted in zero deficiencies. ", "Our corporate staff working on quality initiatives now totals 32 and more than a 100 individuals that the facility level are dedicated to quality and compliance. We implemented a quality score card with 22 indicators; we voluntarily captured the seven core measurements for Joint Commission. Please visit our website where you will find more of our efforts in continuing education and training to keep our patients safe. ", "Keeping our patients our safe is number one goal of PSI, our 24,000 employees work toward that goal everyday. When incidents occur it's very unfortunate and we are dedicated to learning from those incidents to improve our quality of care. ", "Thank you again for your time this morning and now Jack Polson, our Chief Accounting Officer, will review our financial results in more detail.", "Jack Polson", "Thank you, Joe and good morning. PSI\u2019s revenue for the fourth quarter increased 12% to $446 million from $398 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Income from continuing operations increased to 6.3% to $24.6 million from $23.2 million while income from continuing operations grew per diluted share, grows 4.8% to $0.44 from $0.42.", "Our same-facility revenue increase 7.8% for the fourth quarter reflecting a 6.5% increase in revenue per patient day and a 1.3% increase in patient days. Patient days were impacted 0.9% by the admissions hold in Chicago. Same-facility EBITDA margin was 18.7% and total facility EBITDA margin was 18.5% both compared with 21.0% for the fourth quarter of 2007. While same-facility EBITDA margin for the full year was up 30 basis points to 20.8% from 20.5% last year.", "Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increase 9% for the fourth quarter to $74.6 million and increase 23% to $312.9 million for the full year. ", "With substantial net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the quarter and the year as well as strong growth in our consolidated income from continuing operations for the year. We again improved our financial position at year end 2008 with the end of 2007.", "Cash flows from continuing operations was $52.5 million for the quarter and $142.6 million for the year and days and accounts receivable at the end of 2008 was 51 down from 53 last year. Total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved to 4.0 at the end of 2008 from 4.4 a year earlier and 4.1 at the end of the third quarter.", "Net debt to total capitalization improved to 58.7% improved 258.7% at the end of 2008 from 60% at the end of 2007. ", "Now, here is Brent Tuner to discuss the extension of our revolving credit facility.", "Brent Turner", "Thanks Jack. We are extremely pleased to announce two year extension of our revolving credit facility extending the maturity of $200 million of the facility to December 31, 2011. The remaining $100 million will mature at the end of 2009 as originally scheduled.", "The revolver currently has an outstanding balance of approximately $195 million and is priced at LIBOR plus 5.25%. In a more normal lending environment, we would have extended the entire $300 million revolver. However, given the current environment the fact that we were successful on this extension is a credit to the financial performance of PSI. It is important to note that structure we utilized did not impact the terms of our $570 million in term loans that remain priced at LIBOR plus 1.75%. That was also a significant accomplishment and part of our strategy and extending only $200 million of the revolver.", "I want to thanks the lenders that are now part of our new revolver for their support of PSI. With this revolver maturity put behind us we are now well positioned to fund our capital needs for 2009 and we intend to use the excess cash flow to further reduce our overall debt. Finally, we have no significant debt maturities until the end of 2011 when revolver matures once again. ", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Cynthia, would you please open the lines for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you Mr. Turner (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. ", "Christina Bradshaw \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Good morning. It\u2019s Christina Bradshaw for Ryan this morning. To start-off, where is the weakness that you\u2019re seeing in the volume right now given the environment. Is it under acute-RTC side or is it more payer focused?", "Joey Jacobs", "It\u2019s general across the Board. Our payer mix has stayed relatively stable over the years. It is just a general softening that occurred in October, and that was I guess when banks started to fail maybe Lehman Brothers had closed or whatever and we just the uneasiness, the lay-offs in the market, just caused a softening in the census, starting in October. Across the Board we do have several facilities that -- this is not impacted and they are growing rapidly, so but there is a general softness across the country.", "Christina Bradshaw \u2013 William Blair & Company", "That's helpful color. Thank you. Regarding the situation in Riveredge, can you estimate what your costs are going to be for the facility in the first quarter of 09 or I don\u2019t know if you can provide an estimate? And then, I guess, is there a point where you get to just think about converting those beds away from DCF to maybe private pay?", "Joey Jacobs ", "The Riveredge and the softening of the census was taking -- we took both of those things into consideration when we lowered the revenue -- same-store revenue goals to the mid-single digits. So it\u2019s baked in those expectations there. We have starting in November began a program of diversifying the payer mix there, and so that is a part of our strategy and hopefully a successful strategy during 2009. ", "Christina Bradshaw \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. And then, a question on the revolver. Is there a LIBOR floor on, for the extension of the revolver or any new covenants that may be we should be aware of?", "Brent Turner", "There are neither. No LIBOR floor and no change in our covenants.", "Christina Bradshaw \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay. And then, I have one final question. On the M&A front, probably a bit of conundrum as there are fewer bidders and higher interest costs, but the facilities themselves are doing well and maybe, not taking lower multiples. Do you have any color on those?", "Joey Jacobs", "The acquisitions where we have lower intense have good facilities and our multiples for acquisitions have been lowered. So, the multiple that we are going to be paying for acquisitions going forward is slower than what we pay, say from 2005-2006, forward.", "Christina Bradshaw \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have for now. Thank you.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess several moving parts here. Just want to start and just want to clarify something. So you said Riveredge impacted same-store growth by 90 basis points in the quarter, is that correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "Correct. Patient days, yes.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The patient days by 90 basis, okay. Alright, and I guess, as you know, you look out in terms of the impact from the economy and what you're assuming for 2009, you know, you spoke before about the general softening. But are you also assuming some change in reimbursement with some of the state Medicaid issues?", "Joey Jacobs", "Adam, we've built in a little cushion there. We've not seen that yet. But we've built in a little cushion there. You know, the states are, like in Tennessee for example, the governor postponed presenting his budget until he saw what was going to happen with the stimulus package. I think a lot of the pressure on the Medicaid budget at the state level are going to be solved by the funds coming from the Federal Government to shore up Medicaid. So, we will get more clarity as closer we get to July 1. We have been a little bit more conservative in the re-projection for 2009.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just on the patient day softness, I just wanted to delve into this a little bit more detail. I guess as you have seen issues there, I mean, do you believe that payers are limiting length of stay? Do you think that\u2019s driving some of this. Just want to get your thoughts in terms of why a Medicaid beneficiary wouldn\u2019t be getting the same treatment, I would assume that their benefit would be similar. So there hasn\u2019t been any change in terms of co-payments and such for some of the Medicaid beneficiaries. So just curious in terms why you think the patient day softness is taking place?", "Joey Jacobs", "The uneasiness in the population about even buying or consuming even goes into patients days here. More than -- our number one payer now from our last payer source now is commercial HMO, PPO. We really don\u2019t see anything really changing on the length of stay there significantly. What we do see is that population that does have deductibles in co-pays that they would be having to spend for care. So, maybe a little bit more pressure there, but it's more of a general the softness, Adam, across the board.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Alright, and then on the professional liability costs. Maybe just walk us through -- what's going on there in terms of the increase you are seeing, I understand the impacts for the quarter was a boost in your reserves, but as we think about 2009, how should we think about the professional liability cost?", "Joey Jacobs", "That was the reason for lowering the guidance some for 2009 is to make sure that we have what we believe is adequate insurance reserves, expense going or 2009. And the increase came, Adam, from the thoughts or expectations that the actual claim cost per claims going to go up and has going up overtime. So, that\u2019s where it came from. We have instituted some new procedure so we have more of a quarterly look at that number going forward, but we've trended that expense line for 2009 using the 2008 increase in reserves there. So, once again we were conservative cautious there.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And I don\u2019t know, Jack or Brent, I want to go through but in your K outlined there is a change in your policy there. Can you just walk us through the change you guys made in terms of your self insurance here?", "Brent Turner", "Yes, I think you are speaking about the fact that we increased our excess coverage from $50 million to $75 million going forward. And it's important to note from our risk management profile we were able to do that with our lower premium for the entire excess policy than we had at the $50 million level.", "So, that it further validates that there is no significant change in our exposure from claims that we were able to purchase $75 million of additional coverage at premium rate lower than what we were previously paying for 50.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to just fall up a little bit more on the professional liability issue and may be if you can just kind of give us a sense for the timing of the actuarial review and when it became known to you that you would have to take reserves. I just want to sort of get a sense here for the timing of that process. And I think Brent you said that you have a new quarterly look at this so, may be can you just tell us what you are doing differently on a quarterly versus what you did annually before.", "Brent Turner", "", "Darren the timing of this is always done in the middle of fourth quarter, so that we have good results and can study it for year-end. We previously had any significant changes outside of our expectations from that. This is the first year it happened there. And so going forward what we've done is put some -- a monthly internal analysis in place to roll our experience forward. And then quarterly we'll be having our outside actuarial review study, before the end of each quarter. ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "And when did you complete the actuarial review this go-round?", "Brent Turner", "", "Well the final, we got initial indications late in December the final didn't come out till January but those -- these things are they put out a number of drafts and we go through that, so it was initiated, beginning of December and so it's a process.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "I guess just a question with regard to your philosophy pre announcing, it did seem like you had some information available by January, so maybe Joey, can you just share with us your thought process with regard to that and why you didn\u2019t want to get this information in to the marketplaces, probably the biggest miss you had since being public company. So I think your shareholders would like to hear that. ", "Brent Turner", "Darren this -- the review of the malpractices, the general and professional insurance reserves took the whole month of January. And the audit committee and the review of the financial numbers were scheduled for mid February. I thought it would be a disservice not to able to put out one piece of information without being able to really talk about the whole quarter and in it's entirety during that and it was just $0.05 $4.9 million. ", "And so that was the decision and it was somewhat of unusual occurrence and that our history had not, had those sort of adjustments. And we wanted to take the time in January, may be in the in the first couple of weeks in February to review with the actuaries and make sure that we understood the details of what they were recommending to us. And it coincided it was within a few days of when we would be having this call. ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay and then can I just a question with regard to how your educating your referral sources obviously some bad headlines which we would all like to see avoid going forward. But in those markets where that may have had some impact in your referral sources perhaps. Can you just talk to us about how your compliance team is educating referral sources with regard to your outcomes? If there's any different process there?", "Brent Turner", "", "We know when someone's out there doing a story, and by the time the story is written, we kind of know where they are going to focus, fortunately for us they keep focusing on very old stories, very old incidents for so we do give state agencies, Joint Commission, referral sources, heads ups ahead of time so they are not surprised or read it in the paper. And I think our operations teams in conjunction with Kathy Bolmer and non of the compliance and quality department do a good job of reaching out to those sources. And providing more detail surrounding the events and that the subsequent appropriate agency has reviewed those incidents that are occurring. ", "And for example, the story that was written on our Taxes facilities, they talked about fines but all those fines were in none of those fines, we had no fines. We had nothing that occurred in 2008 that required a fine to be assessed to PSI. That was not in the story. Story about our Chicago facility is that they did, we did have a couple of incidents in August of last year. But let me assure you that people have read this story have assess to all the state findings and reviews, we had no more incidents like that since August. And have had none this year and then this, the main part of our story was written on something that occurred in 2007. ", "It's unfortunate that, that is public information and those are the worst of the incidents that occurred with PSI. And so last year we treated 2.8 million patient days and did a great job but there were some incidents. And so but we do try to be aggressive in communicating with all of the appropriate agencies and the referral sources, so I think we do pretty good there and there is always two sides to every story and we try to give our side and let them make their decisions. ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Sure, let me just one last thing here. And that's on the acquisition front and really what I would I guess like to get out is when you think about your liquidity position in the capital that's available to you. Can you just help us think about what you think you realistically would want to take down on your revolving credit facility given that a portion of it does mature this year and sort of what that gets you from an M&A standpoint. And I guess the corollary to that would just be, are there any core assets that you have that might give you some additional liquidity to do an acquisition?", "Brent Turner", "Yeah this is Bret. I think one, our revolver is $300 million and we are very optimistic with our liquidity position, with our cash flow that we generate is ample to fund both our internal as well as our external goals. Keep in mind we have access to other capital the revolver was just one source that was immediately addressed in the first quarter. But there are other sources of capital available to us and so we do not see our acquisition opportunities to be mitigated due to our revolver or access to any other capital. ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question from Mark Arnold with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on that last question, Brent, you mentioned other sources of capital -- your bonds are currently trading about with the yield of about 10% historically that might not have been a level that you guys were willing to do something at. But given multiples are coming down, I think you maybe kind of half-answered this in the last question but I mean would you guys consider going to the bond market if there were attractive acquisitions out there that you wanted to finance?", "Brent Turner", "I think a fair way to reference that is an attractive source of capital that's available to us. ", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just another follow-up to the question on professional and liability reserves, Joey I think you mentioned that in your guidance that you're being conservative in what you've assumed in there as it relates to your guidance, is it fair to say then that your guidance doesn't assume any additional reserves being taken here over the rest of the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I would not see any unusual adjustments to the reserve for the year. I can't guarantee that but we think we have built the reserves adequate enough and that we're going to be more timely with the review each quarter. That $0.05 that we took for the fourth quarter quite frankly that was probably build up and that probably should have been allocated one fourth across all the quarters. ", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. ", "Joey Jacobs", "", "And so we will be more real-time, adjustment I would assume if there was an adjustment would be smaller and quite frankly it can go the other way, so it could be a positive. ", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay and then when we are talking about the weakness that you are seeing I think you said it kind of across the facilities are you projecting that impact to be more severe on the RTC or the acute side?", "Joey Jacobs", "We build our budgets by facility and we have some few facilities that have seen a softness, and then we've had some RTC facilities that have had a softness. So once again it's not one specific area or service or geographic area in the country. So, but it is a general softness.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. One last question and it just relates to Riveredge, can you just give us a sense where we stand at Riveredge right now? Kind of where your census is today, maybe versus a year ago. And just kind of at least to what you can reveal, kind of what the status of the current investigation that DFS review is?", "Joey Jacobs", "Okay. First, it's probably costing us 50 to 70 basis points against the same-store patient day comparison. Now, that comparison will get smaller as we get into the third quarter of this year. And hopefully, in the second quarter, as we're diversifying the patient load at that facility it will get smaller. The status, we continue to work with the Department of Justice on their investigation and respond to their needs. The DCFS, they're waiting on a report from the University of Illinois, Medical Center in Chicago. And since the incidents have occurred, we've had the Joint Commission survey, which the facility did well with. We've had DCFS; we had licensing CMS in there. So, we've had many surveys and inspections since the summer of last year. And so, we are just waiting on DCFS. And they are kind of waiting on this report.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Just one follow up to that and then I will jump back in queue. I think, you guys have put in place some additional staffing. I think you have a job posting for a new compliance officer there. Are those things that you are working along with some of the state agencies? And can we infer that you're working with to address some of the concerns that they have or are these just regular practices and things you are doing to address the, you make sure that the quality issues there, that there aren\u2019t any in the future?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It's a combination of both. Anytime anybody comes in and survey us and give us a report or they think we can improve care, we develop an action plan and put additional resources and we keep the regulatory party that issued the report. We keep them up-to-date on the progress we are making. So it's a combination of both that\u2019s going on there, that we\u2019re keeping the appropriate agencies up-to-date on what we are doing and changes that we are making. We welcome them at any time. Our CEO there has done a good job. She is not been there for a year yet, I think its amaze when she will be there for a year and Terry has done a super job there and we are very open and transparent. And so we are very much in touch with the various agencies that would be looking at this facility.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question Andreas Dirnagl with Stephens. Please go ahead.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Yeah, good morning, guys. Actually, Joey I am going to start with just a sort of another follow-up on where we just were. I just want to clarify, so what you are saying is that for Riveredge at the moment you haven't got to the point where you've sort of come together and done a coordinated action plan with the state yet, you are still waiting to do that or have you done that already?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We have done that.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "They have engaged an outside consultant to come in and do our survey. And that\u2019s been occurring since November.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs  ", "", "So we are waiting on that report but as far as all those other reports and actions we have done those.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "So, in other words, I mean, let me see if I can characterize. What you are saying is that you've done everything the state has asked you to do and now you are just waiting for them to sort of make sure that you really have done those things with this outside survey and that\u2019s what holding up process?", "Joey Jacobs", "Correct. We have done everything, we know to do other than continuing improvement all the time which all of our facilities, we are waiting on DCFS.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Right. Okay, great. And then my second question, I really want to sort of delve in a little bit more into this idea of you are seeing just overall weakness from the economy and people being more cautious. Can you help me marry that idea with sort of the idea that we've always previously had that you guys are really cushion from a lot of the economic environment, simply because I mean you are not a first line treatment modality you are the last line treatment modality significant portion of your patients are a danger themselves and/or their community, there really is no other choice but inpatient hospitalization. I mean where to sort of in the clinical decision making process where is sort of the point where gee a weak economy means that I am going to opt for X versus inpatient hospitalization and what is X?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, hopefully X is not getting treatment, could very well be that there not getting treatment, X could be maybe a position taking more of risk about trying to do that patient through and our patient effort. Let me assure that we are going to have positive patient day growth in the company this year. We are not going to have decline inpatient days, we are going to have positive patient day growth and we have many successes. Just for example, we opened up 44 beds at Holly Hill Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina. And the day of the dedication, it had been opened the week and it was the force 44 beds were already half full. ", "So we have examples of where we have strong growth, where we've expanded our beds. And hopefully these patients are not hopefully, we would hope that they are not trying to get by with not care. And then so but it just a softness and it\u2019s a small softness. We did 1.6% patient day growth, in the fourth quarter and that was 90 basis points effected by Riveredge which would have gotten patient day growth roughly in the 2.5% range.", "So, when you adjust for that 90 basis points, the fourth quarter was strong. We've had stronger quarters. The surprise to us in the fourth quarter was October. For some reason, we occasionally have a month like that were -- where it\u2019s supposed to be a stronger quarter, I mean, stronger month and for some reason the months just wants to be soft. And at that time last year in September and October there was a lot of bad new going out in the economy. So, Andreas that\u2019s -- we are going to have positive patient day growth. ", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Yeah.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "And internally, we are still shooting for 7% and 9%. But as for you all in your models, it's mid-digits for you all in your model and it's a lower single digit for the first quarter. So, but we are still internally, we are still pushing and driving towards the 7% and 9% growth.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "So again, maybe just to try and characterize, in terms of the economic impact, there is likely a certain portion of the population both on the RTC as well as on the acute side, that are for lack of a better term from a clinical perspective kind of borderline maybe as to whether or not they would get inpatients versus some other type of care. And what you are saying is given the cautiousness in the current economic environment maybe some physicians are sort of leaning more towards other venues for those borderline patients?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "That could very well be true. That could very well be true.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay, and just to clarify then, final question on sort of the same-store revenue growth, mid single digit with lower number in the first quarter. Ignoring the first quarter, are you saying that sort of second, third and fourth quarter is going to be mid single digit period or is it mid single low single digit in the first quarter with the slightly higher number in sort of second, third and fourth that averages for the year to mid single. In other words ignoring the first quarter, if you had to give '09 same-store revenue guidance, it would be mid single digits? ", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We will take our next quarter from David Bachman with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Hey good morning and thanks for all the detail so far that you've provided. Just a couple of more questions here. First of all, let's start with a payer mix question. Your commercial HMO private pay categories remained pretty stead here from what we\u2019ve seen in the past at 35% of revenue. But could you perhaps provide a little bit of color to how that breaks out, especially that -- what constitutes that private pay and other places in the K you talked about individual private payers and I am just trying to get a sense of that piece of your business?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, Dave, the commercial category does incorporate the private pay component and that falls into that would also -- that definition would be copays deductible as well as somebody paying full charge individually. On average, that\u2019s going to be in that 3% to 4% of our total revenue. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "So, 3% to 4% of total revenue, okay. And that\u2019s combined, paying the whole bill and copays and deductibles and any further breakout on that or just --?", "Joey Jacobs", "Somebody coming in and actually paying individually, without insurance, would be very low. That would not be a big portion.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "That\u2019s a small piece overall. And just in terms of the volume weakness, Jack is there any breakout on that piece of the business that perhaps -- it makes intuitive sense of that that piece might be a bit softer then what you saw generally? ", "Jack Polson", "There is no more detail we can give you at this time. After first quarter is over, we will tell what the payer mix for the first quarter. We will get back to you.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, thank you. And just bad debt 2% staying kind of in that bad debt expense range? ", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. And acquisition guidance remaining unchanged to six facilities?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, hopefully we can do six. We are being very selective. The economic conditions, make us do a stronger new diligence there but there are going to be some acquisitions and so we feel good about that. So, but the numbers will really be scrubbed. And so can we get six. We did over 900 beds last year and that was the equivalent on nine facilities. We bought five and built de novo. So yep, we could, we are going to be well over 400 beds for this year building and acquiring. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, and then just one final question. What\u2019s not in same-store right now that UMC plus de novo?", "Joey Jacobs", "I believe that is correct. UMC and the new facility, Lincoln Prairie.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Lincoln Prairie and that would be the same then in the first quarter numbers?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, UMC goes in for one month in the first quarter. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, just for most of March.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yeah. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay, that\u2019s it. Thanks again for all the detail, I appreciate it. ", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from A.J. Rice with Soleil Securities. Please go ahead. ", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Hi, everybody. Just a couple of question I am going to ask. You guys have your CapEx guidance for \u201909 including the development spending that you doing?", "Brent Turner ", " ", "I think -- A.J., this is Brent. I am going to go of the cuff here but I think we\u2019re taking about combined 400 bed expansions plus our routine maintenance CapEx of about 2%.

I noticed on the balance sheet the prepaids and others sequentially increased from third quarter about $21 million and obviously drive the business that been stepping up, but that was certainly bigger than usual step up.

And then just on the volume comment taking it in a different way, if you are going to look at the markets in which you had some of these adverse publicity adverse is the broad market, I mean does that explain any of the volume weakness you seeing that some of those market where you have the adverse publicity versus the broad other markets you are in?", "Joey Jacobs", " ", "No, no, that has not occurred. I was in Chicago this week visiting our other large facility in Chicago and in the next sunny days they will be wrapping up on another 42 bed expansion. And we think those beds will come on line and be full, so and then in Houston market. We are seeing good patient days there so no. ", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeff Englander with Standard & Poor\u2019s. Please go ahead. ", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Good morning guys. Just to clarify, the DCF poll continues to be just at Riveredge, you're seeing other amenities to other facilities in the Illinois, correct?", "Joey Jacobs", " ", "Absolutely. ", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Okay second part of the question is Joey you mentioned on the liability expense you're reserving for higher claims costs per claim. And it's my understanding that, that's fairly across the Board's experience for most companies. And I'm wondering if you have any feedback from your actuaries whether that's the case?", "Joey Jacobs", "At other companies I don\u2019t know; we haven't asked them what's going on in other companies, no. ", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Are you -- I guess the other way to put it, you've being told that this is an industry trend and you need to do this, as a result of an industry or just as a result of your --", "Joey Jacobs", "No this is our operation -- this is company specific to us. ", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Okay and then just the last question is, can you \u2013 you've mentioned that if the $0.05 for the fourth quarter related to Riveredge, $0.03 was related to the Holdings, $0.03 was related to investigation can you give any kind of color around the change in guidance how much you're looking for in terms of investigation cost and how much is related to the hold? ", "Joey Jacobs", "We don't give that level of detail. I think the message we want to send is that the revised guidance incorporates the lower level of utilization at Riveredge, so that we don't have, we have 95/94 facilities in operation, 95 now with the new hospital in Franklin, Tennessee. So we're much bigger than just that one facility. So, the revised guidance incorporates that general softness there, and we're not going to continue to specify its incremental impact.", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Right. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Joey Jacobs", "No problem.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Arnold with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Just a couple of follow-up questions. In the other operating expense line, I know that's where the, I believe that's where the professional liability reserve comes in to play. But the other components of that, the investigative costs and legal costs, should we expect there to be some elevated level, or to see the other operating expense line at a somewhat elevated level for the next few quarters as well as you guys continue to work through or work with the groups in -- that the government in Illinois and at some of these other facilities, or should we expect that to come back down to more normalize level?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, the professional fees related to that are going to be in the professional fees line. So, it wouldn't be in that line. But what you see in that line, I would look at the entire year as a proxy for going forward. And in your models. I don't see any significant change in either that line or in the professional fees related to just that.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. So, what you're saying is that look at 2009 as being similar to 2008 on an annual basis.", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then, Joey, you mentioned you expect to add about 400 beds in 2009. Can you give us just some sense of timing of when you expect those to kind of come on line?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "You should think about a 100 a quarter.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And then just one last question, Brent I think you just mentioned, the new hospital or I don't know if you classify it as new or replacement in Tennessee. But how does that and then I think you have one other replacement hospital in is it Cleveland that should open in the couple of years? Can you just give us a sense as to timing on those and how that impacts the volumes when they open?", "Brent Turner", "", "Sure, when I describe the new facility in Franklin that\u2019s a new construction but it is a replacement hospital for our national rehab psychiatric license. And then the other new build we did in 2008 was Lincoln Prairie and Springfield, Illinois. You mentioned the Cleveland facility, we actually, we had those plans in place due to our Windsor Hospital in Green Falls only being having 40 beds and not having the real-estate to expand. However when we made the acquisition of horizon they had a facility in the market and we consolidated those two hospitals and ample room for growth there. So, the de novo replacements are very unique and we don\u2019t have anything on the plans on the intermediate horizon for anything further there.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question from Gary Taylor with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Hi, good morning. I have a few questions. First, what was the number of beds added in the 4Q?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Gary sorry just put that schedule away right one. Fourth quarter we added about 150 beds and that was construction, the construction was completed in the fourth quarter.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "So, if you look at adding maybe a little more than 550 beds around the course of 2008 on beds of about approximately 10,000 beds I think it's generally the number you disclose that\u2019s about 5% increase in the number of beds and even assuming those are kind of ramping ratably. You still might assume maybe those would have contributed a couple points year-over-year. The patient day growth and I think even adding back Riveredge you would be kind in the 2.5% range. So if kind of makes everything else look pretty flat at year-over-year X the bed growth and is that a fair way to look at the quarter. Contribution from those beds is in it high as a couple percentage points.", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, let me make couple things one that we did 500 total beds of expansion new build in 2008 only 380 of those would be same store and of those 150 didn\u2019t even get completed until the fourth quarter. So the math is much smaller in terms of what you would assume to be impact in the fourth quarter. We get no impact from the 1 to 150 that we are completed in the quarter itself.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Right, so I presume then, some of the tail effect of what's been put in place ramping into '09 as part of the confidence by you will have positive patient day growth in '09?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, sure.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "On the kind of sticking to that same thought process, is the reason for the much lower expectation about 1Q same store revenue, I assume as volume related and that\u2019s probably obviously because you have seen almost two months of it, but is leap year factor in why you think the 2Q picks up from the 1Q levels or is it beds or is it both?", "Jack Polson", "", "Well, Its both, but its obvious the math of an extra day in February of last year, when you get paid for diems, its obvious, that\u2019s quite frankly to 110 basis points in the first quarter when you do the math. So the quarter for last year is they get a 110 basis points head start on this year's quarter because they had an extra day.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Right, I just wanted to understand if there was anything else that was impacting that. And then in terms of your margin outlook, if I take my model down to kind of mid-single digit revenue growth for the year, to fight my way back to your guidance. It looks like almost a 100 basis points of margin expansion on a consolidate basis which is more than you accomplished in '08. Am I in the ballpark or are the reasons to be more optimistic about margin growth in '09 versus '08 should be comparable.", "Jack Polson", " ", "You are in the ballpark. ", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "So presumably you obviously have a little less of a tailwind from Medicare and you are not going to have the same patient day growth you saw in '08 so where do you get the extra margin leverage from?", "Jack Polson", "", "We are constantly working on the supply cost, the drug cost, the food cost, the benefits of the company. As mentioned earlier when we went after the reinsurance market, we were able to lower the premiums on the reinsurance market for that. So if the other expense items there. So that we are working on to help us have margin improvement there. ", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "On the other operating expenses if you didn\u2019t do acquisitions in '09 to move that number higher is that a number that can look pretty flat in terms of total dollars, would you still anticipate you\u2019ve got dollar growth in that line item? ", "Joey Jacobs", "I do not have that budget in front of me for that detail, Gary. You might call back and Brent or Jack can you give you that detail.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, last question. Just in terms of free cash flow, the kind of, after routine we would think somewhere $100 million to $130 million of free cash flow you are going to spend $80 to $100 on the de novo beds. So, that leaves a pretty small number of that\u2019s left either for debt reduction or for a few modest acquisitions. So, I just didn\u2019t -- I heard Brent respond, I didn\u2019t quite understand. Someone had asked would you have any willingness to tap any of the $100 million that\u2019s only in place through the end of the year, which seems like maybe it's a little risky. And I didn\u2019t hear exactly or understand exactly what your response was on that? ", "Joey Jacobs", "We have $300 million of revolver until the end of the year and again we have validation that we can -- we get the structure of that current $200 million. Quite frankly if the lending environment improves and let's hope it doesn\u2019t get any worse but if were to improve between now and the end of the year, it's not prohibited that we would ask to extend $300, it's just scheduled as we know it to mature on December 21, 2009.", "But we won't sit ideally and let that go by. So, we are behaving as if we have a $300 million revolver which is the case today. And as we mentioned earlier, there are other avenues of available capital that we would price accordingly in the valuation of the transaction we would evaluate in order to continue to make acquisitions that are accretive to our bottom-line. ", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Your acquisition outlook is going to be more active and where it\u2019s been in the last few months when you -- there was some uncertainty just about how the refinancing will?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, we have been on hold with the maturity issue on our revolver and I want to make sure everybody understands, that is behind us and so we are now back in evaluation mode, more active on that front. ", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Yeah, thank you. Just wanted to ask a follow-up question here, and just, I guess two things. One, so based on your comments, about the economy and everything else, I means, I know you typically don\u2019t comment on the current quarter but certainly, considering everything going on in terms -- and just the markets impact here with the stock price today, I mean should we infer that the impact in the quarter has been greater than anticipated and I know you said the growth would be lower in the first quarter, but just wanted to clarify that whether I was just what you were anticipating or whether you have seen this impact, Joey, that you mentioned started back in the another fall?", "Joey Jacobs", "Obviously, we have the census data through today and so obviously the census is softer as we have told everybody, and once again I'll reiterate for you guys they are doing a models, so it's a lower single digit and also due to the comparison of the leap year, last year statically it's going to make it look over. So, and as Brent mentioned earlier, quite a few of our same-store beds were completed in the fourth quarter, and even in the first quarter, the Holly Hill beds were just completed in January. So, we are to more optimistic for the last two quarters of the year, the third and the fourth quarters in our modeling, and pretty conservative in the first two quarters.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then, just a follow-up, the softness in census and patient day growth, once again you guys are attributing to the economy. In the past, it seems like that wasn\u2019t the case in terms of what you saw in terms of the impact from the economy. So, I guess how certain are you that impact is from the economy and not from other factors such as increased competition or anything else, I guess just wanted to make sure that we properly understand the reason for the weakening and other census for the last six months?", "Joey Jacobs", "Turning to the operation reviews and the updates I get from our two Chief Operating officers. They have not talked about incidents like you are mentioning. And it's more of a general uneasiness. Unfortunately, I am 55-years-old, I have never seen the economy being where it is today. So, we will just have to -- we are very cautions about the economy in the first half of the year. But we are doing -- there's many spots, we are going to have positive patient day growth. And internally Ron and Terry, their goal is to do 7.5% same-store revenue growth. Their goal hasn\u2019t changed. Our outlook to the investors has changed. We are still very much internally got high expectations from our folks and with good execution maybe, we just have to wait and see how they turn out. ", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "We will take our next question from David Bachman with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Yeah thanks for the chance to ask a follow-up question, I forgot to get in earlier again just on the commercial HMO, private pay bucket, pretty stable as a percent in net revenue but as a percent of AR for 2008 it's up to 41% versus 36% last year, just want to understand what's driving that?", "Brent Turner", "David there is a number of various things driving it but the primary thing was our acquisition of UMC. Most of their AR fell into that category. ", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay thanks.", "Operator", "We'll take our last question today from Jeff Englander with Standard & Poor's. Please go ahead. ", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Just one quick follow-up Joey contrasting your expansion of your bed plans at the beginning of '08 in the beginning of '09 given the softness you're seeing is there any changes you've made because of that softness in the roll out plans?", "Joey Jacobs", "No the -- we did go back and re-challenged all the construction projects that we had. And they stand on their own merits that, in that individual market we think the opportunity to grow into those beds is there. And so we did do that we did go back and challenged those in the fourth quarter and so no, Holly hill, as I mentioned before, Rolling Hills which actually started accepting patients in January after a pretty good start there too, so no the new beds that we're building our facilities that needed those new beds. ", "Jeff Englander \u2013 Standard & Poor's", "Great, thanks very much. ", "Operator", "And this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Jacobs I'll turn the conference back over to you for closing comments. ", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure absolutely thank you. Fourth quarter was a disappointment there was two unusual adjustments and due to the economic environment and patient day growth, we did revise our guidance. But I'm still very optimistic about 2009 can be a terrific year for PSI. Our guidance will show a 17% to 21% earnings per share growth for the year, even with the lower guidance. There are 24,000 employees in this company working very hard today to deliver great quality care and to meet our financial targets. And I trust them believe in them, and it's up to us to execute and hopefully the economy does get better. And so, we are positioned for our strong 2009.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and year end 2008 earnings release conference call.  (Operator Instructions).  Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton", "Good morning.  Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning.  Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported income from continuing operations per diluted share of $3.80 for the year and $0.81 for the quarter.  After adjusting for the reserve established in connection with the ongoing investigation of our South Texas Health System affiliates and the liquidation distributions from the malpractice insurer, our adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share for the quarter and at December 31, 2008, were $0.87.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections, and forward-looking statements.  For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments in business trends before opening the call off to questions.", "Revenues for the fourth quarter increased 5% over the prior year\u2019s quarter, exclusive of the impact of new facilities, most notably Centennial Hills and the revenues related to construction management contract revenue have increased by 2%.  On the same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 2.2% during the fourth quarter of 2008.  The increase resulted primarily from a 3.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.", "Admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year were down 0.4% for the quarter.  In the Las Vegas, Nevada market, although the opening of the Centennial Hills Hospital has negatively impacted our same store admissions comparisons to the extent that it cannibalized some of its volume from our existing facilities.   The better than expected operating results at Centennial Hills contributed to a greater than 9% increase in total admissions in the Las Vegas market during the fourth quarter of 2008 over the comparable quarter of 2007.", "We define operating margins as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense, and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenues.  On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 13.9% during the fourth quarter of 2008 from 13.6% during the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $163 million and $140 million during the 3-month periods ended December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007.  Even after adjusting for certain re-classes between charity care and other discounts, the percentage of net revenue, bad debts, charity expense, and the uninsured discount in the fourth quarter were at levels higher than those we experienced for the fourth quarter of 2007.", "On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 4.0% during the fourth quarter of 2008.  This increase resulted from increased patient volumes and an increase in revenue per adjusted patient day.  Admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.7% during the fourth quarter.  Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 4.8% during the fourth quarter of 2008 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year decreased to 23.2% during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 23.5% during the comparable prior year period.", "Our cash flow from operating activities was approximately $67 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to $26 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  At December 31, 2008, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 39% and the ratio of debt to EBITDA was 1.77.", "We spent $115 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter.  Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to a new 171-bed hospital in Palmdale, California and the 220-bed Texoma Replacement Hospital, both of which are scheduled to be completed and opened in 2010.", "In Las Vegas, we are also underway with a major bed tower expansion of our Summerlin Hospital, and in California, we are in the process with a major expansion of emergency room, imaging, and women\u2019s services to our Southwest Health Care campuses in Riverside County.", "During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our class B common stock.  We currently have 2.4 million shares remaining under the previous authorized share repurchase program.", "Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Your first question comes from the line of Shelly Knoll with Goldman Sachs.  ", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "", "Steve, can you remind us why the bad debt trends tend to show sequential improvement into the fourth quarter, and then specifically this quarter, what have you seen on patient mix and why that didn\u2019t impact bad debts more in this quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think, Shelly, we\u2019re pretty consistent in encouraging people to look at bad debt and charity care and uninsured discounts in their entirety.  I have to concede that sometimes I can\u2019t explain the shifts between the various categories and I\u2019m not sure frankly if they\u2019re terribly important.  I think we saw slight modest uptake in our uninsured volumes in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s clearly reflected in an overall increase in again the total of bad debt, charity care, and uninsured discounts.  So, even though bad debts looked like they were fairly low in the quarter, I think if you sort of normalize that, our adjusted revenue per admission was only 3.3% because of the high charity care.  So, if you want to think about bad debts being higher and revenue per admission being a little bit higher, you can think about it that way as well, but clearly the overall trend of patient mix was a slight increase, not terribly dramatic but a slight increase in the number of uninsured, and I think that was reflected in a higher uncompensated care expense in the quarter.", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "", "And then as you think about the guidance for next year, mostly what we\u2019ve heard from your competitors is an expectation that the rising unemployment is going to impact both admissions and bad debt expense, can you tell us what you\u2019ve included in your forecast for bad debt for 2009?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think our best guess is that we\u2019re likely to see the trends that we\u2019ve experienced in the back half of 2008 continue into 2009, and right now I\u2019m just talking about the acute care business, but I think we would expect in 2009 that our same store admissions would be flat to slightly down, 0% to 1% down, and that uncompensated care depending on again where you want to put it, but uncompensated care expense probably will rise by something like 50 to 75 basis points.", "Shelly Knoll - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, and then just quickly on the behavioral health business, any benefits or pressures from either the stimulus, plan, or what you saw in the President\u2019s preliminary budget you think would have a meaningful impact on the business?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Again, I think those are too very sort of separate and discrete questions; as far as the stimulus plan goes, there is a significant $87 billion of additional federal matching moneys to go to the state to subsidize their Medicaid programs, and that I think should be beneficial to us on both sides of our business because clearly many many states have seen significant pressures on their Medicaid programs and we\u2019ve seen Medicaid cuts in many of the states in which we operate, both acute and behavioral.  So, I think that should certainly be helpful.  As far as the President\u2019s budget package, obviously, we have always argued that any initiatives that provides insurance to any or all of the 45 to 50 million of Americans who don\u2019t have health insurance currently would generally be a good thing for hospitals in general and for us in particular.  We don\u2019t know exactly how that\u2019s going to be funded.  Obviously, some of it is through tax increases, some of it is through Medicare advantage reductions, some of it is through provider cuts, and we\u2019ll need to see how all that sorts out, but again, at the end of the day, our general sense and this goes for both behavioral and acute is the more people that have health insurance, the better that is for hospital providers.", "Alan B. Miller", "", "The SCHIP program which was passed increases the number of children by 4 million, which is good for us, and it adds $35 billion over 5 years.  So, that\u2019s an increase for healthcare providers, which is already on the books.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "", "I\u2019ll start with Vegas, Steve, I just wanted to get some followup, it sounded like pretty strong growth there as Centennial had a really nice quarter, you said 9% growth, I was just curious if you could talk about operating profit growth in margins in Vegas also, and just what are your thoughts in terms of what\u2019s driving the growth there and do you think it\u2019s sustainable for 2009?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "Adam, I think that it\u2019s worthwhile saying that the trends that we\u2019ve seen in Vegas beginning with the back half of 2008 are that volumes have remained fairly strong, and that\u2019s I think both kind of overall volumes in the market, but certainly, our market share trends continue to be favorable as well, but payer mixes where we\u2019re clearly seeing the weakness in the Vegas economy, I know you\u2019re well aware that unemployment rates are fairly high, foreclosure rates are high, it\u2019s a market that is under probably a disproportionate amount of pressure compared to the national average, and so, payer mix has certainly declined, and again, our uncompensated care expense has logically increased in that market, and I think that\u2019s sort of our expectation that those trends will continue.  So, in the fourth quarter especially, I think the increase in uncompensated care caused a decline in our operating margins in the Vegas market.  I think one of the more encouraging broader stories of the quarter from our perspective is that despite a decline in operating margins in the Vegas market, overall acute margins increased, which obviously means that we\u2019ve been able to offset that decline in other markets, and I know that was a concern of a lot of people given the overall economic weakness in Vegas, so we were quite pleased with those results.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "", "And then the minority interest line item was a little bit lower, was that related to Vegas? I think last quarter you had some items related to surgery centers, so just wanted to get some clarity there.", "Steve G. Filton", "", "No, I think the decline is related to Vegas, and basically, as I just mentioned, mostly related to an increase in uncompensated care in that market.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "", "And then just on the psych business, what are your thoughts in terms of what\u2019s going on there.  Yesterday, one of your competitors had a difficult quarter; you guys had a better quarter, but did see a slow down in the growth rate, so just curious in terms of do you think there\u2019s been any change there?  One of the things that came out yesterday was some concern about the economy impacting the psych business, so just curious to get your thoughts in terms of what\u2019s going on there.", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think two things are noteworthy, one is that we went into the fourth quarter with a very difficult comparison to last year\u2019s fourth quarter.  Our same store admissions in last year\u2019s fourth quarter rose by over 7%, the competitor that you referred to last year\u2019s fourth quarter had an admission growth rate of 1.5%; so, we obviously had a much tougher comparison going into the quarter, and really even before the economy ever weakened, we suggested to people that beginning with the fourth quarter of \u201908, because of those comparisons, people\u2019s expectations, our expectations clearly had to be more modest for behavioral admission growth, but there\u2019s also another question, and I think we\u2019ve been saying this for some time that the behavioral business is not recession proof by any means and that it is likely that we would see and that we have experienced some softening in our business as a result of the economy.  We\u2019re certainly seeing some payers, for instance, Medicaid payers in particular, but other payers as well looking to control utilization a little more tightly, looking to direct patients to lower cost settings where that\u2019s appropriate, but I would think we would argue that in many cases it is not appropriate, but moving people from acute to residential settings, from residential to home care settings, etc., and so I think that has certainly affected some of the slow down in our behavioral admissions, and also, even though it\u2019s not a huge part of our business, we do have some of our more niche and specialty programs where patients are really paying the bills out of their own pocket, and those self-pay programs are certainly being impacted by the weakening economy as well.  So, I think it\u2019s a combination of a very difficult comparison for us, and some amount of weakening that is caused by the overall economic slow down.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "", "And my final question, on the guidance just to follow up on that, you guys have talked in the past about 6% to 8% type of growth number, so are you thinking about that for 2009 within psych?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think that it probably comes down to the lower end of that range, Adam.  I\u2019m guessing that, our thinking now again, sort of continuing the trends that we\u2019ve experienced is that, more reasonable admission expectations are probably in the 1% to 2% range to tack on to that 3% to 4% pricing growth that has been easier to achieve, and I think that you get sort of close to the low end of that range.  I think it will be very difficult in this environment to get to the high end of that range.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "", "First, going back to the budgets at just high level, one of the things talked about was bundling hospital payments seems a little bit far reaching, but I guess just one, it would be helpful to get your general thoughts on that, and then second, sort of as it relates to that, you guys have a more diversified portfolio, any interest in expanding into other service lines, sort of like an IDN type model as we look forward?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "As far as the first question, Ralph, about the bundling, I know as you know the real savings from that bundling item don\u2019t take place until 2015 or so, so it\u2019s several years out.  In addition it\u2019s not absolutely clear how that\u2019s going to work, but I assume what will happen is that Medicare will essentially give some sort of bundle payment to the hospital providers and then the hospital providers will need to negotiate rates with the long-term care providers.  It will put us at odds to some degree with the long-term care providers, but I think in that sort of dynamic, the acute care providers have a little bit more leverage, and certainly with our market share in most of our markets, etc., we would definitely believe we would have a little more leverage.  So, when the time comes, we will negotiate what we would hope to be, rates that would allow us to continue to earn a reasonable profit on those patients who will then transition to long-term care.  As far as your diversified portfolio question, I think historically the company is open to other lines of business.  We have a surgery center business, used to be a little bit bigger than it is now.  We\u2019ve historically had some forays into other businesses, we\u2019re open to that, but we\u2019re also I think of the mind that we know what we do well and we tend to try and emphasize and continue to reinvest in the things we do well, but we\u2019re always open to other opportunities both in other business lines, geographically; I think our approach has always been to respond prudently to those sorts of opportunities.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "", "And then, any changes to your uninsured discount policy this quarter, obviously pretty decent jump; I know you talked about more uninsured admissions, but is there anything more to that than just the uninsured admits up?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "No, there\u2019s no change to our policy, and as I kind of alluded to with Shelly before and I think I\u2019ve said on these calls before, and honestly, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to analyze the changes between bad debt and charity care and uninsured discount.  At the end of the day, if we\u2019re not getting paid, it\u2019s not hugely important to me what bucket we put that nonpayment in; so, just as I said to Shelly, we tend to look at that whole uncompensated care bucket in its entirety, and no, we certainly have not had any accounting changes that should impact that in the quarter or should impact going forward.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "", "And then just my last one, going back to Vegas, could you maybe just remind us that CRA deal that you signed or United now, where we are in that contract, when that comes up, and then to the extent that you can comment to the concerns that potentially have a HCA kind of trying to get back in or any rumblings around that would be helpful.", "Steve G. Filton", "", "As far as our contract which was signed in the second quarter of 2008 was a 3-year contract, so we\u2019re not even one year into the contract; HCA which has been out of the United/CRA network for 2 years now.  We have always said that at some point we expect that HCA would get back into the network; they\u2019d been out for a long time.  We certainly are not privy to the specific conversations that may or may not be taking place between HCA and United/CRA, but I think at this point, we feel like our market position, particularly with the opening of Centennial this past year has been pretty well solidified and that even if HCA were to get back in the network at some point that the impact on us would be a lot less disruptive than it might have been a couple of years ago had HCA gotten back in the network right away.  So, it certainly would impact us to some degree, but we\u2019re feeling pretty comfortable with where we stand not only with the United/CRA as a payer but with all the payers in the market.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Couple questions with regard to your outlook and the guidance; Steve, I wanted to maybe just get more of a global view from you; it looks like you\u2019re guiding revenue growth for the company to be up a little over 6%, and I wanted to know just sort of how that breaks down, how you\u2019re thinking about that given some of the components already, and then, when you look at the earnings leverage that\u2019s kind of built into the model, could you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about that in the outlook; it sounds like bad debt will be up a bit, so where\u2019s the leverage coming from and then have you built any buy-back into the guidance just to give us a sense for this year count outlook?", "Steve G. Filton", "", "I think on the acute side, and I think I\u2019d probably sort of ticked these basic assumptions off already, but our presumption is that volume growth next year will be flat to slightly down, sort of 0% to 1% negative, pricing ought to be in that 3.5 to 4.5 range, and the bad debt or uncompensated care expense wherever you want to put it goes up by 50 to 75 basis points.  I think when you put those metrics into a model, you\u2019re going to come to an acute care EBITDA model that is flattish again depending on how you mix a little bit and deal with expenses you may get a little bit of a different answer.  On the behavioral side, again I think I ticked these metrics off, but the expectation for next year is may be 1% to 2% admission growth and 3% to 4% pricing growth, and really in the behavioral business no real change in uncompensated care.  If you put those metrics in a model, I think you\u2019ll get sort of modest mid-single digit EBITDA growth on the behavioral side.  So, the behavioral has modest EBITDA growth, relatively flat on the acute side, and then on the non-operating items, we get some benefit from lower interest expense next year both from lower rates as well as lower levels of outstanding debt, and then lower share count, and I think again if you kind of plug all those dynamics in, you can comfortably get to a number well within our guidance.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "You haven\u2019t built in and I don\u2019t think you typically build in additional buy-back, is that still the case?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, we don\u2019t.  Our guidance obviously includes all the buy-backs that we\u2019ve done in \u201908, but it does not presume that we do any buy-backs in \u201909.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "And then maybe, Alan, if you could just give us your perspectives, I know you\u2019d like to spend time out in the market, maybe give us a view on how you think some of the economies are faring; you did a pretty remarkable job managing the expenses in the fourth quarter given the environment, but may be just give us your outlook on how your economies are faring and where you think the big risks are in the portfolio?", "Alan B. Miller", "", "Obviously, we\u2019ve talked about Las Vegas and Las Vegas is interesting because they seem to want to continue to open hotels, and seems to me that they\u2019re looking just a little bit over the hill and expecting things to to ramp back up, and obviously we all know that the housing market has been hit in Las Vegas a lot.  There\u2019s a lot of speculation in Las Vegas.  So, that\u2019s going to be squeezed out.  Florida is another area that\u2019s having some difficulties, but we\u2019ve had a very good experience now in South Texas which has been an area we worked on diligently, and the other thing to think about is that the company is spread all around the country, and so while we are hurt in certain markets, our overall results show that we are spread around, we are into basic lines of business which is helpful, and with all this money going in it should be helpful to us.  What happens in the long run with regard to inflation and the like is nothing that I\u2019m prepared to talk about, but the Democratic Party plans of spending money and extending coverage.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Alright, and then just one last thing here Steve as it relates to the other revenue segment which has the contract and various other things, but still has been a little volatile, hard to model frankly; it looks like it was $70 million in the period; what else is in there now?", "Steve G. Filton", "Basically what\u2019s in there from a revenue perspective, Darren, is the construction management contract or surgery center business; we\u2019ll take a look at them and follow up offline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Erin bloom from Goldman Sachs.", "Erin bloom - Goldman Sachs", "I just wanted to get a little more detail on the behavioral business, and so I\u2019m curious about what is the mix between drug or alcohol rehab patients and/or psychiatric inpatients, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing different admission trends in those two different groups?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don\u2019t have the exact data in front of me at that level of detail, but drug and alcohol treatment over the years has become a smaller piece of our revenue pie in the behavioral division.  We have just a couple of facilities that are dedicated exclusively to that treatment, and then in a number of other facilities we have a service line, but it\u2019s a relatively small part of our business, in large part because I think a good deal of the drug and alcohol treatment business in today\u2019s clinical environment is done on an outpatient basis; there are certainly some inpatient treatments, but it has moved over the years to more of an outpatient basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Bachman from Longbow Research.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "I\u2019m wondering if you would be willing to provide some color on the acute outpatient business, maybe just what you\u2019ve been seeing in different aspects of that business whether it\u2019s ER, outpatient surgeries, just something without that revenue spin on the adjusted admission piece of it?", "Steve G. Filton", "Our experience has been, and I think this has been true for some time, that our outpatient business which the business itself I think is dominated by the emergency room component of our business and its spin-off business that goes along with that, but our outpatient business in general has moved fairly consistently with our inpatient business, within a hundred basis point.  So, if acute admissions were down 0.4% in the quarter than outpatient volumes, however you want to measure it, ER visits, outpatient revenue would move within like I said 50, 60, or 100 basis points to that.  We\u2019ve not had big diversions, positive or negative, or a big gap between the way our outpatient volumes have run or our inpatient volumes have run for some time.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay.  I know last year you signed an agreement for some emergency room management services as well as some other services, but how has that played out for you so far; have you been pleased with that decision?", "Steve G. Filton", "What we did last year was sign a contract with a company that provides as you suggest both emergency room and some other physician related services, and really what we did was sign a contract that from our perspective guaranteed us certain discounted rates if we continue to expand that business, but didn\u2019t obligate us in any way to use that company for emergency room or any other service.  So, from our perspective, it was just a contract that provides us greater flexibility and guaranteed discounts, and in our minds that was a prudent business decision and I think we still cannot believe that.", "David Bachman - Longbow Research", "Okay.  And then just one other question on the other operating expense line; obviously we see that move around a little bit, but although overall expenses looked good for the fourth quarter that was a little bit higher than we had been expecting; is there anything going there?  How do we think about that line moving forward for 2009?", "Steve G. Filton", "This goes back a little bit to the question that Darren asked; probably the most volatile item in other revenues and other expenses is our construction management accounting where we\u2019re recording the cost, the entire cost of building a hospital for a third party, and then being reimbursed by that third party for those costs as well as some sort of service fee, and those numbers can be as large in the 12 months as $60 million, $70 million, or $80 million; so they can be $20 million or $25 million in a quarter on both the revenue and expense line, and again, just really depending on the timing of payments, they can be used somewhat distorted.  And the other piece of it is that we have a contract underway.  That contract will extend out probably about halfway into \u201909, maybe a little bit later into \u201909, we continue to try and get other contracts, but it\u2019s hard to predict.  I\u2019d like to give you more predictability or a better guide to predictability on that line, but it\u2019s a little difficult to do.  The other item that\u2019s in that other operating expense line in the fourth quarter is our reserve for the South Texas investigation.  So, that obviously is not something that anybody would have modeled in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice - Soleil-Pomeroy Research.", "Albert J. Rice - Soleil-Pomeroy Research", "A couple of question; first of all, following up on the share repurchase; what is the level of cash flow from operations that you guys would receive for \u201909; do you have a specific guidance on that number?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think our general sense is that operating cash flow and less capital expenditures next year ought to be in the $125 million to $150 million range.", "Albert J. Rice - Soleil-Pomeroy Research", "Any comment about your attitude toward the repurchase?  I know you said you didn\u2019t have any in the numbers at this point, but you did quite a bit in the second half of last year.  Is that the assumption going forward?", "Steve G. Filton", "Just to be clear, we don\u2019t have any in our guidance because that\u2019s just always been our historical practice not to include it in guidance.  It\u2019s not meant to kind of be a signal of any sort of thinking.  I think we talked in the third quarter and I think this view hasn\u2019t changed a great deal.  Certainly at the levels that our stock is currently trading which after yesterday\u2019s activity is probably closer to the 4.5 times EBITDA range.  It\u2019s going to be hard to find other investment opportunities that are equally as compelling.  Obviously, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to our share price, we don\u2019t know exactly what other opportunities will be available and at what price, but I think we would certainly echo what we\u2019ve said which is that we find our own shares at this price to be a pretty compelling investment.", "Albert J. Rice - Soleil-Pomeroy Research", "Okay.  On the same-store numbers that you laid out, I guess, and your assumptions taken on the acute care side; I guess you have a couple of dynamics that are affecting those numbers, and the obstetrics that you did away with down at Magellan, I guess that starts to impact you even in the fourth quarter, but definitely in the first quarter, and Centennial Hills, you\u2019ll anniversary that at some point; are those enough to move the needle on the admissions numbers?  Can you comment on any effect that that will have as those go through the same store numbers?", "Steve G. Filton ", "What you\u2019re referring to is in the fourth quarter of 2007; the Physician Hospital and Magellan opened OB services and clearly impaired our OB volumes in that market for the following four quarters.  Now, that effect anniversaried itself in the fourth quarter of \u201908; so it\u2019s no longer an issue beginning with the fourth quarter of \u201908.  I know this is not the question you asked, but I\u2019ll comment on it anyway.  I think the good news in the Magellan market is that we\u2019ve replaced that OB business which has been largely Medicaid business that wasn\u2019t terribly profitable with better paying business in part and I think it is just adding onto what Alan said before, some of the other markets that are performing well including Magellan in 2008 and part of the Magellan performance is that we\u2019ve again supplemented that lost Medicaid volume with better paying cardiology and other business.  Centennial Hills opened in January of \u201908 and it was not included in our same store numbers in all of \u201908.  Beginning in the first quarter of \u201909, Centennial will be included in our same store numbers.  Those two factors as well as everything else that we\u2019ve talked about in the call are all going to our thinking about what 2009 looks like, and again, at the end of the day we come up with acute care volumes that should be relatively flattish going into 2009 on a same store basis, and that\u2019s our best guess.", "Albert J. Rice - Soleil-Pomeroy Research", "Okay.  And then maybe one last thing on the guidance; obviously you don\u2019t typically give anymore quarterly guidance, but my sense would be that the first quarter last year was a very strong quarter; needless to say probably surprised you guys, is there any comments that I can get you to make about you might lay out the quarters, the things we should keep in mind, is that the right thing to highlight there, or are there are any comments you\u2019d make?", "Steve G. Filton ", "I think you\u2019ve pretty much done it for me A.J., I appreciate that.  I think it is worthwhile reminding people that the first quarter of 2008 was really an extraordinary performance.  I think, I\u2019m doing this from memory, but I think we beat consensus estimates by $0.30 or something.  We said at that time and it certainly turned out that way that we thought as the year went on the numbers would come down to more historical means and they certainly did.  So, I think as people think about allocating our guidance amongst the quarters for \u201909, they ought to just keep in mind that that first quarter comparison in particular will be a difficult one.", "Alan B. Miller", "Hi A.J.  Glad to have you back.  You know a lot about the business, glad to hear you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets", "I was hoping you could give me a couple of numbers, Steve; what were surgical volumes both on an inpatient and outpatient basis as well as the ER visits?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me, Frank, but following up on the way I answered a question previously, I think again, our surgical volumes and our ER visits have, I think, tracked admission rates for a couple of years now, within a hundred basis points pretty regularly.  So, my recollection is that\u2019s the way the fourth quarter went as well.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets", "You mentioned a growth in the uninsured, could you talk a little bit more about what that was in terms of percentage of total admits, and maybe, talk a little bit about what would the volume growth have been absent the growth in the uninsured population?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that our uninsured volumes were growing at probably 75 or 100 basis point rate faster than our overall admission rates.  So, as I said before, I try to characterize it slightly ahead, but certainly not dramatically ahead.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.  And then one last one here, in terms of your \u201909 guidance, how do you think about the various state programs, the UPL, the DSH programs, all those in terms of your outlook there that\u2019s embedded in the guidance?", "Steve G. Filton", "Most of those programs run on a state fiscal year basis.  So, at this point I think all of our dispro programs have been renewed through the state fiscal years which generally go to either June or August of next year.  There is some uncertainty about some of the UPL programs in Texas, but I think we\u2019ve accounted for that uncertainty in our guidance.  We\u2019re not assuming a best case scenario.  We\u2019re sort of assuming a most likely scenario.  So, I think our guidance takes all that into account.  It takes the definitive renewals of the dispro program and tries to take a shot at the UPL stuff sort of straight down the fairway.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of (Margo Marta).", "(Margo Marta)", "I wondered if you could break down CapEx between maintenance and expense in projects.  Also on the budget proposals, is there anything else in there regarding hospitals?  And specifically on pricing, this year you\u2019re getting good pricing for Medicare; what do you see in the coming years for Medicare and commercial pricing.", "Steve G. Filton", "As far as CapEx goes, I think that we have generally said and we believe that maintenance CapEx, which is really an acute care phenomenon; there is pretty minimal maintenance CapEx on the behavioral side.  The maintenance CapEx on the acute care side is about 2% of revenues.  Everything else in capital spending on the acute care side tends to be expansionary.  I think it\u2019s worthwhile and we certainly have said it before to note that a significant chunk of our capital spending both in 2008 and going into 2009 are tied up in some very large capacity expansion projects, and I mentioned them in my prepared remarks; the new hospital in Palmdale, California; the new hospital or the replacement hospital in Denison, Texas; the Summerlin Bed Tower, the expansion of surgical capacity or the replacement of surgical capacity in our Valley Hospital in Las Vegas; I mean in total probably those four and maybe our California Riverside County projects are somewhere around 60% of our capital spend in \u201909 or our projected capital spend.  So, there are some big pieces of committed projects in our capital spend.", "As far as pricing for next year and budget proposals, there is really not that I\u2019m aware of a specific take on the Medicare market basket increase yet that the Obama administration has tackled.  As commercial rates go, I think the big outstanding question obviously is that there has been some amount of Medicare Advantage cut that the Obama administration has signaled, and presumably that will create some pressure on our Medicare Advantage pricing at some point.  Again, the only thing that we can say about that is that our whole approach to a core business strategy is to create significant market, share positions in markets, etc., specifically and probably most importantly to create leverage in managed care negotiations.  So, it\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t be affected by those kinds of declines or whatever, but we certainly have at least a fairly strong negotiating position.  So, I think that has to be written.  Again, the good news from a pricing perspective which we wouldn\u2019t have necessarily predicted three or four months ago is that I don\u2019t think Medicaid will be nearly as big a pressure point going into 2009 because of all that money that the stimulus package makes available.", "(Margo Marta)", "Okay.  What percentage of acute care reimbursement is Medicaid and also of psychiatric, what percentage is Medicaid?", "Steve G. Filton", "On the acute side it\u2019s about 12% or 13% and on the behavioral side it\u2019s more like 25%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Rex from J.P. Morgan.", "John Rex - J.P. Morgan", "Just a couple of quick ones here; what exclusively have you built in for the \u201909 in terms of the Medicaid reimbursement outlook, in particular for states that have announced or were you to expect reductions and how you\u2019ve offset that against the stimulus provisions?", "Steve G. Filton", "John, I think we for a while have said that our expectations from Medicaid price increases in \u201909 was 0% to 2%, and I think the way things were going towards the latter end of \u201908, we were worried about being able to stay in that range even in the lower end of that range.  I think from our perspective what the stimulus package monies do is allow us much greater comfort to think that we can get into that 0% to 2% range.  More specifically, I think we feel like the cuts that have already been announced we\u2019re assuming will remain in place although if some of them are restored that\u2019ll be a plus, but I think our assumption is that from here on out we really won\u2019t see any further cuts where the states won\u2019t have to make further cuts because this money will be available to them.", "John Rex - J.P. Morgan", "How did you handle California with their recent action?", "Steve G. Filton", "California implemented Medicaid cut back in July of \u201908.  Certainly that cut is reflected in our guidance.  They have in the recent budget that\u2019s passed further Medicaid cuts; our assumption is that those won\u2019t have to be enacted because the monies of the stimulus package provides.  I also think it\u2019s worth noting that our percentage of Medicaid business in California is less than our acute care average.  So, our exposure in that state from a Medicaid perspective is not as great as it is in some other places.", "John Rex - J.P. Morgan", "Any updated color commentary on the January and February volume trends; anything looking much the same essentially as you saw in the 4Q essentially; just any color commentary on that.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think as everyone is aware, we had this mechanical issue of one less day in February this year.  So that certainly is just a cosmetic thing, but generally I think we\u2019re just seeing a continuation of the same trends, softness in volumes on both sides of the business, but not terribly dramatic; I know again, this is not the question you\u2019re asking, but I probably should have mentioned when some other people asked questions about guidance; we are finding a little bit more operating leverage in both businesses, I think you clearly saw that in the fourth quarter, the operators as I mentioned in the third quarter did a good job, again in the fourth quarter of controlling expenses, and I think that the one positive about this economic environment, it\u2019s hard to find any positive, but the one positive is that this sort of deflationary environment has allowed us to control wage rates and other operating costs in a way that in all honesty 6 or 7 months ago we probably wouldn\u2019t have imagined we\u2019d be able to do.  So, I think volumes are going to continue to be soft, but our leverage point on volumes is probably than we would have thought a while ago.", "John Rex - J.P. Morgan", "So you expect that line item to maybe show a little better in \u201909 than when it gets down to the salaries and wages line?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think so.  In the sense, when you say better, I think in the sense that what we would have projected to be our rate of increase in wages 5, 6, or 7 months ago is clearly slower today.  I don\u2019t mean to imply that wages are going down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert LaGaipa from Oppenheimer & Co.", "Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Two question; I guess one relates with the healthcare plan of the President\u2019s budget.  You talked several times about volume improvement as a result of extended coverage, and I guess my question is related to the margin end of things.  Obviously, part of the plan is flat fee admissions into hospitals including 30 days of followup care.  What\u2019s your expectation in terms of margins as a result of the plan, if you have any thus far?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think the devil is in the details Robert, and I think until we see some more precise details it would be difficult for us to tell you what we would expect to happen to margins.  As (Margo) I think just asked before, we don\u2019t even know what our Medicare market basket increase will be next year.  So, it\u2019s very difficult to say.  And by the way, I am not sure we did say that we expected volume improvements from extended coverage.  I think we just generally have said that we think extended coverage is a good thing in a business where bad debts run 10% or 12% of revenues on the acute side and charity care is more than that, and that certainly having more people with healthcare coverage is a good thing, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve tried to take a stab at all at how that would impact volumes in any sort of precise way.", "Robert LaGaipa - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Fair enough, and just one quick followup; this relates to pricing expectations in terms of the guidance for this year.  Is there any variability we should be aware of moving forward in relation to this forecast, and where would it come from?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think, almost by definition, of course there is variability and I think if you look at what it has been in the most recent past, I think it\u2019s probably a decent guide.  I think the pricing has held together pretty well over the past year and our expectation again with the Medicaid relief and the SCHIP relief that Alan referred to.  I think we feel like our pricing is likely to hold and I think that the variability is likely to come on the volume side, that\u2019s been the case.  We think that volume declines will be relatively modest or the growth on the behavioral side will be relatively modest, but that\u2019s a variability.  Then, the uncompensated care component has probably been the single greatest most volatile metric in the entire acute care business for a number of years now and I suspect it will continue to be particularly in a difficult economy.  So, I think that\u2019s where the variability is likely to occur if it does.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Englander from Standard & Poor\u2019s.", "Jeffrey Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "A quick question, and I apologize if you\u2019ve covered this in your prepared remarks; I hopped in a little late.  First in terms of Mental Health Parity which kicks in in October, any meaningful impact from that?", "Steve G. Filton", "Jeff, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s something we can say in any sort of precise way, but it\u2019s one of those things that can only be a good thing for us, but I don\u2019t think we have enough data points or enough of a database to be able to say that there is this universe of people who have been unable to seek care in the past because their behavioral benefits didn\u2019t measure up to their acute care benefits, but presumably, there is some universe and we will have the advantage of having those people covered.  It really gets back t this question of more people covered by more health insurance can only be a good thing for the provider community and Mental Health Parity provides that.  So, we think it\u2019s a plus, but it would be impossible for us to tell you what the precise impact is.", "Jeffrey Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "The other question is on your competitor\u2019s call yesterday they mentioned that they had had some experience with higher rates per claim on the liability side, and I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us any color about what your experience has been on a per-claim basis in terms of that same element.", "Steve G. Filton", "I\u2019m not sure that I have or actually I\u2019m sure that I don\u2019t have the claim-level data available to me right now.  I will say this and make couple of comments just about malpractice experience.  Obviously, first of all because we have our two businesses, the bulk of our malpractice expense is associated with our acute care business, and then just in terms of our historical experience, we\u2019ve always been pretty transparent in what we disclose about our malpractice experience.  Our cash flow statement shows both the amount of malpractice expense we provide and the cash claims that we pay out, and if you look at least over the last three years the amount that we provide exceeds the amount that we paid out by at least $10 million a year, and in many cases by substantially more than that.  So, we\u2019re very comfortable with the levels of expense and the levels of reserves in malpractice.", "Jeffrey Englander - Standard & Poor\u2019s", "The question really was if there was any increase in terms of the general levels of payout amounts on the claims, in a broad sense, not down to specific claim level.", "Steve G. Filton", "I would think just from a trending perspective we actually had a favorable malpractice adjustment back in the second quarter of 2007 and I would say that since then our experience has been largely favorable.  So, we certainly are not anticipating any catch-up adjustments or anything like that.  I think, at a minimum our reserves have certainly sufficiently and fairly stayed in.", "Alan B. Miller", "I don\u2019t think you can approach this on just a broad basis.  I think there\u2019s a quality aspect to this as well, and all provision of services are not the same having to do with quality.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton", "We thank everybody for their time and we\u2019ll talk to you again fairly soon at the end of the first quarter.  Thank you.", "Operator", "This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

I\u2019m Brent Turner, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration, for Psychiatric Solutions, and I would like to welcome you to PSI\u2019s Conference Call for the first Quarter of 2009.", "Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning today through May 15, by dialing 719-457-0820.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "At this time, for our opening remarks, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joey Jacobs.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thank you Brent and good morning. Thanks for being with us today. PSI produced solid results for the first quarter of 2009. Our revenue increased 6.3%, and income from continuing operations grew 11.1%. Overall, our same-facility results were inline with expectations with 3.4% growth in revenues and a same-facility EBITDA margin in excess of 20%.", "We continued to generate substantial cash flow from operations and we used our free cash flow to reduce debt. As you recall from our fourth quarter conference call, we indicated that our first quarter same-facility growth was likely to be in the low-single-digits. We were pleased to see the census levels improve in March above January and February. In addition our same-facility revenues reflect \u2013 reflected having one fewer day in the first quarter of last year as well as the admissions hold in Chicago.", "Together, these two factors had an impact of same-facility revenue and patient days totaling nearly 200 basis points. In regards to our Chicago facility, we are continuing to meet and work with the Division of Children and Family Services. Our leadership team at the facility is doing a great job of demonstrating that we are providing consistent and effective care for our patients in keeping them safe.", "There have been no significant incidents at Riveredge since August 2008. In fact we\u2019ve initiated a number of excellent programs at the facility, and we believe the quality of care provided by the facility is better than ever. As we look towards the remainder of 2009, we are encouraged that the improvement in March census, has carried over thus far in April. This improvement supports our expectations, for an increase in same-facility revenue to the mid single-digit range, as does the continued addition of new beds to existing facilities.", "We expect same-facility EBITDA margin to benefit from improved same-facility revenue and from our continuing initiatives to enhance the contribution of each facility. As a result, we have affirmed our established guidance, which anticipates earnings growth of 17 to 21% for this year.", "With substantial cash flow and low maintenance capital expenditure requirements, we believe we are well positioned to continue to \u2013 we are prepared to continue to position PSI for the long-term adding new beds to capacity-constrained facilities and using free cash flow for further debt reductions. We will continue our initiatives to enhance the top and bottom line performance of each facility. And we are intensifying our focus on investment in providing our patients the highest quality of care.", "In closing, I\u2019ll add that on a longer-term basis, we remain confident about our growth potential based on the strong industry dynamics and our position as the country\u2019s leading in-patient provider. Demand continues to grow at a faster pace than supply in an industry that remains highly fragmented. Given both mental health parity and the national drive to lower healthcare costs, we believe the focus on addressing mental health issues promptly and comprehensively will only strengthen. So based on our strength today and compelling long-term industry trends, we believe we are well positioned to manage PSI for the long-term benefit of all our stakeholders.", "Thank you again for your time this morning, and now Jack Polson our Chief Accounting Officer will review our financial results in more detail.", "Jack Polson", "", "Thank you, Joey and good morning. PSI\u2019s revenue for the first quarter of 2009 was $450.4 million, up 6.3% from $423.8 million for the comparable 2008 quarter. Income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders increased 9.9% to $27.8 million, while income from continuing operations attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, rose 11.1% to $0.50.", "Our growth in revenue for the quarter was produced primarily by a 3.4% increase in same-facility revenue, which was consistent with our guidance. This increase included a 2.8% increase in revenue per patient day and a 0.5% increase in patient days. Our lower same-facility revenue growth affected same-facility EBITDA margin as did the increase in our insurance reserves. At 20.4% for the quarter the margin declined 70 basis points from 21.1% for the first quarter last year. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 2.7% to $78.1 million.", "In addition to the factors mentioned, adjusted EBITDA also reflected a transition to our new Rolling Hills facility in Franklin, Tennessee, from the Nashville Rehab facility, which affected margins by approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. PSI\u2019s net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased to $40.3 million for the latest quarter from $12.3 million for the first quarter of 2008.", "Capital expenditures totaled $24.7 million, primarily for the addition of new beds and maintenance costs. We applied cash and free cash flow to debt reduction, to lower total debt by $40.8 million from our debt level at year-end 2008. As a result debt-to-total capitalization improved to 50% \u2013 58% at the end of the first quarter of 2009 from 59.6% at year-end 2008 and 62.4% at the end of the first quarter last year.", "Total debt to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter improved to four times from 4.3 at year-end. As a final note, we have affirmed our financial guidance for 2009 earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in a range of $2.24 to $2.32, which represents an increase of 17 to 21% compared with 2008. The company\u2019s guidance does not include the impact from any future acquisitions.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Sarah, would you please open the floor for any questions?", "", "Question-and-Answer Section", "", "Operator", "Certainly (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go first to Ryan Daniels, William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Yeah, good morning guys. A couple quick housekeeping questions, first on the financials. I noticed the supply costs were down actually pretty nicely year-over-year even on the good revenue growth. Is there anything there unusual during the quarter or is that something we should anticipate kind of being under check for the remainder of the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think Ryan, that was a good quarter for us. We did get a rebate check from our purchasing group that was a little bit larger than I thought we expected, than we were expecting. We have been working for over a year on drug costs and dietary costs. So January was a good month for us for supply costs, and I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into just one month and more use historical percentages there, but I would like to see it slightly tick down as we go.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I think Jack mentioned the 40 basis points of margin pressure from the relocation of Rolling Hills. Is that something that is going to continue a little bit into the second quarter? Or is that pretty much done and we\u2019re through that pressure?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "The Rolling Hills/Nashville Rehab project, we brought that hospital online in the middle of January. That project during the first quarter lost $1.6 million.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We expect that to breakeven during the second quarter. It still will put some margin pressure; it\u2019s still going to be below the company\u2019s margin.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "But, the first goal is to get it to breakeven, and we think that\u2019s going to happen. Right now the Rolling Hills hospital is at 50% occupancy, and we\u2019ve been open about 90 days. So of the 80 beds we\u2019ve got \u2013 already got 40 of those beds full. So, we\u2019re pleased with where it\u2019s at. So, but it did put pressure on our margins.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Right. And then the cash flow, my last financial question looks very strong in the first quarter. I know that\u2019s typically a weaker quarter. It looks like good working capital management, but anything else there that was unique to drive that so far above net income during the period?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Not really, Ryan. It\u2019s obviously our working capital was the real big difference, the working capital management. Coming off of 2008 a little bit of difference would have been first quarter; we typically pay our performance-based cash, incentive cash bonuses. And obviously with our lower performance in 2008 that outflow was less in our first quarter of 2009.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay. That makes sense. Then maybe a couple of bigger ones and I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. I know you guys have talked about previously some states maybe tightening utilization a little bit, especially on the RTC sides and shifting settings in it. We\u2019ve heard at least anecdotally that with the stimulus some of that has lessened and I\u2019m curious if you have seen that, and if maybe that\u2019s one of the drivers behind improving census in March and April, after the stimulus was passed and the states got those funds?", "Brent Turner", "", "Ryan, what I can give you is that, if you take February the 29 out of the first quarter, for \u201808, and look at the growth over the same period of time, the same number of days, our acute volume was up 2.5% and our residential volume was up 0.6. So both were in positive territory and so, you get back to one that way it\u2019s down to 1.6 growth, 6% growth in patient days and that\u2019s the 0.5 that we reported, plus the 110 basis points for the leap year day.", "So, we had good growth in the first quarter. Really March was strong for us, but both areas of our business had growth in the business. We do believe the stimulus money has helped. We know it\u2019s helped all the states\u2019 Medicaid budgets. So, we see it in those stats; so we were positive across the board on increase in service.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful data, and then last question and I\u2019ll hop off. Just in regards to Q2, if we think about it, obviously it\u2019s still a difficult year to comp. I know Easter shifted into Q2 so, we should we be thinking of that as maybe the lower level of the remaining quarters on a same store basis. Is that a fair assumption given the Easter shift and the one more quarter headwind from Riveredge that we should see that lower and then maybe rebounding a bit back half of the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Absolutely, Easter was in April and the Riveredge comp gets better in the third quarter. But as we\u2019ve said in our press release even though April, Easter was in April. We\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve got great census numbers for April and similar to March\u2019s trend so we\u2019re pleased with the census demand for the services in April, but you\u2019re right on both assumptions. Easter was in April and Riveredge will comp better in the third quarter.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "", "Okay, maybe a little more, a little more pressure but still down at mid single-digits?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes.", "Ryan Daniels \u2013 William Blair", "Great thanks a lot, nice quarter guys.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next from Robert W. Baird, we\u2019ll hear from Whit Mayo.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thanks, good morning. Joey, I just wanted to get your update on the Joint Commission\u2019s Core Measure scores. We\u2019ve heard the pilot testing has ended, but do you have an update as to the timing of when the National Quality Forum may actually endorse those measures? Is there any word on milestones we should be aware of at this point, and do you have a sense for how many providers will participate?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "First I think they will reach agreement in the second quarter on the core measurements. And then it will be, Joint Commission will need to ramp up to roll them out. So I personally don\u2019t see anything happening before October 1 from Joint Commission, when they would release the data on core measures. Now quite frankly, it\u2019s across all the industry so everybody would be reporting the seven core measurements out, and we had 13 facilities that worked on the pilot project.", "And we have for, since January 1 of this year, we have been very aggressive in our communication and education in looking at those scores for the whole company; and if you were to visit at one of our facilities you would come across the seven core measurements posted prominently on a display and what the scores are and how they\u2019re doing and how they\u2019re trending so, but you will not \u2013 we will not see it publically I think the earliest would be October 1. It could actually slip to January 1. We\u2019ll just have to wait see. I think all that\u2019s fluid, but it still needs to be blessed by the NQF.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "Do you have a sense of how many providers will participate, when we see the aggregate scoring I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of how many providers?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think \u2013 now this is just me, I don\u2019t know the actual number. I\u2019ve got a feeling more than 250 are going to be in the database.", "", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and if I recall there were only 39 hospitals that participated in the pilot, and you had, how many 13?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "13.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "That\u2019s well over 30%, okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "So, we\u2019re 20% of the industry. We are the leaders so; obviously we wanted to take to a more active role in this process. So...", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "Okay, okay, now that\u2019s helpful and then maybe just on guidance for a second, recognizing historically the quarters tend to improve sequentially but you\u2019re starting the year at a run rate of only $2 of earnings and from where we stand this does require some significant improvement; not that it\u2019s unachievable. But can you just help us bridge the gap, and secondly what gives you the level of confidence at this point in time?", "Jack Polson", "", "Okay the first is please note that the Rolling Hills/Nashville Rehab project rose from a $1.6 million to breakeven in the quarter. From the first quarter to the second quarter in comparisons. The biggest drivers is going to be revenue. It appears that we\u2019re going to have 81 more, 8,100 more patient days as compared to the first quarter sequentially. And the way I get to that number is I take the average daily census for the first quarter, and it was 7,650, and it appears that in April, we\u2019re going to average about 7,920 to 7,930. And that\u2019s 270 patients a day more than the first quarter.", "And if you\u2019ll multiply that by the 30 days in the month of April. And you get somewhere over 8,000, 8,100. You get, so we are projecting that sequentially for April we\u2019re going to have 8,000 to 8,200 more patient days as compared to the first quarter average. So if we could keep that trend through May and June you can do the math on the revenues. The revenues sequentially would be growing nicely from the second quarter to the third quarter. And now what gives me comfort is that a third of the quarter is already over with. We have a good visibility on April so there is only 62 days left in this quarter. So that helps me there.", "There are some cost reductions that I think, are going to be occurring in the second quarter; so we\u2019ll be picking up some basis points there. I do expect the EBITDA margin to come back and exceed 21% for the second quarter. So, that should be enough. We, I think, on data points using through April 30, that gives us comfort to reaffirm the guidance.", "And what we\u2019re seeing and with the new beds, we built 80 new beds in the first quarter; 74 of those were acute and six of those were RTCs. So we had 80 beds come online in the first quarter. We\u2019ve got 151 beds coming online in the second quarter; 136 of those beds are acute beds with 15 being RTC beds. And the biggest project of those 151 beds is already online. That\u2019s a California facility that we\u2019ve got online. So, we feel good about the beds that we built in January and the beds \u2013 I meant the first quarter and the beds that we\u2019re building in the second quarter.", "So that plus the factors I\u2019ve previously given you; we\u2019ve got our fingers crossed. There are 62 more days to go to the second quarter, but as of today, that\u2019s how we see the second quarter.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right.", "Jack Polson", "", "And you can work through your model, and I think you\u2019ll see that earnings per share growth, grows nicely for the second quarter. I\u2019m not giving you all the positives that are in our model, but I\u2019ve given you lot of things, a lot of the assumptions that we are using.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "", "I appreciate all the details. That\u2019s the best explanation I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019ll go ahead and jump back in the queue. Thanks.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll hear from Kevin Campbell, Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Thanks. Just to follow up on that last question, you had mentioned some cost reductions. Is there anything more specific you can provide as it relates to that or is it just going to be more along the dietary and drug costs or is there something else that you\u2019re doing?", "Jack Polson", "", "I think we\u2019re going to see cost reductions in some of the larger areas too, so, which are other expense, professional fee expense, and salaries and wages. Just by the sheer fact that we\u2019re growing the patients days, we will become more productive. And so, I think there was some cost in this. We did not in January, we did not adjust the core staffing of our facilities, just because of the census was weak there in the first part of January and first part of February. And so, and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t because the census came back strong in March and is strong in April. So, you\u2019ll see improvements, should see improvements as a percent of net revenue in most of those expense areas.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay, could you comment too, on the Residential Treatment Center side of the business. I guess one of your competitors had mentioned yesterday on their call that they\u2019re seeing some pressures on utilization there, average length of stay, et cetera. Have you witnessed that at all, and I know that your average length of stay came down sequentially in, was that a result of that or was it just more mix shift towards more acute, et cetera as it has been in the past?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well, obviously, if you remember, if you adjust for February 29 out of the numbers, acute grew 2.5 and obviously that has a length of stay of 10 days, and residential patient days grew 0.6. So that\u2019s what made our total length of stay come down. There was just small movement in the length of stay downward, but nothing, nothing that I would build as a trend, or anything significant. It was more of a mix issue for the company.", "", "Brent Turner", "", "And Kevin this is Brent. We \u2013 when you look at our RTC census, we\u2019ve actually increased census on the RTC side every month through April this year. So while the first of the year started out very slow as we indicated, it has improved each month since then.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Great. Could you also comment on pricing? It was basically flat sequentially, which was a little unusual, was there any driver there?", "Joey Jacobs", "50 basis points came to us from the phase out of PPS. So the total number was impacted 50 basis points by PPS. We\u2019re phased in now. So that would have been a half a point there. We\u2019ve seen nothing. We see the stimulus bill helping all the states\u2019 Medicaid budgets. And the states have still been pretty quiet about what they are going to do with rate increases for Medicaid and for the psych services.", "So, we are already fixed until July 1 for those services. So, we\u2019ve got our fingers crossed here. We do expect Medicare to give us a 3% cost of living increase July 1. So, that\u2019s our expectations there. So, a little mix, a little intensity among the payers in the first quarter. The 50 basis points from impact of being phased into PPS. So, we\u2019ll just wait and see how that trends in the second quarter. So, but we\u2019ve not heard anything significant on reductions and reimbursement in any of our states.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay. And last question could you comment on the Riveredge Hospital and maybe your efforts to diversify your referral base? And how that\u2019s been effective or not?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well it\u2019s a beginning process. We are remodeling, the facility we were putting several million dollars into remodeling and updating the facility while the census has been down. I\u2019m pleased to know that our Intensive Treatment Unit came back online yesterday 12 beds, that we had down for renovations. We run slightly over a 100 patient days there at Riveredge, and the care is very good. Carey Carlock and her team are doing a wonderful job there. And we\u2019re telling our story to the Division of Children and Family Services there, and so we\u2019re working through that process, but we do, this time next year we do think we will have more adult patients there than we had in 2009.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay. Thank you very much", "Operator", "And from Raymond James, we\u2019ll hear from John Ransom.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Hi, good morning. Can you give us an update on United, that acquisition?", "Joey Jacobs", "United Medical?", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Yeah", "Joey Jacobs", "Those five facilities, the Kentucky facilities are doing fantastic. We are actually expanding the facility at Dupont. We just got an approval to build 20 beds there. And we\u2019ll be bringing those 20 beds online by the end of the year. So, Kentucky is doing extremely well. The Ocala facility was a startup out of that group in Ocala, and it\u2019s doing, it is ramping up and it can do better, but it\u2019s ramping up and we are very pleased with how things are going there.", "Our Wekiva facility is going to a transition to more acute beds there. And we have big hopes for that. Our Jacksonville facilities has been a little disappointing, but we\u2019ve got plans and actions there. So overall the UMC transaction, we\u2019re absolutely pleased with those five facilities that we bought this time last year, and I expect great things to continue and more expansions for those facilities.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Okay thanks. And secondly, I know you\u2019ve had a number, you had, what, 13 of your hospitals in this core measure pilot for a year. Have you found that just the process of posting these measurements and reinforcing that, has that caused an actual change in the quality, in how these measurements are achieved? I\u2019m not asking this question very well, but just about the fact that you\u2019re measuring and then publicizing it. Does just that very fact, does it cause the needle to move measurably in terms of the quality scores?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "John absolutely, any time you take seven specific core measurements and start posting them and putting the score in there every month and putting a goal there for them every month. And then we\u2019re displaying them in the most visible place in the hospital for our employees, usually their break rooms or where they check in or where their information boards are at. So if they see them, the board is like a four by six board that\u2019s on the wall that has these scores.", "And so absolutely, that by itself brings a lot of attention to those areas. Now, there is some debate about the seven core measurements, do they actually raise quality or is it just gathering of information. I think over time it will raise quality. It does, absolutely, do a better job of documentation of what\u2019s happening with the patient.", "So, yes to all of your questions, but it\u2019s a beginning process and we\u2019ve been tracking and posting ours since January. We did not do any posting or tracking during the pilot days, but starting January of this year we have started tracking and posting. As you know, if you\u2019ll measure it, it gets attention and so, and in the end it will be better quality for our patients.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "And I guess, this is probably not an easy question or maybe it\u2019s unanswerable, but when you talk to, if you get sideways with a state, over a facility with a patient, do you think over time the debate will migrate into a more global quality discussion? Or is it still going to be kind of a highly charged politically driven focus on patients, specific patient incidents. Do you think the state is going to start buying into this stuff or are they just going to see it as well this is just a nice way to try to put a gloss on something, but we\u2019re still going to focus on this patient or that patient and media counts and that sort of things?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I think the \u2013 because Joint Commission and the National Quality Forum are behind this effort, it brings legitimacy to it. It will never replace the responsibility of the local and state agencies to investigate incidents, and unfortunately we will always be incident driven. You could have the best core measurement scores and then have a incident, and they have the responsibility of making, tracking that incident. And obviously it helps if the documentation is better and whatever, but it would not take away their responsibility to investigate incidents. So, but five years from now, it may be different.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "And I guess the last question I have on this is, have you, they always say it\u2019s not the crime so to so speak, it\u2019s the cover up. Have you learned anything when you\u2019ve had an incident? Has there been any internal learning to try to maybe overkill the response to it on the front-end versus, I guess, that the report that came out gave this solution \u2013 gave this perception that maybe, you guys weren\u2019t as responsible on the front end of these things. Has there has been any change to respond to these that might allay some of the fears they get bubbled up at the state level.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "John, I think we are very proactive in providing a safe environment. We have mock surveys going on. We have environmental specialists going to the facilities. We have nurse specialists going through the facilities. All of our CEOs take it very serious. However when an incident does occur, we do marshal additional resources to investigate the incident and to take any correction actions that may happen.", "So, just like in any business, if you have an incident or something like that, you do marshal extra resources. Now, can you \u2013 is that a negative? I don\u2019t think so. But some people may think it\u2019s a negative, but I don\u2019t think so.", "Some anecdotal evidence of the quality our facilities, we\u2019re providing. This is from one of our facilities in the Northeast. We were told that Aetna was coming out to do a presentation on June the 2. But apparently we were ill-advised. They showed up this morning; this is April 21. A team of people with the General Manager gathered our management team, and we met for about 90 minutes. They conveyed to us that they decided to start doing this recognition, because they just couldn\u2019t believe the improvement in compliance scores we were attaining and how far ahead of the pack they were. We\u2019ll be 30% ahead of the other 27 hospitals, that this Aetna program looks at, we were number one. And they came out unexpectedly to reward this facility for the great job and quality of care that it does.", "So, we get those kinds of things, all the time and I would encourage again everybody to go to our website. If you\u2019ll click on quality, it will take you to seven more sites of PSI where you can go in and check in on our accreditation scores, recent achievements, testimonial from our patients, and from \u2013 we just won a recognition award this week from Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, about the support and care that our facility is giving to the troops.", "So, I would encourage all of you all, to go there and check in on the positive things that we are doing there. Our online education, university goes live May 30 in the pilot form. And May 30 of next year, we will have all of our 23,000 employees being able to go online, for education and training for the company. So, there is a lot of things that we do proactively that sometimes don\u2019t get recognized.", "But this was our facility, actually the facility is based in Philadelphia, and we are very pleased with that. And also if you\u2019ll go click on recent achievements or whatever, you\u2019ll find out that we do a Behavioral Education School in Brevard County in Florida. And they recently awarded us a five year contract, and we beat out two other companies that are based in the Philadelphia area for that service. Once again, we have lots of positives; but unfortunately, we do have incidents. And we do, we are committed to keeping the patients safe, and we do marshal the resources to implement quick action, if needed.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Right, well and then my last question. I know you\u2019re talking about a mid-single digit same-store number. Is that a structural change in your view? Or is that a 2009 change because of some of the unique things happening this year? Do you think it\u2019s a seven to nine over the intermediate term or do you think it\u2019s 5% now?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Now, John you\u2019re asking the most optimistic person in the world. I think, our second quarter is shaping up to be a good quarter. And all of our facilities will be in the same-store in the second quarter.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Right.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "So, with the patient day growth, once again we\u2019re only a third of the way into the quarter. But with our patient day growth so far, could that be some day us being in the seven to 9% ranges again? I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll publicly set that goal, but I can see us achieving seven to 9% revenue growth some time in the future.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "And what has been the \u2013 those were great numbers you gave out. I think the market loves the more transparency. What do you think has been the biggest census driver? I mean that\u2019s a big, over 200 patients in your facilities. I know you talked about specialty RTC weakness in early March, but what has been the biggest reversal, over the past six weeks in your census?", "Joey Jacobs", "Well, I think, it started in the middle of February I guess.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "The biggest thing is we\u2019ve had a lot of beds come online, and we built those beds to meet to the demand. And one of our Chief Operating Officers took on the special project of growing the RTC business.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "And I think we\u2019ve done an excellent job, on doing a better job telling our story to the referral sources that might be using the RTC business. So it\u2019s a combination of all those things. It\u2019s a combination of Brooke Glen being the best provider in the Aetna Network. That will get you more referrals.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Well, thanks for all the detail, Joey.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll hear from Kevin Campbell, Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners ", "", "Hi, I just wanted to follow up on the sequential improvement in earnings and not really as it relates to what you expect this quarter, but can you just remind us, I look back historically from \u201804 to \u201808, there almost is always a pretty big improvement from the first to the second quarter anywhere from three to $0.06. What has been the key driver for that historically?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Well I think it\u2019s always been patient days. I think we\u2019ve always run a higher occupancy probably in the second quarter, as compared to the first quarter. Once again, as you all know, holidays and how we come out of the holidays is important to us and, but however unusual to this year, Easter was in April. And we blew through that pretty good with demand for the services?", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay, and then one last question. Just real quick on your, floating rate debt, what \u2013 are you paying one month LIBOR right now? And what\u2019s the margin currently in as you pay down debt, where do you think it will go throughout the year?", "Jack Polson", "", "Sure, yeah we are paying one month LIBOR on our floating rate debt. The revolver is at 520, 5.25% over that LIBOR, and then the term loan is 1.75% over the 30-day LIBOR. So as we pay down debt obviously we will pay down the revolver piece, and that\u2019s at the 525 over. So, currently our mix of fixed to floating debt is about right at about 60% or so because that, as we, as you know we swapped a little bit of the term debt two years ago.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And from Piper Jaffray, Mark Arnold.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Good morning, just a couple. Most of my questions here have been answered, but your revenue per treatment was a little bit, revenue per patient day was a little bit lower in the quarter than I was expecting. And, it sounds like the acute side grew a little faster than the RTC side. So, is there anything going on there? Can you talk at all, maybe about trends in your outpatient volumes, anything with mix or anything there that would help explain the flat sequential revenue per patient day?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay the first quarter was impacted 50 basis points, because we are now fully phased in for PPS. So, that impact of not getting an annual increase January 1 for our PPS facilities caused a 50% basis, decrease for us here. It is, from what we have studied, it was just mix across the facilities that impacted the number in the first quarter a little softer than we thought. We\u2019ve not seen any major payer decreases at all. And so that\u2019s how we saw the first quarter, and that\u2019s how we researched it and \u2013 but the biggest impact there was the 50 basis points from no longer phasing in PPS.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay. But on a sequential basis, forget about the pricing increase growth just, I think you were at 585 versus 587, I think in Q4. When you say mix, are you talking about acuity of patients, not mix between the acute and RTC side of the business?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Acuity of patients does not drive revenue for us. They\u2019re all per diems, so you don\u2019t get extra money if the patient is more sick.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "So this is basically the mix in the acute versus RTC or it might be, we\u2019ve had more, we may have had more acute patients at, for example, this is an example $600 a day during the quarter than we were accustomed to having at $700 a day. That for some reason, there was some shift there so it\u2019s a mix inside the acute.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay, Okay the payer mix?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. And then just the other part of that question, can you talk at all about, in the facilities where you provide outpatient services any trends in outpatient volumes and are you seeing, maybe a shift toward or payers pushing patients toward more outpatient services versus inpatient admission?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Outpatient business for us is important, but it\u2019s much smaller. The outpatient business was up mid-single digits for the first quarter, but it\u2019s a very small number.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "For the company. Okay?", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. Just a couple final ones here, your EPS guidance, does it assume any additional debt pay downs throughout the rest of the year?", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure, it has a little bit of the revolver pay down as evidenced by just our free cash flow.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Okay. And then one final one. You mentioned one big facility, or bringing on a significant number of beds in California here that\u2019s already opened in Q2. Does that have any drag or opening or expanding significantly at a facility, does that have any drag on say your Q1 results in that facility?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It didn\u2019t have \u2013 this one did not at all, this was our Canyon Ridge facility where we basically doubled the size of the facility. And I don\u2019t think their earnings were hurt in the first quarter, because they were getting ready for this expansion to open up in the second quarter. The reason being that there was not a lot of construction in the ancillary services. The dietary was already big enough to handle the foodservice for these extra beds. So, I did not see that for Canyon Ridge or did not see that in the numbers. If it was, it was minor.", "Mark Arnold \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Great. Thank you, nice quarter.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll hear from Deutsche Bank\u2019s Darren Lehrich.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Thanks, good morning everyone. Just one housekeeping question before a few others. What is in the discontinued ops at this point? Just wanted to clarify if any facilities moved into that bucket this quarter, if you can just clarify what\u2019s in there?", "Jack Polson", "", "It is the Eltec facility in San Antonio, Texas. And it\u2019s been there since July of last year.

Okay and then, I guess, I wanted to just ask you, Joey, just to get your thoughts on if there is any updated CapEx guidance you could provide to us. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for where that money trends since it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re building any de novo\u2019s this year.

I guess I\u2019m aware of the project in New Jersey that\u2019s been in the local press that\u2019s essentially a rebuild. So, I\u2019m just wondering if there are more projects like that and therefore they\u2019re more costly on a per bed basis, in terms of the bed additions that you have going forward?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Summit is an outlier in the process, Darren. As you know it\u2019s taken us four years or three years to get through the zoning and getting ready for that project. That project is a 2010. I\u2019m trying to find it on the schedule. But that\u2019s going to be \u2013 when is it, Brent?", "Brent Turner", "", "2010.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "That\u2019s a 2010 project, and we\u2019re going to be building 24 additional beds there. So, I have not \u2013 I don\u2019t have that budget in front of me Darren, but it was, it did take a long time to get that project done, and it\u2019ll be a little bit more expensive just because it\u2019s in New Jersey, as you well know.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Sure. Okay so, but in general, what is your cost per bed to build at this point? I just want to get a sense maybe an update on that relative to where it\u2019s been.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It\u2019s going to be somewhere, Darren, it\u2019s going to somewhere between the 200 to $250,000 a bed. I\u2019m just \u2013 and that\u2019s just going back through my memory right now. It can be much less if we\u2019re just building a new wing, but if it\u2019s a tough construction state, it could be 200,000 a bed, 250. We built Rolling Hills for 250, 275, but that was a replacement hospital. Everything else will be less than that.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay fair enough. I appreciate all the detail here. Thanks again.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Hey Darren, before you leave, we\u2019ve got two new numbers for you.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "What\u2019s that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Licensed beds, licensed beds.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Well, I was going to take that off line, but I\u2019m happy to take it now.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "In the spirit of more disclosure, we\u2019ve got them for everybody.

Last quarter you talked about liability costs ticking up and you had that catch up charge. So, I just wanted to get a quick update in terms of your liability costs for you at the quarter?", "Brent Turner", "", "We think it\u2019s good for the quarter.

We feel good with what we expensed in the first quarter.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "And just can you help me just understand.

Okay and then just a couple of other small questions here. Just on the interest expense, I know there\u2019s been a few questions about the LIBOR rates and such, but how should we think about a quarterly number. You guys completed the refinancing, towards the end of February. So, as we think about this kind of quarterly interest expense, is there a certain range that we should we think about Brent.", "Brent Turner", "", "Sure, I would expect there\u2019d be about $19 million of interest expense for the second quarter, which is a slight uptick from the first quarter, but remember we only restructured the revolver and repriced it at the \u2013 we only saw that one month in the first quarter. So, when you work through that, that increased spread on the revolver. I think around just inside of $19 million would be our interest expense for the second quarter.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Great okay, and then just you broke out in terms of the impact of Riveredge on same-store revenues, but just curious as we think about the impact on margins in the quarter. Could you help us think about, what margins would have looked like, ex that? So, just trying to get a better sense in terms of what EBITDA margin.

So, and then just with respect to Riveredge as well, it sounded like you\u2019ve been very proactive in the last couple of months in trying to get things fixed there. I was just curious; the UIC report came out at the beginning of April. So, I was just curious, if there was any I guess impact on the facility, from that so have the trends there been stable so, I realize they\u2019re still down, and impacted results by 70 basis points.

And so we\u2019re using it as a discussion document and our folks are meeting and discussing with DCFS, just about on a weekly basis there. And demonstrating and showing to them the great job the team at Riveredge is doing and so it was a milestone that we had to get past. Adam and the census is still, it was 100 patients a day before the report and it\u2019s 100 days patients a day after the report.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay, great and then just another question here in terms of the RTC business and you spoke a little bit about that and Brent you made a comment that each month it\u2019s gotten better since the start of the year. And back to your previous comment about more disclosure, just curious in terms of the RTC business, the growth I guess that we know how the overall company grew same store, but the RTC same store growth be significantly different from the overall average or pretty similar. I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense just because you guys did call that out as being more impacted by the economy than the acute business, so just curious in terms of as when we think about growth rates?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "As we look at the first quarter Adam, it was 2.5% for the acute and 0.6 for the RTC. Obviously, building of the acute beds is helping that number. We did not build, and we are not building as many RTC numbers. So, that fact alone will not let RTC grow as fast as the acute business.

Maybe just some more additional detail on some of the things that have already been asked.

Maybe, we\u2019re using the wrong terminology, but you do have differential pricing for patients depending on sort of how specialized the program is that they\u2019re accessing, isn\u2019t that correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We have some of that, but it\u2019s very minor. What I should have said instead of \u2013 the correct words were the different payer mix, inside the acute business.

And even with Medicare patients, there is a very small change in the reimbursement rate due to complications in co-morbidities, very small. We do \u2013 we\u2019re per diem based and it\u2019s more of an all inclusive for all illness.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "So, when \u2013 when", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No matter what the diagnosis is.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "So, when you talk about \u2013 when you acquire a facility. How you bring in the specialized programs that\u2019s in order to attract the volume of patients; in other words, you can treat those patients that program doesn\u2019t necessarily get a higher per diem than other programs that were already in place when you bought a facility?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "That is correct. We\u2019re just bringing more volume to the business.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay, great. And then, I guess one more thing on Riveredge. Just from the point of view, you\u2019ve talked about the fact that you\u2019re now back in dialogue with DCFS. Lord knows no one wants you to try and put a date range on when you think something can be resolved. But in terms of how you would characterize the current dialogue, is it similar from what the dialogue you had in the past? In other words, is the viewpoint that you\u2019re moving towards a coordinated action plan that you\u2019re going to put in place and then DCFS, either with UIC or without will review that again and then you know a decision will be made?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I would hope that would be the outcome DCS \u2013 DCFS is in our facility every week and was before the hold and is after hold. So we have a good working relationship with them even during the hold. But they had to go through their process, which the biggest part of their process, was the report and they\u2019ve just now gotten the report. So, the amount of conversations between DCFS and Riveredge has increased. Obviously, the goal is that we would reach agreement and the hold would be lifted. And so we\u2019re working through that process and it\u2019s very sensitive and so, but we\u2019re working through that and so, we\u2019ll just keep you posted.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay and then finally just trying to get a little color overall on let\u2019s call it the risk management program. If you now look back at the past couple of years, and it\u2019s part of the business. You\u2019ve had some incidences at certain facilities that have very much been in the press. But if you look at those facilities now in hindsight, are there certain maybe warning signs or early warning signs that you\u2019ve now learned that hopefully you can use to look at other facilities that you have in your portfolio and maybe send in an early action team or something like that? How does that work overall?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Absolutely we\u2019re more sensitive to early indicators, absolutely. Absolutely we\u2019re more aware; we\u2019re more sensitive to early indicators. We\u2019re more sensitive to making sure we have the resources in place for them, making sure that we have the right \u2013 we\u2019re decentralized. We expect a lot of our Chief Executive Officers, and one of those responsibilities is to have a quality facility. So, we are more sensitive to the front end and to early indications of something might be occurring.", "Andreas Dirnagl \u2013 Stephens Inc.", "", "Okay great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And from Longbow Research, David Bachman.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of quick questions that we haven\u2019t touched on already or want to revisit. I just, we\u2019ve been hearing from a few different places that there may be this secular pressure on utilization or length of stay, more as a secular trend and looking at alternatives to residential treatment. And I just want to get your take on that and if you don\u2019t really see that as perhaps a threat on a longer term basis and if it is, how positioned are you to maybe steer the business to capture whatever those alternatives might be?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Many of the patients that are in our RTC facilities today, 10 years ago would actually be in a hospital; the intensity of that patient would qualify them to be an admission in the hospital. Over time, the RTC facilities have taken on more acutely ill child and adolescents basically.", "Can you move them to outpatients? Yes you can. Is that a goal that everybody should have is that the patients gets well enough to move to an outpatient setting to be closer to home and to support systems? Absolutely, we\u2019re all for that. That is a very much a long-term effort, and we have in certain states Virginia, Oklahoma, we have in certain states we have large group homes, foster homes, Puerto Rico extension of care there already. So, we at PSI has several of our facilities that are doing that. And can we do more of that? Yes.", "But once again, the acuity of the patient in the RTC facility today is something that would have been in a hospital 10 years ago, is a patient that would have been in a hospital 10 years ago. So it\u2019s hard for me to visualize these people being in an outpatient setting until they improve in a residential setting first.", "And then once that happens, absolutely we\u2019re all in favor of that child and adolescent going home. We hope there is a home environment for them, if not a foster home or group home or something. We\u2019d like for them to be back in their local school, and we do have that continuum of care in many, in several of our facilities in several of our states. So that\u2019s our stated objective.", "David Bachman", "", "Okay that\u2019s very helpful color on that front. And then just two other questions here on the intake and marketing side in terms of interfacing with referral sources, have there been any kind of renewed efforts there or any changes maybe over the past few months as, maybe related to the economy or stepping up efforts there? And then on the, I know it\u2019s small, but the EAP slice of the business just any updates on what you\u2019re seeing in that business? Thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Okay on the RTC referral development side of the business, two years ago it was a local responsibility for the CEOs in their facilities during the past two years and especially during the past 12 months we have created an additional corporate service for that. That helps our facilities, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been the biggest impact for us is having a corporate service covering the country. For that matching up the child with the right appropriate facility and service. So, I think that\u2019s working well there and your last question part was?", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "EAP.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "EAP. We continue to sell contracts. We just brought on Blue Cross of Montana. I think it\u2019s Montana. We do lose a few contracts. It\u2019s a very much a needed service and actually some of our larger EAP vendor contracts are asking us for additional services and additional project \u2013 products, which we\u2019re creating for them. So, it\u2019s a good book of business. And there is some growth there, but it\u2019s small. But we\u2019re very pleased with Cindy Sherif and her team and the excellent work they are doing.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay and just one last question. Just again we\u2019re seeing bad debt provisions, in line with historical, where it\u2019s been historically for you. Any other update or just color on that piece of the business?", "Jack Polson", "", "No, no, really, more than half of our businesses that are child and adolescents, and they don\u2019t have deductibles or copays. And so, this industry had preauthorization since the early 90s; so bad debts, we think will continue to be in that 2% range.", "David Bachman \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Excellent. Well we appreciate all the, all the good information and color today.", "Jack Polson", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll next hear from A.J. Rice, Soleil Securities.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Thanks. I have just a couple of follow ups and then one broader question. Obviously the UIC report, which thanks for the comments on, was mainly targeted for the benefit of the Illinois authorities since they\u2019re in discussions with you. But I just was \u2013 it\u2019d be remiss if we didn\u2019t ask you, has it prompted any other inquiries from any other regulatory bodies or payers. Has that changed the discussion in any way with anybody else that we should know about?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "None at all.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Could we get a call or a question just like you\u2019ve given us one? Yes.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Right.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Has it impacted any relationships? No.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay, and then just maybe to try to comment to Adam\u2019s question a little differently on the general liability area. Has there just been claims filed or size of claims you\u2019re seeing, has there been any material change in the last quarter versus what you had in the fourth quarter?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We have seen none there. And once again, last year it was not \u2013 we projected a number of claims we received. We were right on top of that number. What slipped up on us was the average settlement went up about $30,000 a settlement, which \u2013 if you could see the size of our settlements, it\u2019s a percent increase there. Once again the settlements are very small.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay, and then just finally, on the cash flow projections for this year, it looks like cash flow from ops is about $40 million rounded. Free cash flow after the $25 million or so of CapEx, is about $15 million in the first quarter. As you already mentioned, second quarter, tends to be seasonally stronger than first; third quarter seasonally weaker than first.", "Should we annualize the free cash flow number for the first quarter? It gives you $60 million. Is that a good number to think about for free cash flow this year or can you give us any help on that? I know you gave us CapEx at $120 to $140 million.", "Brent Turner", "That\u2019s right. A.J., it\u2019s Brent. We would expect, we\u2019ve always said our net income times number of shares, our net income plus the non-cash stock comp, which I think based on the midpoint of our range, those would be in the 160, $180 million range combined and that\u2019s what we get about. We\u2019ve forecasted about $50 to $60 million of true free cash flow after growth and maintenance capital for the year. So, the first quarter was very, very robust and probably, it would be a little optimistic to assume we\u2019re going do that, that level for each quarter going forward.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Right. And did you \u2013 do you give the breakout between routine and what you\u2019re calling development CapEx?", "Brent Turner", "", "Absolutely. The maintenance capital this quarter was just a little over 2%. It was 2.3%, and the balance was expansion. That\u2019d be about 3.1%. Those are percentages of revenue.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay and then maybe I\u2019ll just ask this last one then. On acquisitions, you made the point as you always do that there is no acquisitions in the guidance. Are we still sort of on hold a little bit on acquisitions, but you\u2019ve got the refinancing, which needs to be done? Are you looking at things again or \u2013 where do you stand with that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "There is not going to be any acquisitions in the first quarter of new facilities. Our two development people are out looking at facilities for potential acquisitions. We need the credit markets to stabilize some more and our goal is to continue to pay down the debt and build beds at are in our existing facilities; and we\u2019ll revisit this A.J., with you all in the \u2013 in July when we talk about the second quarter numbers. We\u2019ll be in a better position to talk about the possibility of acquisitions and that sort of thing, but nothing in the second quarter. But we are looking; we do still visit and look at facilities.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 Soleil Securities", "", "Okay, all right, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our last question today will come from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Sorry, can you hear me now?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Hey Gary, this is Joey.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Hey, how are you doing?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Good.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "A few quick ones. When we look at length of stay year-over-year in the same store numbers down half a day, is that \u2013 is there a facility-specific issue like a Rolling Hills type thing? Does that RTC showing up? Is there anything obvious on that half day?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No, not it all.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It is just the mix of the acute versus RTC length of stay flowing through; both of them I think. Like on the acute length of stay for the first quarter as compared to last year, I think it was down one-tenth of a day. And then on the residential, it might have been just down one day. I think the length of stay there is, I don\u2019t know the exact number; it could be like 140 going to 139. Nothing significant other than the mix of the patients driving the length of stay down.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Now what\u2019s your \u2013 what is your ballpark acute length of stay now?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "The length of stay is between nine to ten days.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay. And you were talking about earlier just kind a range of per diem payments on the acute care side roughly six to $700 per day. Can you remind us on the RTC side, what a range might be?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "They would be in the \u2013 they average about 330. So give or take 40 bucks each way, I would say. They average I think about 330, 340.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay. Brent, on the balance sheet the allowance as a percent of gross AR has been stable; it actually improved some sequentially. Has there been any change in terms of timing on write-offs? Can you just remind us when you\u2019ve got an account that\u2019s fully reserved when you actually write that off the balance sheet is that at 180 days or 360?", "Jack Polson", "", "I think that\u2019s \u2013 this is Jack. I think that\u2019s more of a function of as we acquire facilities, we\u2019re reluctant to have them write-off too quickly. And as they mature with PSI and as we integrate them, we become more comfortable in the assessment of those claims that are aging out. And with the acquisitions slowing down, we\u2019re seeing them follow PSI processes more closely.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "So, that means, I\u2019m not sure I follow you.", "Jack Polson", "", "Okay what you saw in the previously was a little bit of growth in that because we\u2019re reluctant to have them write-off too quickly, new acquisitions write-off to quickly.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Got it.", "Jack Polson", "", "We wanted to properly assess those things and make sure that they\u2019re following our processes. Now that they\u2019ve been with us for a time, we\u2019re following our processes. It\u2019s not an acceleration overall for PSI. It\u2019s just we\u2019re more comfortable with bringing them onboard our process and writing them, writing them off in due course.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay, I mean, the number looks, the number looks good. I\u2019m not pointing it out of as an area of concern. Is there \u2013 can you tell us for a core PSI facility at what point you would write-off a fully reserved account or does it vary by payer or essentially by market?", "Jack Polson", "", "The latter two, it varies by payer; it varies by facility, and what kind of patients that facility is seeing. So to say, that there is a good example of one, there is not.", "Brent Turner", "", "However Gary you need to be careful here that, there is rules concerning writing off Medicare bad debts that you have to have them returned from the collection agency before you can do that. All efforts have to be exhausted.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Sure.", "Brent Turner", "", "And they really want to see the same effort for your commercial account. So, we probably follow that closer about when we write them off than any other criteria.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay.", "Brent Turner", "Occasionally we can write them off earlier, but more than likely we are letting them go through a collection service cycle one-time.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Right. Okay, so, overall though there has been no change in that policy --", "Brent Turner", "", "No, not at all.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Except maybe you have fewer acquisitions come through.", "Jack Polson ", "", "No, not at all.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Final question, just going back to margin again. I understood the comments about Rolling Hills but when you look at your \u2013 the press release that shows the same-store margin down 70 basis points year-over-year, I think you said Rolling Hills was 40, did I miss anything else that was called out that was driving that?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I don\u2019t think I gave anything specifically, other then the Rolling Hills/Nashville Rehab issue.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay and then so, with the first quarter same-store margin down 70, half of that being Rolling Hills, which gets better on a forward basis, I\u2019m still of the mind that your earnings guidance for the year implies, 70s or 80 basis points of margin, same-store margin growth for the full year. Is that in the ballpark of what you\u2019re thinking? -- Go ahead.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Gary, it\u2019s in the ballpark. And probably what you\u2019re discounting is that as I mentioned earlier during, the first six weeks of the year, we were not aggressive on trying to match that to census. We knew the census would come back so, when you see souring wages and benefits as a percent of that revenue being higher, that number will get better, because of the revenues growing in the second quarter. And so, can we do better in the second, third and fourth quarter? Absolutely, we can do better against those first quarter metrics just by the sheer fact that we knew the census was coming back, and we were not aggressive in trying to reduce head count.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Got it, you had mentioned some cost reductions for the 2Q. I understand the labor sequentially, because of the census. My last question, I\u2019ll let you go is anything specific you can help us think about just in terms of cost reductions moving forward?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "No not, I did not give any specifics, other than I\u2019d anticipate that there will be.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay, all right thanks.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Just some information for everybody. I\u2019ve got a little bit more detail on the core measures in the pilot project. There were 100 about 190 hospitals in the pilot project. We should expect more than 200 to be in the system when fully implemented. Core measurements should be blessed by NQF this summer. Full implementation by October or January. Public reporting of data probably early 2010.", "And that\u2019s from Mark McClellan who heads up our association, who is closer to this than anybody about the implementation. So, there will be more than 200 hospital facilities in the core measurement. And it is still subject to being approved this summer. And then October, January will be when the first data comes out.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay.", "Joey Jacobs", "And I guess we\u2019re ready for my closing comments. First, thank you all for joining us and being with us. During the first quarter, I was out to visit several of our facilities: Lincoln Prairie, Holly Hill, Oaks, Streamwood, Riveredge, River Park, Michiana. I had great visits; saw the commitment to quality in keeping the patients safe in every one of those facilities. To those employees, to all employees of PSI, I thank you for doing the outstanding job you\u2019re doing.", "Absolutely quality is our number one number goal for this company, and keeping that patients safe and having good outcomes. So, thank you very much for that. We\u2019ll be communicating through our website, once again on our efforts. So, please you can go to our website and find updates about Joint Commission scores, feedback from the field and from our patients concerning quality. Our online PSI University goes live at the end of May. So, a lot of good things happening at PSI.", "We do expect a good second quarter. We do as of April; the census looks very good for us. Hopefully, we can hold it for another 62 days. And we\u2019ll talk to you again at the end of July. Thanks.", "Operator: Ladies and gentleman that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "At this time, for opening remarks, I would now like to turn the conference over to our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joey Jacobs.", "Joey Jacobs", "Thank you, Brent, and good morning. Thanks for being with us today. As you know from our new release yesterday PSI\u2019s financial results for the third quarter did not meet our expectations. Our operations were affected by the Labor Day holiday following seven days later than last year in a quarter that already absorbed the seasonal impact of vacation and school holidays as well as an adverse shift in our payer mix.", "One other factor is that had a greater and unexpected impact on our results than ever before was the increase in charity/indigent care. This increase came primarily in two specific markets, one county in California and the state of Colorado whose budget constraints have led to a reduction of adult charity/indigent beds in these markets. As a result the amount of our care for these patients increased by approximately $4 million for the third quarter, more than double the third quarter last year. ", "While we usually provide some of this uncompensated care every quarter the increase this quarter reduced our same facility revenue per patient day by an estimated 100 basis points compared with the third quarter last year. This had a negative impact on margins and lowered our earnings $0.04 per diluted share. ", "One other factor that affected our third quarter results was lower than expected earnings from our contract management business which impacted us by $0.02 per diluted share. Part of this shortfall related to higher expenses than planned as the revenue stream from our contract management company softened and part was related to unanticipated expense increases in our health plan business in Puerto Rico which has now been addressed. ", "During the third quarter we continued our work to add more than 400 beds to existing facilities for 2009 including more than 200 in the second half of the year. The majority of these beds are scheduled for the fourth quarter and this work, plus our maintenance costs, accounted for approximately 50% of our capital expenditures of $65.7 million for the third quarter. ", "We also completed the purchase of two facilities including one acquired on the last day of the quarter which added a total of 221 beds. As these purchases indicated the market for acquisition has improved from the first half of 2009. ", "Despite some increase in debt for the third quarter compared with the second we completed the quarter with more than $210 million in availability on our credit facility. We also expect to generate significant cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter. As a result we are well positioned to fund additional facility acquisitions that meet our strategic objectives.", "Based on our results for the first nine months and the fourth quarter to date we remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect our charity/indigent care to remain at similar levels as the third quarter, at least through the end of the year. Despite this increase we continue to expect same facility revenue growth in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We also expect the contract management business to perform to our expectations for the fourth quarter and as a result of this outlook we have adjusted our earnings guidance for 2009 to a near range of $2.11 to $2.14 per diluted share. ", "From a longer- term perspective we are optimistic about the growth prospects of the behavioral health industry and the opportunities we have as the industry leader. Industry dynamics are favorable with expectations for long-term growth and demand in a capacity constrained industry that remains highly fragmented. With our track record of leveraging these trends and increasing our market share we have proven our ability to expand our capacity through the addition of new beds and strategic acquisitions.", "At the same time we have increased our investment not only to provide the highest quality of care, but also to help drive a new level of industry transparency. Over the past 12 months PSI has provided its patients with approximately 2.8 million days of high quality care. Despite the recent industry pressure related to the current economic environment, we are confident that we are positioned to meet growing demand for our services for the long term.", "Thank you again for your time this morning and now Jack Polson, our Chief Accounting Officer, will review our financial results in more detail.", "Jack Polson", "Thank you, Joey and good morning. PSI\u2019s revenue rose to $455.3 million for the third quarter of 2009 from $431.7 million for the third quarter last year. This was an increase of 5.5% for the second consecutive quarter. Income from continuing operations attributable to PSI stockholders was $28.1 million or $0.50 per diluted share for the latest quarter compared with $27.6 million or $0.49 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2008. ", "Our same facility revenue increased 4.7% for the third quarter on a 3.3% increase in patient days and a 1.6 increase in revenue per patient day.", "Same facility EITDA margin was 20.5% for the latest quarter compared with 21% for the third quarter of 2008. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased to $79.9 million for the third quarter, up 2.5% from the third quarter last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.5% for the quarter versus 18.1% for the comparable quarter, which also reflected the impact of lower revenue growth, as Joey discussed, and a lower than expected contribution from the contract management business.", "PSI\u2019s capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $65.7 million, which includes $33 million for the addition of new beds and maintenance capital expenditures and $32.7 million for the two facility acquisitions.", "Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased 11.2% for the third quarter to $34.6 million. ", "With total debt increasing approximately $30 million during the third quarter, our total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was $3.9 x at quarters end, compared with 4.2 x at December 31, 2008 and 3.8 x at June 30th 2009.", "Debt to total capitalization improved to 56.2% from 59.6% at the end of 2008 and 56.5% at the end of the second quarter.", "This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Jessica, would you please open the floor for any question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "I wanted to dive into the charity care issue a little bit more if I could. From your comments it seems like in Colorado and California maybe the state budgets have actually forced some of the state run facilities to be shut down or some of the beds to be reduced, is that what you were indicating in your commentary?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes, it is. What happened in the third quarter for us in Sacramento County was it is really county/state funds. The Sacramento County has a 100 bed psychiatric hospital for charity/indigent patients for that county and starting at the end of June 1st of July they started diverting patients away and then closed 50 beds of the 100 beds leaving the med-surg emergency rooms and the three free standing psych hospitals in the area as the place for these patients to migrate to. For example in the third quarter of \u201908 for our facilities in this market we recorded under $100,000.00 in charity and this time we recorded just about $1.7 million in the third quarter. Now we believe it is going to be moderating in the fourth quarter and we have an action plan. There are some things we can be doing at our two facilities there to mitigate this impact to the Company. ", "We have also begun dialogue with the county officials about reimbursement and getting reimbursement, so there is an action plan there where we can moderate the level of this charity care. We always took some charity care in those facilities, but all of this occurred in the third quarter for us in Sacramento County and so similar to Colorado it started a little bit earlier, maybe at the beginning of the second quarter there, and we have already taken actions at our facility there. We think the charity level will be going down going forward, trending down. ", "So, they make up about 75% of the increase in the charity care from third quarter \u201909 over third quarter \u201908.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay that is really helpful color. Just to be perfectly clear, when you are talking about charity care they will come to your facility and because you are a freestanding site, unlike an acute care hospital with a psych unit you actually do not get paid anything from the state for those patients?", "Joey Jacobs", "That is correct and quite frankly some of these patients do not even qualify for Medicaid, they are truly a charity/indigent patient that the county was just taking responsibility for.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay and maybe you can share with us some of the mitigation plans to help moderate that. It sounds like you have already put some into play in Colorado and you said some of that might be going to the state and you are saying you just can\u2019t shut units and have us take on these patients for free; so maybe there is an argument to be made there. But, what else can you do from maybe a marketing perspective, or trying to fill beds with other patients? Any color there would be helpful.", "Joey Jacobs", "Our approach is going to be the county obviously realizes what they have done not only to us, but really to the medical/surgical hospitals emergency rooms. For programming for us, as we have evolved the Company we are becoming experts in various clinical programs. Our facilities there do not have a very strong geriatric program, so we may take some of those beds and develop a geriatric program. It is strategies like that that we are working on in Sacramento. ", "We did something similar at our facility in Colorado. It has expanded its TRICARE programs that are very specific just for the military and the military dependents, so those beds are very unique. There are things like that that we are going to do. We have in the past taken some charity patients and we are not afraid to take our charity patients, but the county just cannot dump all of these charity patients on us, the other freestanding psych hospitals in the med/surg emergency rooms.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Are you getting a feel from any other states? It sounds like Colorado you have an earlier fill and it sounds like these two areas are 75%, but are there any other states on the horizon that you are worried about, or think that this could have an impact, or do you have a pretty good handle around kind of what the future looks like at this point?", "", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We do not have, to my knowledge and we just went through our MORs for the month of September, we do not have any of this percolating in any of our other markets and really Sacramento County is very unique. We have other facilities in California and they are doing extremely well. They do not have this charity issue facing them, and they do not have a county hospital that is going to close or close its beds. Sacramento County must be suffering more than the other parts of California.", "Ryan Daniels - William Blair", "Okay and then my last question is on Puerto Rico. Could you provide a little bit more color on what exactly it was that kind of caused the penny hit and if that should be unique to the quarter do you guys think that could continue to pressure results going forward?", "Joey Jacobs", "We have one more month of hang over from our actions we have taken with that contract. When we bought this facility through the ABS transaction, we have a great network. We have the largest network in Puerto Rico providing mental health services. With the acquisition came a somewhat small insurance company where it was primarily an ASO arrangement with contracts, we decided to do at risk contracts on a small number of lives that started May 1. By June 30th we knew that we had not made a good decision here and we renegotiated out of that contract as of November 1st and it will revert back to an ASO relationship. So, we have one more month of impact in the fourth quarter for that contract and then it will go ASO type contract. That was a one-x blip that occurred over the summer months.", "We encourage our CEO\u2019s that if opportunities present themselves that we will take calculated risks and on this one it didn\u2019t work out for us, but quickly in June we began the discussions to turn it back into an ASO contract and we were successful in doing that.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank Securities.", " ", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "So I am clear on the charity care issue, can you remind us the $4 million, or the dollars that you will be reflecting in charity/indigent are those on a gross revenue basis? Can you talk about how that trend has been in charity/indigent care say over the last couple of years, what percentage, what dollar amount would you attribute on an annual basis versus what you are seeing on a run rate basis now?", "Joey Jacobs", "I don\u2019t have the exact full year number for \u201908, but I think in \u201908 we probably provided somewhere around $16 million of charity. For the first two months of this year we were tracking about $11 million, slightly over $5 million on average for the first two quarters of this year and then it jumped to $8.4. What we have done though is we have modeled, or looked at, what we expect to occur in the fourth quarter of \u201909 because we know things are moving our way and we know we are mitigating the issue in Colorado. We know that things are going on in California, so we projected it to increase slightly to between $8.5 to $9 million for the fourth quarter.", "I am hopeful that this is the high water mark for us for our quarterly expenditure on this area and that it will start trending back down. That is the best I can give you and those are the numbers I have in front of me right now.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I don\u2019t want to pin you down on this and I know it is hard to predict, but for the investors who are listening to this and hearing about charity care being a dynamic in the behavioral sector maybe for the first time; state budgets, local budgets are under a lot of pressure and it sounds like there may be other local county indigent providers that could lose funding. I want to get your thoughts on why you think it may not be a bigger risk.", "Joey Jacobs", " ", "First, as I mentioned to Ron I do not know of any other county or market in the Company where we have this risk of a county charity/indigent hospital closing its beds. I am not aware of that going on anywhere else. This is really a Sacramento, California issue that has driven this and we think we have a way to mitigate that. Now, if the county had approached us we probably would have tried to find a way to work through this issue like we did in Raleigh, North Carolina. We had a state hospital that is in the process of closing there, but we worked with Wake County there in Raleigh, North Carolina and we built 44 beds. Wake County stepped up and has inside their budgets. I think it is actually the No.1 priority in Wake County, when you speak to the Wake County officials mental health is the No.1 priority for them and we have been able to work together in a partnership. We don\u2019t get the greatest of rates, but we get an adequate rate there and so we were able to deflect that. Now we don\u2019t have any other discussions going on and I am not aware of any other market where there is a charity/indigent facility that is trying to close or that sort of thing.", "So that is the reason for my statements about we have modeled it $8.5 to $9 million for fourth quarter, but we are expecting the Colorado facility to provide less charity care in the fourth quarter, that the California hospitals will still do a little bit more in the fourth quarter. So, that is the best read of the land. I know of no other county facility that is trying to do this and we do have plans that are working in Colorado. We did do this in Raleigh, North Carolina and we are going to work through and work with the Sacramento County officials on finding an answer here for this and so do the med/surg hospitals there. ", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Sure that is helpful. I wanted to ask about the acquisitions that you closed at the end of the quarter; I know you mentioned there were two of them. I just wanted to flag one thing and that was the $33 million in CapEx you spent on these deals, that is less than 1x revenue which is I think about as low as we have seen for a long time. I wanted to get your thoughts, Joey, on what kind of pricing you are seeing on acquisitions now and how we should think about capital spending on acquisitions and pricing on acquisitions as we look out to next year. ", "Joey Jacobs", "The two hospitals that we are mentioning, one is in Fargo, North Dakota and the other one is in Panama City, Florida. The one in Fargo, North Dakota was owned by two psychiatrists that had bought this old med/surg hospital and turned it into one of the only two freestanding psych hospitals in the whole state and it has done a wonderful job there. It had EBITDA margins in the mid to upper teens here. We did buy very good, similar to 2003, 2005 multiples at that time, 5x looking back as we adjust for specific issues. ", "The one in Florida was owned by a large not for profit hospital that bought it during the collapse of the industry in the 90s and now they need cash for their med/surg facility and we bought it for a little less than 1x revenue, I think, and so these two together are less than 1x revenue and EBITDA earnings are probably in the 5, 5.5 x for and so we expect more acquisitions to occur. I do not see anything else being acquired this year. These two are the only two facilities that we will acquire for 2009, I think. But 2010 the possibility of acquiring two to six facilities is there for us. Our pipeline is busy. Steve is keeping me very busy going on the road looking at facilities and so that is where we are at. The multiples have come back and so that is what is going on.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Okay. I have a question about the bed counts and then a request for Jack. Jack, if you could give us your thoughts on this, will you recast the first and second quarters of the year separately excluding the EAP business or showing that as an asset health for sale, just out of curiosity. It will be easier for us to model that out into 2010.", "Brent Turner", "I will answer both of those. On the EAP obviously we have restated the first six months inside the nine-month numbers for the EAP going into discontinued operations and assets held for disposition. We had not planned on putting that out separately. We will certainly work with you on the line item adjustments there and if need be we can put something out. But, it is reflected in the nine-month numbers and we can help you bridge that adjustment. ", "On the bed count, we ended the quarter with 11,192 licensed beds and 10,706 beds in operation.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Arnold with Piper Jaffray.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "On charity care, can you talk through the process of when you make the decision that those patients are going to be charity or indigent patients? The reason I am asking this is that a lot of people were surprised by the results when you guys provided the new guidance excluding the AP at the end of September. So, can you talk through that process of how and when you determine that that care will be considered charity care and reduces your revenues?", "Joey Jacobs", "On the average the acute patient stays with us nine days, our financial counselors at the facilities make the determination during the admission process. We will go through that process and it has various levels of approval. So it is real time when the patient is in the facility. Our goal is that by the time the patient is discharged we will have made that decision if this was a charity/indigent patient. Even if it is a self-pay account we try to do it real time and see how much the self-pay patient is going to pay us. If they are not going to pay us all off we do that discount at the time and set them up a monthly payment. We try to be as real time as possible about the classifications of the revenue and the appropriate recording of the deductions or expense.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Okay and how should we look at the margins in the quarter? What if any impact did the exclusion of the EAP business have on the EBITDA margins versus just the weak revenues?", "Joey Jacobs", "The EBITDA margins for the EAP company were slightly higher. They had good margins, but it was in the other category there, so you would have seen its impact there, but it would flow through to the Company. The biggest impact to the margins was, in my mind, we were short somewhere $4 to $6 million below my expectations. So, when I look at it when we treated these patients it was probably $4 to $6 million of revenue and I was expecting more than what we got and that would improve all of those margins. There were a couple of expense areas where we could have done a better job and we are working on those areas that would help that.", "So, 90% of the margin decline was the fact, to me, that we didn\u2019t get our revenue like we should have. The way to offset that is to continue to grow our patient days. We were disappointed, but we were pleased with our patient day growth at 3.3% it is the highest for the year. The monthly numbers for patient day growth for same store was 1.2 in July, 4.1 in August, and 3.8 in September and so far through 26 days in October we are up 4.5% on same store patient day growth. So, we are optimistic, as we said here today, but it was more of a revenue, but there were a couple of expense areas we could have worked on and done better and we are going to do that.", "We are working through the budget process and so we are getting our facilities ready for 2010 and also getting them ready for the holidays. Thanksgiving will be here in four weeks, so we need to be adjusting our expenses and getting ready for the holidays. Like this year we saw that the census really didn\u2019t come back until January the 15th so we are going to have to be managing our expenses better through the first two weeks of January than we did this year. Ron Fincher who is the interim COO for the Company is off to a great start about setting the expectation with our division presidents and CEOs on doing that and that will help the margins. ", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "Do you have the break down of to what extent the two markets that you talked about with the charity and indigent care, to what portion the volume growth that we saw was attributable to those markets where the volume growth was obviously on patients that aren\u2019t paying?", "Joey Jacobs", "The best thing we could do there was to estimate what we thought it did. We thought it cost us 100 basis points on our revenue per day. Because charity/the indigent patient had not been significant to us and hopefully it won\u2019t be, but starting January 1st we will be capturing those revenues, patient days, and admits in a separate category where we had not in the past. So, we are going to work better on getting our IT system so we can answer your question in more detail.", "Mark Arnold - Piper Jaffray", "There was also a fairly big jump in other operating expenses in the quarter. What caused that and should we expect that dollar value to be similar in Q4?", "Joey Jacobs", "That is the management contract driving that. We expect revenues and earnings to come back to profitability and the contract in Puerto Rico that is going ASO will impact that line. So, we hope and expect that it will trend down, but once again, we will have to get through the quarter. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "I wanted you to delve into charity care into more detail. I appreciate the fact that you have gone through it a lot, but this is a newer issue for you guys. First, I think in the past the thought of charity care, uninsured, bad debt, really wasn\u2019t as much as an overhang for you guys. I hear comments about some specific state issues that you think will get better, but certainly with respect to things maybe getting worse and at the same time if it doesn\u2019t manifest itself through increased charity care we could see higher bad debt expense. So, I am just throwing that out there and I wanted you to talk about your confidence level and then at the same time do you think we will see bad debt expense move up also?", "Joey Jacobs", "We know what we did in Colorado is working and we are confident that we will work through the issue in California. Quite frankly, we would not be having this discussion if it wasn\u2019t for Sacramento County. We do not see another Sacramento County out there on the landscape anywhere in our markets, so we are going to work through this issue there. I want to see it plateau, see it trend down. ", "Bad debts remember 60% of our patients are children and adolescents and they don\u2019t have co-pays and deductibles. If started to see people putting co-pays and deductibles on Medicaid or state agency kids I would get concerned, but so far I haven\u2019t seen that, so all of that population would be fully covered. Bad debts we have historically run 2%; could it go from 2% to 2.2% or something like that? That is possible but I do not see huge increases in the bad debt expense anywhere. I don\u2019t see that coming. No one has told me anything like that. ", "None of our operation or division CFOs or Ron Fincher has given me a heads up that that is coming, so I just don\u2019t see that, though it is always a possibility. We have been out on the road the last 90 days and talking to folks. Obviously everybody needs the economy to get better and the state budgets to get better and we want that to occur to help us too. ", "That is the best I can do on that Adam.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "I understand. You guys called out Sacramento County as well as Colorado, but if you x those markets out does charity care go up and the other markets? You gave out those numbers earlier, but I am just trying to\u2026", "", "Joey Jacobs", "Do you mean as compared to the third quarter of \u201908?", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Yes.", "Joey Jacobs", "It actually went down. You have to remember in the third quarter of \u201908 there was only $100,000.00 in there for Sacramento County and now it is nearly $2 million. Once again it is only $8 million and $3 of the $4 million increase was Colorado Springs and California.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Riveredge it sounds like you guys have been making progress there, so you would have annualized the impact midway through the quarter. How much of a pick up did you get on that this year relative to last year and just any updates?", "Joey Jacobs", "I will give updates on the demand side. The hold was put in, I think, the third week of July of last year, so for the third quarter Riveredge averaged 91 patients, and last year it averaged 94. This year Riveredge is averaging 110 patients for October versus 94, 97 for last year. So it is up about 10% over last year for the month of October to date. If we can keep those trends continuing through the fourth quarter patient days are going to be positive growth over the quarter last year and that is what we are working on.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Your patient mix, could you give us some ballpark numbers in terms of payer mix for the quarter and how that changed relative to last year? Maybe it didn\u2019t change much, but I just want to better understand the mix of patients you are seeing.", "Joey Jacobs", "I do not have that detail with me. What I can tell you is obviously charity was also dumped in self-pay and other for us in our financial system classification. I think that did increase a little bit, so it took away from the other payer mixes there. There wasn\u2019t a lot of movement in the Medicaid. There might have been some decline in state agencies, but it was minor movements once again. It is hard to move our payer mix very much anyway.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "", "The only reason I was asking was because of the charity care issue you brought up, so I was just wondering if you were seeing more patients move from the commercial population to self-pay.", "Joey Jacobs", "Until we get our financial system up January 1st when we will start categorizing charity care as a very separate account we won\u2019t have those numbers.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Just given the pressure on budget and waiver funding right now, Joey, has this impacted at all any of your out of state RTC referrals? I understand a lot of those are very specific in unique cases either at the Deaf Academy or Texas Neuro more often than not, but how has that trended over the past maybe 6 to 12 months?", "Joey Jacobs", "I don\u2019t have those numbers, but I have a lot of anecdotal information. So far this month we have had a new state refer to our Deaf Academy two new patients. This year we have put together a corporate call center for referral placements for placements for RTC patients and we are hitting record levels as far as admissions being sent to our facilities and referral packets being reviewed. I don\u2019t have the details on that, but I do stay close to how many admissions they are having weekly and sometimes daily. I do know we have broken into some new states that normally would not have been giving us referrals.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Do you have any idea for just the number of patient days that you\u2019re getting from out of state? Then if you could comment on the negotiated rates, whether or not those rates are changing at all?", "Joey Jacobs", "The vast majority of our RTC patients are out of state. I don\u2019t have the rate information here in front of me.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "If we compare maybe kind of renewal rates right now with some of those states, has that gotten better or worse then a year ago?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think it stayed status quo. I think actually one large referral area has actually given us an increase.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Jack, did you guys reverse any bonus accruals in the quarter and if so what was that number?", "Jack Polson", "We did that as we did any quarter where we don\u2019t have the expectations. I don\u2019t have the exact number because it is done at each individual facility level, but that is done with RA. We don\u2019t meet expectations; we don\u2019t expect to pay out bonuses.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Was the number really an expense or was it a benefit for you in the quarter as you reversed it?", "Joey Jacobs", "It would be a benefit. Obviously with the results for the third quarter, there was some pick up in the reversal of bonus accruals, because they might have been in the bonus accrual at a certain level and due to the performance they had to reduce it, or if they were barely over it had to be reversed out. But, that is a real time, every quarter accounting issue. I just don\u2019t have the numbers.", "Jack Polson", "But the expense wasn\u2019t a negative expense in the quarter. There are still facilities that earn bonuses.", " ", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "That makes sense; maybe we can talk offline about that. Just maybe on the management contract business, just to be clearer it sounds like you lost some plans, some of the old Horizon plans. Were any of those, those big high priced cadillac plans that Horizon managed and can you minus how many rehab contracts you still have?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "First, there was none of the large contribution contracts. This year we have seen more of a decline in the rehab contracts. Unfortunately for us we have several new contracts that are full staff models that began in the second quarter and as they ramp up their staff and their census they had negative earnings, they lost money. We lost $360,000.00 in the quarter for the start-up contracts, but we also lost several rehab contracts during the year. Our folks are optimistic and we do think their performance will be better in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter and so it still generates cash and earnings for us. ", "Another key point here is of the contracts nearly half of the contracts were up for renewal this year and I think we had something over an 80% renewal rate. Next year we only have 35 contracts up for renewal, so we will not have as much pressure about getting contracts renewed.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "So we could frame up the risk around those 35 contracts could you isolate for us how much annual revenue that would contribute, obviously assuming that you would probably still have an 80%?", "Joey Jacobs", "I don\u2019t have that detail in front of me.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeff Englander with Standard & Poor's Equity Group.", "Jeff Englander - Standard & Poor's Equity Group", "Given the charity care question I am wondering if you can give us some color that you are seeing from any other states and/or anything you are doing in anticipation of any kind of pressure or any kind of cutbacks?", "Joey Jacobs", "During our monthly operating review for September it was not highlighted to me that any other counties were having an issue similar to what\u2019s happening in Sacramento County and that is a very unique arrangement there. We project, and we have lowered this over time, rate increases for Medicaid we think are zero at best going forward for the next 12 months, but, as I mentioned earlier, we have had one large referral source to our residential facilities give us an increase. So, we do provide a very unique service that is very much in demand and so we do have some pricing leverage there, but no one has brought it to my attention that there is another Sacramento County out there that would cause this.

One, similar to med/surg is taking care of the charity patients and uninsured and on Medicaid adult there is a demonstration project and obviously we would be asking for that demonstration project to be put in markets where we have an issue of treating more Medicaid adult patients because the med/surg hospitals have closed their psych beds.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "First on the commercial rate increases, do you still feel comfortable that 6% to 8% is achievable despite the pressures that perhaps the managed care companies are seeing themselves elsewhere?

We did not know the full impact of the charity and the results for September and for the quarter until somewhere around probably around October the 8th, give or take a couple of days there, so that was the timing. Probably what we should have done was to get the EAP announcement out sooner. It was done the third week of September and then released on the 30th I think, by the time it got through all the approvals and reviews here at the Company.", "Once again, our third quarter is made on how September does and we didn\u2019t know that until the second week of October.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "On 2010 guidance typically you issue that with the third quarter release, at least I have seen you do that in the past. Is there a reason why you didn\u2019t do that this year?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, it was the first quarter of this year. So, I think we have told most everybody that we will be giving 2010\u2019s guidance sometime after the first of the year. We are going to let the books get closed. We are going to have our budgets finalized and adjusted and then we will be giving the guidance sometime after the first of the year.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "Okay and then on the contract management as well, so clearly there were some of the issues in Puerto Rico, but what were the other issues in the contract management business? I didn\u2019t quite gather all of that from some of the earlier comments.", "Joey Jacobs", "Some of it was start up losses for new contracts that we have signed. They have lost, I think, $350,000.00 during the quarter. Also, the reduction in contracts were greater to us in the third quarter and Puerto Rico; when you put all of those things together that caused the miss in the contract division for PSI.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "The start up costs you feel like over time would go away as you ramp up there and turn those profitable. Puerto Rico clearly will change. Of those two what percent does that represent of the relative shortfall there versus the decline in contract? Clearly the decline in contract is sort of a continuing, on going issue.", "Joey Jacobs", "It is probably a penny each way. It is probably a penny on this ramp up of the start up losses in Puerto Rico and there is probably a penny on the lost contracts. That is my best estimate on the limited information I have in front of me.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners", "On the RTC side one of the things that we have seen from talking to some other private providers is utilization pressures just on the front end, not necessarily when the children and adolescents have been placed, but just getting those referrals. Have you noticed that yourselves in the RTC business and if so is it in select markets over others or?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "We have done really well with our national call center on placements and the number of placements continues to grow each month, as we started that department at the beginning of the year. Then we are building 20 RTC beds in Arkansas right now and we sped up construction because there are patients that need to be in those beds. We have some very good RTC facilities and some very good RTC programs that states need to send their patients to.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from A.J. Rice with Soleil Securities.", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "Not to belabor a point, but on the Sacramento situation you have a million seven impact in the quarter. Adults you said have a nine-day average length of stay. You have about $500 to $600 average reimbursement per case. That seems like a huge number for one facility. Am I missing something there or how can you explain that?", "Joey Jacobs", "There are two facilities there and I haven\u2019t worked through the math like you have there. The only think I know is I have one [interposing].", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "", "Is there some other dynamic there? Is it a catch up of previously treated patients from other periods?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, it is not a catch up. Probably some of the difference is that when the County hospital had been full they would send overflow to us and the County of Sacramento would pay for those patients. So, there would be some of those patients that we were actually treating previously that got paid and they stopped that as of July 1st too, paying our facilities for treating charity/indigent patients, so that would also be in that number.", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "Maybe slice it a different way, if you look at patient days year-to-year up 3.3% how much was charity up if you just look at the charity days? Do you have that number by any chance?", "Joey Jacobs", "As I mentioned earlier on the call our system does not capture charity patient days and admissions specifically for charity. We have a catchall that says self-pay and other where these types of patients would be categorized. Starting January 1st we are going to be capturing them in a specific charity/indigent so we will know better. We know the dollar amounts, but we really don\u2019t know how many patient days and admissions were involved there.", "Brent Turner", "On the California there was a million nine increase for Sacramento. Rates out there are much higher than the 500 average for the company. Using 800 and 92 days in the month it is an increase of about 25 patients across two facilities. That is still the total dollars we referenced. The length of stay, even though that company\u2019s average is nine, in California it would be one to two days lower.", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "", "So on the self-pay if you were to look at that number year-to-year what kind of increase would you get on self-pay?", "Brent Turner", "I don\u2019t have that number. ", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "", "On the contract management, EAP came out of that right? So you are running $45 million in the second quarter and your EAP would have taken about what $13 million out of that going into the third quarter?", "Joey Jacobs", "How much revenue was taken out in the third quarter for the EAP or how much would have normally been there?", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "", "Yes, obviously it was down and less than it had been in the [interposing].", "Joey Jacobs", "We are looking for that number for you. The revenue for the EAP company was slightly over $40 million I thought. So, if you divided that by four it is going to be somewhere around $10 to $11 million that would have normally been there.", "Jack Polson", "In \u201908 it was $43 million, about $11 million.", "A.J. Rice - Soleil Securities", "", "So that puts you sort of flat sequentially in the contract management x EAP am I thinking about that the right way?", "Joey Jacobs", "It was flat to slightly down, yes.", "Jack Polson", "But it also increased because the gross revenue increased because of the at risk contract in Puerto Rico which we have adjusted for.", "Joey Jacobs", "That is right. I don\u2019t know if you were on earlier, but in May of this year we entered into an at risk contract, so we put more gross revenue there and that will go away November 1st.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James & Associates.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "The adult business, are you seeing any impact yet from the Company hiring unemployment numbers? Is the demand side on the adult side still holding up and do you think it will continue to? Is that still stable? I know you were talking about your price increases but what about the demand and the volume?", "Joey Jacobs", "It is very stable on the RTC business, which is all children. On the acute side the demand for the adult business, for the month we are up 4.5% total and acute will be up more than the 4.5%, RDC will be bringing that down. So, the demand for the acute children and adult I think is doing very well. I don\u2019t have those specific numbers, but I would expect that it is doing well.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "Okay and if you were to look out, let\u2019s just assume conservatively which I don\u2019t think is going to be right, but no acquisitions. If you were to look at your bed count additions and the conversion in Chicago, if we were to look at the end of 2010 what do you think our approximate revenue mix is between the two businesses if you will? I mean how much is going to skew to adult and child acute versus RTC by the end of 2010 versus where it is now?", "Joey Jacobs", "You would have to call back. We would have to do a little study on that. We will give you the number, but we would have to do more homework on that.", "John Ransom - Raymond James & Associates", "The issue is wouldn\u2019t we expect, not a gigantic, but a material up tick in the acute mix given where you are trending your new bed count?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely. We expect to have more acute patients next year than we did this year. When you talk about the adult, I don\u2019t have the adult and the child broken out. I have acute and RTC, but I don\u2019t have acute broken out between adult and child with me.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Andreas Dirnagl with Stephens Inc.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "Joey, I know it is obviously going to be the No.1 topic today, but when it comes to Sacramento and Colorado Spring, I guess you made some comments in your prepared remarks and then answering questions. I guess in Colorado you seem to get a sense that something was going on by the beginning of the second quarter. In Sacramento I think you mentioned that at the end of June, early July they began to divert and then they closed 50 beds. Was there something missed there? In other words when was the first monthly operating review that you heard about this happening? Were there forewarning signs that you maybe could have seen that you are now on the look out in other states for? It seemed to come on rather suddenly and what is to give us comfort that it is not going to come on rather suddenly despite the fact that right now you are not aware of anything happening in other states?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think just the level of sensitivity that has been raised over this issue by the ones on the call and by our CEOs in the field. We\u2019ve sent a clear message to the CEOs in the field that any inkling of information about something like this they need to get it to us immediately.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "In Sacramento specifically were there signs, or was there any inkling that maybe you should have been picking up on a couple of weeks or months earlier?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, there were signs in California about budget issues. Fortunately for us it only impacted these two facilities. Our facility in Freemont and our two facilities in the L.A. area are not impacted by this. This was specifically a Sacramento area issue and I have a feeling our folks were hopeful that there was a way it was going to be fixed by the Governor. I don\u2019t think they still have their budget done. I don\u2019t think anyone, in the beginning, thought they were going to close 50 of their 100 beds. ", "Obviously in the second quarter of \u201909 somebody had to be talking about this and telling us about this that these issues were going on, but as far as the magnitude of what they did it surprised us all.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "So in other words the actual action of closing the 50 beds was very quickly decided and caught everyone by surprise?", "Joey Jacobs", "To my knowledge it was all decided in the third quarter.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "To be blunt, there has been a risk in future quarters that that could happen in a number of other locales. If the decision is to be made and then the impact of the Company can happen within a couple of weeks\u2026", "Joey Jacobs", "The unexpected can happen, but this is what you need to find, how many markets have 100-bed charity freestanding psych hospital funded by the county? That instantly reduces the pull instantly, absolutely instantly.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "And of your markets how many do?", "Joey Jacobs", "To my knowledge I know of no other that is set up like this. Maybe after this call we will poll our CEOs again about that specific question, who has a 100-bed charity hospital bed hospital funded by the county in your market that could close? We may survey our CEOs and do that, but once again, when you put that criterion out there who has a 100-bed charity hospital funded by a county, they are few and far between.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "Okay, so Colorado was a slightly different circumstance then?", "Joey Jacobs", "Colorado was, well first population density matters here and that several med/surg hospitals over the past 12 months had closed their psych beds due to budget constraints. I think Colorado may have one of the largest unemployment rates in the whole country and the largest uninsured rates in the whole country. But, we are working around that and we expect the charity issue in Colorado to trend down.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "Okay and then in general clearly there is a potential moral or charitable obligation to take these patients. What is the legal obligation to take these patients?", "Joey Jacobs", "The legal obligation is for us and med/surg hospitals in its entirety. If a patient shows up to you and they are in an emergency condition you have to treat that patient. Every hospital in this country has that obligation whether you are a psych hospital or a med/surg hospital; you have to treat that patient.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "Then just to be clear in terms of the mitigation factors that you are taking, by in effect putting in a specialized program and designating those beds to the specialized program, if you don\u2019t have an appropriate bed for a patient you can\u2019t take them?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, you could not put a 40-year-old adult acute patient in a geriatric-based program where all of the patients there are 79+ years old. That would not be safe to the patient that needs care and it definitely would not be safe to the geriatric patients on that unit.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "Your comments were that the Puerto Rico issue by June 30th it was clear that this was a problem. The end of June, early July the divert and then the closing of the beds in July, obviously California, Sacramento had an impact in part of July and most of August. By the third week of September you would have theoretically closed the first two months of the quarter and seen that there were already a couple of things going against you. I know that the quarter is made in September, but was it basically the hope that okay despite the fact that Labor Day is a week late this year and we knew September was maybe going to be problematic that we would still be able to make up this shortfall, in terms of not adjusting your guidance?", "Joey Jacobs", "Coming into the month of September we just came up August and the patient day growth was up 4.1%.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "And pricing at that point?", "Joey Jacobs", "I don\u2019t have the pricing numbers in front of me. Then September ended up 3.8%. The real issue is this $4 million of charity care and that as we have explained $3 of the $4 million is in two markets.", "Andreas Dirnagl - Stephens Inc.", "Labor Day was a week late this year; do you have any estimate as to what impact that had on the business in terms of maybe volumes?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "I can always give you estimates. We are now averaging 4.5 for the month of October. We averaged 4.1 in August. Could I easily have reached a conclusion that Septembers 3.8 would have been above 4%? Sure I can, but the Labor Day week took it down. So, if I was to go back and look at September and say what would we normally think we would have gotten out of this, it probably would have been above 4% patient day growth because we had that in August and we have it so far in October. So, the trending of patient day growth was 4.1, 3.8 and now 4.5, so obviously when looking back at it I would have expected September would have had a chance to be above 4%.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo Securities, Llc. ", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, Llc ", "In terms of the mitigation that you have discussed in Colorado, you talked about adding some TRICARE business, so can you just maybe talk about the dynamic that that helps you avoid some of the charity care? Is that just because you fill beds with other business and so you don\u2019t have beds for charity care, how does that work?", "Joey Jacobs", "Let\u2019s think through this. If you have an 80-bed hospital and you have five very distinct programs, distinct meaning a child and adolescent, or a child and an adolescent program, or a TRICARE program, or a geriatric program. If you have a defined clinical program for these distinct units for the safety of the patient and the safety of the patients in those units, the patients have to have similar diagnoses. Once again, if you have a geriatric unit that is taking care of patients that are 65 and older you are not going to put a 40-year-old adult on that ward. It is designed totally differently, the equipment, the bed, everything there is different for that patient. So, if your facility has these unique programs and a patient presents that doesn\u2019t qualify for the clinical programs you obviously cannot treat that patient. We have an obligation to try and find you a place to send that patient to, but more importantly, when the referral source calls we will legitimately say we have two geriatric beds open. So, if the patient is not a geriatric patient then that person needs to go somewhere else. That is how very specific clinical programs can develop very specific niches. This is one way you diversity payer mix. ", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, Llc ", "That is helpful color and then just to clarify one of the numbers that you gave out, I believe you said that Colorado was 75% of the issue in the quarter and then you also said you mostly mitigated that.", "Joey Jacobs", "No, Gary it is California and Colorado are 75% of the issue. Of the $4 million $3 million is for those two states. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Your two facilities in Sacramento I think are about 148 beds, am I right?", "Joey Jacobs", "That is close.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Okay and then I want to go back to your comment on 2010 guidance. You would anticipate releasing that after the New Year but before the release of the Q4 which is probably in February, or with the Q4?", "Joey Jacobs", "I didn\u2019t make that commitment. I just said it would be after January. We would have to talk to the board and we would have to huddle, the board would approve the budgets and things like that. There are some logistics we would have to go through and then the timing we would have to decide. I don\u2019t know what most companies do. Historically we have done it in November, but we do think it is prudent for us not to do it the first week of November when you still have 60 days of the year to go.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Right, no, I think most companies give it in conjunction with their Q4 earnings report, but there are a couple that actually give it earlier in January, so I just wanted to see if that was firm or it sounds like it is not firm.", "Joey Jacobs", "Somewhere in the New Year is the answer.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "You mentioned on the Medicaid side some states giving increases and some states cutting. What state gave you the biggest rate cut and what was the magnitude of that?", "Joey Jacobs", "Probably what is going on in North Carolina, they are doing somewhere between a 3% to 7% rate cut in North Carolina based upon the services, I think. To my recollection that is probably the biggest cuts that have occurred.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Is that an ongoing process or is that pretty finalized?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think it is either finalized or will be finalized shortly.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "In your contract management business, the contracts that you failed to renew, is there a competitor that is willing to do it cheaper, has there been dissatisfaction? What do you attribute some of that contract loss to?", "Joey Jacobs", "What we have seen is facilities try to do it in-house. They think they are going to make money by eliminating the management fee that we were charging, or someone buys the med/surg hospital, or the CEO terminates and the new CEO doesn\u2019t believe in outsourcing. Those are really the three reasons why a contract turns. Very rarely will you get a contract terminated for performance.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "The Puerto Rico health plan was the assumption of risk there you were taking there purely a behavioral risk or was there some medical risk that you have been parceling out?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "It was behavioral and drugs. ", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Okay and then I thought the commentary around Sacramento was very helpful to understanding this, but I am not as clear on what happened in Colorado. You are describing more of just a macro issue of seeing more charity as opposed to any sort of definitive unilateral action by a city, county, or state facility, is that correct?", "Joey Jacobs", "That is correct. I do not know of any unilateral decision made there. What I do know is that over 12 months quite a few psych beds closed inside med/surg hospitals and then one day we woke up and we are the primary provider for Southern Colorado and with that came more referrals for the charity/indigent patient than we had seen previously.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "How does Texas look and feel on the charity issue?", "Joey Jacobs", "It is not an issue at all and no one is saying it is an issue.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Going back to the concept of, these were obviously isolated incidents, but of course the markets worry that at some point this could be broader, or even if you are not seeing issues now more issues could pop up and you have allowed for that. I think in most of your markets wouldn\u2019t there be some safety net, city, county, state facility that is taking these Medicaid adults? Wouldn\u2019t that be true in most of your markets? Maybe not a single large provider, as large as 100 beds, but wouldn\u2019t that sort of safety net exist in most markets, or not?", "Joey Jacobs", "No, not really. This hospital in Sacramento County, these weren\u2019t all Medicaid patients. These were truly charity that they were taking care of. These people didn\u2019t have coverage. These people were uninsured.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Regardless of whether they are Medicaid adults or just people that either didn\u2019t sign up or didn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, isn\u2019t there a sort of safety net city, county, state capacity in most of these markets or they just end up at the city med/surg hospital, or county med/surg facility?", "Joey Jacobs", "I will take Tennessee for example. I think in Tennessee there are three large freestanding psych state hospitals scattered through out the state geographically. Then inside med/surg hospitals there are psych beds that should be taking care of the Medicaid adult patients. So that is what is going on. Then there is more for an out patient basis there are community mental health centers that would be treating the adult schizophrenic population and they would be residing there. ", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "I guess there are a lot more out patient safety net resources than in-patient at this point?", "Joey Jacobs", "Absolutely, there are a lot of mental health centers through out the country.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Alan Fishman with Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "My question is around the portion of revenue that is related to state agencies. How are those rates generally set?", "Joey Jacobs", "Some state agencies may use Medicaid costs; some of them may be set by individual negotiations, probably a majority of them.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Are based on negotiations?", "Joey Jacobs", "Yes.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay and so you talked about a 0% at best in 2010 Medicaid reimbursement rate, should that also include the state agencies at 0% as well, or what do you think about that as you look forward to 2010 and still targeting this 2% to 3% revenue per day?", "Joey Jacobs", "This is primarily for RTC patients that are being referred out of state. I would think that we would get a 2% to 4% price increase there. For example I mentioned earlier that one of our large referral sources gave us a good increase. So, I think the more specialized the RTC patient is that is being referred to us from out of state the better our chances are of getting adequate reimbursement.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Switching over to Medicaid reimbursement, you mentioned North Carolina, but what other states might you be looking at that are considering Medicaid reductions and how does that factor into your Q4 and 2010 expectation for this 2% to 3% revenue per day growth?", "Joey Jacobs", "Right now the worry will restart next year getting ready for July 1st and October 1st. The only really straggling budget out there is California: they have made a lot of their cuts, but once again in California the economy is not very good at all. Right now the only one I am really worried about right now is California\u2019s budget because basically we have gotten through all of the other state budgets.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "How quickly can you transition beds in the acute setting from a general purpose, or another program, into a geriatric to mitigate this potential charity care issue?", "Joey Jacobs", "I think it would probably take us 60 days, maybe even a little less. We have a lot of expertise in doing geriatric-based units. One thing is you have to go back and re-look at the environment. In the geriatric population instantly falls become an issue, so we would go back and re-look about the flooring and beds and those sorts of things we would have to do. We would have to do some of that and then the staff would have to be trained for that geriatric patient and their special needs for that patient. By the time you got through the in-service and additional training probably 30 to 60 days maybe.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Okay and that would be relatively similar for TRICARE as well?", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Yes. It takes about 60 days to bring up any clinical program.", "Alan Fishman - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay and I guess you were aware of the self-pay volume increase, how did that contribute to the overall volume growth in the quarter? Did you break that out?", "Joey Jacobs", "I don\u2019t have that number.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Banc of America Merrill Lynch ", "Kevin Fischbeck - B of A Merrill Lynch", "I want to follow up on a comment you made earlier. The comment you made on the two deals you closed so far was helpful, but you also mentioned the ability to maybe do two to six deals next year, which I think is up from the two to three that you have recently been talking about. I just want to get a better sense of that visibility in the pipeline. What is driving it? Are the types of sellers changing? Can you give us any color there?", "Joey Jacobs", "More activity and actually there is activity with multi-facilities in one transaction. So, we could do one transaction and fill the six, or two transactions and get to the six. We have more of those opportunities now that the credit markets and PSI\u2019s balance sheet has been strengthened, so the ability now to continue to consolidate the market is there for us, so the activity has picked up and there can be transactions that would get us there through one transaction.", "Kevin Fischbeck - B of A Merrill Lynch", "Okay so it is not as much a situation of, I guess you mentioned one of the hospitals being a non-profit hospital looking to focus on its core business is not necessarily an issue of the economy weighing on those types of sellers as it has as much to do with the financial flexibility that you have now opening you up to doing larger transactions?", "Joey Jacobs", "Correct.", "Kevin Fischbeck - B of A Merrill Lynch", "When we look at the cost structure that you have now, when we look at your margins and you look at each line item, the comments that you made earlier about other operating expense being a little bit high and how that is going to start to improve in Q4 was helpful. Is there anything else that you would look at, any line items where you say here is an area where either there is going to be a lot of leverage when we drive volumes or even at current volumes there is room to move? Any comments on that would be helpful.", "Joey Jacobs", "Sure, I can think of three areas: We have rolled out a formulary drug formulary for the whole company and we have established a corporate pharmacy and therapeutics committee. That just got kicked off, so we do think we will be getting more rebates and better use of lower cost drugs. The second is that on the benefit side of the business normally we are in April 1 reenrollment; we pushed that up to January 1st, so that will also assist the Company. Then last if we will just fine-tune our productivity standards and expectations on the salary and wage line we will get some benefits there, so right now those three areas. We might get some more expense out of the system in the professional fee line, so we have a project going on there too. So, we have several projects going on to take expenses out of probably the five or six largest expense categories for the Company.", "Kevin Fischbeck - B of A Merrill Lynch", "Do you have any thoughts about margin expansion opportunity or target margins?", "Joey Jacobs", "We expect our margins to improve, so once again, we have not given up on the goal of having an EBITDA margin before overhead of 22%.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jacobs for closing remarks.", "Joey Jacobs", "", "Thanks everyone for your attendance today and all of your questions. I hope I didn\u2019t sound frustrated about answering the charity question. It is very important to all of you and it is very important to us and it has our undivided attention.", "We do want to welcome the two new facilities, Prairie-St. John's and Emerald Coast to the Company, Fargo, North Dakota, and Panama City, Florida. To the CEOs, many of our CEOs did listen on in this call and I just want to thank them and their employees for the great job they are doing in keeping our patients safe and growing the business. We recently had a CEO meeting back in Nashville, probably six weeks ago, and I want everybody to keep in mind what Mike Ham reminded us of, we are PSI.

My name is Scheret and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Filton. Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you and good morning. I am Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30th, 2011. As discussed in our press release last night the company recorded adjusted net income per diluted share of $1.04 for the quarter compared to $0.68 during the second quarter of 2010 as calculated on the supplemental schedules included with last night\u2019s press release.", "We are maintaining our previously announced guidance for the full year with earnings per diluted share expected to be $3.85 to $4. During this conference call we will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking estimates and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2010, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2011. We\u2019d like to highlight just a couple of developments in business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenue increased 6.1% during the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year were down approximately 1% for the quarter. On a same-facility basis, revenue per adjusted admission increased 7.1% over last year\u2019s quarter. The increased revenue was due to higher acuity, improved payer mix, and strong commercial pricing.", "We define operating margin as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages, and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and provision for doubtful accounts divided by net revenues. The impact of the prior year items included on the supplemental schedules are not included in our divisional operating margin.", "On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 15.2% during the second quarter of 2011 from 14.2% during the second quarter of 2010. The margin improvement resulted mainly from improved payer mix, higher acuity and strong commercial pricing.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to 239 million and 190 million during the three month periods ended John 30, \u201811 and \u201810 respectively. As a percentage of gross revenue the combined total of bad debt, charity care and uninsured discount was slightly lower than last year\u2019s second quarter.", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.2% during the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted patient days at our behavioral hospitals owned for more than a year increased 3% during the second quarter and revenue per adjusted day increased 3.8% compared to the comparable prior year quarter. These same favorable trends were present in the results of the recently acquired PSI facilities which largely met our financial expectations for the second quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 26.7% during the quarter ended June 30, 2011 as compared to 27.4% during the comparable prior year period, primarily due to the temporary closure of some capacity at one of our Pennsylvania facilities to repair certain physical plant problems.", "Our cash flow from operating activities was $173 million during the second quarter of 2011 as compared to $88 million in the second quarter of 2010. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 44 days during the second quarter of 2011 from 42 days in 2010.", "At June 30, 2011, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 63% and the ratio of debt to EBITDA was 3.8 times. We spent $60 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter. We opened a total of 176 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest facilities during the first two quarters of 2011 and anticipate opening another 150 new beds during the remainder of this year.", "At this point Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from A. J. Rice with Susquehanna Financial.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Hi, everybody. Thanks. Maybe just asking about the margins on the same-store basis on both sides of the business. You had a positive margin trend on the acute care side, it sounds like on a same-store basis. When you drill down to the specific expense items what were some of the dynamics there. And just to confirm, if you ex out that unusual item you would have been positive it sounds like on the psych side? I just want to make sure that\u2019s true.", "Steve Filton", "Okay, A. J. Yeah, I think that on the acute side, much as was the case in Q1, the very strong revenue performance, revenues up 6%, is really what contributes to the margin expansion, and I think if you look through our expense items, we felt I think we were particular successful on the supply line, but just in general, I think we are always going to feel that that sort of margin growth, particularly on the acute side, we ought to have margin expansion and just as we\u2019ve done in Q1 and Q2.", "On the behavioral side, as you suggested, we called out, or I called ant in my remarks the fact that we were a couple of million dollars behind due to the closure of the capacity of this one Pennsylvania facility in the quarter, combined with a couple of smaller nonrecurring expense items in the quarter. We calculate our margins probably would have on an adjusted basis, would have been ahead of last year by 20 or 30 basis points.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Okay. And then just maybe one other one. Obviously with the events of earlier in the week, there\u2019s focus specifically on Medicare mix and acuity levels and you said that your overall acuity was up nicely. I don\u2019t know if you have the case mix overall number by any chance, but \u2013 or what the trend was there, but also have you \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve even done this, but have you drilled down and seen whether you had any anomalies or unusual activity in your Medicare book specifically?", "Steve Filton", "A. J., I think the three elements that we\u2019ve highlighted as contributing to the strong revenue performance in acute care are essentially the exact same three that we highlighted in Q1.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Right.", "Steve Filton", "Higher acuity and that\u2019s true in our Medicare book of business as well as our non-Medicare book. Better payer mix, and as we talked about in Q1, what we really mean by that is lower \u2013 a lower level of uninsured patients. And basically we talked in Q1 about the fact that after a couple of years of having uninsured admissions grow by 5 and 6%, uninsured admissions were sort of flat in Q1 and they are sort of, flat in Q2. So that trend continued. And then finally, we sited in both quarters strong commercial pricing, and again, in each of the cases, the trends continued from Q1 into Q2.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Okay. So you just haven\u2019t seen any change, basically.", "Steve Filton", "We really have not.", "A. J. Rice \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Justin Lake with UBS.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. Good morning. First question, Steve, just on the new capacity build-out, the acute business continues to run pretty strongly. Can you give us an idea of what the contribution is from the capacity you put on-line in 2010 for the second quarter, what it added year-over-year to the EBITDA growth? And then more importantly, can you give us an idea what you think that could contribute from an EBITDA standpoint next year on a year-over-year growth basis?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Justin. Alan, I think in his quote specifically in the press release, highlighted the contribution of the large acute care capital projects, and by that I think he was referencing the three large capital projects we\u2019ve talked about for a couple of years now, and that\u2019s the new tower at Summerlin in Las Vegas, and then the replacement facilities for Texoma and Palmdale in California. Combined, there\u2019s probably $4 to 5 million of capital investment in those three projects.", "Two of which opened in early 2010 and Palmdale opened in late 2010. Those projects I think as a result of the recession have taken a little bit longer to ramp-up than we originally anticipated, but are clearly ramping up, and I would say the three facilities combined contributed at least half of the EBITDA growth that we had as a company in Q2, which again is why I think, you know, Alan specifically called that out in his comments in the press release.", "As far as what they will contribute in the future next year, I\u2019m not going to be specific. I\u2019m sure when we give our 2012 guidance we\u2019ll be more specific, but I think the expectation is that each of those three project will continue to improve.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. And Steve, the 0 to 2% EBITDA growth target that you had for the acute care business this year, that was excluding the contribution from these projects?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. Definitely Texoma and Palmdale. Summerlin is little bit harder to sort of, segregate out because obviously it\u2019s an existing hospital with existing capacity, so it\u2019s a little bit harder to do. But for the most part, yes. I think we \u2013 those trends we sort of talked about in our same-store facilities.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. And then lastly, the cash flow in the quarter and year-to-date, free cash flow is $240 million. Just curious if you have a target there for the full year?", "Steve Filton", "You know, I think in our Q1 call we talked about using a number of about 400 million. I still think that\u2019s a reasonable estimate. Obviously, if you annualize the first six months you\u2019ll get a higher number, but certainly our guidance implies that our earnings will be lower in the second half of the year.", "You have to take that into account. I think we would suggest that our capital spend, which has been very, very tight in the first six months is likely to increase a little bit in the second half of the year. So I think that $400 million number is still not \u2013 it\u2019s probably a bit of a conservative estimate but not a bad place holder.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Just last quick number question...", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, Justin, can I interrupt for one second, the one thing I should call out, though, sort of a nonrecurring item is, we did sell one of the PSI facilities that were acquired by the FTC to sell in the beginning of July, and if we sell the other three facilities that we acquired just to sell that would be an element of cash flow that would obviously be above and beyond what folks have seen in the first half of the year.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Steve, can I just throw out one quick numbers question, and then I\u2019ll jump off. The $1.04 number you reported, I assume x these items you talked about in the behavioral business probably looks more like $1.06. Can you just compare that to what your internal plan was for EPS in the second quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I mean, our reported EPS was probably $0.04 or $0.05 ahead of our internal number.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "The reported number was $0.04 to $0.05 ahead and if we include the adjustment it might have been $0.06 or $0.07 ahead then?", "Steve Filton", "Yes.", "Justin Lake \u2013 UBS", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Hi, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Everything looked very strong here. I just wanted to get some clarity on a couple things. Maybe just, Steve, in your starting point just talk about Las Vegas a little bit and you talked about the improved payer mix trends for the company. Let us know how Las Vegas done in the quarter? And then just want to get a \u2013 see if you had any update on the Sierra contract also, since I know that contract was coming up for renewal in June?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I\u2019ll talk about Sierra first, Adam. Pretty much the comments that we made, I think in Q1 still apply. We \u2013 I think we\u2019ve made throughout Q2. We have the contract with Sierra is actually expired. We have an agreement in principal in place with Sierra as to a new to three-year contract with a rate increase that falls well within our sort of quoted managed care price increase range.", "We continue to go back and forth with Sierra over some very detailed conversations about essentially how to allocate that increase to specific diagnoses and procedures etcetera. And we believe we\u2019ll conclude those conversations in short order and sign a formal contract at that point.", "As far as the overall trends in Las Vegas, we said in Q1 that the beat in Q1 and the very significant beat in Q1 was largely driven by Vegas performance, very strong payer mix. I think we\u2019ve seen those positive payer mix trends continue into Q2. We have seen volumes weaken a little bit in Las Vegas in Q2. And so as a result, I think that the improvement in EBITDA in the acute division in Q2 is sort of a more widely dispersed among the acute portfolio and not as concentrated in Las Vegas as it was in Q1, although Las Vegas still is ahead of where it was in Q2 of last year.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "And since you mentioned the portfolio, Steve, maybe just an update on the McAllen in Southwest Texas market.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I mean, I think the comments there would be similar to what we\u2019ve been saying for the last few quarters. Again, we\u2019ve seen soft volumes in that market, but improved payer mix trends, and so the market actually continues to, frankly, outperform where we thought they\u2019d be this year, which has been a positive, obviously. But again, I think it\u2019s largely reflective of the overarching trends that we\u2019ve seen which are, weaker volumes than we expected but better payer mix.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then, just maybe a question for Alan, just wanted to get your though, so you guys have owned PSI for two full quarters now. So just relative to your expectations going into it, just curious to get your observations in terms of how the integration of PSI has been going.", "Alan Miller", "The integration is going well. We\u2019re pleased with it. And we have found areas of upside. We\u2019re working on a couple of problems but on balance, we\u2019re very happy with it.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just on that same topic, Steve, the synergy numbers you guys outlined, you\u2019re still comfortable with the same range relative to what you talked about earlier?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, I mean, we\u2019ve \u2013 from the outset side of this 35 to $45 million synergy number which was meant to refer to the amount of corporate overhead savings we thought were available as a result of the transaction and as we have on numerous occasions, we\u2019ll reiterate today we think we are very much on track to meet that within the sort of two-year period that we set for ourselves in the beginning.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "All right, thank you very much.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, may be just going back to \u2013 you talked about the temporary closing of the Pennsylvania facility. Maybe just give us a sense, how long was that closed for? Is it now open? What were the issues there? Any details there would be helpful.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. As I said in my comments, Ralph, we had some physical plant problems that, in order to repair them we had to close down some capacity. Not all of the \u2013 the facility is still open. I believe I don\u2019t have the date in front of me. I believe it was closed for most of the second quarter, and we expect it to the reopen sometime fairly soon, mid to late August. So we may have a bit of a lingering effect into Q3, but then it should be behind us.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, can you maybe talk about where you are in terms of capacity in the Psych business overall?", "Steve Filton", "Our occupancy rates continue to run for both portfolios in the high 70s, and I think from our perspective, that still means that there are any number of facilities that are operating at what we would deem to be inefficient levels of occupancy, meaning that we\u2019re turning patients away, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve added, as my comments indicated, 175 or so beds so far this year, and we expect to add another 150 in the balance of the year.", "And I think at a similar rate in the following couple of years, I think we still think there\u2019s an opportunity again in the entire portfolio for facilities that quite frankly are operating at that high 70s, low 80s, in some cases even higher than that occupancy levels at relatively attractive investments, invest in new capacity and earn a decent return.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then just in terms of going back to the acute care pricing mix, was the best I think we\u2019ve seen in eight years, can you may be just \u2013 is there a way to parse out a little bit what you think is coming from kind of the pure pricing versus acuity versus payer mix and then maybe just more importantly for the second half of the year, do you think you can sustain in that area, just given what appears to be kind of relatively easy comps?", "Alan Miller", "Sure. Well, to some degree, Ralph, I\u2019m going to express the same sentiments we expressed in Q1. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the very robust revenue performance in acute care but we remain cautious about it because obviously we\u2019re still in an economic recovery that appears to just about everybody to be fairly fragile and uneven, and so particularly as it has affected the numbers of uninsured, we saw dramatic drop in those in Q1, and we sustained that in Q2.", "We\u2019d like to be able to believe we\u2019ll be able to sustain that completely going forward but are not quite so sure. We\u2019ve also seen an increase in acuity in Q1 and again in Q2. I think to some degree that\u2019s a function of the fact that the flip side is that we\u2019ve got weaker admissions and the admissions we\u2019re losing tend to be the less acute, more discretionary and elective sort of procedures, so what we\u2019re left with are the more acute procedures, but I think we continue to believe that it\u2019s quite possible and probably even likely that the acute care pricing backs off as the year goes on.", "The other thing that I think we know is coming is that Medicaid pricing is going to decline as the year goes on. As we\u2019ve said many times, Medicaid pricing was flat to down 1% in the first half of the year. We expect it to be much more down 3% or 4% in the back half of the year and that will affect our overall pricing, both on the acute and frankly even more so on the behavioral side, so that\u2019s another cautionary area that we\u2019re keeping an eye on in the back half of the year.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Right. And then Steve, if I could squeeze in one last one, I know it\u2019s only a month into the quarter but I need just general observations, either positive or negative of the trends relative to kind of what you\u2019ve reported for second quarter or first half of the year.", "Steve Filton", "As is always the case, when we have these calls, the only real metric that we have any real insight into at this point is volumes and I would say that the early indications of Q3 are no different than they were in Q2, which is pressure on acute care volumes and strength on the behavioral side.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to go back to Vegas and I guess my question is a little more specific in regards to the Summerlin capacity expansion.", "Alan or Steve, I guess just the way I would frame the question is given that the Summerlin is probably your highest margin asset in the market, is it possible that maybe we\u2019ve seen more of a structural change in your Vegas margin profile going forward? It just seems like we\u2019ve seen so far since that\u2019s ramped up much better acute margins. And I just want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about that Summerlin expansion in context?", "Alan Miller", "Look, I think, Darren, your overall point is correct. I mean, by the way, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s terribly specific to Summerlin in the sense that just like when we talk about behavioral capacity expansion, if we can expand capacity in existing facilities and fill that capacity, then that\u2019s probably the highest return investment we can make, because there\u2019s little sort of fixed costs, fixed operating costs, that\u2019s associated with it. I think it\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve been able to drive behavioral margins up as much as we have in the last few years.", "We haven\u2019t had as many opportunities to do that on the acute side. Summerlin has been a unique opportunity, but, yes, I think and part of the problem with Summerlin is we opened that Summerlin capacity in January of \u201810, and in the teeth of this terrible recession, particularly in Las Vegas, and so we didn\u2019t get much impact out of it in 2010. In fact, I think Summerlin\u2019s volumes didn\u2019t change much.", "But clearly in \u201811 we\u2019re starting to see some ramp-up, some incremental capacity, and that\u2019s absolutely helping Summerlin\u2019s margins and the company\u2019s margins, and they indicated to Justin in answer to the question before, I think we would expect it would continue to get better as the economy improves and demand improves.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then one thing I just wanted to clarify. Did you bring some facilities on balance sheet? There was I guess a little bit of a higher D&A number and correspondingly a lower rent expense number, and I just want to make sure I understand what was going on there. That was relative to my model, so\u2013 ?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah. I know nothing really in the quarter, Darren. We\u2019ll go back and look. But I suspect it\u2019s probably just a tweaking of our depreciation for the opening balance sheet of PSI and some of the new projects, but nothing of an operational nature came on-line in Q2.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So are you suggesting there was some kind of true-up in D&A in the period that we might want to call out or think about?", "Alan Miller", "I mean, I would to have go back and look. All I would suggest is I think that the Q2 depreciation is the right run rate to use.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just the last thing, and I don\u2019t want to wordsmith here too much, but, Steve, you said PSI is performing generally in line, so maybe a little more of a qualification perhaps. I just want to make sure I\u2019m hearing what you\u2019re saying and not reading too much into it. But, Alan, I think you gave us a general sense, but is there anything specific you would want to call out, just as regards to how you\u2019re characterizing it?", "Alan Miller", "No, I think that what I was trying to say in my comments are simply that obviously we give same-store metrics because we have them on very strong admissions and pretty robust pricing, etcetera, and I think we were just trying to make the point that we\u2019re seeing those same metrics in the PSI facilities as well. Alan, I think pointed to the fact that we\u2019ve seen some areas of improvement, things like overtime and registry expense, but I think we\u2019ve been able to impact almost immediately without any real change to the operations or disruption in the operations.", "I think, for the most part, you\u2019ve heard us say that most of the operational changes that we \u2013 and improvements we would hope to make to the PSI facilities will be done in the 2012 and \u201813 timeframe, but those are the only points we\u2019re trying to make. And we\u2019re not trying to wordsmith or be cute about anything here. So it\u2019s pretty straightforward from our perspective.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. Maybe, just follow up on that last point. As you think about the operational opportunities longer-term, any updated thinking on margin potential at PSI facilities?", "Steve Filton", "Tom, I think that again this is another one of these issues \u2013 I think what we have to in Q2 is largely a reiteration of what we\u2019ve said before. I think that the difference between the two companies\u2019 apples-to-apples margin were probably a couple of hundred basis points. The UHS margins were better.", "I think we believe that probably half of that is structural in nature and has to do with the fact that PSI had a bit more of an emphasis and skewed towards the residential business, which by definition has a lower margin. Of the remaining 100 basis points, I think, we think that a measurable amount of that can be closed over time. And by 2012, 2013, we should be able to close, again, a measurable portion of that.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay. And the admissions growth continues to be very strong. Do you have a sense of what you think the market is growing versus maybe what you\u2019re taking either in terms of share or how much additional capacity is generating the volume that you\u2019re seeing?", "Steve Filton", "I think it\u2019s hard or difficult for us to, sort of, parse out what portion of admission growth comes from market share increase or capacity increase. I mean, I will say this \u2013 we\u2019ve made this comment before \u2013 that without the capacity additions that we\u2019ve done for a number of years and that frankly PSI had been doing for a number of years and that we believe we\u2019re going to continue to do for several years, it would be difficult for us to get to 7% admission growth.", "So, certainly, some of that growth is attributable to the capacity expansion. We believe that some of it\u2019s attributable to the benefits of Mental Health Parity legislation, although frankly that\u2019s even harder to precisely define.", "And we also believe, as I think your question suggests, Tom, that we think some of it is just due to the strength and increasing demand for behavioral services, in general. And they\u2019ve proved to be less, sort of, economically sensitive than acute care demand and acute care volumes, but it\u2019s difficult to sort of parse it into pieces.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Okay. And last one from me. You mentioned maybe pricing backing off a bit in the second half. You pointed to Medicaid. I guess, Medicare, maybe a little pressure there. And managed care, though, you said it\u2019s been strong. What ranges are you seeing for new contracts, sort of, price increases, and is that steady up or down as you look out?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I mean, the managed care pricing range that we\u2019ve quoted for some time now has been this 5 to 7%. And I think by characterizing managed care pricing on the strong side implies that we\u2019ve been at the high end of that range, and we\u2019ve not really seen any significant changes in that in the last couple quarters.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert", "Thanks. Maybe, first question just for Steve or Alan. I think you\u2019ve got a new executive that joined to run the acute care segment. Can you talk a little bit about Marvin, his experience coming from the non-profit world, what he brings to Universal, and just maybe any general comments about any newer priorities that division may have or if this hire signals anything that we should be aware of?", "Alan Miller", "Well, Marvin is an exceptional executive. He both has a financial background and an operating background. He is extremely highly thought of in the industry. I\u2019ve had a number of people contact me and congratulate me on having a man of his caliber join us. He\u2019s highly experienced. So we are very delighted he\u2019ll be with us in a couple of weeks.", "We think that \u2013 as I mentioned, his strength is across the board, but he has a background in strategy. He\u2019s very good with managed care and doing different projects and doing different joint ventures. He\u2019s an excellent operator, and he had been designated chief financial officer. So he brings an unusual combination. He\u2019s experienced, and we\u2019re very excited about having him join the company.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert", "Okay Great. And maybe, Steve, just update us on your thoughts with regards to buying physician practices. Are you warming up to the idea more, have you bought any at this point, or is it just still not prevalent in many of your markets?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. Whit, I think, what we\u2019ve said about physician practice acquisition is that we\u2019re approaching it judiciously and definitely on market by market basis. I think that we believe that some of the benefits of physician practice acquisition have been overstated. We think that frankly the history of the industry has demonstrated that on more than one occasion. But, on the other hand we also recognize and acknowledge that particularly in certain markets; there is competitive pressure to do so. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag.", "In some markets, we\u2019re pursuing physician acquisitions pretty aggressively and have already completed some. In other market, like a Las Vegas, physician practice acquisition has really kind of been a non-event in the market itself, and we\u2019re certainly not doing anything to disrupt that dynamic. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, and as we, I think, approach this business in general, we do what we think is right in every individual market to suit market facts and circumstances.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert", "That\u2019s helpful. And just maybe last one, just high-tech and thinking about stage one meaningful use, just any updates on the internal investments or general thoughts.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, as we\u2019ve I think disclosed before, we\u2019ve brought one hospital live on the Cerner system, which we \u2013 is the system that we think will qualify for the meaningful use criteria. We have schedule to bring the remaining 24 hospitals live over the course of the next two years. We have submitted applications to a number of states for Medicaid reimbursement for 2011. Some of the state Medicaid programs allow reimbursement really based just on your commitment to implement a system as opposed to meeting the same sort of criteria that Medicare and the high-tech act required.", "It is conceivable. We\u2019ve applied for those funds. We think that we could receive by the end of 2011 some not insubstantial amount, but we\u2019re also continuing to talk with our accountants and auditors about how we would recognize that. I know that some of our peers have already recognized those revenues. I think we are inclined generally to recognize the revenues as we implement the system, but we\u2019ll do whatever the industry deems to be the appropriate accounting treatment.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert", "Maybe any book-ins to think about what the cash could be that you think you may receive from the states in 2011, or is it just too early to tell?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I \u2013 we\u2019ve applied for amounts that probably fall between 10 and $20 million. I wouldn\u2019t speculate at this point on the likelihood of what we might receive in 2011.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert", "Yeah, all right. Thanks a lot, Steve.", "Steve Filton", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. I\u2019m \u2013 it sounds like with PSI largely integrated I was just curious what\u2019s your appetite might be for either acute or behavioral acquisitions going forward. That was my first question. And then a second one, I think you mentioned, not to be too picky here, but on the Sierra, you mentioned one of the things that you\u2019re trying to wrap up is the specifics on how you allocate the rate increases. I think you said a cross diagnosis. I\u2019m just curious, is that a normal negotiation that you would have? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So on the acquisition front, Frank; I guess, as somebody\u2019s question before indicated, our cash flow and debt repayment plans are ahead of schedule. I think our run rate leverage is sort of around 3.1 times, and again, is ahead of where we expect it to be at this point and certainly ahead of the 4.0 times we were at, right around when we announced the acquisition.", "So we\u2019re very pleased with our leverage position. We feel it affords us a great deal of flexibility and we are actively pursuing opportunities in both business segments to expand where that makes sense.", "And again, I think it\u2019s \u2013 as it always does, it\u2019s sort of the whole array of opportunities. One-off acquisitions, capacity expansions, larger acquisitions, and I think UHS has a well-deserved reputation for approaching these in an opportunistic and disciplined way, and I think that\u2019s going to be our approach, but certainly our leverage and capital structure has us feeling that we have very few limitations if there are good opportunities out there.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "And then on the Sierra?", "Steve Filton", "I\u2019m sorry. Yeah, it\u2019s hard I guess for me to describe what\u2019s kind of a normal managed care negotiation, Frank. The Sierra negotiation is a little different because I think some of our contracts have more differentiation existing between diagnoses, etcetera.", "The Sierra contract was \u2013 as large it was it was largely kind of a single rate contract, and we were trying to be a bit more nuanced in this go-round, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s causing a little bit of the extra work here at the end. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s terribly \u2013 indicates a terrible departure from what would be the shape and structure of other managed care contracts.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen", "Hi. Couple of follow-ups. First based on your comments on Sierra I trust that there aren\u2019t changes in the ultimate payment terms of how we get the same pricing spend having is that true?", "Alan Miller", "Well what I said, Christine is obviously we believe we\u2019ve agreed upon an increased amount, and, yes, we think we\u2019re going to get that regardless of what we agree to, that whatever we agree to in terms of the specific diagnoses and allocation of rates to procedures it will total to the agreed upon increased amount.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen", "Okay. All right. So there\u2019s no risk in the details here.", "Alan Miller", "We don\u2019t believe so.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen", "Okay. And then the three facilities that you\u2019re selling, could you remind us what the sell proceeds are likely to be on that in the second half?", "Alan Miller", "The sale proceeds are likely to be somewhere in the $100 million range when all the deals are completed, but I can\u2019t guarantee they will all be completed in the second half of the year.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen", "And then this may not be possible, but is it on the acute care pricing side possible to put numbers around, gee of the 7.1% pricing in acute, we think we got two percentage points on CMI, we think we got better commercial pricing execution of something else, and then payer mix was worth something else? Or is that not something that\u2019s quantifiable?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah, I think the easy answer is I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible, Christine. It\u2019s certainly not possible for me right now, but we will try and put some more substance around that and maybe include it in some of our conference presentations, etcetera, perhaps in Q3.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen", "Okay. And then final question, can you confirm if you have an uninsured patient your net revenue that you book is less than it is for insured patients?", "Alan Miller", "Sure. For a truly uninsured patient, in almost every case, there\u2019s going to be a charity care and uninsured discount, and the amount of net revenue associated with that patient is going to be extremely low, quite frankly. The only exception to that would be if you add a patient who, for whatever reason, you concluded that even though they lacked insurance had the means to pay their bills and you were not taking any discount, I can assure you those patients are few and far between.", "Christine Arnold \u2013 Cowen", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fishbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "I was just looking at the psych margins again. And if I back into it, it looks like the same-store psych margins were up sequentially, but the non-acquired margins were down sequentially. Is there any reason for that?", "Alan Miller", "I think the problem in doing that, Kevin is we include some other nonrecurring items in the non same-store stuff that I think is going to distort your attempt to do that analysis. I would tell you that I think that if you will, using the term same-store margins for both the UHS and PSI facilities are both up, and they\u2019re both up by similar amounts on a sequential basis.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. That makes sense. And then the 300 plus beds that you guys are looking to build this year, I think that that number is less than what you and Psych Solutions used to be doing separately but combined. Any thought about why that number is the right number here versus maybe what the pro forma company used to be doing?", "And I guess I would have thought there might be some catch-up about some of the issue with Psych Solutions was they did not really continue to build beds last year. I thought there might actually be some pickup.", "Alan Miller", "Yeah, it\u2019s all \u2013 those are all fair comments, Kevin. I think the challenge that we have in adding psych beds is that obviously people like to model them in a very ratable way and a very predictable way, and it\u2019s hard to do.", "I think we believe that there is a pipeline of potential bed capacity expansion that\u2019s pretty significant. Again, in both portfolios, because of regulatory issues and licensing and to a lesser \u2013 local zoning issues, we are working as fast as we can to add those beds, but, I think the pace is likely to pick up in \u201812 and \u201813.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. And then last question, one of the things that I think in the past when we talked about taking the improvement on the acute care side and released \u2013 factoring it into the numbers going forward, one of the things is that you were looking for as far as payer mix was not only just uninsured being down but also commercial volumes being up. So I guess when we think about the mix trends is it right that we\u2019re seeing uninsured volumes down but we still haven\u2019t seen a rebound in commercial volumes?", "Alan Miller", "That\u2019s absolutely correct.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Rex with JPMorgan.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks. One more question, as we look to understand revenue yields better and kind of what\u2019s going on there. Can you just size explicitly \u2013 and maybe I just missed this \u2013 what the percentage change in your case-mix index was in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "I think the case-mix index is probably \u2013 Medicare case-mix index is probably 3 or 4% higher than it was in the comparable quarter last year, and I think our non-Medicare case-mix increased by a similar amount.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "And was that \u2013 if you go back 1Q, would have that been a similar move or was this a step-up?", "Steve Filton", "I believe that the increase in both quarters was fairly similar, although sequentially Q2 was yet higher than Q1.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. So the absolute \u2013 if I saw the absolute case-mix index, it was sequentially higher.", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So at least from a Medicare perspective, our case-mix index \u2013 we made this comment in Q1, but I\u2019ll reiterate \u2013 is now \u2013 it\u2019s the highest it\u2019s ever been.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "All right. And with regards to kind of some of the commentary that HCA was making earlier, specifically as it relates to cardiovascular surgeries and such, have you seen any shift there in that specific category?", "Steve Filton", "No, I would say \u2013 and again, as you might imagine, John, I mean, we\u2019ve been largely focused this week on our own results and not paying too much attention to what others have reported, but I know that HCA talked a little bit about cardiovascular procedures, in general, and ICD procedures specifically.", "We\u2019ve seen those procedures decline. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I certainly wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s new to Q2. I think that decline has been fairly secular and has been in place for some time now. So, again, I don\u2019t think there was anything terribly different about that trend for us in Q2. And obviously, we\u2019ve seen an uptick in enough other procedures to move the acuity needle up.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great. And then on the Psych business, so residential has been somewhat a headwind. You\u2019ve commented in the past in terms of length of stay and states moving that. Can you size what\u2019s \u2013 if you just break out the Medicaid residential business, what\u2019s happened to length of stay over the past year? I\u2019m just trying to see how much of a headwind that is and understand kind of what that\u2019s inserting in the overall length of stay in Psych.", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think, you can just sort of go from the overall numbers. I mean, these are rough numbers, but admissions are up 7%, patient days are up 3%, which sort of implies that length of stay is down 4.", "What that really means is because of the length of stay decline is focused in the residential business, the length of stay is down even more than that in the residential business. But that order of magnitude, I think, gives awe sense of what we\u2019re talking about.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "I mean \u2013 and should we think of that as still an accelerating trend from the stays? I guess what I mean by this \u2013 is there still a long way to go for the states in terms of cutting length of stay in that business or should we be basing out? And that just comes back to \u2013 do we ever see any benefit in the consolidated length of stay from Mental Health Parity and other things like that?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I would answer the question in two ways, John. I mean, one is \u2013 look, I think that the reduction in length of stay on the part of state Medicaid programs is part in parcel with the reduction in Medicaid rates. I mean it is just another mechanism for the states in their own minds to pay less for mental healthcare.", "I think, from a clinical perspective, what our clinicians would argue is one of the reasons you\u2019re seeing admissions so strong even in the residential business as well as the acute business is that it is a sort of clinically flawed strategy that you\u2019re just discharging these parents sooner and they\u2019re just coming back to the facility faster.", "So I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s an effective strategy on the states\u2019 part, but I\u2019m not sure they are going to abandon it. So I think, as long as we continue to see Medicaid rate cuts, we\u2019re likely to see Medicaid length of stay cuts as well.", "John Rex \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Hi. I guess, it\u2019s either for Steve or Alan. A couple things. One, Alan, I\u2019d be interested in your perspective on how, if and when, the debt ceiling drama ends. And secondly, could you just talk specifically about the former PSI facilities? I mean, when they ran these facilities, we would seemingly get a press release every week about some patient care issue.", "What have you guys done specifically either to address that or to maybe improve the regulatory response, when something happens, because we would notice sometimes they would choose to fight the regulators versus work with them when there was a problem?", "Alan Miller", "Let me talk, John, about the problems that they may have had. We have dedicated a great deal of effort and a number of people to reviewing all the procedures, particularly in the quality area, and we\u2019re working our way through the facilities. So I\u2019m very confident that whatever number of incidents they have had in the past and the problems will be a lot less going forward. We have very capable group, and I think we\u2019re doing well in that regard.", "With regard to the debt ceiling, I was telling Steve this morning, I view that pretty much the way I view the NFL problem. I think that ultimately it will get resolved. The business round table a couple of weeks ago, 400 companies, we sent a letter in to the administration telling them that they had to resolve the situation before we fell off a cliff somewhere, and I think that\u2019s going to happen.", "And I don\u2019t know how. There\u2019s a vote today, as you know, and we\u2019ve all been following this as it goes along. Now there\u2019s a vote in the house, and then it goes to the Senate, then the President, but I can\u2019t imagine that ultimately something doesn\u2019t get done in the short run to avoid what could be a huge problem. And I think we\u2019ll actually, for the hospital business, and healthcare in general, I don\u2019t think there will be too much emphasis on us in the short run.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Thanks. And just one more follow-up on Psych I mean was it \u2013 after you\u2019ve done these things for a while do you think the quality issue was it a training issue, was it that you had to hire new people and replace a lot of the people that you had, was it just regulatory \u2013 sluggishness on regulatory response?", "Steve Filton", "John, I think the company was more focused on acquisitions and growing the company and showing size growth, quarter-by-quarter and not as detailed on the operations.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Art Henderson with Jefferies & Company.", "Arthur Henderson \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Steve, going back on the CapEx, I know you talked a little bit earlier on in your comments about that number, but if I take the first half of the year, annualize out what you\u2019ve spent, it\u2019s about 232 million, and I think in your comments you said 325 to 350 is still on target.", "So I\u2019m curious, if I \u2013 is there going to be some incremental spend in there in the back half that would get to you that number, or is that expectation a bit high, the CapEx will ultimately be lower?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, Art, I mean if what I said was interpreted to be that we\u2019re still going to get to that original capital spend guidance, I\u2019m glad you asked the question, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really going to happen. You know, I think it\u2019s far more likely that we \u2013 what I tried to say was that the pace of the spent will pick up in the second half of the year. I think the number we get to is much more likely to be kind of a 275 to 300 number.", "Arthur Henderson \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, 275 to 300. And then going back on \u2013 Alan, I know you were just talking about your perspective on Washington, and you mentioned short term hospitals are going to be okay. I was just curious, has the dynamic in Washington changed dramatically from \u2013 when you came out of the Healthcare Reform Bill and you had some visibility there, are they a bit more intolerant on making sure that the hospitals have extended visibility are you having to \u2013 seems like the number of ads that get run on TV supporting the hospitals and pushing against cuts seems to have gone up so I\u2019m just curious like what kind of demands are being made on the hospital sector to the extent that you could talk about those at the moment?", "Steve Filton", "Well, the hospital industry has been running the ads, so they haven\u2019t been a big surprise to us. You know, there\u2019s a hospital in every community, and it\u2019s a big employer in every community, and all of the legislators are well aware of the importance of the hospital, and its importance in people\u2019s lives. So we just keep pointing that out.", "And beyond that, I think you know what we all know, and that there has been a great deal of expense beyond what the nation brings in, and there will be areas looking to reduce expense. But I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s got to be done carefully, and I don\u2019t see that legislators will want to do that at the hospital level without very, VERY carefully reviewing what they\u2019re doing and doing it very judiciously.", "Arthur Henderson \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "And one last follow-up to that. To the extent that there are a lot of non-profits out there that are sort of tearing on the edge, I mean in times like this as your phones start ringing off the hook more from people looking to partner up, or is there any sort of change in that dynamic?", "Alan Miller", "I don\u2019t know that there is. As Steve had mentioned, we\u2019re very active. We\u2019re talking to a lot of people, and where we find an opportunity, we\u2019re in a position to act on it. We\u2019re feeling good about our financial situation, so that\u2019s all I could say with regard to your question.", "Arthur Henderson \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. All right. Well, thank you, Alan. I Appreciate. Thanks, Steve.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I think we have time maybe for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. (Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from Jake Hindelong of Ticonderoga.", "Jake Hindelong \u2013 Ticonderoga", "Okay. Good morning. Just a couple of questions, guys. First up, it\u2019s on guidance. So your first two quarters ran ahead of budget, so I seem to be on trend. Would it be fair to assume that if the remainder of the year stays more or less on that trend that we could focus on the high end of your guidance range?", "Steve Filton", "Jake, I mean to be fair, I think the idea of having a range out there is that we\u2019re suggesting that that\u2019s our range. Once we start suggesting in essence where in the range we should be, I think we\u2019ve changed our range. So we\u2019re going to just stick with telling you what our range is.", "Jake Hindelong \u2013 Ticonderoga", "Okay. Great. Thanks, Steve. And then just secondly on the behavioral facilities that you\u2019ve been divesting or that you\u2019re planning to divest over the next couple of quarters, what kind of EBITDA multiples are you seeing?", "Alan Miller", "We, I think, said from the beginning that we thought we could dispose of the four facilities for a turn or two less than what we bought them for and I think we still think we\u2019re kind of in that range.", "Jake Hindelong \u2013 Ticonderoga", "Thanks, guys.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. Well, we thank everybody for their time this quarter, and we look forward to speaking with everyone again after the third quarter results.", "Operator", "Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host Mr. Filton. Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you and good morning. I am Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011.", "During this conference call Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements. We recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.04 for the year and $0.98 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating primarily to prior years, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, was $0.91.", "Included in the quarter is a year-to-date reduction to our effective tax rate due to final implementation of certain state income tax planning and the securing of certain state tax credits.", "We define operating margin as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages, and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and doubtful accounts divided by net revenue. Our operating margins increased to 16.7% during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 15.7% during the comparable prior year period.", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2011. We note that the PSI facilities are included in our same-store data for one month this quarter. Adjusted admissions and patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 8.3% and 4.1% respectively during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.4% during the fourth quarter of 2011 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 24.7% during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 22.6% during the comparable prior year period.", "On a same-facility basis in our acute division, revenues increased 1.6% during the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase resulted primarily from a 1.3% increase in revenues per adjusted admission. Adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year were relatively flat. The relatively muted revenue growth reflects a $6 million reduction in the quarter of Medicaid disproportionate share and UPL reimbursements, primarily related to Texas as well as the continued impact of negative economic trends in certain of our local markets.", "On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 13.3% during the fourth quarter of 2011 from 14.4% during the fourth quarter of 2010. We also note that they were no EHR related revenues included in our quarterly financial statements.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates, amounting to $248 million and $208 million during the three month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.", "As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debt, charity care expense and the uninsured discount in this year's fourth quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the fourth quarter of 2010. However, due primarily to the increase in behavioral health revenues in the very low levels of bad debt and uninsured discounts in that business or overall percentage of bad debts, charity care and uninsured discounts were lower than those experienced during the fourth quarter of 2010.", "Our cash from operating activities was approximately $156 million during the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 49 days during the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to a slowdown in Medicaid payments from the State of Illinois.", "At December 31, 2011, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 61%. We spent $90 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to a 97 bed replacement behavioral hospital in Kentucky, which recently opened and the ongoing construction of a new acute care hospital in Temecula, California.", "We opened a total of 263 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest facilities in 2011. And effective in the first quarter of 2012, we have completed all of the divestitures required by the FTC as part of the PSI acquisition. The proceeds from these divestitures totaled approximate $115 million consistent with our expectations.", "Excluding the unfavorable $0.04 per diluted share EHR impact described in our press release, our estimated range of earnings per diluted share attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2012, is $4.33 to $4.48 and projected net revenues of $7.2 billion. You should note that this revenue figure excludes the previously announced NAP acquisition, which is not included in our 2012 guidance.", "Our net revenues for 2012 have been adjusted to reflect reclassification of our provision for doubtful accounts, which began in January 1, 2012, will be reflected as a deduction from revenues rather than as an operating expense.", "Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of AJ Rice.", "A.J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Could you maybe tell us, in your mind, maybe give us a little bit of flavor for what you see to be the sling factors in 2012 guidance? And I know you key operational variables move into, around and that. And then you don't typically give quarterly guidance, but I think you're facing a fairly tough comp in Vegas in the first quarter, which I think it was fairly strong last year. Can you give us any sense at all about maybe first quarter outlook in light of that? I assume the way you lay out the guidance is the rest of the year the comps will get about considerably easier, particularly as you move to the back half of the year?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, actually you've asked for a lot of information in short order, but that's fine. I think as we reflect back on 2011 it was a tail, particularly in the acute segment of two-halves of the year. As you suggest, early in the year, particularly in the first quarter and particularly in the Las Vegas market, we saw a significant improvement in our payer mix and as a consequence a rise in our revenue growth per unit. And we were not able to sustain that as the year went on, as unemployment after coming down in the beginning of the year in Las Vegas rose again as the year went on. So revenues in the acute segment rose on average and that's inclusive of bad debt, something live 5.5% in the first half of the year and only about 2.5% in the back half of the year.", "Our 2012 guidance for the acute division is more reflective of the way we exited the year and pegs revenue growth for the acute segment in kind of the 3% to 3.5% range, much more closely to what we're currently running.", "On the behavioral side, again, the results have been more consistent in our guidance for 2012, reflects that consistency we estimate that we'll be able to grow revenues in 6% to 6.5% range. And that's the premise of our guidance.", "From a quarterly perspective, you raised I think a very fair point, and you're right we don't give quarterly guidance but we would certainly will try and remind people that we had a very strong first half of the year and extremely strong first quarter.", "I think if you look at it historically, in what I would sort of call a normal year. We've earned something like 52% of our pre-tax earnings in the first half of the year. And 48% in the back half give or take percentage or two. In 2011, I think those numbers were closer to 58%, 59% in the first half of the year.", "We would suggest and our own internal guidance suggests that 2012 will return to kind of a normalized allocation with us earning something like 51% or 52% of our overall annual earnings in the first half of the year. So I think as you all think about your models and your allocations of our guidance or your own guidance, obviously I would suggest that that you sort of keep those guidelines in mind.", "A.J. Rice - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Just last thing, on the NAP acquisition you said that that is not in the guidance. Can you give us sort of your update on that and then if it were to close with that be something that you would say is sort of neutral issue or could it be additive at some point this year?", "Alan Miller", "We announced the NAP acquisition, I think back at the end of November, subsequent to that the selling board of the hospital realized that they had a legal obligation to obtain approval for the sale from an independent hospital authority board and they have been in the process of attempting to do that and are determined to do it.", "They have run into some obstacles. We've largely sort of stepped aside as they try and resolve this problem. We stand ready to complete the deal. If in fact they get the requisite approvals, we're prepared to move forward.", "The main reason I mentioned that NAP wasn't in the guidance is because I think some people were struggling a little bit with our revenue projections without NAP in the guidance. As far as an earnings perspective, we were always thinking that in 2012 the NAP transaction would be fairly neutral to having any impact on our 2012 earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Maybe just starting at the point and I just want to say it is a great year for you guys. And just looking back through to my notes and I guess we started the year initially at about $3.55. So it's certainly a very strong year even with some of the headwinds you highlighted, Steve, in the acute care space. So maybe just a quick update in terms of just the key markets, just get some more color on Vegas and then on the McAllen market, also Steve?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Adam. When I talked about or referred to kind of a tale of the two half of the year, a lot of that I think is a function of our individual and most important markets. The Vegas market really outperformed in the beginning of the year, they saw their unemployment rate dropped in a short period of time from a high of about 15% to something like 12% in the first quarter of 2011. But then as the year progressed unfortunately that employment rate downs back to 14% and our payer mix consistently sort of deteriorated with that metric.", "Right now, I think it's sort of status quo in the market. Our Vegas volumes were relatively soft in Q4. Payer mix remains stable to maybe very slightly down. There is a lot that's been written about the market, much more focus quite frankly on the gaming industry that suggests that by the end of 2012 the market will start to see some broader economic recovery.", "For the most part we really have not embedded any of that in our guidance. Our guidance simply assumes that the payer mix situation stabilizes and as a result of that that our revenue growth picks up a very slight amount from where we are today.", "The South Texas, particularly the McAllen market is much of the same. We've disclosed in number of previous quarters that the economy down there has been a fairly soft over the last four or five quarters. That market is plagued by some unique issues, border violence, issues in Mexico that obviously are again very unique to that market and much of the same our expectations over that not a lot of that changes in a significant way in 2012.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "And just a couple of follow-up questions. And then I guess with the PSI integration fully ramped up now. I guess, just, you'd outlined the base case $40 million in the synergies and potentially in $20 million just on the improved margins. So just, Steve, any update in terms of just relative to the initial base case in terms of how you're thinking about just the overall impact from that?", "Steve Filton", "So I think that the corporate overhead synergies, Adam, we estimated, we would achieve about half of it, literally out the gate with the transaction a year ago. And we'd achieved the remaining half of the $40 million that you alluded to over the course of a couple years. I think that has gone, very much according to plan. I think we're largely there. We've gotten most of those overhead savings. There maybe a few million dollars to go in 2012. But I think we are certainly the lion share of the way there.", "As far as the margin improvement, I think as you start to see the behavioral result. You start to dig into them a little bit more. I think you'll see that we actually, well, we didn't anticipate getting a lot of margin improvement in 2011. I think you'll see that we actually were able to achieve a little bit of that margin improvement in '11.", "I think the general, since that they were somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points of available margin improvement over a couple of years. I think we still share that view. Again, I think we got a little bit of it in '11. And I think our sense is we'll get the rest of it in '12 and to some degree in '13 as well.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "And it is just a final question for Alan, maybe just if you could just talk a little about your view in terms of the overall environment and just clearly a lot of things going on in Washington but just your thoughts in terms of just managing in this environment with some of the uncertainty in the Washington?", "Alan Miller", "Adam, I don't think much is going to happen of anything. The election is coming in terms of legislation. As you know, some of the ObamaCare has been modified rollback exemptions. So that will be very interesting to see what the supreme court does and what happens in the election. So we don't anticipate anything much during the year, waiting for the election.", "The one thing, I had noticed that there appears to be a lot of opportunities coming up. The non-profits are uncertain, more uncertain than others and there is a lot of opportunities. And we have done well in terms of integration of psych solutions. So we are optimistic.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci.", "Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets", "Just two questions. One, both in behavioral health, the first, there has been some focus in Washington on the Medicare side. If you go back a few months in terms of look back to your PPS, just wondering what your latest views are there in terms of the potential for change or not in the Medicare side?", "And then, number two, clearly volumes have been very strong. I'm just wondering if it's real big picture, how you sort of seeing the supply demand equation out there. It seems like whenever you build a bed its fills fairly quickly. So where do you think these people getting care before the beds are build. Is there still a significant supply demand imbalance or really where you think the volume is coming from?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Tom. So taking the reimbursement question first, CMS had announced previously that when they came out with their annual Medicare rate update for behavioral. They would likely sort of do as you suggest that our retrospective look back on the PPS program and perhaps make some tweaks of the system. Some people I think get delivered to that to me and they would consider some major overhauls. There was some conversation at the MedPAC meeting or two in that regard.", "Our expectations, we've said this for while is that sometimes soon in the spring CMS will announce their rate update for fiscal 2012. We think that that's likely to be accompanied if at the most by some small changes in the side PPS system. But at this point we do not anticipate any significant revamps or reduce or overhauls of the system and largely anticipate that it will give business as usual in terms of Medicare reimbursement.", "In terms of volume strength in the behavioral business, we've attributed it to a few different dynamics. You focused on the one, which is our continued capacity expansion. And we have certainly benefited from that. And we have been clear that we didn't think we could be putting up the sort of growth numbers that we are. If we were not doing this sort of and have been doing this regular capacity expansion that at least in our own portfolio now then ongoing for probably six or seven years.", "I will say this time. I mean I think it's not just a question of the old feel, the dream dynamic that if you build it they will come. I think we have been very prudent and our operators have been very prudent in identifying those situations, those markets, those hospitals that have an unmet demand that are currently turning patients away. They're operating at very high occupancy levels. That's where we have been adding beds.", "And as a consequence as you suggested, when we add beds we've been pretty successful in filling them fairly quickly. I think we've also benefited from the fact that behavioral demand has not been as recession sensitive as demand in the acute care services are frankly demand in other health care services, that's been helpful in terms of weathering the recession.", "And finally, we certainly have been helped legislatively by mental health parity legislation, which is kind of taken a while to gain traction and to kick-in. But I think we've clearly benefited from that over the last few years. So we continue to pursue our capacity expansion program.", "We've got many, many hundreds of beds in the pipeline, various stages in the pipeline. We often have sort of regulatory zoning issues that we have to overcome, but we're working very aggressively because we think that the demand, we're not seeing any diminution in that demand. And so we want to be in a position in those markets whereas called for to take advantage of the growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse First Boston", "Just wanted to go back to the guidance, I guess I am sort of wondering, Steve, when you mentioned kind of that 3% to 3.5% on the acute care side and 6% to 6.5% on the behavioral side, maybe if you could help us sort of bridge what that means sort of on the EBITDA side of things, obviously the last couple quarters, topline on the acute care side has been weak, which has led to sort of declines in the EBITDA numbers and so I'm just wondering how you're thinking about sort of the operating earnings growth in both of the businesses?", "Steve Filton", "I think on the acute side, Ralph, 3%, 3.5% growth would generally get you to EBITDA performance that would be flat to very slightly up. I think that there are few tailwinds that push that up a little bit in the sense that we've talked over the last year to about our acute care capital projects, that's new capital that we've employed in Texoma, and in Handel and new tower at Summerlin and those projects continue to ramp up.", "And I think provide a little bit more up lift and then we would get just from kind of same-store results. And also I think we've talked about some of the drag that we felt for more South West facility over the last couple of years, which has been very focused on some regulatory compliance issues. We've seem to be largely have that behind us and so we're hoping for pickup in that market as well. So that maybe pushes the EBITDA. It provides a little bit of cushion for that growth.", "On the behavioral side, again, I think our view is that 6% or 6.5% of revenue growth should translate into high-single digit. EBITDA growth and that includes I think going back to Adam's question some improvements in the acquired PSI portfolio. So I think that's where how the guidance rolls up to the growth that we project in the guidance.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse First Boston", "And then, just going back to the kind of 1Q, tough comp and the commentary, you know, helpful to get sort of that split first half to second half, I guess to get sort of a little more granular and would you be little in this sort of suggest, I mean do you expect EPS to sort of be up or down in the first quarter relative to what you reported in the first quarter of '11. What do you expect EPS to grow?", "Steve Filton", "I think again if you sort of do the math on the percentages that I suggested, it would sort of lead to the believe that we may well be a little bit behind by as you see in the first quarter and then make it up as the year progresses.", "Operator", "Your next comes from the line of Justin Lake.", "Justin Lake - UBS Securities", "Two questions here, first up for Alan. Alan, in the release you discussed being encouraged by opportunities to expand your presence in the behavioral health business, can you push that upwards?", "Alan Miller", "I have nothing specific to tell you but because of our position, when anyone wants to sell or anyone wants to have a new facility built we are the obvious one that they come to. So we are very, as Steve has pointing out we have been expanding our existing facilities, but we are looking at other things as well.", "Justin Lake - UBS Securities", "So you're seeing the pipeline for M&A or de novo opportunities expand versus where it's been the last few years or tell me if I'm wrong, I don't think there has been much in the way of M&As and obviously the psych solutions?", "Alan Miller", "Psych solutions but there is more business out there. We just had a conversation about building beds and seeming to fill them up when we build them. So there is demand out there. And we are preeminent in that business. And people come to us. So we are encouraged that we will continue to have opportunities both internally and for new facilities.", "Justin Lake - UBS Securities", "And then, just last, Steve, the second question was that I'm wondering if you can walk us through the cash flow and CapEx expectations for 2012?", "Alan Miller", "I think that our CapEx numbers which I think we disclosed in the 10-K but we're in that sort of 350 range, 350, 360 in terms of estimated CapEx for 2012 which is a little bit of a tick up from this year. And it's reflective of ramp up in the spending on a Temecula hospital that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. It's also reflective of a new patient tower we're building in our hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida as well as kind of smaller but cumulatively impactful numbers of all this behavioral expansion that we're doing both again in our legacy portfolio and in the acquired PSI portfolio as well.", "Cash flows, if you sort of run through our guidance and use the income numbers in our guidance, I think cash flows or free cash flows after CapEx is in the kind of 450, 500 range in 2012. And our guidance presumes that bulk of those cash flows go towards the repayment of debt as they have for the past 12 to 15 months.", "Justin Lake - UBS Securities", "And, Steve, you mentioned the repayment of debt there. And maybe I'll ask this to Allen specifically as you think about capital deployment there own, obviously you brought the side business. You made some commitments to leverage yourself back to investment grade. In the meantime, just recently there has been some really interesting deals from HCA and community in the debt market. You're paying down a low very cost debt for 2013. Any thoughts on where there might be opportunity to change tact there and mend expense to extent to some of these debt deals instead of paying down 4% debt ,buy back stock or do accretive acquisitions that might be more shareholder-friendly?", "Alan Miller", "I think you covered just about all the opportunities. We're looking at. The company is opportunistic. And we are considering all of the above. In terms of, I might be a little more specific, potentially buyback acquisitions and expansion of our existing portfolio. And having come down to 60%, 61%, we are moving in a very strong direction financially.", "Justin Lake - UBS Securities", "And If I could just ask one last specific question, Steve, in terms of the debt with these deals going on, just curious if you talked to bankers about what that market might look for you. And if you have any estimate for us in terms of if you were to do a transaction here. This amend may extend maybe even a recap, where would the debt markets looks like versus or the interest expense look like on that debt versus what you currently have?", "Steve Filton", "The easy answer to your question is we're always talking to our banks and looking at what's happening in the markets currently. So that's a process that literally is sort of ongoing all the time.", "I think if you look at what our peers have done in the last month lets say, those I think refinancing deals have been driven by one or two motives or maybe both wanted to lower their interest rates and interest expense and two was to extent their terms out. As far as lowering interest rates, even with the refinances that have taken place our interest rate structure is still by far the best out there.", "I think that it would be difficult for us in this market to improve our interest rates much if at all. So that's tough for us. And then in terms of extending our terms out again, not getting into the specifics of our peers. Our terms already are going out at a four five years. So we don't sort of feel that's same, a kind of immediate pressure to do that.", "So again, we're always looking at the market and we'll continue to do so. And if opportunities rose along the menu that Alan discussed, we're always interested in what we could access the markets for additional capital. So we're always doing that. But again, I mean I think at the moment the general sense is to continue on the track and the trajectory that we've been on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Maybe you could just give us an update on where you are with regards to managed care contracting for 2012 and 2013 and any color in terms of what you're seeing ion the renegotiations both on the acute and the behavioral side?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Gary. It's an interesting area and I know a lot of the folks on the call routinely are having conversations with the managed care companies. And I know that the managed care companies tend only because I read many of your reports to paint a picture of a landscape that's changing a great deal that have a lot of sort of new dynamics in terms of narrower networks and tiered networks. And contracts that are much more aligned with quality metrics, et cetera.", "I think in real time and on the ground with our contracts, we're not seeing very many of those same dynamics. Our contracts tend to look very much like they've looked before. And our rate increases have tended to be fairly healthy. We've talked about getting rate increases in the 5% to 7% range for many quarters now. And I think we feel like we continue to be comfortably in that range.", "Most of our contracts for 2012 are in the books at this point. There is a small percentage more towards the end of the year. A goodly number of 2013 contracts are already committed to. And again, I think we're very comfortable that we remain in that range of at least 5% to 7% and without a whole lot of other changes to our contracts.", "And by the way, I'm not sure that we would be adverse to some of those other dynamics. I think we feel like we've got very strong provider networks in many of our markets and we'd be anxious to be in a tiered network or we rather see the top tier and narrower network, and we're anxious in many of our markets to have quality metrics play a larger role, et cetera. But we're just not seeing a lot of that.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Any sense or any thoughts on what types of benefit design changes you saw in '11 or might see in '12 and the impact that that's had on utilization, if any?", "Alan Miller", "I think the managed care companies are always in a better position than the providers are to give specific information about that. I mean I think our sense generally is that the trends that we've seen for the last few years continue, and that is a continued shift in the payment obligation from the company or the insurance planner, the managed care organization to the patient or the employee themselves.", "And so we are in the position of having to collect a larger portion of the bill from the patient themselves than from the insurer. We have a lot of great data on exactly how much that's occurred, et cetera. Certainly, that trend towards a greater payment obligation to the part of the employee or the patient and combined with the weak economy certainly has been a significant and maybe the most significant contributing factor to the muted demand that the acute business has seen over the last few years as patients where they're able to postponing and deferring more discretionary acute care. No question we continue to see that trend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fishbeck.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "I wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that were asked earlier. I just want to clarify around the acute care hospital EBITDA outlook. I think the 3% or 3.5% revenue growth would lead to flat to up slightly EBITDA. Why won't you be able to kind of keep margins flat with that type of revenue growth and then grow EBITDA on that 3% to 3.5% range?", "Steve Filton", "I think, Kevin, the nature of our business model, no different than our peers, is that this is largely a fixed and semi-fixed cost business. And I think that there has always been sort of a relatively modest amount of revenue growth that sort of covers, if you will, your cost inflation. And I think we believe in this environment it is roughly that sort of 3% to 3.5%. We certainly have a number of initiatives underway to restrain our cost inflation to the degree that we can or the growth of our cost.", "But our best guess is kind of in that 2.5% to 3.5% range is probably the rate at which you can keep your EBITDA flat. Now, obviously the corollary to that is a little bit of growth above and beyond that should lead to real margin expansion. And obviously if you can't get there, which is the position we've been in the last couple of quarters, you've seen some margin contraction.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "But if your revenue and your cost are growing at the same rate, doesn't that mean your EBITDA is going to also be growing 3%, 3.5%?", "Steve Filton", "Kevin, I don't mean to cut it too finely here. But I think we're right around that. This is just a mass exercise. If revenue grows at 3% and costs grow at 4%, then we should have some expansion. If revenue grows at 3% and costs grow 3.25%, we'd probably have relatively flat EBITDA. I think we're operating in a pretty narrow range when you're talking about those assumptions.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "And then as far as the deal environment, I don't know if I'm reading too much into, but I think Alan had made some comments about the deal outlook and being encouraged by. Historically, as a company, you guys have been some of the most cautious around acute care hospital acquisitions, because you have a very specific target deal in mind. Do you see that that pipeline is actually starting to heat up there or was I reading too much into that?", "Alan Miller", "We hear about a lot of deals. We hear about a lot of stresses in the acute business. So we're looking. And some folks thought we wouldn't do this type of deal before. We're always looking and the big thing is getting a good property, good price and having the ability to do it. I think we're there for all of those.", "Steve Filton", "I also would just clarify, Kevin, you're absolutely right that we haven't done a great deal of external M&A on the acute side in the last few years. As I mentioned earlier, we put about $0.5 billion of new capital into some very large projects, take them off before, Texoma, Palmdale, Summerlin. To a large degree, we've concluded that we could more economically prudently build new capacity than buy it from somebody else.", "And I think as Alan suggested before, we continue to go through that thought process as well. We're not stuck on expanding EBITDA in one particular way. If there are opportunities to grow existing EBITDA streams in our existing markets and existing franchises in both real and acute, we're going to pursue that. But we've definitely not been stuck on the notion that kind of one size or one transaction fits everything that we want to do.", "So we've been fairly aggressive or employed a fair amount of capital in growing our acute business over the last few years, even though it has not been as you probably really pointed out so much on the M&A side.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "I guess last quarter, you guys made some bullish commentary about just how you saw the dislocation in the stock price, historic drop, if you will. Q3 and Q4, you're buying back stock. I mean stock has come back up. Is share repurchase still a big part of the mix or should we read into commentary earlier that kind of debt pay down is really still the first use of capital?", "Steve Filton", "Again, I was clear that debt pay down remains our first use of capital. We continue to generate however a fair amount of cash. And I think Alan I thought was very clear in saying that all other options are on the table including share repurchase. So we're actively evaluating and pursuing all those other options at the same time.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "On the Medicaid side, I think in the 10-K you said that the fiscal '12 Medicaid rates were down 3% to 4%. What's your calendar '12 outlook for Medicaid?", "Steve Filton", "Just to frame it for everybody, most state Medicaid year is run from July to June, and we presume or we essentially know now that from July of '11 through June of '12 that our Medicaid rates are down on average about 3% or 4%. What our guidance and our budget presumes is that in July of '12 that Medicaid rates improve, at least relatively improve and maybe are down or flat to down maybe 1% beginning in July of '12.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Just a couple of specific questions here. I guess, first, as it relates to the behavioral business, you obviously picked up some contract related businesses, some things that you have been in the four. I'd be curious to see your thoughts on how you're viewing that set of businesses and whether that's something, you're going to be putting a little more emphasis in terms of growth going forward?", "Steve Filton", "So, Darren, I mean as part of the PSI acquisition we acquired, what used to be called the legacy Horizon business, which was their management contract business. Just to be clear, we had a management contract business for many years, in more recent years and specifically I think after Psych PPS was implemented, we didn't necessarily see that as a tremendous growth business. But PSI was successful with Horizon and we've embraced that business, and focused on it and continued to try and grow it.", "It is still a relatively small piece of the overall behavioral portfolio. And I think quite frankly, just given the size of the portfolio is unlikely the change from a relative level of importance in that sense. But it's a business that Horizon remains I think the biggest contract provider in the country and we certainly wanted to maintain that position.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "The contract business that you have in the construction management side of things, obviously separate business entirely. But is there anything at all in 2012 guidance that related to that, maybe just update us briefly on whether there's going to be much there going forward?", "Steve Filton", "We continue to pursue that business. Again, I would describe it as something that while we think it makes sense and as we're able to get contracts, they can be reasonably lucrative. It's like it would remain a small part of the business.", "We do have, I think we've mentioned this before, a new contract to build a hospital in Florida. There's probably a couple of penny of income in our 2012 guidance that are reflective of that particular contract. And again, we continue to look for incremental opportunities to that.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "And maybe just last question here as it relates to the Cerner implementation, you've maybe shifted some things around with regard to your high-tech contribution. Can you just update us there on how that's coming together and how we should be thinking about the impact on expenses mainly in 2012 as you move through that process?", "Steve Filton", "So again, just to put this in historical perspective, we signed our Cerner contract at the very end of 2009, spent the next 18 months or so on the design phase of that project and implemented our first hospital on Cerner in roughly July of 2011. We then have a plan and a schedule that has us converting the balance of our 25 acute care hospitals over the course of the next 24 months or so. And we've been adhering to that schedule.", "So, obviously as we implement those hospital, we've been differing from a financial reporting perspective, we've been differing the design and implementation fees and we start to amortize them as we bring each hospital live, that will be the bulk of the sort of incremental effect. And when we talked in our guidance about the incremental expense related to Cerner to EHR implementation Cerner to the EHR implementation, it's really mostly those investment type cost that will start to be amortized.", "From an operating perspective, Darren, we had an EHR system in place prior to Cerner, basically a home grown system, and we had operating cost associated with that. We generally feel that the operating cost related to Cerner will simply replace the operating cost that we had in our home grown system and there won't be a whole lot of incremental expense. There maybe some as we do the transition, kind of duplicative expense at each hospital a couple of months a duplication effect, but not a whole lot.", "So I think our view is that operating expenses remain largely the same, what I'll sort of call the one-time capital investment, which we've pegged at $6 million or $7 million for each of our acute care hospitals is really the source of the bulk of the incremental expense. And then obviously, we hope that a significant portion, albeit not all of that winds up getting reimbursed through high-tech reimbursement.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christine Arnold.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "A couple of questions on the behavioral health division, can you clarify, are you expecting your Psych PPS update to be about 3% in October 2012?", "Steve Filton", "Christine, I believe our guidance presumes it's between 2% and 3%, yes.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "And then, can we walk through some math here, as I think about the Psych business and the fact that you're converting maybe 150 basis points of revenue from Medicaid's commercial within your behavioral book, because you're taking now commercial patients and residential, and then you're converting residential beds to acute. You're targeting 150 to 200 beds, that's maybe to 2% to 3% of beds. It seems to me, it should get at least a 100 basis point boost to pricing, given that Medicaid pays 40% to 50% of what commercial does. Is that embedded in behavioral guidance in terms of the pricing or is that upside?", "Steve Filton", "First of all, Christine, I have to say that you are way better doing math in your head than I am. So I'm not sure I'm able to follow that. But I think your point is that, we're doing a number of things to shift away from our reliance on Medicaid, particularly in our residential business.", "I think the two things that you cited are that we're taking more commercial patients, which historically we really had very few commercial patients in our residential business. And secondly, we're converting at least a small number of beds from residential to acute, which again should have the effect of shifting away from our reliance on Medicaid.", "I think that, again, while I didn't follow the precise math that you went through. The fact that we've been able to sustain fairly high behavioral revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters of this year, despite the fact that we've had 3% or 4% cuts in our Medicaid reimbursement, I think is reflective in part, it's obviously reflective of the strong volumes that we have. But it's also reflective of what you're suggesting, which is some efforts on our part to reconfigure our payer mix a little bit to a more favorable and less Medicaid reliant payer mix. So again, while I can't comment on the precise math that you've talked, I think in general your sentiment is correct.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "So is there still room to move on, mixing more commercial into the residential and moving up to 200 residential beds to acute?", "Steve Filton", "Yes, I think we continue to look at those opportunities again to take commercial patients, where we've not necessarily taken them before and to convert residential beds where that opportunity exists. I don't think we feel we've exhausted either of those opportunities yet.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "And then just on the acute pricing, if I look at your net revenue per adjusted admission it was up 1.3% in the quarter in acute. If I take out the $6 million from the disproportionate share in Texas and EPL and also South Carolina, I get to 1.9%.", "Steve Filton", "Operator did we lose Christine.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "I have maybe just first it's a random question. There have been a string of what I think are somewhat interesting local press reports in the past month or so, that seem to point to a number of closures of the state owned psych hospitals. And it seems like a lot of these states are just taking the state funds and the patients and transferring them to the private freestanding providers. And I was just curious if you were (devey) of seeing this in any of your markets or just any thoughts on that?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I've seen some of those same press releases with. Again, I think as you know historically, the patient population that is tended to occupy state behavioral facilities is not the same as the patient population we normally treat in our facilities. I don't think we've really had the experience of getting a significant load of patients from a state facility in any of our markets. Maybe if that starts to happen with more frequency, we might see that.", "But it's not an easy sort of trade in essence, because I think and in a lot of cases these state hospitals are treating a more chronically old population that's designed for people who stay for longer periods of time. And quite frankly, I just don't think we're equipped in many cases to treat that same patient population.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "It seems interesting some like Medicaid like and Medicare payment that they are giving providers. But I guess maybe to follow on I think with Christine was, just can you talk maybe about UPL in 2011, and how it differed from 2010, and maybe thoughts on 2012? And if you want to comment just on any other pickup in other supplemental funds provider taxes it'd be helpful?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So I think that our UPL and disproportionate share, which we sort of combined as our kind of two special Medicaid reimbursement programs. I think in total, we're down somewhere between $12 million and $14 million from 2010 to 2011. We called out that $6 million of that reduction was in Q4.", "In our guidance for next year, we presume that that same reimbursement is down probably another $7 million to $9 million in our 2012 guidance. Again, most of that is Texas, although there are some other states. Provider taxes were down, as I recall about $3 million this year, and again I think our guidance presumes that they are down $1 million or $2 million next year. So that gives you a sense of how those numbers move next year.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "And maybe just back on at the Psych business for a second. Can you just sort of remind us where you are with some of your cost trends as wages, payroll, supplies form? Is there any reason that those unit cost would grow faster than your revenue over the foreseeable future?", "Steve Filton", "Well, look I think the behavioral business has a number of advantages that you've been able to see in our financial statements now for a while. First of all, the revenue growth in behavioral has clearly been more robust than it's been in acute and that allows us a lot more operating leverage. Getting back to the conversation I was having with Kevin before, if we think 2.5% or 3% is the kind of breakeven EBITDA growth rate or revenue growth rate, we've been well above that in behavioral. And you'll see that in our expanding margins.", "The other aspect of it is, is I think we just don't have quite the same level of cost inflation on the behavioral side maybe because you don't have that sort of what I'll call technological component, the cost of drugs or pharmaceuticals and medical equipment technology that you really have on the acute side. So if anything I think which I think refers to your question that cost inflation on the behavioral side maybe 50 basis points or 60 basis points slower than it is on the acute side.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "And may just one final editorial. I think you've now accumulated over $80 million in prior year favorable developments from med mal for the past three years and most companies would have taken full credit for that. So I just wanted to recognize your progress on that front?", "Steve Filton", "I appreciate that, Whit, thanks. We've generally been very conservative in that regard. And I appreciate somebody know this thing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Purvis.", "Kimberly Purvis - Cross Current Research", "You had mentioned that EBITDA improvement in the PSI portfolio was expected in 2012. What will be driving that? Is that improved volumes, pricing or something else?", "Steve Filton", "I think it's a little bit of everything, Kimberly. Although, I think generally we had the sense when we did the acquisition that the UHS facilities on average were run a little bit more efficiently. And that most of the savings or most of the margin gap closer would result from improved expense control.", "Kimberly Purvis - Cross Current Research", "Can you give a little bit more specific information on that, I mean, is it personal? What exactly is the rental expense? Just a little bit more color there?", "Steve Filton", "I think it's across the Board. I mean, obviously, if you look at our behavioral segment financial statements and 50% or more of our costs are salaries and wages. So obviously, some of those savings will come from the labor side of the business. But I think we feel it sort of comes pro rata if you will from across the income statement. And just I think is a function of a 30-year history we have of running that business and having the best margins in that business and just doing it as efficiently as anybody else.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up with Christine Arnold.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "I was attempting to ask about the acute pricing, which was up kind of 1.3% in that revenue per adjusted admission in the quarter. And excluding the $6 million from UPL DSH, it was only up 1.9%. So they get to 3%. Are we assuming a payer mix improvement in 2012 or maybe better Medicare pricing? Can you just tease out in addition to the Medicaid improvement where else you see pricing improvement on acute?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I would make one point before that, Christine. And that is, when we talk about acute care, we talk about revenue growth in general. We're always talking about an inclusive of bad debt expense. So earlier in the call, when I talked about our revenue in acute care growing at 5.5% in the first half of the year and 2.5% in the back half of the year, that was inclusive of bad debt. So I think if you include the bad debt in either Q3 or Q4, you're looking at a number that is much closer to 2.5%.", "But to your point that still is a little lower than our guidance for 2012 presumes. And I think that the increase in our guidance, I did try and tease this out before perhaps I wasn't transparent enough, comes from a couple of things. I mean one is the improvement in some of these facilities that we've invested quite a bit of money in Texoma, Palmdale and Summerlin and that continue to ramp up. That's number one.", "And number two is, we do assume while there is no recovery in volumes or uptick in volumes in our guidance. We do assume there is some stabilization or payer mix. And certainly in Q3 and Q4 we saw a payer mix deteriorate, a little bit, not a great deal, but a little bit. And again, the presumption is that in order to reduce that revenue growth number up in acute care, we would have to see that payer mix stabilize in 2012.", "Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co.", "And Medicare, what are you assuming for Medicare, October 2012?", "Steve Filton", "Again, I think it's that same 2% to 3% that we talked about. And behavioral, obviously, the two different numbers, but they coincidently wind up being in the same magnitude.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Well, we thank everybody. And we look forward to speaking to everyone again after our first quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Christine, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Filton, CFO.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you and good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services\u2019 results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections, and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.", "We\u2019d like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of a $1.31 for the quarter, after adjusting for the prior year impact of several reimbursement items recorded during the quarter, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 was a $1.13.", "On a same facility basis, revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 5.3% during the first quarter of 2012. We note that the PSI facilities are included in our same-store data for the entire quarter.", "Adjusted admissions and patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 9.2% and 2.8%, respectively during the first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.4% during the first quarter of 2012 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 26.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 as compared to 26.5% during the comparable prior year.", "On a same facility basis in our acute care division revenues increased 0.8% during the first quarter of 2012. The increase resulted primarily from a 1.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year.", "The relatively muted revenue growth reflects a difficult comparisons to the prior year quarter when our net revenues were favorably impacted by positive changes in payor mix especially stabilization in uninsured volumes.", "On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 18.6% during the first quarter of 2012 from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2011. We also note that there are no EHR-related revenues included in our quarterly financial statements.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $315 million and $223 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.", "As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debt, charity, care expense and the uninsured discount in this year\u2019s first quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the first quarter 2011.", "However, due primarily to the increase in behavioral health revenues and the very low levels of bad debt and uninsured discounts in that business, our overall percentage of bad debt, charity care and uninsured discounts were lower than those experienced during the first quarter of 2011.", "Our cash from operating activities was approximately $134 million during the first quarter of 2012, as compared to $183 million in the first quarter of 2011.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 56 days during the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to a lack of Medicaid payments from the State of Illinois and the lack of disproportionate share payments from Texas, as well as the Rural Floor settlement recorded as receivable during the quarter.", "At March 31, 2012 our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 59.6%. We spent $93 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter, included in our capital expenditures were the construction cost related to the ongoing construction of a new acute care hospital in Temecula, California and a new bed tower at our Wellington facility in Florida. Active in the first quarter of 2012, we have completed all of the divestitures required by the FTC as part of the PSI acquisition.", "Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein of Barclays.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays", "Hi. Good morning. This is Bryan Sekino on behalf of Adam this morning. Just wanted to know if you could provide us with some details in Vegas on some of the mix shift that you saw in acute care versus the strong Q1 of \u201811, if you could provide us with some details on how the mix shift, if that was really the bullish of the mix shift in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Bryan. I mean, I think that, in talking about the comparison, the sort of anomaly was in the first quarter of last year. For those of you who recall, we talked a great deal in Q1 of \u201811 about the fact that rather dramatically unemployment rates had declined in the Vegas market from like 15% at the end of \u201810 to 12% in the first quarter of \u201811, we saw a benefit from that in our business almost immediately. We saw a reduction in uninsured volumes in the first quarter of \u201811 that was -- had an extremely favorable effect on our results and our revenues per admission, et cetera.", "As the 2011 progressed, the payor mix sort of regressed back to kind of a normal mean if you will both in the Vegas market I think in the portfolio in general and most of those trends continued into the first quarter of \u201811 and those, excuse me, into the first quarter of \u201812, and those trends are again the same as we have about the last few quarters.", "Commercial volumes are down, Medicare volumes are down, really the only volumes that are up are Medicaid, which is actually managed Medicaid and to some degree our uninsured volumes, that\u2019s particularly true in some of our more economically troubled markets like Vegas and South Taxes, but it is generally true to the portfolio and that\u2019s what made the comparison so difficult from an acute care perspective in Q1.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. And then, just a question on the behavioral side, it looks like your adjusted admissions were up very strong and adjusted patient days were up, but there was a gap in the growth? Is there a shift in more acute versus RTC, or is there also some length of stay pressures from the Medicaid payors as well?", "Alan Miller", "Brian, it\u2019s again -- it\u2019s a continuing trend where we\u2019re seeing compression in our length of stay, not anything new, but also not something that seems to be decelerating yet at this point.", "It is primarily focused in the residential business -- length of stay is down on both sides of our behavioral business, but primarily on the residential side. And it is mostly I think a function of Medicaid and managed Medicaid payors intentionally obviously trying to get their patients out of the residential facilities sooner than previously.", "Bryan Sekino \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Good morning. Thanks for the details Steve. I guess just on volumes, over and above mix on absolute utilization, did you see anything that was new or different as you sort of look inside the details of the numbers that indicate that anything is better or worst and maybe where they\u2019re trying to bid in in recent quarters or somewhat stabilization?", "Steve Filton", "No, the growth in the volumes, that 1.6% growth in adjusted admissions -- same-store admissions. We thought -- seemed to be much as expected and were reasonable number. I think, Tom, we are more focused on the fact that when the economy begins to improve in number of our markets but in particularly some of our larger markets, that we are well-positioned to benefit from that and we are waiting patiently for that to happen.", "Obviously, this has been an extended recession and it\u2019s been particularly extended again in some of our most important markets. So, that\u2019s really where we are keeping our eye on most importantly.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Okay. So not seeing things worst but doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re still waiting for things to get a little bit better. On the cash flow you mentioned some of the state collections, I guess in particular, was there anything else that you can talk about on collections or rates are still pretty consistent relative to outside, I guess of the states that you mentioned?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I think from a rate perspective there is nothing significant going on either from our government payors or our private payors. I mean the biggest collection issue which we discussed last quarter as well is almost a complete lack of payments from Illinois Medicaid. Although, payments did resume again this past week, so we view that as an encouraging sign.", "And we believe the Texas Medicaid disproportionate share payments, which were not made in Q1, we\u2019re actually expecting at least a portion of those payments to be made either today or Monday. So, we\u2019re hoping to get a little bit of easing of that pressure.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Okay. And is that Illinois resumed, did they took a catch up or how fast do you expect to make up with what you haven\u2019t been paid in the past?", "Steve Filton", "I wish I could precisely answer that question, Tom, the state is not terribly helpful in letting folks know what their plan is, although they certainly have taken the position consistently that they intent to pay all the outstanding receivables.", "So that\u2019s our expectation and obviously, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve reflected in our financials. But there is no plan that the state has issued as to when the timing of payments will take place.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Okay. Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich of Deutsche Bank.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple of things here, I guess, first, I wanted to start with capital deployment. It does look like you had a little back in the quarter on share repurchase and I guess I\u2019d be curious just to know, if you\u2019re preserving capital for any particular reason at the moment be it, to the extent that ties into what you\u2019re seeing in the acquisition pipeline. How we should be thinking about that and how maybe that\u2019s changed over the last six months or so, as you think about deploying capital?", "Steve Filton", "Darren, I don\u2019t think there is anything terribly new this quarter, as I think, we\u2019ve probably said pretty consistently over the course of the last few quarters. We are mostly focused on generating cash and repaying debt as effectively as we can.", "We are entertaining other opportunities both internal and external to deploy capital, if we discover or are able to take advantage of opportunities that we find really compelling, we\u2019re prepared to do so. But, again, I\u2019ll make the point that in our mind there are going to have to be pretty compelling.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. I guess, just with the Knapp deal, looking like its turn off the table for now. Is there anything else that that looks more imminent in the pipeline, just on the acute side. Would love to get a comment or two there about what kind of things you\u2019re evaluating?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. So as we discussed last quarter, the Knapp deal that we have previously announced has elapsed largely because the seller has been unable to meet all their obligations and our involvement, some litigation at the moment. So you\u2019re right that we put that off to the side, sort of, as is the practice, Darren. And I don\u2019t know think we\u2019re going to make any specific comments about opportunities on either side of the businesses.", "Again just suffice to say that we\u2019re continuing to look and we\u2019re continuing to pursue internal opportunities as well. I mentioned in my remarks that we\u2019re building new hospitals or new acute capacity in California and Florida. And we certainly continue to explore those opportunities as well.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Right. Okay. And then just -- as you look at the acute business, obviously the comp was was the big factor here. Is there any way to help us think about how things progressed over the course of the quarter? And can you just comment a little bit about how you use see that comp impacting Q2, I know it was still pretty strong throughout the first half last year but how should we be thinking about that?", "Steve Filton", "Well as far as the progression goes, Darren, I would say that both volumes in payor mix probably strengthened a little bit as the quarter went on although in fairness I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not exactly sure how or what to read into that. You are absolutely right. I mean, our expectations that we set couple of months ago when we gave guidance for 2012. Does that acute care revenue growth would be fairly modest in 2012 in the, kind of, 2.5% to 3% range?", "Part of that thinking was that we knew that in the first half of the year the comparisons would be difficult. So even though we didn\u2019t get into specifics and won\u2019t do that today either. I think the notion was we would be somewhat lower than 2.5% to 3% in the first half of the year and somewhat little bit higher in the back half of the year as the comparisons got easier, and that\u2019s still our view.", "I should make the point that I think the first quarter played out very consistent with our internal expectations, certainly from an overall basis. But from a pricing perspective, I think we\u2019re a little disappointed with the level of acute care pricing but don\u2019t view it at all was as outlined with our full-year guidance.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning. Just, Steve, going back to what you just said in terms of the pricing number, down 0.8 on the acute care side obviously impacted by the mix but I just wondering on the peer pricing side, maybe, you could remind us what rates you\u2019re getting from managed care if it\u2019s sort of in line with what you\u2019ve historically got and little but lower and maybe even on the Medicaid side, maybe tell us what the pure price, sort of decline was in the first quarter?", "Steve Filton", "I think from a rate perspective, Ralph, we continue to get commercial rate increases in the 5% to 10% range that we\u2019ve talked about for some time. Our Medicaid declines as we been saying since July of last year or insert of three or 4% range. And I think what\u2019s driving -- I tried to outline before, what\u2019s driving the pressure on acute care pricing is not rates from a particular payor, but the mix of business and that mix continues to shift from our better paying commercial and Medicare patients to our weaker paying Medicaid and frankly non-paying patients.", "That trend has been in place for a while now and that\u2019s -- the fact that that trend was interrupted in the first quarter of \u201811 last year, and we\u2019re seeing sort of just -- it resumed in the back half of \u201811 and into \u201812. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving that very difficult comparisons in Q1.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. That\u2019s fair. Maybe you can give us in terms of your managed care contracts, do you have what percentages done for \u201812 versus \u201813?", "Steve Filton", "I would say, at this point, we have probably got somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters of our 2012 contracts done and maybe quarter to a third of our \u201813 contracts.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just going back to the behavioral side, your conversation earlier around the decline in length of stay. Is this then we should think about that\u2019s going to comp out shortly or is there just a lot more days to come out as more -- as we get more of shift to manage Medicaid?", "Steve Filton", "I\u2019m not sure Ralph that we can answer that question with great confidence. There is pressure on length of stay has been existing now for some time. I think it is largely a function of state Medicaid programs or they\u2019re contractor managed Medicaid providers, who are attempting to address budgetary concerns and drive costs down by reducing length of stay.", "As we expect with Medicaid rates, we think that pressure will ease a little bit in this next budgetary cycle beginning this summer, but I suspect that we may not see length of stay compression completely stabilized at that point. It may still continue to trend downwards.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. Hi, everybody. A couple of questions, if I could ask. On the acute side, the year-to-year margin trend down 190 basis points. I assume that you would say that\u2019s mostly due to the top line pressure, but I did want to at least ask is there anything on labor or supply that\u2019s worth calling out that you saw in the quarter that would -- was particularly noteworthy, absent just the natural effect of the pressure on the top line?", "Steve Filton", "No. A.J., I think that we would attribute the margin decline almost exclusively to the top line pressure.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Okay. You didn\u2019t recognize any high-tech revenue in the -- or incentive payments in the quarter. You did collect -- it looks like $17 million in cash. Do you have any updated estimate or what is your thought on how much you would likely collect in cash this year and any thought on time -- updated thought on timing of recognition?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I think, I would just kind of reiterate what we talked about from the free cash flow perspective last year -- excuse me -- at our 2012 guidance. And that is, we expect to generate free cash flow in the $400 million to $500 million range. Again, much like our operating income guidance, I don\u2019t think we have any changes to that.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then just finally on the Medicare proposed rule, any comment or thought or reaction of that relative to what you were thinking?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I don\u2019t know what others have said, but I think we probably reacted by thinking that the update was maybe 100 to 150 basis points lower than we expected mostly because of the higher than expected coding adjustments in our higher threshold on the outliers. I\u2019m not smart enough to predict how the final rule will look. Obviously, the industry will lobby hard for some relief on both those issues.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Right. Sure. Okay. All right. Thanks for your update.", "Alan Miller", "Hey A.J. A.J., you guys did very well in a drift. We got a first rounder in Jim Fords.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. Thanks Alan.", "Alan Miller", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman of Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Behavioral continues to be very strong. Is it possible for you to parse out how much of that is organic, how much of that is continuing to benefit from the synergies on the Psych Solutions assets?", "Steve Filton", "I don\u2019t know that I can do it precisely, Gary. I will tell you that we continue to improve the margin on the PSI assets or the PSI portfolio. And I think our view is that there is still a benefit to be -- continuing benefit that we had.", "So we\u2019re generally positive about April performance for two reasons. I mean, one is we view their revenue growth in that business as very solid and strong. We\u2019ve been growing at above 5% for 2.5 years now in the teeth, obviously, of a very severe recession. And so we feel real good about the underlying demand in that business. And then we still feel as I said, there are opportunities that we\u2019ve talked about in many occasion before to continue to drive slightly higher margins in the PSI portfolio.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "So, the total is compared to when you first purchased the assets, the total expectation is higher lower the same in terms of the total synergies that you\u2019ll be able to get out of it?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, in terms of the margin improvement, which we pegged all along that\u2019s sort of 50 to 100 basis points. Cumulatively, I\u2019d say we feel fairly confident. We\u2019ll come in at the high end of that number.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. Right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor of Citigroup.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Hey, good morning. Just had two questions. Steve, is this the first quarter that PSI is fully in the same-store or was that last quarter?", "Steve Filton", "No. It\u2019s the first quarter where we have a full quarter comparison.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. So that\u2019s what I thought. So you had been running on, kind of, the legacy UHS, north of 6% revenue growth for some time and this numbers is five to three. Did I miss any comment in terms of have you parsed out at all PSI versus legacy UHS or is the length of stay issue kind of impacting both of the assets?", "Alan Miller", "I think that the length of stay issue is affecting the residential assets primarily, again, in both portfolios. I will say and I know that you\u2019re getting to this question -- getting to this point with your question, but having the PSI facilities in for a full quarter of comparison, we get a little bit of a drag from their Pines facilities in Virginia. Those were facilities that were somewhat of a problem for PSI.", "They were I think troubled facilities at the time the PSI owned them and quite frankly remained so for us. So, including that, we closed down one of the three campuses that we operate there. That clearly drove revenue down in the quarter in effort to, sort of, right that ship and get the quality issues in mind for future growth, which I think we feel well poised to do. But it was a bit of a drag in the quarter and the mechanics of having PSI in the same-store comparison contributed to that.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. That is what I presume you are not going to want to break those out separately anymore, but I was just wondering if the slightly slower revenue growth was impact of PSI coming into the quarter? And it sounds like it was. Would you agree -- I mean does leap year have a positive benefit for the behavioral book?", "Alan Miller", "", "I have always been a believer that leap year doesn\u2019t have much of an effect either way. It affects the cosmetic metrics a little bit. You\u2019ve got an extra obviously day of both admissions and patient days, but you also have an extra day of salary expense. And so I don\u2019t think it makes a whole lot of difference.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. And my last question maybe more for Alan, I\u2019d be interested. I was reading the other day about this 1.5 billion Union Village development in Las Vegas, that\u2019s supposed to have four hospitals. And just wondering if you guys had a view if that\u2019s, kind of, still a pipe dream at this stage or if at any point geographically that would possibly create any threat to you, if they eventually get these hospitals built. Any thoughts around that?", "Steve Filton", "I\u2019ll take that one Gary. So that big development which is in Southeast part of Las Vegas or in Henderson, has been on the boards for many, many years. It sounds like its a little bit closer to reality perhaps than it has been from a hospital perspective. I think the developers went to Catholic Healthcare West because they clearly have historically dominated that quadrant of the market.", "What we have heard and I don\u2019t mean it any way to be definitive is that whether or not Catholic Healthcare West will build or what they will build as part of that development is very much still uncertain at this point. So I think from our perspective that is not a quadrant of the city that we have ever competed terribly robustly in and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changing anytime soon.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fishbeck of Bank of America.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Thank you. It wasn\u2019t clear to me whether you answered this in response to AJ\u2019s question, but as far as the EPS guidance that you\u2019re giving, are you reaffirming that kind of ex the Medicare boost?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. Our practice, I think always is, if we don\u2019t say anything, we\u2019re not changing anything. But yeah, we would reconfirm our year-end guidance.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Okay. And then the Medicare boost would be on top of that one-time items you discussed this quarter would be on top of that?", "Steve Filton", "", "Right. I mean as -- we\u2019re excluding that from our guidance just like we excluded them during the quarter.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Okay. All right. Perfect. And I guess, maybe the answer was the response to Gary\u2019s question, but I would have thought that the same store behavioral revenue growth would have been a little bit stronger even if we -- is it really just that one facility or is there anything else? I guess, how much was closing down that one campus to your same-store metrics?", "Steve Filton", "", "I don\u2019t know the precise impact but that was probably the biggest impact, Kevin. We closed the facility in Missouri, a residential facility in a process to convert it to acute care beds that had again slightly negative impact in the quarter. Although, obviously we think in ongoing more positive impact, we continue to work on some regulatory issues in the Illinois, but I think long-term should have a positive impact. But I don\u2019t know that any of those had real needle moving impacts.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. And then, as far as Vegas goes, we\u2019re kind of seeing some modest economic improvement in Vegas. I mean, how in your experience, how long is there between a change in the underlying economic metrics in the market before that starts to really flow through to the numbers. Because it sounds like it\u2019s not showing up yet but when would you start to expect that to show up?", "Steve Filton", "I think that historically, Kevin, our view is there\u2019s usually something like a two to four quarter lag before our business or the hospital business starts to really get the impact of underlying economic metrics, particularly changes in unemployment. It\u2019s why we were so surprised the year ago that we seem to get on almost, kind of, real-time immediate benefit from a decline in unemployment in that market. And why we frankly at the time didn\u2019t think that was necessarily going to be sustainable.", "But, sort of, to your point, I mean I think that some of the news coming out of the Vegas market over the last few months has been encouraging. We\u2019re certainly encouraged by it. And we would hope that by the end of this year, we\u2019d start to see some of that benefit in our business.", "Kevin Fishbeck \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Corsair of UBS.", "Todd Corsair \u2013 UBS", "Hey. Thanks. Just wondered, if you guys could comment on your outlook for allocating free cash flows, as someone earlier pointed out -- only a couple million spent on share repurchase during the quarter. And I think per your 10-K, you are expecting a pretty significant amount of free cash flow. So really just interested in, sort of, viewing where you stand in terms of balance sheet at this point?", "Do you want to -- are you guys prioritizing, moving back toward investment grade or might we expect a more balanced allocation of free cash flow, perhaps is a little more towards the equity in terms of stock repurchase going forward?", "Steve Filton", "", "Todd, I think that Darren asked a similar question before and I just very quickly reiterate that -- absent compelling opportunities on the M&A front, we\u2019re largely dedicated our free cash flow to debt repayment. But are exploring these opportunities and if compelling ones arise, we will be prepared to take advantage of them.", "Todd Corsair \u2013 UBS", "But outside of M&A stock repurchase is a far lower priority than debt reduction?", "Steve Filton", "", "I think all the priorities, sort of, our -- have to considered kind of -- at the same time and so I think if there is a lack of compelling M&A opportunities we might have a different point of view about free cash flow. I mean -- excuse me -- about share repurchase, but I don\u2019t think we can kind of answer the opportunity in a vacuum. I think we are exploring all those alternatives at the same time.", "Todd Corsair \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks and lastly, could you just refresh us on what remaining capacity you have under existing authorization?", "Alan Miller", "I think our existing authorization is fairly thin, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a determinative factor. If we think it\u2019s appropriate to move forward, we certainly I think can expand that authorization with -- without a great deal of difficulty.", "Todd Corsair \u2013 UBS", "No obstacle there. Okay. Thanks very much for your time.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo of Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hey. Thanks. Just a couple of final questions. Steve, is it still your expectation that the Medicare rule for behavioral will be a notice and will probably avoid the formal rule making session? And does that really mean anything to you one way or the other?", "Steve Filton", "", "Well, Whit. I think that the question has been put to us quite differently over the course of last few months and that is we expecting major changes to the site PPS regulations and we said, no. We expected that the action of CMS would likely either just be the regular market basket update or some minor tweaks to the system. That remains our expectation.", "It strikes me, more about this than I do, but it strikes me that the investors and the investing public are coming around to that point of view. We\u2019ve had that point of view for some months now.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird", "I agree. And maybe one other question, several of your peers are feeling the pinch on salaries and other expenses from employment costs income guarantees, whatever physician strategy they have and it\u2019s really never been central to, sort of, what you guys view is core to your strategy. Just wanted to confirm that nothing has really changed one way or the other as you think about sort of realigning interests with physicians?", "Steve Filton", "", "Well, I think just to be clear, we certainly believe as I think most of our peers do, that physician integration is a critical piece of our strategy moving forward. I think as you described it and I think fairly described it, we may not be as enthusiastic about the idea that the only way to address the physician integration issue is through employment and acquisition. We\u2019re pursuing, kind of, a whole array of alternatives including clinical integration, et cetera and we\u2019ll continue to do so.", "In large part, because we recognize I think as you -- your comments that the purchase of physician practices and the employment of physicians often results in negative consequences like increased costs, et cetera, that if we can, we prefer to avoid. But we very much view physician integration as a market-by-market issue.", "And as I said, we don\u2019t have a kind of one solution fits all approach to it. But we are very conscious of the fact that providers over the years have had very negative experiences in many cases with the economics of physician employment and acquisition and so we\u2019re very cautious about it.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird", "Yeah. And maybe shifting gears just to high tech and maybe a longer term question. But do you have any internal thoughts as you look out to stage 2 and the requirements, and I know it\u2019s a little over the horizon, but I guess I\u2019m sort of curious what\u2019s on the top of mind with your IT department right now?", "Steve Filton", "", "I\u2019m not exactly sure, what you\u2019re asking, Whit. If you\u2019re asking do we think we can comply with the stage II requirements? I think the answer is yeah. Our EHR implementation, which is still in relatively early stages but we\u2019ve got probably a quarter of our hospitals implemented at this point.", "We\u2019re feeling pretty good about the way it\u2019s going. We\u2019re not yet there in terms of meeting the meaningful use requirements. But we expect to be there and are feeling generally positive about the process.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird", "I guess, I was just, sort of, asking whether or not you felt that there were going to have to be more additional internal resources committed to get the stage 2 and 3 and maybe a corollary to that being the cost associated with it. I guess do you have a great idea for sort of what it looks into stage II and III at this point?", "Steve Filton", "", "Okay. I know, okay. I better I understand the question, better. I think that our -- at this point, our overall estimates of what the EHR will -- EHR implementation will cost us have not changed. But in fairness, I think your question points to a good point or makes a good point. It\u2019s a changing process. Every time we do an implementation we sort of rethink our approach et cetera.", "So, it\u2019s certainly not impossible that some point down the road we come back and revise our estimates of cost or whatever. But at the moment, I think we\u2019re comfortable with what we put out there.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird", "Got it. And one last one, sorry to slip this in, may have missed it. But did you give any colors on surgical growth and maybe sort of what you\u2019re seeing with the birthrate and maybe acuity in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "", "Yeah. Acuity has not really changed for us. We\u2019ve not had any significant changes in acuity. I think birthrate remains as it has been for the last few years, down a little bit. From a surgical perspective, I think our overall surgeries were probably down 1% or 2% for the quarter with inpatient surgeries being down a little bit more and outpatient surgeries being a little bit better than that.", "Whit Mayo \u2013 Robert Baird", "Great. Very helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Adam Feinstein of Barclays.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you. I know we asked one previously. So I will be brief here. But just wanted to -- just maybe ask you guys, have done a great job of investing CapEx over the years in some of these bigger projects. So, I just thought maybe it would be helpful to just give a quick update on some of the bigger projects in recent years, maybe just talk about how those have ramped up?", "And as you think about doing future projects just wanted to get a quick update on some of the larger ones in recent years like Texoma and Palmdale and Wellington coming up?", "Steve Filton", "", "Sure. So the three big acute care projects that we\u2019ve completed in the last few years, Adam, are a new hospital a replacement facility in the acquired Texoma market, which is north of Dallas, a replacement facility for our Lancaster Hospital in Palmdale, California, and then a significant new tower for Summerlin in Las Vegas.", "Obviously, although, this wasn\u2019t contemplated when we undertook those three projects, but they were all begun around the same time. They were all begun right in -- well frankly before the recession and opened in the middle of the recession. And so I think we\u2019ve said a number of times that all three of those projects have been somewhat slower to ramp up than our original expectations.", "On the other hand, I don\u2019t think that our fundamental view of any of those projects has fundamentally changed from when we undertook them. We think that they will all be ultimately (inaudible) and helpful to our earnings.", "Texoma is probably the one that\u2019s had the most success so far. It\u2019s a market that probably has had the least sort of economic drag. Southern California and Las Vegas have had more of an economic drag. So the Summerlin and Palmdale projects have been a little bit slower.", "In terms of the new projects that we have going, the new hospital in Temecula, California, is part of our Riverside County network, where we\u2019ve got three existing hospitals. There is data out there that shows that Temecula is sort of the largest metropolitan area without a hospital in the U.S. So we think that there is a tremendous unmet demand there that we are hoping to serve.", "And then, our Wellington Hospital on the East Coast of Florida has been a hospital that has been extremely successful for us, particularly over the last five or seven years. And we\u2019re just trying to take advantage of the fact that, we have had some capacity constraints there and so we will have that tower open by the end of this year.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. All right. Thank you very much, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan of RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. I hopped on late, so I apologize if you\u2019ve already answered this. But did you talk about Steve the uninsured admit rates is that either the growth in it or the mix as a percentage of total admits that were uninsured?", "Steve Filton", "", "Frank, I think what we have said is that basically the trend we\u2019re seeing in our acute care business is lower commercial than Medicare admits and higher managed Medicaid and self-pay admits. And that\u2019s a trend that frankly is probably even present now for a good three, maybe four quarters.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Steve Filton", "", "Okay. Well, we thank everybody. We know everybody has a busy morning. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steven Filton, Chief Financial Officer.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you and good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services\u2019 results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2012.", "During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections, and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.10 for the quarter, after adjusting for the prior year impact of several reimbursement items recorded during the quarter, and the revenues and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, was $1.12.", "On the same facility basis, revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 4.1% during the second quarter of 2012 over the comparable prior year quarter. Adjusted admissions inpatient days who are behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 3.3% and 0.2% respectively during the second quarter.", "Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.5% during the second quarter of 2012 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 28.6% during the quarter ended June 30, 2012, as compared to 26.9% during the comparable prior year period.", "On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues decreased 2.2% during the second quarter 2012. The decrease resulted primarily from a 1.3% decrease in adjusted admissions and a 0.9% decrease in revenue per adjusted admissions who are hospital\u2019s own for more than a year.", "The revenue decline reflects a difficult comparison to the prior year quarter when our net revenues were favorably impacted by positive changes in payer mix, especially stabilization in uninsured volumes.", "On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 16.3% during the second quarter of 2012 from 17.8% during the second quarter of 2011. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $266 million and $239 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 respectively.", "As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debts, charity care expense and the uninsured discount in this year\u2019s first quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the second quarter of 2011. However, due primarily to the increase in behavioral health revenues and the very low levels of bad debt and uninsured discounts in that business, our overall percentage of bad debt, charity care and uninsured discounts were lower than those experienced during the second quarter of 2011.", "Our cash from operating activities was approximately $246 million during the second quarter of 2012, as compared to $173 million in the second quarter of 2011.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 54 days during the second quarter of 2012, from 56 days during the first quarter of this year as we collected a portion of outstanding Medicaid receivables from the State of Illinois.", "At June 30, 2012 our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 57.7% and debt to EBITDA was 2.99. We spent $90 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter, included in our capital expenditures during the first half of 2012 were the construction cost related to the construction of a new acute care hospital in Temecula, California, a new bed tower at our Wellington facility in Florida and 222 beds added to facilities within our behavioral health division.", "Against the backdrop of a sluggish economic recovery and based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2012, our revised estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year-ended December 31, 2012 is $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which represents a 2% to 3% decrease from our original 2012 guidance excludes the estimated favorable impact associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals and the impact of the other items reflected on the supplemental schedule for the six months ended June 30, 2012 as disclosed in last night\u2019s press release, as well as any incremental impact resulting from our previously announced acquisition of Ascend Health Corporation, which we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of this year.", "Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Thanks, good morning. Two quick questions I guess. Steve, first on the acute care side, given the trends you are seeing in the changing guidance, just wondering what you did to your guidance as we think about the second half of the year versus first half trends?", "Steve Filton", "Tom, in our original guidance, if people recall, was that acute care revenues would grow in 2012 by somewhere in the neighborhood of 3% and I think \u2013 we believe because of the comparison through \u201911 that was backend loaded. So we grow by let's say 2% in the first half of the year and by 4% in the back half of the year. I think the revised guidance is frankly almost exclusively a reflection of the fact that we think that 4% growth that was embedded in the back half of the year and the original guidance is now probably 1.5% or 2% and is reflective just of the existing operating trends that we are seeing.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Okay. And then on the behavioral health side, obviously a very good trend there for 18 months or so that were above average is I guess the way we looked at them, which sort of came back down to earth a little bit this quarter. Can you point to anything in particular what they have changed and I guess what is your long-term growth outlook for that business at this stage?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, I think Tom that we have said a number of times that we think that going forward a reasonable growth rate, revenue growth rate in the behavioral division is probably in the 5%, 5.5% range and we have been pretty consistently meeting those targets. We were a little lower than that in Q2. As we looked at the detail of it I think we identified a number of facilities where because of ongoing either new construction projects or ongoing construction projects to convert residential to acute beds, we had to close down some capacity and we think that cost us maybe 50 or 60 or 70 basis points revenue growth in the second quarter. So I think when adjusted for that I think we feel like again that sort of 5%, 5.5% growth rate is reasonable, and the other piece is that beginning in July of 2012, the severe Medicaid reductions that we saw at this time last year of 3% to 4% moderate to something like flat to down 1% and so that\u2019s a helpful comparison as well.", "Tom Gallucci \u2013 Lazard Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Hi, everybody, just maybe I\u2019ll ask two questions as well. Following up on the behavioral business, can you point to is the moderation, I mean albeit you have great margins, is it basically a capital constraint issue in the second quarter that somehow gets a little better in the back half of the year, how much of it was that or how much of it is just natural ebb and flow from Q1 to Q2?", "Steve Filton", "A.J., just following on what I was saying to Tom. I think that 50, 60, 70 basis points that I alluded to is exactly what you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s \u2013 we had beds that we had to have out of service for these construction projects. I think our sense is two-fold. Once we are able to get those beds back in service and once the new beds that we\u2019re building or the converted beds that we\u2019re building go back online, we\u2019re very comfortable that the demand is actually there to support the sort of 5%, 5.5% growth rate.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Back on the acute side, I guess, I\u2019m seeing here, again cost control wise you guys have done a good job. I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve seen someone post a negative same-store revenue growth in acute business, but obviously you had a very tough comp a year ago. One of the things we\u2019re seeing from some of the other guys is as they report soft in-patient volumes, it seems like they are getting a little help from revenue per adjusted admission being somewhat stronger and the argument that at least it\u2019s being made is that the soft volumes tend to be in cases that have lower revenues associated with them and therefore it\u2019s not impacting the overall revenue growth or 3%, 4%, 5% revenue on a same-store basis.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like that dynamic is a play here in your case, I just wondered if you had any thoughts about it in terms of where you\u2019re seeing the softness in the volume and the revenue per adjusted admission being a little sort of flattish or only slightly up.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, so I think if you look at the difference between our admissions or unadjusted admissions and our adjusted admissions, there is a measurable difference which obviously implies that our out-patient revenues are growing faster than our in-patient. So we are certainly experiencing some of that same shift that you\u2019re alluding to A.J., that I think the other companies are referencing. What it does also highlight however is that the unadjusted admissions that is really the straight in-patient admissions are rather weak and remain rather weak and we think that\u2019s largely a function of these sort of very difficult economic conditions in certain of our markets, most notable Vegas and South Texas. But I think that\u2019s the major explanation. I think other than that we feel like \u2013 as we look at what the other companies are reporting in general and directionally we\u2019re experiencing much of the same trends.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "I guess the point I was making is, the point upper respiratory, OB/GYN cases which sometimes can be lower revenue cases and then obviously your surgery and so forth suggest \u2013 maybe they not losing as many of the in-patient hiring cases. Is that \u2013 when you look at where the softness is on the in-patient volume, is that observed across the board or does it tend to be in those types of cases?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think that\u2019s a valid observation and I think the way we would or I would sort of prove that if you will is by saying that our acuity has changed very little, and that our acuity has remained consistently high which sort of suggests that we continue to get the most tertiary and the most severe and acute cases and that the business that we\u2019re losing tends to be the less intense business that is shifting to either to out-patient or just shifting to a non-admitted status.", "A.J. Rice \u2013 UBS", "", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning. Steve, do you have the payer mix in the quarter, if possible the percentages by payer maybe this quarter versus a year ago?", "Steve Filton", "Ralph, I don\u2019t have the specific metrics in front of me, but I will tell you that the trend that we saw in the quarter was very similar to what we have been seeing which is taking whatever metric you like, if you take the 1.3% decline in adjusted admissions that commercial and Medicare admissions declined more than that and Medicaid and uninsured admissions increased more than that and that unfavorable shift is one that\u2019s been underway for some time and continues and quite frankly until we believe the economy is improving, our local markets, etcetera, it\u2019s going to be difficult to sort of reverse those trends.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then can you remind me of the drag on Medicaid from the cuts that started last July and then the headwind or I think tailwind that you see for fiscal \u201913?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, so in July of \u201911 we said that Medicaid rates on average were decreasing 3% to 4%. Our guidance for 2012 presume that in July of \u201912 Medicaid rates would be flat to down 1% and given all the states that we have been able to get results from etcetera, and have their rates in place, we believe we are in that range.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just the last one. I think there has been questions in the past on sort of the margin in EBITDA growth and behavioral and revenue trends have been higher. Revenue was obviously a little bit lower this quarter but you had better margins in growth. So I guess is that related CSI synergies incrementally coming on board or is it just more broad based maybe sustainability of that going forward?", "Steve Filton", "You know, I think the answer is sort of two-fold. One, again as you alluded to Ralph is, I certainly think that we continue to improve the PSI legacy margins if you will, and in short order we are going to stop using that term. But, I also believe and we have made the case that if we are able to grow revenues by 4% or 5% in what amounts to a fixed or largely fixed and semi-fixed cost business we should be able to continue to expand margins. Again, I think you saw that in Q2, it\u2019s not always absolutely linear. So there are some quarters in which revenue grew by a little bit more and margins didn\u2019t increase quite as much, and in Q2 of this year revenue was a little more moderated but cost controls were better. In general, I think if we can have that 5% revenue growth that I have mentioned a few times on the call, we should continue to generate expanded margins in the behavioral business.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Alan I would be interested to get your perspective on Washington heading into the elections and with the fiscal [inaudible] coming up, the potential that congress addresses sequestration either in a lame duck or in a new congress?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah. Thought you were going to ask about anything that is new. Nothing happens before the election, and lame ducks are difficult. So we don\u2019t really have any indication except that \u2013 Vice President Cheney came out a sort of seclusion and went up on The Hill and talked about the defense. So I think they are going to have to try and address something but we don\u2019t have any indication as to where and how we accept that. The other thing I will say is that we all are in good shape with the administration. The hospitals are and I think we have got them on the defensive a little bit because of the state\u2019s reaction to Medicaid. So I think that \u2013 I know for a fact that the administration is going to try and be helpful to hospitals.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Okay. Since you brought it up, is there anything new?", "Alan Miller", "In what regard?", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Just in general.", "Alan Miller", "You mean legislatively?", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Yeah, anything that you are aware of or anything that\u2019s come across your radar screens that you find particularly interesting?", "Alan Miller", "No nothing \u2013 no, I think that, you know, it is the law.  But a lot of people don\u2019t like it and a lot is happening at the state level as you are well aware with regard to the Medicaid, and it\u2019s going to be a very brutal challenging situation legislatively in Washington regardless of who wins. I think it\u2019s unlikely that Republicans can have a sweep of all three, house, senate, Whitehouse. But it\u2019s going to be a really very interesting year next year. But as I said, I think we are in as good as shape as we can be because of I think very smart moves on the part of some of our representatives. I don\u2019t mean legislatively. Representatives in different organizations. I think the administration is very strongly on our side for whatever good that is.", "Gary Lieberman \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thank for your thoughts.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank", "", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A few things here. Just as it relates to the M&A activity, Steve we saw that the deal termination and the cash flow statement. I just want to confirm you have exited that South Texas situation. Is that what that was?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. As we have disclosed at the end of last year we had a tentative agreement to buy that medical center in the South Texas market. Subsequent to reaching a definitive agreement the seller discovered some limitations they had in being able to sell the facility, and as a result of that they were unable to resolve those and the agreement was terminated.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Right. And then you said just a refund of your money. And then Auburn, we\u2019re still on track for the September clause there, and then I just wanted to also ask about Ascend timing, is there anything different that we should be thinking about there?", "Steve Filton", "No. As you suggest we \u2013 our intent is to close Auburn in the third quarter, late in the third quarter, and our intent, which is a little less precise and specific as it involves FTC approvals is that we will close or be able to close Ascend sometime during the fourth quarter. ", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And if I could just Alan, we\u2019d love to just get your thoughts on the acquisition outlook for the company. Obviously Ascend is in a really unique situation for you in Behavioral. How are you thinking now about acute and the outlook in that pipeline, the opportunity for more behavioral like Ascend, just would love to get your updated thoughts there.", "Alan Miller", "I think Ascend is very unusual in that the quality of it, nine facilities, every one of them is really good. There is new beds coming on, they\u2019ve been very well managed, but there is a lot of growth in it. So we think Ascend was unusually good quality wise. We\u2019re very happy with it, very happy with it. And we think we can see a lot of growth coming from it. I don't think there are networks that we know of that are similar to Ascend, so I think Ascend was \u2013 we think Ascend was just a great acquisition.", "With regard to other acquisitions, we're seeing a lot. And I think in this environment it\u2019s a question of what you want to direct yourself towards, but there are a lot of opportunities. And we are going to close Ascend and move onto look at other opportunities, both acute and behavioral. But I just want to stress, I think the Ascend deal was really an excellent deal for us, unusually excellent.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for that. And then just the last thing here, we\u2019ve heard your commentary a lot about just the comps and obviously going in to this year that was going to be a challenge particularly in Vegas, given the success for staff in Summerland [ph]. I guess, the thing I\u2019d like to just ask is, is there anything new or different beyond the macro, you are seeing in Vegas competitively the way physicians are being organized, anything that we ought to also consider?", "Steve Filton", "I don't think so Darren I mean I would make the comment that obviously, when a market is contracting the way that Vegas or South Texas has been that, it\u2019s natural to sort of see competition ramp up. People are competing for a smaller base of patients and it becomes sort of more intense and more severe and yeah, I think we\u2019ve that in both markets. But I think our market position remains largely the same. There are small shifts in market share et cetera, but I think that the overarching issue again in both of those markets has been market softness that quite frankly we have been struggling for a long time now.", "Darren Lehrich \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners. ", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick ones on guidance. Can you give us an estimate of the impact that moving Auburn Regional Medical Center out of continuing ops had on the earnings guidance?", "Steve Filton", "Just to be clear because of its relative immateriality we do not show or report Auburn as a discontinued op, we just sort of removed the detailed revenues and expenses and recorded the EBITDA loss of Auburn, which was a couple of million dollars in the quarter in the other operating expense line. Because we expect to dispose off Auburn in the third quarter, we\u2019ve included in our guidance a comparable amount for Q3 and then assume that it\u2019s no longer owned by us.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And as you look at your volumes particularly in the fourth quarter and the new readmission rule sort of coming into play, are you anticipating any sort of unusual difference+ in sort of volumes in fourth quarter this year versus prior years because of the new readmission rules or do you feel like you already have a pretty good hand on readmissions and therefore it\u2019s not going to be a material impact on your volumes in the fourth quarter?", "Steve Filton", "No. I think Kevin as you sort of suggest that the attention to the readmission rules has now been present for a while, the government regulations and rules about the incentive penalties in that regard have been well known now for a while. I don\u2019t sense that we are likely to see any significant or impactful change as we move forward.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Okay. And then last question on the non-controlling interest, how should we think about that sort of from a modeling perspective going forward? Is that on a pure dollars basis?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, as everybody I think knows, the most significant item on that non-controlling interest line is the minority interest in the Vegas market. And, as Darren I think and others have asked about, that\u2019s a market that\u2019s been soft, I think that part of our reason for revising guidance is an expectation that at least in the short run it remains so. To me, the current run rate in that market, and therefore the impact on that line is probably as good a guide to at least the next couple of quarters than anything else.", "Kevin Campbell \u2013 Avondale Partners", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line Gary Taylor with Citigroup.", "", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple of housekeeping things. Steve, on the HITECH payment that you receive and that you breakout in the supplemental tables, I think it\u2019s actually called revenue, but I just want to make sure that being netted in the other operating expense line, that\u2019s not in the revenue line, correct?", "Steve Filton", "No, it is on the revenue line, Gary.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. On the minority interest share attributable to some of those HITECH expenses, I assume that\u2019s down in the minority interest line as part of that line as well, right, not rollup in other op?", "Steve Filton", "That\u2019s correct. It is on the minority interest line.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay.  I guess my last question is, can you talk a little bit about the length of stay pressure in RTC and any expectations of when that abate or is there a significant state where some policy changes might, anniversary or, when we should expect \u2013 or if we can expect reasonably that some of the length of stay pressure is going to ease?", "Steve Filton", "Again, this is another dynamic that certainly has been present now for \u2013 I would say going on for a couple of years where we\u2019ve seen \u2013 really since I think the recession began we\u2019ve seen Medicaid programs through the country tighten up on both the rate of payment, which lots of companies discuss, but for us, in the behavioral division, also on utilization which really I think is most notably reflected in length of stay contraction. Actually I thought one of the encouraging, albeit mildly encouraging dynamics in Q2 was that, I thought that the length of stay reduction decelerated a little bit, but I think to your point Gary, and my sense is that just as we talked about rates, Medicaid rate reductions is decelerating in July of 2012, my sense is that length of stay contraction should respond the same way because it quite frankly is emblematic of the same sorts budgetary issues. But I think it remains to be seen. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve bottomed out yet, but I think the hope is that we\u2019ll at least start to see some deceleration or stabilization in that contraction.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Are there \u2013 I guess in RTC, are there some hard stops or policy changes or this is just more active utilization management I guess for lack of a better word in terms of number of days, a state of allowance.", "Steve Filton \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I think much less than hard stops is just kind of a series of initiatives that different states take on in different ways trying to move these kids out sooner, move them into less intensive settings like group homes and stuff like that. So, those are the kinds of things you see as opposed to kind of \u2013 as again you described a hard stop where they just say absolutely not after 25 days or whatever the issue is, but it\u2019s just a variety of initiatives. Interestingly, the admission growth level has not really changed, which sort of implies, and to some degree I think it\u2019s remained pretty strong, which sort of implies that clinically the effort to get these kids out sooner in the end is not really meeting the overall objectives in that. They may just be returning to facilities because they\u2019re not completing an effective course of treatment.", "Gary Taylor \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Hey, good morning. Just based on our estimate, it looks like your profit contribution that\u2019s really behavioral and acute if you factor in Ascend it\u2019s close to 70% behavioral and 30% acute, if we did some estimate allocation. As you look at your mix of M&A and you think about your portfolio, do you think that number is a good number? Is that going to hold or are we at the high watermark in terms of the relevance of behavioral mix in the business.", "Steve Filton", "John, I think we have said many time over the years that we\u2019ve never set sort of target percentages in the way that you framed your question. As you know, obviously that allocation used to be dramatically different with the key contribution being higher. I think our view always is we\u2019re looking for the next dollar of invested capital to go into whatever investment that is, whether it\u2019s an external M&A investment in acute or behavioral or internal CapEx investment in one of those segments or in buying back our own shares, we are always looking for it to go into place where we it\u2019s going to earn the greatest return and I think that remains our approach and our point of view.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Are you seeing any large acute care deals that you are even close to pulling the trigger on, I know you guys are very sticky and you should be commended for being so. And then conversely do you think it\u2019s possible you might explore anymore acute divestitures?", "Steve Filton", "I think as Alan suggested we are seeing a large number of deals available out in the marketplace and I think that\u2019s reflective of what our peers say as well. As you suggest John we're quite proud of the fact that we're very judicious in how we evaluate those deals and what we choose to pursue. Our general sense on the acute stuff especially is that those deals are going to be available, not those specific deals, but deals of that kind will be available now for the foreseeable future.", "I mean I think the landscape of healthcare is changing in the country and there\u2019s pipeline that is robust at the moment, I think will remain so. And so we'll continue to look at those kinds of deals. Just as we're looking at organic expansion, I alluded to a couple of new projects in my remarks that were underway, and new beds in behavioral. Again all those items are on the table as we think about our business going forward.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "I guess I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s plenty of second tier and rural deals, I guess I was curious if there were kind of whole market acquisitions and larger urban market type deals, or if it\u2019s still kind of more one-off a hospital in this market or that market or maybe a market that\u2019s not growing. But are you seeing the upper, likely opportunity to go into a large market and take 30% share or something. Are you seeing any of those kinds of deals?", "Steve Filton", "I mean it strikes me that there is starting to be an evolution as you suggest of the deals available, but I think for the last couple of years it's been heavily skewed towards the single standalone, more rural providers, and I think that we're starting to see a shift to bigger systems, multiple facility systems, et cetera. Again my sense is that it\u2019s going to continue that we\u2019re no nowhere near the top of the curve on that yet.", "Alan Miller", "John, you are particularly astute, and I can tell you \u2013 and I'm sure you have seen this or you \u2013 the industry is going through a real transition, these things take time it\u2019s going to be slow, but it's going to be a real transition, and I think the companies that are experienced and have been successful over a long period of time, and know how to evaluate opportunities and are not impatient, are going to do really well. ", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Well, I guess that's what I think. I would think that there\u2019s a pretty high probability we\u2019re going to wake up in the next two years and you guys are going to go into a market in a pretty big way. You\u2019ve husband your resources accordingly. I know you\u2019re not going to jump at something just because it\u2019s there. So, anyway, that will be interesting. My other question is I guess there was a little bit of chatter about the revenue multiple that you paid for $0.01 and I know they have very high margins and it\u2019s been a very well run company. But this seems a little bit like a stretch multiple for you guys in particular. So what are we missing, is it the growth is the ability to add capacity on the back end of this, is that what we might be missing here?", "Alan Miller", "I\u2019ll just say one thing. Really good opportunities are not bargain priced, so I wouldn\u2019t say that this was a bargain price. Cole Hamels just went for $144 million. So there aren\u2019t a lot of really great lefthanders around, so we think Ascend was worth what we paid, in the long run.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Steve Filton", "Great. Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning, thanks. Hey, Steve, I was hoping you could back on the volume side, obviously weak by geographies. But in terms of just service lines can you comment and give some kind of characterization of the volume, between say what looked better worse between say, ortho or cardio or any other specific business lines? And then on the topic of the weak volume, I know Garry asked about tighter utilization management in Behavioral Care, are you seeing anything different in your acute markets, would that be a contributor as well as the weak accounting.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. Again, I think the trends, Frank, overall remain much the same and that is \u2013 and again I think A.J. was asking a similar question kind of from a different angle. But, we continue to see relatively steady volumes in our most tertiary, most severe procedures, as you would expect. Because quite frankly there sort of is no alternative inpatient treatment for those kinds of procedures. Within those kinds of procedures, we have seen a shift, as I think most of our peers have away from cardiac into orthopedics and certain other specialties over the last few years. We have seen the same decline in birth that many of our peers have seen. Again, I don\u2019t necessarily feel like any of the trends that we have seen, other than sort of as indicated by the specific conditions in our markets are terribly different than what our peers say and experienced as well.", "As far as the utilization management goes, in effect I would give the same answer. I think we face the same increased pressure on rigorous review of the appropriateness of admissions as every hospital in the country and as a consequence we are feeling that same shift from inpatient to outpatient that again I think every hospital feels. But I don\u2019t necessarily have any reason to believe that in our markets or in our hospitals we are sort of experiencing it in any sort of unique way or any differently than the average hospital in the country is experiencing it.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. One more follow-up. You mentioned in your earlier comments on \u2013 you had a theory about potential readmissions on the behavioral side of the RTC. Do you have to have a number like what percentage of RTC patients actually end up being readmitted in any given year? Have you ever seen that number or do you look at that number?", "Steve Filton", "I'm not aware of that. It may well be that we have that data. I mean, really all I was suggesting is that as Medicaid programs try and reduce utilization, one might expect to see a reduction in both admission rates and length of stay and for the most part what we have seen over the last few years is really no decline in admissions. In fact pretty strong admissions on both the residential and acute side. But a contraction in length of stay, and again, my sort of conclusion that I draw from that is that it may be somewhat self-defeating strategy and that you are getting some patients out sooner. But you are not really helping drive down the overall utilization if they are not effectively completing a course of treatment.", "Frank Morgan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instruction] This question is from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay great. Thanks, good morning. I guess you talked a little bit about it. But I guess if you could just talk a little bit more about what was going on in Las Vegas this quarter? I know that we had \u2013 a commentary last quarter was that some of the economic data points were starting to firm and that you kind of hope that things might start to turn by the end of the year. We\u2019ve seen some data points get a little weaker in Vegas. What are your thoughts there?", "Steve Filton", "Kevin I think you have summarized it fairly accurately. I think there were some macro-indications last quarter that there was going to be overall improvement in the market. Some of those indicators have moved sideways or slipped a little bit. But the one thing we\u2019ve consistently said and that I think we would repeat this quarter is that we are not seeing the recovery in the hospital business yet and that\u2019s still the case. Again, I think part of the decision to take guidance down a little bit is tied to that idea that our expectation now at least in the short term is that there is not likely to be a significant recovery in that market.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay. As you did mention earlier you have some CapEx projects coming \u2013 that you are starting. But obviously you took down guidance in part because you are concerned about the economy and that kind of things. How do you balance those two things, the desire to invest for growth down the line versus kind of what you are seeing right now as a weaker demand profile? What\u2019s your thought process there?", "Steve Filton", "Well my general sense Kevin is that CapEx decisions tend to have a longer term perspective to them than operating decisions. So we I thought had very good cost controls as an example in both of our business segments this quarter as we reacted to a more modest revenue growth environment and we react very much in real-time to those kinds of changes. As we think about CapEx and particularly as you think about bigger CapEx, building a new hospital in Temecula, building a new tower at Wellington or adding beds in behavioral, those I think are much longer term decisions and I think we have to think beyond just the current economic recovery and just the market position and what we view as the long term projections in a market and that\u2019s how we do it. So I think that\u2019s why you see sort of more immediate changes in our operating cost structure and less immediate changes in our capital planning.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay I don\u2019t know, maybe I missed it. But you guys are booking high tech revenue differently than your peers. I guess it\u2019s in the revenue number for you. Where does that show up in your same-store metrics? Is that excluded from same-store? Does it show up in other revenue on your supplementals?", "Steve Filton", "It\u2019s excluded from same-store which \u2013 and you guys know this better than I do but I think maybe a reason why sometimes our revenue data compares unfavorably to our peer is because I think they do include it in their same-store numbers.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, now most companies are looking at kind of on a net basis as a contrary expense line. But \u2013 okay, so does that number then show up in other revenue for you?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah it\u2019s a non-same-store acute.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Non-same store acute.", "Steve Filton", "Is where it will show up in the queue.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay.

[Operator Instructions]", "At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Filton, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton", "Thank you, and good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning.", "Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. During this call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and our form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $0.73 for the quarter. After adjusting for the after-tax cost of debt extinguishment recorded during the quarter and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, was $0.91 compared to $0.86 per diluted share recorded in the third quarter of 2011, as calculated on the supplemental schedules included with last night's press release.", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.4% during the third quarter of 2012 over the comparable prior year quarter. Adjusted admissions and patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.6% and 0.7%, respectively, during the third quarter.", "Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.6% during the third quarter of 2012 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 27.8% during the quarter ended September 30, 2012, as compared to 26.5% during the comparable prior year period.", "On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues decreased 0.4% during the third quarter of 2012. The decrease resulted primarily from a 1.7% decrease in adjusted admissions, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission to our hospitals owned for more than a year.", "The rate of organic growth -- the rate of organic revenue growth was weaker than expected, contributing to a decline in operating margins. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 13.4% during the third quarter of 2012, from 14.8% during the third quarter of 2011.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $259 million and $246 million during the 3-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debts, charity care expense and the uninsured discount in this year's third quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the third quarter of 2011.", "However, due primarily to the increase in behavioral health revenues and the very low levels of bad debt and uninsured discounts in that business, our overall percentage of bad debts, charity care and uninsured discounts were lower than those experienced during the third quarter of 2011.", "Our cash provided by operating activities was approximately $162 million during the third quarter of 2012, as compared to $207 million in the third quarter of 2011. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 57 days during the third quarter of 2012, from 51 days during the third quarter of last year, as we continue to have a substantial outstanding Medicaid receivable from the State of Illinois.", "At September 30, 2012, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 56.9% and debt-to-EBITDA was 2.96x. We spent $100 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter. Included in our capital expenditures during the first 9 months of 2012 were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new hospital in Temecula, California. We opened a new bed tower at our Wellington Hospital in West Palm Beach early in October and expect to open a new behavioral facility in Chicago later in the quarter.", "The operating trends and financial results experienced by our behavioral health facilities met our expectations during the first 9 months of 2012. However, against the backdrop of a continued sluggish economic recovery, the operating trends and financial results experienced by our acute hospitals were below our expectations for the third quarter of 2012, and those trends are expected to continue during the fourth quarter of this year.", "Based upon our consolidated financial results experienced during the first 9 months of 2012 and, most notably, the results experienced by our acute care hospitals during the third quarter of 2012, our revised estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2012, is $4 to $4.10 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which includes the EHR impact and the impact of the other items, reflected on the supplemental schedule for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, represents a decrease of approximately 6% from the previously provided range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share.", "The operating pressures that we continue to experience in many of our acute care markets has increased the volatility of the financial results of our acute care hospitals, making estimation of future results more challenging.", "However, we continue to actively and aggressively respond to these challenges through strategic initiatives and operational enhancements, such as physician recruitment and integration, and implementation of expense controls and other operating efficiencies.", "Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.", "Colleen Lang - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "This is Colleen Lang on for Tom. Steve, just on the guidance, I was just wondering if you could walk us through what changed in Q3 versus what you were thinking at the time of Q2. Were the admissions worse? Or did the mix not improved as you would have hoped?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Colleen. So I think in our original guidance for the full year, we were anticipating acute care revenue growth of 3% for the full year. And that was broken down into a slightly lower amount, let's say 2% in the first half of the year and a slightly higher amount of like 4% in the back half of the year, which was reflective of the fact that we were aware that our comparisons were going to be more difficult in the first half of the year. At the end of the second quarter, when we revised our guidance down slightly, it was really an acknowledgment on our part that acute care revenue growth would likely not even meet that 4% level in the back half of the year. So we revised it down to about 2% growth. And as you can see in Q3, we didn't meet the 2%. We -- our acute care same-store revenue growth was actually slightly negative. And really, the revised guidance for the fourth quarter is really just reflective of that trend and the expectation that, that trend is likely to continue into Q4.", "Colleen Lang - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just quickly on the behavioral side. I think last quarter, you talked about how you took some beds offline for construction projects in converting some beds from RTC to acute. Did you see that impact again this quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "We did. I mean, the 3.4% same-store revenue growth that we saw in acute in Q3, I would remind people different than the acute dynamic, is compared to a pretty robust number in Q3 of 2011, close to 7% same-store revenue growth. So the 3.4% was against a difficult comparison. But it did -- it does reflect sort of the metric that we talked about last quarter, which is that probably, the single greatest pressure we feel on the behavioral side is continued pressure on our Medicaid length of stay in the residential business. That has been driving our same-store revenue growth down. And we are, as we discussed last quarter, doing any number of things to try and counter that, including adding more acute care beds. Obviously, the Ascend transaction will add a significant number of acute care beds, converting residential beds to acute. And all those initiatives continue. And so, yes, I think that had a little bit of a dampening impact on our revenue growth in the quarter. And we think that as the initiatives gain traction, that number will start to climb back to a level that we saw just a few quarters ago.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was wondering about this guidance reduction in 2012 and how to think about it for 2013. I know that you're not providing 2013 guidance at this point. But if you took down EPS guidance by 6% in the second half of the year, is there a reason not to kind of say, \"Well, let's annualize that and take down the number by 12% for the year\" and use that as our basis for how we think about growing into 2013? I guess you mentioned cost cutting initiatives that should help offset this next year. But why isn't taking this impact, annualizing it and then growing off of that, the right way to think about 2013?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, Kevin, I want to reinforce what you said, which is that we're not giving 2013 guidance and we're not prepared to do that. But I'll talk a little bit. I mean, I think some of the dynamics that have weighed heavily on acute care revenue growth in 2012 are the economic weakness in our local markets. And when we do give our 2013 guidance at the end February, we'll talk, I think, more about what our outlook is for those metrics in 2013. But, obviously, there is a hope that we will start to see some recovery in some of those markets, albeit we tend to believe it'll be a relatively gradual incremental recovery. The other issue is a number of other companies have talked about, I think, that there has been this continued shift from inpatient to outpatient, which has muted revenues, some in the acute space. Some of that, I think, is a real shift, where the delivery of services has truly changed from one setting to another. And then some of it is this reimbursement dynamic of just more days being billed and reimbursed as observation days rather than as inpatient. And I think, at some point, we will begin to anniversary that impact. I think some of the companies may have already started to see that sort of anniversary-ing impact. So those would be, at least, in my mind, Kevin, the 2 reasons why I would think that you wouldn't necessarily just want to take the third and projected fourth quarter performance and assume that that's to be extrapolated to 2013.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, as we think about the -- I guess, the economic weakness that you mentioned, could you just talk a little bit about, on the acute care business, some of the major markets and where most of that weakness was or was it more broad-based. And then if it's broad-based, just give an update on Vegas?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think the weakness was generally broad-based. I mean, Vegas was down in the third quarter compared to last year but so were, quite frankly, a number of other markets, including South Texas, which we certainly have talked about before, as well as a handful of others. So I don't think the weakness is isolated to a particular market. As far as Vegas goes and, quite frankly, as far as a number of other markets go, the overarching metrics, as we've mentioned before, seem to be getting better. Unemployment is improving in a number of these markets, et cetera. I would think it's fair to say that in most of these markets, that sort of macro growth or macro recovery isn't yet filtering down to the hospital business. But we expect that in the near and intermediate future that it should.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one last quick question. The behavioral facility in Chicago; is that a new facility or is that a replacement facility?", "Steve G. Filton", "It's effectively a new facility. So we had a facility called Hartgrove that we closed a few years ago and built a replacement facility. We have now, subsequently, renovated the Hartgrove physical plant and are reopening it. But it's effectively a net new facility for us in the Chicago market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Campbell of Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to start with maybe some color you could give us on the EHR incentive income and maybe what you expect to receive there in the fourth quarter? And I know you break it out in your guidance or exclude it. But just in general, maybe what we should expect from that line in the fourth quarter and beyond, if possible.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, I will sort of just recap. I think what we've said about our EHR experience in total, and that is we've projected to spend something in the neighborhood of $190 million to $200 million dollars to implement this EHR over the course of 4 or 5 years, beginning in -- at the very end of 2009 and into 2010. We expect to get Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement related to those expenditures in the $140 million to $150 million range. And, therefore, our net expenditure will be $50 million to $60 million, Kevin. We will -- as we have in the press release and as we will in our 2013 guidance, we'll give our best guesses as to what we think those numbers, both from an income and expense line, will be in 2013. I don't think we're prepared to do that today.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And as we think about that, in general, the cost that you associate there and you break out in the adjusted net income, are those theoretically onetime costs as well? Or are those ongoing costs associated with that, that once those incentive payments go away, you'll still have those higher costs?", "Steve G. Filton", "No. The reason that we choose to exclude them, because we think that it gives a better picture of what ongoing operating results are, is because we believe that both the income and the expenses are onetime. I will just remind people that we had an EHR system before implementing the current one and we had operating costs associated with that. We believe that the operating costs associated with the new implementation are fairly comparable. And so we have a universe of operating EHR costs that have been embedded in our results for years and will continue to be in our operating results and will not be excluded.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just a couple of sort of housekeeping items. The D&A went up sequentially. It looks like a lot of that was related to the EHR costs. What sort of -- should we assume that sort of -- that same sort of run rate that you had in the quarter, what was it, $77 million, $78 million?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, as we continue to bring facilities live on this current version of EHR, obviously, the D&A expense will go up. I haven't really thought this through all the way, but we may consider trying to break that out when we give our 2013 guidance. Obviously, we break it out in total, but we may want to beak it out by functional line item.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. Okay. And then on the other operating expenses, that ticked up sequentially, but when you look back versus maybe the first quarter, it was not materially different. Can you -- was it just unusually low in the second quarter? It was around $347,000 versus $363,000 here in the third. And maybe what sort of a more normalized run rate we should use there?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, as I think about it, Kevin, there's only a couple of sort of unusual items, I think, that are in the third quarter, none of which are terribly material. There's probably a couple of million dollars of Ascend transaction cost. There's probably $5 million of costs related to our small construction management business. And those costs are offset by a very like amount of revenues. I think other than those 2 items, I would say that other operating expenses in Q3 reflect a pretty reasonable run rate going forward.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And what were the Ascend costs in the quarter? I don't think you broke those out, did you, in the adjusted?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, I don't have it in front of me. But it's only a couple of million dollars.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom of Raymond James.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to drill down into the behavioral business a little bit more. The same-store revenue missed our model by about 160 bps. And I know you mentioned the length of stay issue in Medicaid. How is the adult side and the commercial side doing relative to your expectations?", "Steve G. Filton", "John, I think that -- and I called out the Medicaid length of stay issue as really the 1 metric that has been sort of pressuring the business. I would say that, generally, trends on the acute side of the behavioral business are strong, both from an admission or a volume perspective, length of stay remains fairly constant because it is almost exclusively non-Medicaid pricing on the acute side. Pricing remains strong, et cetera. So the pressures really have been almost exclusively on the residential side of the acute business. And almost exclusively on the Medicaid part of that, which is the biggest piece of it.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And just 2 follow-ups on that. One is remind me how much, if we were to look at your overall plan over the next 2 or 3 years, what's your plan to expand your headcount on a percentage basis in your behavioral? And then, secondly, I guess it's not entirely clear if Medicaid's imposing shorter lengths of stay, what you can do to specifically counteract that. I'm not sure -- I'm not familiar with the tactics you might use to push against that.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. So I think, obviously, we're always, and I think this has always been the case, I mean, we're always fighting for the appropriate length of stay and justifying medically necessary length of stay, et cetera. That's something we always do. But quite frankly, I mean, the main technique and tactic that we've talked about in the last few quarters is we're trying to lessen our reliance on the residential business. We've talked before about 1 of the significant attractions and compelling arguments for Ascend was that it's a business that is very highly weighted to acute beds rather than residential beds. We've been adding, in response to your question, John, something in the neighborhood of 300, 350 new beds a year in the behavioral segment. And those beds have been largely acute beds. And then, finally, we've talked in the last quarter or so about conversion of residential beds to acute beds. And we're probably on pace in 2012 to convert a couple of hundred residential beds to acute beds. And my guess would be we probably have a like amount in the Q for next year as well.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And what's your mix now between adult and RTC -- or I'm sorry, RTC, non-RTC [indiscernible]?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, so before the Ascend transaction, our historical, I think, revenue mix was like 75% acute, 25% residential.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And you can move -- how much can you move that a year with your conversions and your bed adds?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, again, if you think about, basically, a base of roughly 20,000 beds, and if you're adding 300 to 350 acute and converting another couple of hundred, it's sort of 500 beds on a basis of 20,000 gives you some sense of what we're able to do.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "So a couple of percent.", "Steve G. Filton", "Exactly.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I know ourselves and others have tried to allocate your G&A, and we come up with an EBITDA mix, if you allocate you G&A, of something in the range of 67% to 70% of EBITDA now comes from behavioral and the remainder comes from acute. Would you agree with that math or would you allocate the overhead differently? Or is there something that we need to adjust in our thinking?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I think we've said publicly that post the Ascend transaction, our run rate will reflect an EBITDA contribution from the behavioral segment of about 70% of the total.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice of UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions, if I might. First of all, maybe I missed this, but is the Ascend results in your fourth quarter guidance?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, A.J., I was just referring to the fact that we had some transaction costs related to Ascend -- oh, I'm sorry, in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, yes, I'm sorry, the -- we do assume we will get a couple of pennies benefit from having Ascend in the fourth quarter.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. When I look at the margin trend, and I know you commented on the other operating, obviously, the -- behavioral's moving in a positive direction and the acute's in a negative direction. I think you'd probably say that both of those are largely driven by top line performance. But could you comment on the individual expense items? And in the 2 divisions, what was under pressure on the acute side, and what was -- where was the positive leverage on the psych side?", "Steve G. Filton", "Hey, look, A.J., I think you've got to the crux of the point or the crux of the matter. Because both of these businesses are largely fixed and semi-fixed cost businesses, they really require some amount of revenue growth to create operating leverage. Not a significant amount. And I think our performance -- our behavioral performance in Q3 is reflective of that. So we have 3.5% revenue growth in behavioral in Q3, 8% or 9% EBITDA expansion. A very positive, strong, robust result in our minds and something that we think we can and will continue to replicate. On the acute side, it's really sort of just the opposite. I think we've been, quite frankly, for many years now, for a good 3 or 4 years now, focused on really creating leaner, more efficient operating structures in the acute division. And I think we've been largely successful in doing it. The fact of the matter, however, is that unless we can sort of drive 2% or 3% revenue growth, it's pretty hard to avoid margin contraction, which is what you saw in Q3. I think that's largely true across the board again in both divisions, but where the real leverage tends to come, again, is in the more fixed and semi-fixed costs. You just can't cut your utilities and your taxes and your insurance, et cetera, as your revenue shrinks, in the same way that you can adjust headcount and things like that, which I think we've done a good job of doing.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just lastly, any update on your thinking around provider tax, UPL, a DSH payments either, as they reflected in the third quarter or going forward from here?", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean, again, I think we'll certainly, I think, provide more color when we give our 2013 guidance. But I think, for now, our expectation is that, I'll sort of call those special items, UPL, DSH pro, provider taxes will likely continue at or around the same levels that they're at now.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And there wasn't anything unusual in the quarter around any of those?", "Steve G. Filton", "No.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Anton Hie of RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Frank Morgan here. Steve, my question is on, hopefully, getting an update on the state reimbursement outlook for the new fiscal year we're in. Particularly on the behavioral side, are you seeing any improvement at all? Or is it basically about the same?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I think beginning in the sort of July of 2011 time frame, Frank, we talked about the outlook for the next 12 months, which is basically the Medicaid fiscal year as being Medicaid cuts of sort of flat to down 1%. I think we've probably trended to the, however you want to think about it, the lower end, meaning the 1% cuts rather than flattish. And again, that contributes to a little bit of that same Medicaid pressure that I was alluding to before, mostly as a length of stay pressure, but also a little bit of rate pressure. I think it's too early to say what that will look like come July of 2012 -- excuse me, 2013. And, obviously, what I meant was July of 2012 for the flat to down 1%. Obviously, when we give our guidance for 2013, we will embed in that an estimate for the back half of the year for Medicaid pricing and, hopefully, we'll have a better sense of it at that point in time.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. In terms of -- could you talk a little bit more about the cost reduction efforts? I mean, you touched on this with A.J. a little bit, but the cost reduction efforts going on through the process of the third quarter relative to the slowdown in volumes. And I'm just curious, could the fourth quarter be a quarter where you get the full benefit of the cost reductions you were making across the course of the third quarter and then with any pickup in volume and that maybe the effect here reverses the other way? And then maybe could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in volumes so far in the fourth?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I think it's worth noting, and I know a number of the other companies that have previously reported this quarter, mention that September, for them, was clearly the weakest month of the quarter. That was certainly true for us as well. And so, as I think normally occurs with that sort of thing, I mean, both our volumes and payor mix weakened in September. It's difficult to respond in real time to that almost immediately. But we did -- we do and we have responded and so, we will get some continuing benefit from that in Q4. Now, part of our revised guidance assumptions in Q4, quite frankly, is that the negative trends that we experienced in September will largely continue into Q4. Certainly, we hope that they improve. And I would say the very first glimpses we've had of Q4, which are basically October volumes, look a little bit better, although, I wouldn't draw too many definitive conclusions from that on its own. So I think the question you're asking, Frank, is the third quarter deteriorated. We began making some more aggressive cost cuts towards the end of the third quarter. If the revenue trajectory improves a little bit in Q4 from where it was in September, we should certainly benefit from that and get a pickup, and that would make our revised guidance look a little more conservative. But I think it's way too early to make that judgment.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton", "Okay. Well, we'd like to thank everybody. We hope that everybody stays safe and continues to recover from the hurricane. And look forward to talking with you at the end of the year.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Q4 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton", "Thank you. Good morning. I'm Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.", "We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $4.53 for the year and $1.39 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating primarily to prior years, the gain on the sale of our Auburn facility and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2012, was $1.", "Included in the quarter is an increase to our effective tax rate due to nondeductible transaction costs related to the Ascend acquisition. On a same-facility basis, revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 4.5% during the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted admissions and patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 5% and 0.5%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 4% during the fourth quarter of 2012 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "We define operating margins as operating income or net revenue less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses, supplies expense and doubtful accounts divided by net revenue. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 27.6% during the quarter ended December 31, 2012, as compared to 25.3% during the comparable prior year period.", "As discussed in the Form 10-K we filed last night, the OIG has served a subpoena requesting various documents concerning UHS and several of its behavioral facilities. At the present time, we're uncertain as to the focus, scope or extent of the investigation, liability of the facilities and/or potential financial exposure, if any, in connection with this matter.", "On a same-facility basis, in our acute division, revenues increased 3.1% during the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase resulted primarily from a 1.7% increase in adjusted admissions and a 1.4% increase in revenues per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 14.4% during the fourth quarter of 2012 from 15.5% during the fourth quarter of 2011. Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $206 million and $248 million during the 3-month periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debts, charity care expense and the uninsured discount in this year's fourth quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the fourth quarter of 2011.", "However, due primarily to the increase in behavioral health revenues and the very low levels of bad debt and uninsured discounts in that business, our overall percentage of bad debt to charity care and uninsured discounts were lower than those experienced during the fourth quarter of 2011.", "Our cash from operating activities was approximately $280 million during the fourth quarter of 2012, as compared to $156 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2012, as we continue to have a substantial Medicaid receivable from the state of Illinois. At December 31, 2012, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 58%.", "We spent $81 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter. Included in our capital expenditures were the ongoing construction costs related to a new acute care hospital in Temecula, California. We opened a new bed tower at our Wellington hospital in West Palm Beach, Florida early in October. We opened a total of 270 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest facilities in 2012. During 2013, we expect to spend approximately $360 million to $385 million on capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. Excluding the favorable $0.13 per diluted share EHR impact described in our press release, our estimated range of earnings per diluted share attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2013, is $4.35 to $4.50 on projected net revenues of $7.4 billion.", "We are pleased to answer questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of A.J. Rice from UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions if I could ask. First of all, it's good to see that you, obviously, returned to the positive on the inpatient acute care volumes. Can you give us a little more flavor? Was that -- I mean, do you have a sense of how much, if any, the flu impacted that? Or maybe in terms of geographies, was that a Vegas-driven turn? Was that more broad based? Any color would be helpful.", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, A.J. I think that, like everybody, we experienced a busier flu season this past winter than we have had in several years. Although, again, I think as most hospital providers have reported, for us, it was probably more of an ER dynamic and more ER visits than actual inpatient admissions. I think we believe we had a bit of a pickup in inpatient admissions, but don't believe it to be a material number or certainly a material impact from a financial statement perspective for the quarter. As far as the improved, I think, both volumes and payor mix in the acute division for the quarter, I think that strength was relatively pervasive throughout the division. It was not focused in 1 or 2 markets and just -- but more of a trend that we tended to see throughout the facilities and throughout the portfolio.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then if you -- on your 2013 guidance, I know you gave us the numbers for the HITECH incentives and so forth. How about just operating assumptions, are you assuming any kind of turn either in the acute business or steady state in the psych? Can you give us a little more flavors for some of the key underlying assumptions there?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. I think that the guidance for next year is generally premised on stabilizing trends underlying the business. On the acute side, I think that it is reflective of the sort of revenue growth that we saw in the third quarter. That is kind of in the 2.5%,  3% range split sort of evenly between pricing and volumes. Obviously, we have factored into our guidance, as have our peers, the effect of sequestration beginning in April and the effect of both the disproportionate share and coding cuts that will become effective in October as part of the Affordable Care Act. On the behavioral side, I think just generally more of the same, 4%, 5% revenue growth and mid-single-digit EBITDA growth. And then, obviously, we've got a full year of the Ascend facilities in our guidance for next year.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the last question maybe. I don't know how much you can say on the OIG subpoena. But clearly, a lot of the regulatory and questions that have been related to the psych business over the, really, the last decade have been more clinical type of questions as opposed to billing questions. Is there any way to look at the wording of the thing and make any assessment as to whether it's -- which of those 2 directions it seems to be going?", "Steve G. Filton", "No. I think, A.J., as you suggest, the trend in behavioral care has been -- and these -- to have these investigations focus on clinical practices, and I would say that the content of the subpoenas would suggest that, that's largely the focus here. I will say that I believe the government often pursues a technique in which they try and tie together what they perceive to be clinical issues and quality deficiencies then with an argument that a false claim has been filed because there's not adequate care, et cetera. We have no idea if that's where the government is going in this case and certainly couldn't predict that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin from Barclays Capital.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just first question on the behavioral, Steve, following up. I think you said sort of 4% to 5% on the revenue growth. I think historically, you guys have targeted something sort of north of 5% -- 5%, 5.5%. Was there some of the bed conversion impact still going on? Or I'm just curious. Is that -- is 4% to 5% now a better sort of long-term behavioral health growth rate?", "Steve G. Filton", "Josh, I think that the key variable that has sort of tempered a little bit of our expectations from something a little bit higher than 5%, let's say, is the length-of-stay issue. As you saw in the press release and I reiterated in my prepared remarks, admissions grew a very solid 5% but -- or adjusted admissions grew 5%, but adjusted patient days only grew 0.5%. And obviously, the dynamic there is we continue to see length-of-stay compression, and because the vast majority of our reimbursement is on a per diem basis, that length-of-stay compression, which is very much focused in the residential component of our behavioral business, continues to temper our revenue growth. Now we speculate and we believe and I think from a clinical perspective, we particularly believe that there's a natural floor to that length-of-stay compression and reduction that at some point -- and I think our clinical people would argue we've probably passed that point -- the continued early discharge of these patients is really not a clinically effective treatment protocol. So we'll see. I mean, but I think our expectation that we grow at the current rates is that to continue to see those length-of-stay pressures.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So you're actually assuming another reduction in length of stay in the behavioral side for [indiscernible] ?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think we're assuming the trajectory continues as it is now.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Got you. And then just second question, you mentioned the coding and DSH cuts that are effective October. Can you size of those, maybe what your DSH payments were on both Medicare and Medicaid and just sort of give us a sense as to what the actual dollar impact you think could be in the fourth quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. So I think the issue vis-\u00e0-vis the fourth quarter cuts from the ACA really are surrounding Medicare disproportionate share. Our annual Medicare disproportionate share reimbursement is in the neighborhood of a little over $100 million. We're assuming that about half of that goes away. I know there have been discussions on some of our peers' calls about some of the mechanics that go into that calculation, and we by no means can be terribly precise about it. But we're assuming about half of that goes away, so something like $50 million of DSH begins to be cut in the fourth quarter. Obviously, 1/4 of that is something in the neighborhood of $13 million or $14 million impact in the fourth quarter of '13.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And that's just the fourth quarter impact.", "Steve G. Filton", "Correct.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Got you. And then the coding adjustment.", "Steve G. Filton", "And then the coding adjustment, which also is just the fourth quarter, is another $4 million or $5 million.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "$4 million, $5 million for the quarter.", "Steve G. Filton", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I guess just, Steve, the margins in the quarter in the acute care side were still under a little bit of pressure. Revenues rebounded. I'm wondering if you had any thoughts there and sort of what your expectations are in that regard as you think about '13.", "Steve G. Filton", "Tom, I mean, you probably have heard me say and others say that, I think, generally our view is that when we get to about 3% same-store revenue growth on the acute side that we feel that's a sufficient level of growth to have, at a minimum, sort of flattish EBITDA and maybe even slightly improved, and we were down a little bit in the fourth quarter. I think that the single biggest driver of that was probably $4 million or $5 million of incremental expense associated with physician employment and physician practice acquisition. Those who follow us know we probably have not pursued those physician strategies at least in terms of the significant dollars of investment as aggressively as some of our peers. But we're certainly doing it in some of our markets, and clearly, you saw that impact a little bit in the fourth quarter of 2012. As far as 2013 goes, I think, generally, we sort of view it as a sort of a push in our guidance, meaning that we don't think our physician expenses grow much. I think we feel like whatever new investment we make in 2013 will be offset by some of the efficiencies we're able to achieve in the existing practices that we have.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "So does that suggest that you sort of anticipate more stable margins as we think about the coming year?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, I think what it suggests, Tom, in my mind, is that we believe that if we can get to that level of growth that we had in Q4, that is 3% growth, that we ought to be able to have margins that are relatively flat or slightly improving. Obviously, the real challenge in the budget next year is to get to that level of revenue growth with all of the reimbursement cuts that we've highlighted so far.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Right, right. Okay. And then just wondering on the balance sheet and sort of the acquisition side of things. Obviously, you did Ascend. Wondering sort of where your thinking is on delevering and sort of what the pipeline might look like, particularly on the acute care side and your appetite there.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. I mean, I don't think our view has changed really at all there, Tom. You've heard us say before we are -- tend to be opportunistic, and we're always looking at opportunities to either strengthen our existing acute care franchises, and behavioral as well, or to penetrate new markets or enter new markets that look particularly compelling. I think one of the hurdles to that for a number of years now has been the -- still what we view as fairly rich valuations for a lot of these acquisitions, which make it very hard to earn a reasonable return. I think UHS has a history of being very judicious about where we invest and what we invest in. And I see that continuing. On the other hand, as you've heard Alan and I talk about, I think, on these calls before, there's obviously a great deal of change going on in this industry, and I think it's causing not-for-profit hospitals, in particular, to rethink their future plans. And we may see an uptick in activity in the M&A landscape, and we will certainly be paying attention to that and evaluate those opportunities as they arise.", "Operator", "Your next question from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just one quick one here. Start with -- on the guidance. What is the implied cash flow from ops number you would see on the year based on your EPS guidance?", "Steve G. Filton", "So I think when you factor in, Frank, the CapEx projections that we detailed, I think you're talking about free cash flow in the $450 million range.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Secondly, just on reform, it looks like expectations are shifting to see a lot more benefit from Medicaid expansion early on in the reform process. I'm just curious, as it relates to your Behavioral Health Care business, do you think there's a big enough impact there to really affect your bad debt expenses early on, particularly with that adult male population that you may have been treating in the past that may now be covered under reform. So any thoughts that you could see some kind of material improvement in bad debts on the behavioral side in 2014 when reform cranks up?", "Steve G. Filton", "So obviously, as you can tell, Frank, and others, I mean, our bad debt percentage in behavioral runs fairly low already. It's in that 2.5% to 3% range. And so I think our view from the outset of thinking about reform has been that the opportunity on the behavioral side, while there is some opportunity to reduce our uncompensated load, the big opportunity in that regard is on the acute side. The larger, I think, opportunity on the behavioral side is to have an expanded universe of patients that have coverage either through Medicaid, as you suggest, or through the exchanges, who might be eligible for admission to our hospitals, who were not previously eligible. I think we've articulated in prior presentations, et cetera, that it's difficult to quantify that opportunity in any precise way, but we think that it may be a significant portion of the population that will now have insured mental health benefits that don't have them today.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then one final, on length of stay, are there any particular states where you're seeing more focus on the issue of length-of-stay management?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think for the most part, as I was saying before to Josh, that the length-of-stay issue, I think, is generally focused in our residential business, which is the smaller component of our behavioral business. It's very much a Medicaid and Medicaid managed care issue, but I don't know that it's particularly focused on a state or a particularly aggressive payor. I just think, in general, we're seeing most Medicaid payors, whether they're the traditional state payors or the managed payors, being more rigorous about their utilization review, et cetera. I mean, obviously, we see it a little more aggressive in certain states than others, but it's pretty much an across-the-board phenomena.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is actually Joanna Gajuk in today for Kevin. Just on the topic of the reform, you mentioned -- you talked about the psych business, but I guess what relates to both businesses. Can you talk about what are your expectations or where you see out there in terms of rates of the new exchanges? Some of your peers commented that they were able to secure some contracts already. So any color you can provide where you see those rates falling?", "Steve G. Filton", "Joanna, I can certainly comment on expectations. I think we've said from the beginning that our expectations are the commercial exchange rates would fall into our range of commercial pricing. But I think we've also said that, as recently as literally just weeks ago, that we've really not negotiated any firm rates on exchanges, et cetera. I know that's a little bit different than some of our peers, who in this earnings season have been able to point to some actual contract negotiations. We're unable to do that. I mean, again, I think our expectations are very similar to our peers, but I don't know that we can point with any sort of certainty to actual negotiations that have been concluded as did some of our peers.", "Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then on a different topic, in terms of your outlook for next year, can you give us a little bit more color on what you expect on the Medicaid rates?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think our expectation about Medicaid rates is that they remain similar to this year. So that in the sort of July of '13 Medicaid pricing cycle, I think we've presumed in our guidance that Medicaid rates remain sort of flat or maybe down 1%, very similar to what they did in the July of '12 cycle.", "Joanna Gajuk - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And the last one, can you just talk a little bit more about the Vegas performance and your expectations there for this year?", "Steve G. Filton", "As I said previously, I think that the overarching trends that were present in the acute business in the fourth quarter, which were slightly improved volumes and slightly improved payor mix, were generally present throughout the portfolio and that there were not necessarily any markets that were really extremely positive performing or negative. I think, again, we saw the general improvement throughout the portfolio. I think our basic view of '13 are generally stable trends, again, as it comes to volumes and payor mix, I think it's a little too early to read into the fourth quarter performance that we're on a kind of a steadily increasing trajectory at this point. As I noted to a previous question, I think some of the benefit, although not a huge number, but some of the impact in Q4 may have been the flu. I think some of that carries over into, at least, January or so of the first quarter. So we'll see. I mean, I think we'd like to see another quarter or 2 of that sort of strong performance to presume we've really had a turn here. But otherwise, I think, generally, our 2013 outlook is for stabilizing trends in the acute division.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Justin Lake from JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, if we could start off on the psych side with the OIG, is there anything that you can tell us in terms of billing of psych that has historically been controversial that maybe they could be looking at here?", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean, again, I think it's very difficult, Justin, for us to really predict with any sort of level of accuracy what the government's angling for. I think I suggested in an earlier comment to a question, the bulk of the request, I think, is on patient records or is for patient records, et cetera, which would sort of lead you to believe it's -- the focus is probably more on clinical matters. Although, again, I think there's a history of the government trying to convert that, if you will, into a billing issue. But no, I mean, it's not like we've had a pattern of kind of billing issues or irregularities in the behavioral business by any means.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. And Steve, is this the -- my recollection is the OIG had been looking into one of the facilities previously, not one of these, one of this batch. But you've had the OIG looking at or asking for information on one of the other facilities, right?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I mean, there's a little bit of history here. I mean, PSI had a facility that had a Department of Justice subpoena that I think goes back all the way to 2008. We've disclosed an investigation of our Peachford facility for at least several quarters. So I mean, it's not the first time a behavioral facility has been investigated, if that's the question.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, I mean, I'm just curious if there's anything you can look at in terms of how those investigations went and what they were looking at that you might be able to share with us here?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I mean, the PSI investigation, which began, frankly, well before our ownership -- I think, again, the subpoena goes back in 2008. Nothing has ever really come of that investigation. And as far as the Peachford investigation goes, we've had no indication from the government other than our response to the subpoena, no feedback from them about what they're looking for. And no reason -- Justin, just let me say, I have no reason to believe that either of those previous investigations are connected to this current subpoena.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Got it. Okay. So -- and then if we kind of jump away from that, free cash flow for 2014, Steve, can you give us a number? I assume there's nothing in guidance for deployment there. So can you kind of walk us through what your thoughts are for -- or I should say 2013 for capital deployment?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. Just from a guidance perspective, I think our convention always has been to assume that all of our free cash flow goes towards the repayment of debt unless, at the time of giving guidance, we have a specific transaction that is very far along, which is not the case this year. So we've assumed, as I indicated in the previous -- to the previous questioner, about $450 million of free cash flow and that all that goes to repayment of debt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Steve, are you aware of maybe others in the industry also getting a similar request from OIG? Or do you not know?", "Steve G. Filton", "Unaware. I mean, Ralph, I think the only way we'd be aware is if folks had disclosed that, and I don't know that we would have any other way of knowing that.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Okay. And then just switching gears here. You -- on the behavioral side, I guess, as you think about next year, do you think you have the capacity to kind of deal with the potential bump in volume into 2014? And then I think in the past, you've mentioned there are uninsured today that, I guess, you have the potential opportunity you may not accept to some degree in your facilities. Is there any way for you to give a sense or to measure the magnitude of that number?", "Steve G. Filton", "So let me answer your -- the latter question first. No, I think it's difficult to do. It's sort of trying to capture a patient population who effectively either gets care elsewhere today or, frankly, doesn't get care at all. And so that's just not a number that we have easy access to. We do know, just from sort of ongoing operations, et cetera, that there's a significant universe of people -- I mean, again, this is not particularly unique to us, but we know there's a fairly significant universe of people who don't have insurance and, therefore, don't have access to the current system, and who, if they get insurance, will have access to the system. As far as our ability to absorb that increased demand, I would suggest to you that if you go back and look at our occupancy rates for the last 10 years in the behavioral division, you'll see that as recently as sort of 2005 or so, we were running 85% occupancy in our behavioral division. We currently run in the mids -- mid- to upper 70s. So we certainly could move higher. Now when we were running in the mid-80s, is when we began a program of fairly aggressive capacity expansion because I think we believe that, that's a fairly inefficient level of occupancy, and we're turning away insured patients at that level of occupancy. But I think the answer is, in the short term, if demand were to increase as we expect that it might to some degree, we can certainly accommodate that in the short run and then begin plans to add new beds relatively quickly and aggressively much as the way we've been doing so for the last 7 or 8 years.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just my last one, is there anything we need to consider in terms of the guidance of incremental cost in '13 that may roll off in 2014, just in general or maybe to prepare for reform?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don't know that to prepare for reform is really specific. I will say the one probably UHS-specific item in guidance is -- that's probably a little different and people have not anticipated -- is we are opening in the back half of 2013 our hospital in Temecula, California. We've certainly discussed that construction before. But it opens in the sort of September-October time frame. And there's probably a good $16 million, $17 million, $18 million in our guidance, in our budget of start-up losses and costs associated with that opening, which, obviously, is somewhat of a drag on our back half of '13.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Back half, meaning sort of 4Q and sort of a way to think about an offset from some of the pressure that you talked about earlier from the DSH cuts and coding? Is that the way to think about it?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, not an offset. It's a further headwind, and it's in -- it's sort of start-up costs in Q3 and then operating losses in Q4.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Right. But those don't -- point being that those don't repeat next year?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, the presumption would be that, as the facility operates, there's probably -- the start-up losses continue into the first half of '14, but by the back half of '14, we would start to turn that around.", "Ginger?", "Operator", "Yes, Chris, your line is open.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Chris Rigg?", "Operator", "Yes.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, sorry. I couldn't hear you. Just to follow up a little bit on the last question, can you just remind us sort of the total investment expansion investment money running through the P&L in 2012, whether that's Wellington or behavioral bed development versus what you're expecting in 2013, Temecula and additional beds on the behavioral side?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, Chris, I think it's about the same. I mean, I'll just round the numbers and say that we're going to spend $375 million in -- well, we spent $375 million in CapEx in '12. We'll spend a like amount in '13. Probably $100 million of that is maintenance capital. That's mostly focused in the acute division. That's capital that basically is just there to upgrade the equipment and keep the facilities running, et cetera, no real return being associated with that. And then another $100 million to $150 million of behavioral expansion and another $100 million to $150 million of acute expansion.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "In terms of what's running through the income statement, is that also about -- are you saying that's also about the same?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don't really -- I apologize because I don't -- when you say capital ...", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I guess, yes, maybe it was unclear. I got caught a little off guard there with -- when the queue opened. But with regard to -- you said you're going to spend $16 million, $17 million, $18 million on Temecula. I'm sure you had similar -- something similar for Wellington and then also in terms of is there anything on sort of behavioral start-up costs? I'm trying to figure out, apples to apples, what the investment headwinds running through the income statement would be.", "Steve G. Filton", "Okay. No, I got that. No, I think that the Temecula start-up losses and start-up costs are unique in the sense that, Wellington, we opened a bed tower in an existing facility. And there's not anywhere remotely close to the same sort of level of start-up costs, et cetera. We're talking about a brand-new greenfield hospital in Temecula. It's a much different dynamic. Most of the behavioral expansion is like the Wellington tower. It's additional beds at existing facilities. So again, there's nothing comparable this year to that Temecula number next year.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the OIG subpoena -- and I'm not sure what you can say here. But can you give us a sense for the revenue exposure with regard to the facilities that are cited in the subpoena?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I had a few analysts say to me last night that they simply went to AHD data or whatever for the facilities identified and got 6% or 7% of our consolidated revenues. And I think that's a fairly accurate number of the 10 or 11 facilities that have been identified.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Campbell from Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of modeling questions at this point. The sale of the acute care hospital, where exactly does that impact the income statement in the fourth quarter if we wanted to back that out in our own models? And really same question for the favorable reserve impact, which line item and which segment does that affect?", "Steve G. Filton", "So they're both on the other operating expense line, and obviously, Auburn is an acute facility. The malpractice reserve affects both divisions, although it's probably skewed to the acute division.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then the -- on the Temecula hospital, what sort of quarterly D&A jump should we see from 3Q to 4Q from that opening?", "Steve G. Filton", "It's a $150 million investment to be amortized or depreciated over 25 years.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "You've talked in the past about transitioning some of the RTC beds into acute. Can you give us a sense of sort of where you were, I guess, either as a percentage of revenue or percentage of volumes at the end of '12 and where you might hope to be at the end of '13?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, Gary, so I think roughly, the behavioral revenue split is about 75% acute behavioral, 25% residential behavioral. I think our view is that as we convert beds, maybe we're affecting that split by 50 or 75 basis points a year is kind of the general sense of what we can accomplish.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, just in terms of either anticipating the impact from health care reform or as you see more volumes from that reform, can you speed that up? Or would you be satisfying the additional demand mainly from new additional beds on the acute side?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think that the general sense is that adding beds in the behavioral space can be -- the process can be accelerated some if the demand is there. We probably said before that the biggest challenge or hurdle to adding beds on the behavioral side tends to be kind of the regulatory local zoning sorts of issues. So sometimes that's not within our control. But yes, generally, I think our view is that if reform results in a measured increase in demand that we will accelerate the expansion program that we've already been -- had under way for 7 or 8 years, and so we're quite familiar with how to do it and what needs to be done and that we can make that happen somewhat faster.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you just remind us what type of average commercial rate increases are incorporated into the guidance for 2013?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, I think our commercial rate increases on the acute side have been averaging 5% to 7%, and I believe we still feel are in that range. On the behavioral side, that number is historically a couple of hundred basis points lower and I think remains so in our guidance. So that -- those numbers honestly have not changed very much in the past few years.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And no material changes in contract terms or contract types?", "Steve G. Filton", "Not yet.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Ransom from Raymond James.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just -- we've noticed with you and some others that the charity and bad debt blipped up a little bit in the fourth quarter, which seems a little odd kind of where we are in the employment recovery. Do you have any thoughts about that?", "Steve G. Filton", "John, I mean, I think what we saw was a shift from charity and uninsured discount to bad debts. As you've heard me comment any number of times over the years, we view the uncompensated expense sort of all as one large pool. So we never spend a lot of time trying to analyze or explain shifts between the categories. I think, in general, our view was that payor mix improved a little bit in Q4, and these are really acute care observations that even though we continue to see decelerating commercial and Medicare volumes and accelerating Medicaid and uninsured volumes, both the rates of deceleration and acceleration were somewhat muted or more mitigated in Q4. So I think we had a view that actually payor mix got a little better in the quarter.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Yes. If nothing happened with mix and all that flowed through was your pricing, how much would bad debt go up for you every year?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, so I think in general, our gross pricing continues to go up between 6% and 8% a year. So you can sort of do that math. I mean, that, in and of itself, drives a lot of the increase in bad debt and charity care expense. I don't have a calculation in front of me, but I think you can kind of do that back of the envelope.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Right. Is there any -- I know a while back, you guys were a little more optimistic about deploying some capital on the acute care side. Has your enthusiasm waxed or waned on your pipeline since that time?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. I wouldn't describe it as either, John. I mean, I think we have a very kind of opportunity-specific view of the world, and that is we evaluate every opportunity on its own. If an individual opportunity makes sense, we'll pursue it. So I don't know that I think I would make any kind of macro characterizations of our view at the moment. Obviously, the proof's in the pudding, we haven't made a ton of external acute investments in the last 4 or 5 years because we've not found them compelling. Now in fairness, as we've mentioned about Temecula and the Wellington bed tower and the Summerlin Tower, et cetera, and Palmdale, we've made a lot of internal capital investments in acute care because we felt like they were the more likely or the more economically prudent investments to earn above average returns.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I mean, how many would you say UHS-quality assets come on the market in a given year now? And is it more or fewer than it was a few years ago?", "Steve G. Filton", "Again, I think there are more assets that come to the market today. I think that there are lots of -- a reasonable number of quality assets that come on the market. Again, we're not the only party out there bidding for those assets, et cetera. So I think it -- more than anything, it becomes a price valuation issue in terms of whether you can acquire the asset at a valuation that allows you earn a reasonable return.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it's more the pricing than it is the supply.", "Steve G. Filton", "I believe so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Steve, I think you've called out med mal as a favorable onetime benefit, I think, almost every year for 4 or 5 years now. At what point does that become recurring? I mean, your peers all take credit for it, so I'm just wondering what the thinking was on that.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, it's a fair comment, Whit. Obviously, I think, for the most part, the reason that we exclude it from current operating earnings is that almost by definition, it is focused on prior year amounts and prior year reserves. But to your point, UHS has had a long history of taking a very conservative position on its malpractice expense and reserves. I think our main focus is just trying our best to get the current expense, the current year malpractice provision correct and accurate, and we believe we're getting closer to that. But I appreciate your pointing out that we've penalized ourselves to some degree by always tossing these numbers out.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Sure. And maybe just any comments on Ascend and the integration and how that's progressing.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. I mean, obviously, it's a much smaller deal and therefore integration than the PSI deal was -- we're talking 9 facilities. We have commented sort of from the beginning when we announced the deal that we anticipated getting about $200 million in revenues and about $60 million in EBITDA from Ascend. And I think we feel like we're very much on track to do that. Those are really the numbers that are embedded in our 2013 guidance. And we're very pleased, even though it's early on the process, we're pleased with the way that integration's going.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And maybe just one last final one. Any thoughts on sort of the sequence of earnings this year? Historically, you've always had a lot sort of weighted in the first half of the year for acute, and then maybe a year ago or so, you felt that, that imbalance would balance out, if you will, and the calendar looks a little tough in Q1. And so just wondering if you had any updated thoughts for how we should see sort of the sequence of earnings progress throughout the year.", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I mean, other than a few of the things that we've discussed, I think there'll be a little bit of a benefit from the flu in the first quarter, and then obviously, these reimbursement cuts, as well as the Temecula opening that we talked about, are skewed towards the latter half of the year. Sequestration is effective beginning in April, and you've got all those cuts over then the balance of the year. And then you've got the disproportionate share coding cuts in the fourth quarter and then the Temecula drag in the third and fourth quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Glen Losev from WallachBeth.", "Glen M. Losev - WallachBeth Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, can you comment on surgical volumes in 4Q relative to the first 9 months of the year and what your expectations are for, let's say, 2013?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, surgical volumes, Glen, picked up a little bit in Q4. Inpatient volumes were sort of flattish, which is, frankly, the best they've been in a number of quarters, and outpatient was down a little bit. But that was also the best we've seen probably at least since the first quarter of the year. So much like the other metrics that I talked about in terms of overall volumes and payor mix, surgical volumes showed a bit of an improvement in Q4 as well.", "Glen M. Losev - WallachBeth Capital, LLC, Research Division", "And what's the acuity of the surgeries? Was it higher than you've seen recently? Or it was a lower acuity surgeries?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, definitely, our Medicare CMI was higher in Q4.", "Glen M. Losev - WallachBeth Capital, LLC, Research Division", "And one last question, can you give us any color on what you guys seen in your Las Vegas and Texas markets?", "Steve G. Filton", "Did you say in Last Vegas and Texas or...", "Glen M. Losev - WallachBeth Capital, LLC, Research Division", "Uhmm.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. Again, as I've mentioned to a few different people, in general, the trends that I've articulated a few times, slightly better volumes, slightly better surgical volumes, a little bit better payor mix in the acute division in Q4, were generally present throughout the portfolio, not necessarily terribly better or worse in any markets, including Las Vegas and South Texas.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton", "Okay. Well, we thank everybody and look forward to speaking to everybody in a couple of months after the first quarter. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Q1 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton", "Good morning. I'm Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.", "During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.21 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased 8% to $1.22 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $1.13 per diluted share during the first quarter of last year.", "On a same-facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.4% during the first quarter of 2013.", "Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.6% and adjusted patient days were relatively flat during the first quarter.", "Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.6% during the first quarter of 2013 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 28.4% during the quarter ended March 31, 2013, as compared to 26.8% during the comparable prior year period.", "On a same-facility basis in our acute division, revenues increased 0.7% during the first quarter of 2013. The increase resulted primarily from a 1.5% decrease in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 2.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.", "On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 16.0% during the first quarter of 2013 from 19.0% during the first quarter of 2012.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates amounting to $230 million and $312 million during the 3-month periods ended March 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The decrease in charity care and uninsured discounts recorded at our acute care hospitals during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012 was offset by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, which amounted to $218 million during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $125 million during the first quarter of 2012.", "As a percentage of acute care net revenues, bad debts, charity care expense and the uninsured discount in this year's first quarter were at levels higher than those experienced during the first quarter of 2012. However, due primarily to the increase in behavioral health revenues and the very low levels of bad debt and uninsured discounts in that business, our overall percentage of bad debts, charity care and uninsured discounts were lower than those experienced during the first quarter of 2012.", "Our cash from operating activities was approximately $188 million during the first quarter of 2013 as compared to $127 million in the first quarter of 2012. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 56 days during the first quarter of 2013.", "As previously disclosed, our accounts receivable days outstanding have been inflated somewhat by an increase in receivables from the state of Illinois. As of March 31, 2013, our accounts receivable include $72 million due from Illinois, the collection of which has been delayed by budgetary and funding pressures experienced by that state. However, thus far, in April 2013, we have received approximately $42 million of cash payments from Illinois, a substantial portion of which applies to the state's outstanding receivables as of March 31, 2013.", "At March 31, 2013, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 56.4%. We spent $96 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter. Included in those capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new acute care hospital in Temecula, California.", "Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions, if I could. First of all, obviously, there's been a lot of discussion about the volumes and the softness of volumes due part -- at least in part to the calendar. I'd love to get your perspective on the extent to which you believe the calendar may have impacted to this quarter? And also, any early read on April where maybe the calendar would swing more favorable?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, A.J. So I think, actually, historically, as a company, we tended not to point to the calendar as explanatory to changes in volumes. But this quarter, it's hard to get away from it. Obviously, we have one less day for leap year and that affects both of our business segments. And then we have Easter occurring in March of this year, and last year, it occurred in April. It's always difficult to sort of frame what the impact is of those sorts of things. But one thing that I think we look to and certainly has caught our attention is that our April volumes in both of our business segments have rebounded fairly measurably. So I think it reinforces the idea that there may have been some shift in business from March into April. Difficult to quantify in any sort of precise way, but certainly that's the feel that we have.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe 2 more things on that. There's some discussion that, especially the Easter shift, had had a pronounced effect on commercial volumes even in the midst of soft volumes, generally. Did you guys see that? And also, we -- I would like to say we don't typically talk about it too much on the behavioral side, but can you comment on how the calendar might have affected the behavioral business specifically? Does it have impact on both the volume and price? Or is it more just volume?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. So from a payor mix perspective, we saw trends, I think, continue in the quarter of declining commercial volume, declining Medicare volume, and more particularly, both managed Medicare and managed Medicaid volume. And yes, that's an unfavorable trend. But to be fair, it's not a trend that's particularly new to this quarter. So if the calendar exacerbated that sum, that's hard to tell. And unlike volumes, which we can see improving or rebounding in April, I cannot really -- I don't have a read on payor mix in April, so I can't really comment on that. As far as the behavioral business goes, I think that, obviously, leap year is just a mathematical sort of calculation and I think, again, it's affects both businesses equally. As far as the holiday goes, I think, historically, those kinds of holiday shifts have had more of an impact on the residential business than the acute behavioral business because kids tend to go home for the holidays, et cetera. And again, we saw -- we definitely saw some weakness in the residential business in the quarter. Absolutely not a new phenomenon, but it certainly could have been exacerbated by the calendar.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just lastly, on your acute care margin trend, that is sort of consistent with what you showed for a while now. Would you attribute that largely to the top line pressure, the volume pressure? Or would you -- I think last time you called out some physician costs. Is that still -- are you still seeing that as well?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. I think that primarily the pressure comes from the fact that our same-store revenue grew by less than 1%. As we've talked about many times, it's difficult to drive any sort of margin improvement or expansion with revenues that are not a little more robust than that. But also, as you suggest, A.J., and as we talked about last quarter and I think folks can see on the other operating expense line, we continue to have some growth in that line that's a result of our increased activity in physician employment and physician acquisition.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just staying on the volume topic. Steve, you usually go through the geographic markets during Q&A so I was hoping you could that, if there's anything sort of worth highlighting, Vegas, Texas, et cetera?", "Steve G. Filton", "Ralph, I mean, actually, from a kind of a gross volume perspective, Vegas had a relatively decent quarter compared to the rest of the portfolio. But one of the phenomena that we saw beyond just kind of a sheer volume weakness or gross volume weakness in the quarter was just a lack of intensity or acuity, surgical weakness. Surgeries were down 5%, both in- and outpatient surgeries approximately. And those phenomena, along with the payor mix dynamics that I talked about with A.J., were clearly present in the Vegas market, and for the most part, present throughout the portfolio.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just going to the behavioral side, can you talk about the margins there? Obviously, a very strong result considering the soft top line. Is that sustainable? Should we be thinking about investments that you need to make ahead of 2014? Or maybe just how do you think about that margin profile as we think ahead?", "Steve G. Filton", "Look, I think we've talked about that, in general, when same-store revenues grow by 2.5%,  it's tough, even in the behavioral segment, to drive margin expansion, so we were particularly pleased by the results in Q1. I think the operators, obviously, are doing a great job there. I think we're still getting some benefit, as we've talked about, in the improvement in the PSI portfolio margins. We said that we would improve those margins during '12 and '13. We think we got a lot of that improvement in '12, but I think there was a little bit more to go. We certainly got some more of it in the first quarter. I don't think we can sustain EBITDA growth at 9% every quarter with only 2.5% revenue growth. But I think it's reflective of the opportunity in that business to continue to expand margins as long as we can continue to grow the top line, and I don't see any reason why we can't.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just my last one. Want to talk about sort of about next year and exchanges. Have you -- I guess, at this point, have you negotiated exchange contracts? If you have, can you give us a sense of what percentage maybe of the book you've maybe negotiated? And any color on kind of the rates that you're getting on the exchange?", "Steve G. Filton", "Our commentary in that regard is really pretty consistent. We've negotiated really a small number of exchange contracts. For the most part, they've been negotiated at our average or maybe slightly below our average commercial rates, but in that neighborhood. But it is -- it remains a small number of contracts. And at least right now, I don't think the pace of those contract negotiations are picking up. So we anticipate, obviously, that will occur later this year. We anticipate that they will occur again at something pretty close to our average commercial rates, but that remains to be seen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just to follow up maybe on Vegas and then maybe some of B.C. in there as well. The BLS data is showing some improvement in the unemployment trends, specifically in those markets. And I'm curious, are you seeing any change in those specific markets around levels of insurance or anything else that would indicate maybe some economic stability?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, Josh, I mean, I think we talked about this a little bit in Q4. I think we saw some improvement in the Vegas market in Q4 consistent, as you suggest, with some of the overarching kind of microeconomic data that has been coming out of that market for the last few quarters. I don't think -- Q1 was clearly weaker in that market, but as we've discussed and as some of our peers have discussed, that weakness seems to be far more pervasive than just a single market here or there. So I don't know how to read the Q1 Vegas performance or how to reconcile that to the improving market data that continues to come out of that market. Our general expectation is market's improving. You get that from the data. I think you get that if you're in the market. You just have a sense that it's picking up. And the expectation's we'll begin to feel that in our business fairly consistently in due time, although I think we've been pretty transparent about the fact that we're not at that point just yet.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right, right. And no discernible change in benefit level, trends or things like that, that have increased co-pays and deductibles?", "Steve G. Filton", "I know there's been a fair amount of conversation after the 2 pre-announcements in phase this quarter that maybe there's been a big pickup in high deductible plans, et cetera. Honestly, I think, as a provider and I assume more peers would say much the same thing, we're not in a great position to have a lot of data to support that. From what I've read, the managed care companies sort of indicate that high deductible plans and the like continue to grow and gain market share but not in a terribly dramatic way. So I don't know that anybody, including us, is really chalking up the first quarter weakness, particularly the late first quarter weakness, to dramatic changes in benefit plan designs.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just last one for me, Steve, just on guidance. Could you help us, what do you have included in your guidance with respect to the fourth quarter around Medicare reimbursement? How are you thinking about IPPS? And then do you have DSH cuts included in there already?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, we definitely have DSH cuts. We discussed that in our fourth quarter call, that we included DSH cuts based on a calculation that our DSH would be negatively impacted by about $50 million annually, so we've got a quarter of that in the fourth quarter of our guidance this year. As far as the IPPS rates, I don't have it right in front of me but my recollection is we were sort of in the flat to up 0.5% range for the IPPS rates beginning in October.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Steve, I'm not sure if you have a great answer for this, but I'll take a stab anyway. Any thoughts on whether or not you guys think that CMS could make a determination on whether it declines to apply the IMD exclusion to the newly eligible Medicaid population? I know it's a tough question.", "Steve G. Filton", "And I'm sorry, Whit, you're asking me like what we think the likelihood of that is?", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes. Well, I mean, I know that CMS is reviewing whether or not they're going to apply the IMD exclusion or not, and I just was kind of curious on your updated thoughts or what you anticipate potentially happening.", "Steve G. Filton", "Right, right. And obviously, as an industry, the behavioral industry, including us, has pressed for that. And we think the IMD exclusion is not really sort of beneficial to the overall population, et cetera, and is just not a great idea and that there would be a lot of macro benefits to be had from it being lifted. We certainly have pressed and lobbied CMS, again, as an industry, to do so. But as with so many other things in terms of what the government will ultimately do, I think it's hard for us to give any sort of realistic projection or guesstimate on how that's going to play out. I think we think it will be decided, however, relatively soon. So we will know one way or the other relatively soon.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Yes, okay. And I guess, even regardless of whether or not it applies to the newly expanded Medicaid population, there should potentially be a fairly large addressable site market with newer enhanced benefits. And do you think that there's an opportunity to accelerate some bed expansion projects to potentially capture some of this volume?", "Steve G. Filton", "So I think there's a few different issues. I mean, there are a number of, I'll call them, sort of regulatory decisions pending that I think stand to at least potentially benefit the behavioral business. The final regulations on the Mental Health Parity Legislation are due out, and our hopes would be that they strengthen those regulations and that they particularly address that -- or note that they are relevant and that they address the residential, as well as the acute business. So that's one area, the IMD exclusion is another area. So I think that our view is that those developments, as well as just reform in general and the newly expanded or newly insured population that will arise as a result of reform, all should potentially create more behavioral demand in existing to -- in addition, quite frankly, to the existing demand that we continue to try and meet. So we're always looking at our behavioral expansion program and seeing if there are ways that we can accelerate it and make it sort of responsive to where that -- we believe that demand either exist today, specifically in focus markets or where we think it will develop. So that's a big focus of our behavioral health management team as we move forward.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just one last final one, if you could spend just a second on capital priorities. Your leverage is now, I think, below 3x now. And just maybe an update on what you're thinking over the balance of this year.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think, again, our commentary here is going to be consistent with what it's been historically and that is we remain relatively agnostic about capital deployment. Meaning, we're anxious to deploy capital wherever we think it's going to earn the greatest return. We just talked about earning those returns in terms of organic expansion within our behavioral business that's clearly an area where we're going to continue to focus. But we also are looking at M&A opportunities in behavioral. We'll continue to look at M&A opportunities in acute. And there's a lot of commentary from our peers that, that pipeline is as active as it's ever been. We've tended to be, I think, a little more judicious than some of our peers about acting on some of those opportunities, but we're absolutely evaluating them. We continue to invest and reinvest in our acute care business. I mentioned in my comments about our Temecula, California hospital, which is opening late in the year. So we're just going to continue to do what we've always done, which is try and deploy capital in the most efficient way to earn the highest returns.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I just want to clarify some comments earlier. I think you said you saw some volume weakness in the acute care side, specifically in the managed Medicaid and Medicare Advantage side. And I guess I just -- if I did hear that correctly, are you implying that you actually saw fewer people walk through the door of the hospital? Or you've just seen sort of a -- like some of your other peers have talked about an increase in observation visits that have sort of put pressure actual inpatient admissions?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I'm sorry, Chris, if I misspoke, I apologize or if I wasn't clear enough. What I talked about when talking about our payor mix dynamics was that we saw less commercial business and less traditional Medicare business and more managed Medicaid and managed Medicare business in the quarter.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then just with regard to Texas, in the Southern Texas market, you've had a couple of the Medicaid HMOs talk about some retroactive payment updates and you're seeing them also talk about pushing some of that along to their provider side, not necessarily hospitals per se. But I guess, are you guys expecting anything beneficial on the Texas Medicaid side, given what the managed care guys are seeing?", "Steve G. Filton", "Hard to say. I would say that I don't think we're necessarily seeing that now. No, I don't think that we've really -- we've seen some pressure on utilization and length of stay as a result of the penetration of managed Medicaid in those South Texas markets, similar to what we've seen when managed Medicaid or Medicare comes to any market. I don't know that it's been a huge needle mover in the market. And if there is to be some relief going the other way, maybe some rate relief, I don't think we've seen it yet, but we're certainly well positioned to take advantage of it if that's going to be the case.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question, just a follow-up on the M&A question a minute ago. I mean, when you think about pricing, particularly on the acute side, do you -- are you guys viewing the Affordable Care Act as a game changer in sort of takeout multiples going forward? Or I guess, I just want to get your sense in terms of where the M&A environment is evolving to given the changes we're going to have next year.", "Steve G. Filton", "It's a complicated question and I don't think there's an easy answer to it. I think that,, as we look at potential acquisition opportunities, and in the same way we look at our own business, we certainly view the Affordable Care Act and the infusion of a newly insured population as generally in that benefit in almost all markets and for most hospitals. But we also acknowledge that there's likely to be continuing rate pressures from government and private payors in the future. And so again, I think we're as much interested in the positioning of a potential acquisition target, where they are in the market, what their market share is, how well they're sort of positioned to integrate with physicians, et cetera. And again, all the same criteria we use to think about our own hospitals as much as we are about sort of the mathematics of reform and rate changes, et cetera. So all those dynamics come into play as we think about potential acquisitions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just have a couple of follow-ups, Steve. On the exchanges, you mentioned not a lot of negotiations necessarily done at this point for yourselves. Are you seeing any other providers be more active? I know you typically have a pretty strong share in your markets. Do you think -- will those with less share are maybe offering narrow -- lower prices to get into narrower networks? Or do you any other dynamics going on more broadly in your markets that are of interest?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, Tom. I don't think that the lack of activity on our part is in any way unique or an indication of we're sort of lagging the activity in our markets. I think it's a reflection that the payors have been, I think, slow to move. And my sense is that a number of the payors, and maybe particularly some of the larger payors, are being very deliberate about making their decisions on what they're doing. And I think, to some degree, that's why this process is developing a little slower than people expected that it might. But no, it's not a question of we're not negotiating any rates but we're standing by as we see more competitors doing so. That's not the case.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then maybe just taking on the pricing side, just want to make sure you give us an update on your broader commercial negotiations and if there's any changes there, either in terms of rates or type of contracts, pushing more risk towards your way or anything like that.", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I think from a rate perspective, rates continue to be comfortably in that 5% to 7% range that we've talked -- rate increases that we've talked about for some time. And in terms of new and differing kinds of contracting with significantly narrower networks or risk taking, et cetera, while I think that's a subject of conversation in a lot of markets, the actual on-the-ground presence of those kinds of new arrangements is really very limited.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just shifting to behavioral real quick. Length of stay, obviously, it's been under pressure. I think you've commented in the past that you might have thought from a clinical perspective it would've bottomed already. Is there any signs of bottoming at this stage? Or it's just sort of more of the same?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think it's the latter. It's more of the same. I mean, I think, and I probably should have been clear about making this point before, I mean, we've talked before about the fact that as the pressure, particularly on length of stay, continues in the residential segment of the business, we continue where appropriate, to convert beds to acute behavioral, to shift beds to acute behavioral. And again, I think that's part of the margin growth explanation even in a relatively muted revenue environment as we're shifting more business to the higher margin segment of the 2, from residential behavioral to acute behavioral. And frankly,  I think we'll continue to do that because, again, as you suggest, we're not really seeing those dynamics change in the residential business. I mean, we saw length of stay decline again in the residential business in Q1 whereas length of stay in the acute behavioral business remained pretty stable.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "All right. Okay. And then last one. I know it's a smaller deal, but you've got your hands dirty a little bit there on Ascend. Any color that you could offer?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think for the most part, the Ascend acquisition is proceeding the way that we would have expected. There's always pluses and minuses in individual facilities. But again, we're very enthusiastic about that deal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Ryan K. Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Ryan on for Gary. I guess, going back to the acute care volumes, I was wondering if you are specifically seeing a reversal in the trends away from observation stay in the quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think observation visits increased year-over-year for us, although sequentially it certainly seems to indicate, at least again for us, that we're starting to see that activity level out some.", "Ryan K. Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then moving on to the behavioral. Obviously, you've given a lot of color on the margin benefit and -- but I guess, has Ascend -- or did you see any margin benefit from the Ascend deal this quarter? And should we expect it to sort of ramp similar to the PSI deal?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I think we've been clear that the Ascend margins, quite frankly, were already higher than ours, in large part because that was a business that was almost exclusively acute behavioral rather -- and didn't really have much of a residential component. And that we really thought that the improvement opportunity on the Ascend side was to increase capacity over time in facilities that were already running pretty high occupancy rates. So again, obviously, the Ascend numbers don't affect our same-store comparisons. But in terms of goosing our overall margins a little bit, they do that, although again it's a pretty small piece of business, so the moving of the needle is relatively minor.", "Ryan K. Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then as far as the regulatory, I guess, factors that you listed that could impact 2014 and behavioral, I was just curious how you guys are thinking about some of the alternatives that the states are considering for Medicaid expansion. Is that something you guys are paying attention to in potentially impacting your behavioral business?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure. I mean, I think, in general, we welcome any sort of insurance expansion. Generally, we're able to treat patients profitably that have some sort of insurance, whether it's government or private insurance. So these kind of negotiations between the states and the Feds and these nuances of exactly how insurance expansion is going to take place, we're certainly watching with interest, but at the end of the day, just generally have the sense that any insurance expansion that takes place is going to be beneficial to us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just wanted to go to the guidance. I guess, since I don't remember you actually specifically talking about it, that means that you're reaffirming it, but the -- just in particular some of the components with a weak start to the same-store revenue growth on both the acute and the behavioral side. Do you still feel good about that 2.5% to 3% top line growth and -- on acute and, I guess, 4% to 5% on behavioral? Or do you  think that, that number may come in lower but there's cost items that kind of leave you comfortable with the EPS range?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Kevin. So I think taking sort of the 2 business segments differently as we discussed in our guidance, our guidance is premised on acute care revenue growth in the 2.5%, 3% range for the year. We obviously fell short of that in Q1. Again, I think our general sense is that the latter half of Q1 was particularly weak. We attribute a lot of that to the calendar. Like I said, some of the rebound in April reinforces that notion for us. So I think we view that latter Q1 performance as largely an anomaly, so in our minds, there's no real change to our initial guidance and I don't fail to see. Otherwise, that will be the case. On the behavioral side, I think as we discussed in our end-of-the-year call, I think you're right. We were expecting review growth in the 4%, 4.5% range. Look, I think the Q1 performance is an indicator that on the behavioral side, we have some flexibility that even if we don't get there at the top line, we have an opportunity to get there from the EBITDA perspective and just gives us more reason to be comfortable with our initial guidance on the behavioral side.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. All right. That makes sense. Can you just also talk about the charity care number in the quarter? Was there a change in the charity care policy that kind of shifted the numbers between charity care and bad debt in the quarter? And is there a reason for that?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don't think an actual change in policy, Kevin, but I will say from a practical application perspective, we certainly got a bit more aggressive about qualifying people for charity care. Meaning, I think less people qualify for charity care and more people went through the actual collection process in the hopes that, in the end, we would collect and net a little bit more incrementally. Now at the end of the day, it creates this fairly significant cosmetic shift because to the degree that we don't collect, more of that is reflected as bad debt than is reflected as charity care. But in the end, the overall uncompensated care totals didn't change dramatically and largely came in as we -- where we expect it and so I don't think it was a significant bottom line issue in the quarter.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then actually just going back to guidance for a second. Oftentimes, there's a delta between where consensus is and maybe where you guys are internally. Do you guys view Q1 as an in-line quarter versus your own plan?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think that the overall results for the quarter were in line with our own expectations, although they broke out, as I'm sure they did in most people's models, with better-than-expected behavioral performance and slightly lower than expectations on the acute side.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, makes sense. And then lastly, any update on the subpoena that you guys announced last quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "No. For the most part, as you might expect, it was a broad subpoena, so we're in the process of gathering the documents that have been requested, which is a fairly significant effort in and of itself. That will continue for some time and then I suspect it will take the government some time to sort through it. So my guess is that there may be no update on this for a while, but certainly not for this quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a few things left here. I want to just go back to the volume question, Steve, wondering if you have a read it all on ER visits in the quarter. Just curious how that trended for you and whether just less traffic there also was a contributor.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, ER visits we're relatively flat compared to the prior year quarter, which, again, I think was fairly consistent with our adjusted admission activity. The 2 of those usually mirror each other pretty closely. So it was sort of consistent with a more muted activity. We've seen ER visits growing by more than that in the previous quarters to this.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, a couple broader topics. One is just health care, IT implementation and just wondering how that's progressing. Sometimes, big projects like that can take on their own lives. I'm just curious how that's going for you guys.", "Steve G. Filton", "We began the actual implementation of our EHR system into our hospitals after the design phase in the middle of 2011, right around July of 2011. And the plan that we had at the time was to have all 25 of our acute care facilities converted by July of 2013, basically a 24-month run rate. And I know we're only a few months away from that, and we believe we're going to meet it from a timing perspective. And to the credit of a bunch of our internal personnel, that process has gone really without any sort of major disruption, which is quite an accomplishment so we're very pleased with the way that's gone. And you don't see me, but I'm knocking on wood to just to ensure that we finish up in the same fashion.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's great. So I guess all the -- the D&A guidance that's built in EPS will stand then in terms of you starting to depreciate all that?", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean, D&A will ramp up as the year goes on, as more and more facilities come live on EHR. And then obviously, in Q4, it will ramp up again when we open our Temecula facility.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then I guess just -- I don't know if Alan is still in the room but just wanted to get some comments. Sometimes you give us some commentary on just physician employment activity and alignment activity. I know that alignment strategy has been a big focus for you guys in many of your markets. How do you see that playing out? And how are some of those trends impacting your acute business?", "Alan B. Miller", "We are -- we're moving into that cautiously, and it's important that we position ourselves to build networks. And as the transition in the industry goes forward, we're going to be in a position to do very well with it. So we are -- we have put together a group that is buying up physician practices on a selective basis and managing them. And we are, I think, very well positioned to do networking and to be in a position to go after contracts as the exchanges come about, et cetera. But the business is in transition, as you well know.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And do you -- Alan, do you see yourselves taking on any risk? Just wondering if you're organizing yourself any differently to basically take some of the risk-based contracts or if that's just further down the road for you guys.", "Alan B. Miller", "It's down the road. There's an actuarial aspect to that. We're not in that business. But again, depending on how the networks shape up and who our potential partners might be, we'll consider anything along those lines.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to go back to this -- the charity care issue and the charity care policy. Was there any particular markets where they kind of precipitated the need for that? Or did you notice any kind of different pattern in those markets to result in this more aggressive attempt at collections?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, Frank, I think it was kind of an overall observation that maybe we -- that the pendulum had swung a little too far in terms of putting folks in the charity care designation when in fact there may have been an opportunity to collect at least some of their portion of the bill. But no, I don't think it was driven by a particular market. And like I said, I mean, I realize it has sort of a significant cosmetic impact on the income statement. I think, at the end of the day, while it was the right thing to do operationally, it's not going to have a huge -- make a huge difference to our results.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Just one other random one here. You mentioned on your early contracting with exchanges, without saying any names, could you characterize the kind of parties you're contracting with now? Is it Blue Cross'? Or was there -- how would you characterize those contracts that you have negotiated? And I'll hop off.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, the only thing I would say, Frank, is I think they tend to be some of the smaller contracts we have, so -- in none of the cases that the negotiated among our really large and significant contracts. Other than that, I'm not sure there's anything -- any sort of common theme to be drawn.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Campbell with Avondale Partners.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Really just have one here. I was just hoping maybe you guys could describe a little bit the systems you have in place to sort of flex costs to handle volumes. Clearly, volumes continue to be sort of a challenge. Some have done a better job than others, apparently, this quarter, of flexing those costs down. So I was just hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about what you guys do specifically to adjust to off changes in volumes in your markets?", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean, honestly, Kevin, I think we probably -- when I talk about we, I mean, our -- the for-profit industry tends to approach this in much the same way. We have some fairly sophisticated electronic systems for tracking and trying to match staffing levels to volumes literally on a shift by shift basis. The challenge for the industry, I think, in general for hospitals in general is that there's a significant amount of your staffing that is fixed and semi-fixed and is very difficult to adjust to in short increments and to quick changes in volumes. And that's the real challenge. But I think, much like our peers, we certainly try and adjust the volumes in as real a time as possible.", "Kevin Campbell - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division", "What about your utilization of sort of contract nurses? Do you have a particularly -- any difference as you think versus peers, you use less of them?", "Steve G. Filton", "I'm sure we all have the same goal, which is to use as little outside agency nurses as possible just because I think, from a quality perspective and a cost perspective, it is preferable to not do so. But there certainly is a proper use for temporary nurses, when they truly are temporary. And it varies by market. There are markets where it is definitely more of a challenge to hire nurses than others. And again, we're very focused on that and trying to work through it as best as possible.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Gary Taylor with Citigroup.", "Gary P. Taylor - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just one question. Steve, is there any update on your Medicaid DSH in Texas coming through that reorganization of the UPL program into the uncompensated care pool and the regional health partner pool? Is there any piece of your 2013 guidance that's predicated on UPL funding that's not yet finalized? Or is that all in place?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I think that all of our UPL revenue that we have in our guidance is based on established plans. Now I think as we disclosed in our 10-K, some of them are dependent on intergovernmental transfers that have to take place and contributions that have to be made by third parties. We expect that they will be made, but I think we disclosed that conditionality in our 10-K. But I think all the plans have been approved.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A few questions here. First, Steve, you mentioned a measurable bounce back in volumes. I'm just curious if you can help us delineate -- is that measurable in your mind even beyond what we know as the calendar benefit you're going to get in April from the Easter passover shift?", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean, the way I think about it, Justin, is it just strikes me, and obviously we still have a few days to go in April, is that when we combine the March April volumes, that they will look sort of more normalized than either month on its own will have looked. And I think that was the challenge in Q1, is that March looked a lot weaker than any of us would have expected and that seems to have been an industry-wide issue, not just a UHS issue. I don't know how the other companies feel but I think we feel like when we look at April and March combined, again just from a volume perspective and just from a gross volume perspective, not talking about ER visits or surgical activity but just adjusted admissions, it's going to look more normal when the months are combined.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And March was down materially and so to get up -- to up slightly, which we kind of think of as normal, April is up fairly materially, is that right?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And beyond that, you mentioned the benefits of psych parity. So beyond more people getting new coverage in terms of the uninsured, obviously, we're going to see some better benefits within the existing individual and small group market. Can you -- is there anything you could do to try to help us quantify the potential impacts there just in terms of are there big copays and deductibles or are -- people are -- patients having to leave earlier than they typically would like to because they only have 10 days of coverage instead of 30-type of thing? Anything you can help us with there?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think it's difficult to do. I mean, there have been a number of pieces put out, some by analysts, some by the industry itself. I think that talk about tens of millions of people who either will have new coverage altogether or expanded coverage as a result of some of the dynamics that we're talking about. I think it's extremely difficult for us to take that sort of macro data and convert it to -- in any way to a precise opportunity for us. But I think the observation that we would have, and I think others have had as well, is that it's a fairly significant opportunity and one that, obviously, we're tracking very closely and will respond to as it arises. And we think about capacity expansion in all those other dynamics.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Then lastly, I just wanted to go back a couple of years in, I think, 2011. You had some really material hospital projects go online in terms of expansions. It's clear the business overall has been tough from there, but just wanted to get an update in terms of how those expansions have looked versus expectations and maybe even what kind of EBITDA you're generating from them versus, if I remember correctly, it was $400 million to $500 million of CapEx you spent on those 3 projects.", "Steve G. Filton", "So the 3 projects you're referring to are replacement hospitals that we built in Texoma, which is north of Dallas and Palmdale, which is north of L.A., and then the large patient tower addition that we did at our Summerlin facility in Las Vegas. I think as we've discussed over the period, the challenge has been, I think particularly in the California and Las Vegas markets, that we opened that capacity in the teeth of pretty significant recessionary challenges. And I think, in our minds, what that did was it extended the ramp-up period that we would have otherwise anticipated. And I think that's still the case. I mean, for sure, we don't feel like we're getting the full benefit of the Summerlin and Palmdale projects yet. I think we continue to feel that we ultimately will but not -- we're not quite there yet. On the Texoma side, I think -- which was a market that was less hurt by the recession, I think we really have benefited already and are earning pretty reasonable returns on that project already.", "Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. Does that change your thoughts on capital deployment on the hospital side going forward in terms of increasing the hurdle rate for new projects or anything? Or you really just feel that this is a macro issue and it'll sort itself out?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I mean, obviously, if we had had perfect foresight, I'm not sure that we would have timed these projects to open in 2010 in 2 areas that were really hurt by the recession. But when the projects had begun 2 or 3 years earlier, obviously, we didn't have that perfect amount of foresight. So no, I mean, again, when we undertake projects like that, we do so because they make sense in the marketplace because the demand is there, because we think that the long-term positioning is correct. We're not really making short-term bets on the local economy or anything like that. So again, with perfect hindsight, we may have timed them differently but that's about it.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time from the phone lines. Are there any closing remarks?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, we'd just like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter.

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2013.", "We'd like to highlight a few developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, during the third quarter of 2013, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS of $1.15 per diluted share. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $1.10 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2013, as compared to $0.91 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.", "As discussed in last night's release, included in the adjusted net income attributable to UHS during the third quarter of 2013 is $0.10 per diluted share, resulting from additional revenues recorded in the quarter that are applicable to the period of October 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, earned in connection with the Texas Medicaid disproportionate share and uncompensated care programs.", "On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.4% during the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 5.8%, and adjusted patient days increased 1.5% during the third quarter of 2013 as compared to last year's comparable quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 1.9% during the third quarter of 2013 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% during the third quarter of 2013 as compared to 27.9% during the third quarter of 2012. On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, excluding the impact of approximately $16 million of the additional revenues earned in connection with the Texas Medicaid disproportionate share and uncompensated care programs covering the period of October 2012 through June of 2013, revenues increased 6.6% during the third quarter of 2013 as compared to the third quarter of 2012. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 2.9% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 12.8% during the third quarter of 2013 from 13.4% during the third quarter of 2012.", "Our acute care hospitals provided charity care and uninsured discounts based on charges at established rates, amounting to approximately $276 million and $259 million during the 3-month periods ended September 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and approximately $766 million and $840 million during the 9-month period ended September 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively.", "In addition to provision for doubtful accounts at our acute care hospitals increased to approximately $291 million during the third quarter of 2013 as compared to approximately $167 million during the third quarter of 2012, and increased to approximately $725 million during the first 9 months of 2013, as compared to approximately $456 million during the comparable period of 2012. As a percentage of acute care net revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, charity care and the uninsured discount in this year's third quarter we're at levels higher than those experienced during the third quarter of 2012.", "Our cash from operating activities increased by approximately 15% to $186 million during the third quarter of 2013, as compared to $162 million in the third quarter of 2012. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, our cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately 11% to $592 million over the $535 million generated during the comparable 9-month period of 2012.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 59 days during the third quarter of 2013 as compared to 57 days during the third quarter of 2012. At September 30, 2013, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization was 52.9%.", "We spent approximately $104 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2013. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the recently opened 140-bed Temecula Valley Hospital, a newly constructed acute care facility located in Temecula, California. Late last week, we completed an amendment to our $275 million accounts receivable securitization program, which extended the maturity date of this program for 3 years to October of 2016.", "This year, 48 UHS hospitals, that's 43 behavioral health and 5 acute care, were recognized by the Joint Commission as Top Quality Performers. This acknowledgment publicly demonstrates the long-standing commitment of UHS to provide care to our patients that is based upon evidence-based practice to ensure positive outcomes. Several sets of quality indicators are measured and compared across the entire population of accredited hospitals. In 2012, 32 UHS hospitals were recognized. This year's achievement recognizes that these facilities have sustained excellent quality performance for the past several years.", "Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Was just hoping you can provide some additional color on the bad debts? And what, if anything -- or what additional color you might be able to provide with regard to the increase, both sequentially and year-to-year?", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure, Chris. So as we, I think, talked about in the middle of last year, we changed our charity care policy across the division, frankly, to make it a little more difficult to qualify for charity care. And we suggested at that time that the cosmetic result of that on our income statement would be the shift on compensated dollars from charity care to bad debt. And in fact, I think that's what you're seeing occur in the significant increase in bad debt and the reduction in charity care in 2013. As noted in my prepared remarks, I mean, the total amount of the items that we consider to be uncompensated care has remained relatively stable. And, again, I think it's largely, in our minds, a cosmetic change.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. But, I guess, that makes sense year-over-year. But relative to the second quarter, it does look like it crept up a little bit. There's nothing notable to isolate there?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don't think so. I mean, obviously, if you look at -- after you adjust for charity care or uncompensated care, our net revenue metrics were quite strong in the quarter in the acute division. So it doesn't seem to be having -- doesn't seem to be any underlying or substantive change in our payor mix.", "Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then just change gears quickly here. In Temecula, can you give us a sense for the operating expenses, how much expenses in there were related to Temecula without any corresponding revenue in the quarter? And I'll leave it at that.", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure. So just provide a little bit of context and to remind people, in our original guidance for 2013, we included $15 million or $16 million, both preopening start-up costs as well as opening start-up losses for the Temecula facility. And we indicated that those would occur in quarter 3 and quarter 4. We incurred something like $6 million or $7 million of start-up costs in quarter 3 across all of our operating costs. And we think we're on track, generally, to incur the sorts of losses that we included in our original guidance with the fourth quarter opening of the hospital.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just maybe -- mentioned, obviously, with the nice pickup in volume on the acute care side you had. Did you end up running -- having to make any short-term adjustments that would have maybe mitigated some of that flowing through to the bottom line, the way you dealt with the nurses, et cetera?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think that's correct, A.J. And the fact is, because volumes picked up as quickly as they did in Q3, I think as we went through the detailed results, we found that there is probably $4 million or $5 million of what I would sort of describe as inefficient salary expense. In this case, meaning, higher uses of registry and over time, as we responded quickly to the increase in volumes. And I think the good news from our perspective is that those increases should be fixed in relatively short order and return to much -- kind of a more normalized salary and staffing pattern. And so we would expect that issue to largely be resolved in Q4 and going forward.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And I might switch gears and ask you about this behavioral business. Obviously, there's been some discussion about bumping up against capacity constraints in various markets. Are we at a point now where you would actually look at even a de novo facility, and do you have any of those on the drawing board that are worth highlighting?", "Steve G. Filton", "The easy answer to the question is yes. I mean, we have opened de novo facilities in the last few years. We opened de novo facilities in Arkansas and in Illinois and in Texas, all in the last few years. We have a couple -- another 1 or 2 that are absolutely on the drawing board. So I think our view of capacity expansion as we move forward is that it includes both expanded beds at existing facilities, as well as de novo projects.", "Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, and maybe last question. On the pressure on the length of stay in the RTC segment, which continued this quarter. I mean, we don't have a lot of competitors any more to look at, to benchmark you against, but it does seem like the other public company doesn't -- isn't seeing exactly the same, at least they're saying they're not. And is there anything about particular programs you have or particular geographies that would make the facilities a little more susceptible to that length-of-stay pressure? And then I know it's a hard call, but do we see any signs of that starting to ease up a little bit?", "Steve G. Filton", "No. I mean, as you know, we've been discussing this pressure on length of stay for some time. And I think in response to previous questions, we've always talked about the fact that, although it was relatively isolated to our residential business, that within the residential business, it was fairly widespread, that this was not just a phenomena at a small handful of facilities. And so, again, it's been a pervasive kind of phenomena for several years. Why another company or other hospitals might not be experiencing it is really a question that's difficult for me to answer. And as far as sort of indications of a turn, while I know lots of people have heard me say for a long time, and I certainly can see that I'm the main proponent of this, that there seems to be a natural trough to this length-of-stay issue. To be fair about it, we have not yet seen it yet -- we haven't seen it yet. And I don't know that we've really seen any leading indicators of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin of Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just first question. Just simply on the admits number, not adjusted admissions, but actual admits in the quarter, same-store basis on the acute care side were, obviously, very strong. And I'm just curious any color on that, and whether that's geographically focused, or any other sort of things that you could point out there?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I think from an admissions perspective, by far, the greatest strength in admissions in the quarter was in Las Vegas, which is kind of an interesting turn from the second quarter. In Q2, much of the strength in Vegas was from a payor mix perspective, as opposed to volumes. And now in Q3, volumes were stronger. But I will make the point that I think the overall revenue strength in the acute portfolio was fairly widespread, which I think means that while volumes were strongest in the Vegas market, the payor mix and therefore, the pricing metrics, were stronger throughout the rest of the portfolio as well.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. But, no specific types of admits or delays or anything that you can -- it sounds like it's generally picking up in Vegas was the big driver, is that fair?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that's a fair characterization, Josh.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then Temecula, just a quick follow-up on that. I think I got the answer in the last question. It sounds like you're on pace for sort of a $9-million EBITDA hit in 4Q. I'm just curious, expectations for EBITDA breakeven at Temecula. When do you think that happens?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think we've said before that our general expectation is that Temecula itself would likely get to breakeven for the full year of 2014. And progressively, I think what that implies is that we'll have some losses in the beginning of '14. And then that should turn around by the end of the year. The more difficult call for us, quite frankly, is how Temecula affects the other hospitals in its Riverside County market. It's been a while since we had an opening like this, that is an opening in a market where we had existing hospitals. But when we opened Centennial Hills in Las Vegas, it, clearly, in the early, I would say, first 12, 18 months, cannibalized our own hospitals a lot more than it took market share away from other hospitals in the market. And I think, to some degree, we're expecting some of that same dynamic in Temecula. But after that, Centennial really started to take market share from its competitors and really came into its own. And again, I think, we'd expect that same sort of phenomena in Temecula. So a little bit of an unknown as to when we say we expect Temecula to break even, what the impact on the rest of the market is, but we're certainly very upbeat about the long-term prospects of the hospital.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So it's possible that Riverside, overall, in '14 may not be breakeven in light of the impact on -- the cannibalization on other facilities, but Temecula itself would be breakeven, if that's...", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, incrementally breakeven. Certainly, the other hospitals are already profitable, and we wouldn't expect them to decline in that sort of material way to make them breakeven. But, yes, incrementally breakeven for the market, maybe a bit more of a hurdle.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then just last question, Steve, on the guidance coming up. Midpoint's about $0.12 or $0.13. I'm curious how much -- was that mostly Texas? Was any of the Texas DSH -- I think, the whole amount was $0.13. Was any of that expected? I know only $0.10 was out of period, but was any of the $0.13 expected, or is that the boost in guidance? And, I guess, just a little surprise based on the strength of the actual quarter and the final IPPS rule came in a little bit better, et cetera?", "Steve G. Filton", "So I think that, basically, the raise in guidance was largely, in our own minds, a mechanical exercise to reflect the Texas DSH and UPL amounts or uncompensated care amounts that were, in fact, not expected and not included in the original guidance, as well as the adjustment for -- we had originally included in our original guidance the Medicare DSH cuts that were embedded in the ACA that have since largely been eliminated. The reason why the guidance raise is a little bit less than those 2 items together is that I think that through the 9 months, our results for the 9 months are probably a few pennies shy of our own internal expectations, so that we're reflecting that in the guidance change as well.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, got you. So there were some modest headwinds that offset those 2 positives?", "Steve G. Filton", "Correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci with FBR.", "Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Maybe just following up on that last point that you made, Steve. In terms of maybe a few pennies weaker than you were looking for, are there any particular areas that you can point to that have been a little bit different than what you were initially expecting?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I think probably, in the broadest sense, we've already touched on those. I think that our behavioral revenues have grown by -- pretty steadily at around this 3.5% mark for the year. And I think our own expectations were for slightly stronger behavioral growth. And as it get largely -- really gets down to this length-of-stay issue that we've discussed quite a bit before. And on the acute side, struggling a little bit -- I mean, we're very pleased with the way revenues have rebounded, but struggled a little bit with getting those margins up as quickly as we might have hoped to get them up, given the revenue increase. So I think those are the 2 phenomena. Obviously, on the acute side, as we mentioned, I think, we feel like those are fixable sorts of items that turn around pretty quickly. And on the behavioral side, while we think there's a natural trough in this length of stay, we're still finding it difficult to predict when we hit it.", "Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Right. Two cost items, I think, that you called out in the past, just want to make sure we've got the right numbers for this quarter. On the acute care side, sort of physician costs, I think, have been a drag. Just curious where are those this quarter. And on the behavioral side, you've had continued legal costs, so just want to make sure we call those out, too.", "Steve G. Filton", "Sure. So on the on the behavioral side, the legal costs associated with the investigation were about $2 million for the quarter, which is compared to, I think, about $4 million for last quarter. And then on the acute side, the drag from the incremental increase in our physician-owned, physician-acquired, physician subsidies is probably $3 million or $4 million in the quarter, which again, I think, is a sequential step-down from the last quarter, but still a little bit of a drag.", "Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. Last question, just a big picture, sort of on the M&A front. See a fair amount of activity out there, just curious what your perspective is at this stage of the game, particularly on the acute care side.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think we -- as we we've said, I think, pretty consistently, we remain very interested in any strong and attractive, compelling acquisition opportunities and investigating those. I think our sense is, at the moment, the market's taking a bit of a pause as we sort of make our way to the other side of health reform, and it seems like that is consuming most hospitals' attention. But our expectation is that at some point next year, the pace of activity is likely to pick up again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "A few things left here in my questions. The length-of-stay topic, obviously, has been prominent with you guys over the last several quarters. I guess, one thing I just wanted to ask is I think a lot of the focus has been on the residential side, Steve, in terms of how you've described this issue. But on the acute side, is there anything that we might see in the final parity regs that might help you out a little bit with managed care payors in terms of how length of stay is managed. I'm just wondering if that's part of the issue as you see it here.", "Steve G. Filton", "I mean, I think in many respects, Darren, that the parity -- the preliminary parity regulations kind of already addressed the issue and basically say that insurance plans can't really manage utilization in the behavioral space differently than they measure in the Med/Surg space. We certainly try and reinforce that point with payors. It can be kind of a nuanced issue at times, but I think we think that sort of protection is already there. Certainly, I think we've seen small pockets of pressure on length of stay on the acute behavioral side of the business, where a particular state has, let's say, moved to -- from a traditional Medicaid program to a managed Medicaid program. But I think those -- again, those instances are fairly isolated. And the really broad impact on length-of-stay pressure has continued to be in the residential business, and by definition, in the Medicaid side of the business.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just as it relates to your share count. You've been a little bit more quiet on the buyback front. I think your share count has crept up about 2% year-over-year, I guess, from options. But can you help us think about how you're looking at buyback versus other options that you have with capital deployment, particularly as it relates to just managing share count at a minimum.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that -- sort of like what I alluded to before as kind of a broader industry kind of trend, I mean, I think we're very much focused on operating our business as efficiently as we can and preparing for kind of a post-reform landscape. And I think when we get to sometime well into next year, the middle -- the second or third quarter of next year, I think at that point, it would be more prudent of us to sort of sit back and see what the M&A landscape -- it looks like, what other uses for our cash flow there might be, and whether at that point we want to become more serious about returning capital to shareholders. I think between now and then, we're mostly sort of keeping our head down sort of literally and figuratively, trying to run the business as efficiently as we can, happy to generate a lot of cash, which we've been doing, and pay down debt in the interim.", "Darren P. Lehrich - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Makes sense. Last thing here is just wanted to maybe get a little bit more visibility, if we could, on HITECH, and how you're thinking about how that comes through in Q4 and then for 2014. Any broadbrush comments on what you think your net benefit might look like? I know it's not in your guidance, but it's certainly a source of cash flow for you, as we've seen this quarter.", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes. So from a 2013 perspective, while you're correct we don't include it in our guidance per se, we did estimate that the impact of EHR would be a positive $0.13 or so in 2013. And I think we are -- feel like we're largely on track to get within shouting distance of that number, one direction or another, which means that the fourth quarter should be a fairly significant positive, mostly because a lot of the revenue recognition occurs in Q4. As we move beyond that, and again, I think we've set the stage for this previously, we have said that the ultimate impact of our EHR process is a net investment in the neighborhood of $50 million or $60 million. So ultimately, it would be a net cost to us. Again, the way our accounting works and require that it works is that we're recognizing the revenues and the cash tending to be upfront, but we will recognize the expenses more ratably as we depreciate those costs over a 5- or 6-year period, as we bring these hospitals live. So beginning in 2014 the EHR impact will turn negative. When we give our 2014 guidance, we'll be more specific about the magnitude of that number. But from here on out, it becomes negative. I will make the point that from a cash flow perspective, I think it's only positive from here on out, because we've spent virtually all of our -- or made all of our EHR investment already, so that the expenses that are being recognized from here on out is just depreciation of already expended amounts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc.", "Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "With some of the details out now on the exchanges and the health plans, how do you feel with UHS' contracting strategy?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think that we're fairly confident that we have exchange contracts with most of the payors in our market. In some markets, there's a little bit of alignment with certain payors with certain hospitals, et cetera. But I think we feel reasonably well positioned from a contracting perspective in our markets. I think this is going to be a more meaningful question, both asked and answered, months from now, when we have a better sense of how -- what enrollment looks like in those markets, and who's got the bulk of enrollment, et cetera. But I think, right now, we're very comfortable with our positioning in the vast majority of our markets.", "Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And have you guys done any more quantitative work on what the potential benefits from the expansion of coverage might be on the behavioral health side of the business?", "Steve G. Filton", "Not really. I mean, honestly, it's difficult to do. We've certainly done what I would sort of call scenario work, in which we go through the exercise of saying, \"If enrollment increases by this, and if there's x amount of admissions per thousand as a result of that, these would be the impacts.\" But I think it's still very early and really too premature for us to say with any level of confidence what the actual beneficial impact of these newly insureds are going to be, and how much more behavioral admissions will result from that increase in insurance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Steve, can you just give us the payor mix percentages, actually, in the quarter and maybe versus last year? And then do you have the uninsured volume growth and what percentage of admissions that represents?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, what I would say, Ralph, is I think the most significant change this quarter is, really, for the first time in a number of years, we saw an increase, and albeit a slight one, in both managed care and Medicare volumes. And, really, those have been on the decline for several years. So I think that gets -- winds up getting reflected in the strong pricing and the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Uninsured admissions were relatively flattish as well. So I mean, it was a quarter in which most of our payor classes were sort of flattish in terms of utilization. But quite, frankly, that's the best utilization we've had in a long time. And it obviously got reflected in our revenue growth numbers.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you talk about initiatives or strategies you have in place or will put in place to get more people enrolled in the exchanges or Medicaid heading into 2014? And, also, if you can give us a sense of what percentage of success you currently have in getting Medicaid eligibles signed up.", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, I think it's worth noting that the process of enrolling eligible patients as they present themselves in our hospitals and Medicaid is nothing new for us, or I would think for most hospitals, and something we've been doing for a long time. And, quite frankly, in some markets we have a whole sort of infrastructure created to do that. And in large part, the Medicaid expansion just allows us to continue a process that we're very capable of doing and are very accustomed to doing, and we'll continue to do that. Obviously, the introduction of the exchanges is certainly a new nuance that we haven't dealt with before in this very specific way. And we've trained people for that, we've educated people, we've got people certified as counselors, et cetera. Right now, like everybody else in the world, we're sort of subject to the government ironing out the kinks in their systems before what we're prepared to do, I think, will have a real measurable impact. So even some of the things that we've thought about doing more proactively, reaching out to patients through mailers and other means, I think we're, for the most part -- and I think, most of our peers are -- have suggested the same thing. I mean, we're really delaying and deferring those sorts of activities until it seems like the system is prepared for those people in a more efficient way than it currently seems to be.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Fair enough. And then just my last one. Can you talk about the 2-Midnight Rule? Any concerns there? Do you think it will impact you in any way? And just maybe general thoughts on the rule itself.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think as -- again, as I understand, at least some of our peers have commented on it. We have some concerns to the degree that what the 2-Midnight Rule suggests is that if that a patient is in for 2 midnights, then that's likely to be a legitimate admission. But by the converse being that if they're there for less than 2 midnights, then that's not a legitimate admission. Now I don't know that CMS has really confirmed that that's their view. So I think, like other providers, we're anxious to get as much clarification and as much specificity from CMS as we can. And until then, we're going to follow this issue very closely. I think until there is more specificity forthcoming from CMS, it's difficult for us to say what the impact is likely to be. I think we'll have a better sense of that early in 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Zimmerman, Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Looking at your acute side of the business, can you make some general comments on what you're seeing in terms of trends on specific business lines, like surgeries, emergency department visits, any trends you saw this quarter?,", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, I think surgeries, clearly, also along with payor mix, took a bit of an uptick this quarter. Again, everything is relative. So I think our surgical volumes, both in and outpatient, were up this quarter, albeit slightly. But I think that's the first time they've both been up in a number of quarters. And again, I think that the strength in surgical activity is another dynamic that's reflected in that overall strong revenue growth. ER admissions -- or ER visits tend to track admissions pretty closely. And, obviously, ER visits, I think, ticked up with the increase in admissions. Or I would almost sort of suggest it goes the other way, that admissions tick up as ER activity ticks up.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I appreciate your comments on Vegas and the admission trends you're seeing there. What about Texas? And any update you can provide on trends you're seeing in the Texas market?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, it's worth noting, first of all, that we're in a number of significant markets in Texas.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, McAllen is the one I'm thinking.", "Steve G. Filton", "The McAllen has been a market that I think was sort of slow to be impacted by the economic downturn, and conversely, has been slow to recover, and I think remains that way. So we're seeing strength in the acute care portfolio. I don't think McAllen is really driving that much.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then my final question is just a follow-up. How many of your hospitals are now meaningful-use compliant that you've attested for?", "Steve G. Filton", "All of them are compliant from a Phase I perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up on Las Vegas, because just looking at the minority interest line, it looks like the overall results of Vegas maybe weren't as strong. You mentioned that the volumes were good. Was there a cost offset that was flowing through there? Is there something skewing the minority interest line? How do we think about the profitability of Vegas during the quarter?", "Steve G. Filton", "Well, what I did say before, Kevin, was that in Q2, what really drove the bottom line Vegas performance was an improvement in payor mix. And what I suggested before was that even though volumes improved in Q3 in Vegas, payor mix actually deteriorated from the second quarter. And I think probably more than anything else, that drives what I think is kind of an overarching sort of dynamic in the acute division in Q3, which was stronger revenue performance, which didn't necessarily translate dollar-for-dollar to the EBITDA line. And I think in Vegas, the main explanation for that is payor mix, whereas, I think for the rest of the portfolio, there were more -- tended to be more operating cost explanations.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Because, I guess, I'm having a little bit of difficulty reconciling the comment you made earlier. I think it was Chris's question about the bad debt and the charity care. Because looking at the numbers, it looks to me like your charity care and discounts were up about 7%, and that bad debt was up 74%, which is due to the classification issue you mentioned before. If you add them together, they're up 33% in the quarter. So that to me feels like a big number, but you kind of characterized it as more flattish. Is there something -- am I missing something in that analysis?", "Steve G. Filton", "No. I mean, I think, the issue, obviously, is though -- and to me the ultimate test is what's happening to our overall paying revenues, which are clearly up in the quarter and the strongest performance that we've had in some time. And that's reinforced, or in my mind, validated by our cash performance. So no, I mean, I think, and I've made this point a lot before, we don't do a lot of analysis of bad debt and charity care in the sense of what we're not collecting. We're far more focused on what we are collecting. And I thought in Q3, those numbers were actually pretty strong.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. I think that makes sense. And when you think about the payor mix issues that you're talking about, that is just Medicare growing as a percentage? Or what's causing the payor mix issue?", "Steve G. Filton", "In Vegas?", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, I guess, specifically.", "Steve G. Filton", "Because Vegas, I think, is really where we had the payor mix issue, yes. I mean, I think what we saw in Vegas was an uptick in emergency room business, and that led to an increase in volumes, but unfortunately, the mix of those patients was more uninsureds and more Medicaid, specific in that market.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then how do we think about the Texas DSH program, because in some ways, it's very helpful for you to spike out what happened in the quarter versus out of quarter. But is this something you would expect to continue next year? Or is this something that we're going to have to wait until this time next year before it finalizes again, and then we'll find another onetime -- or not, maybe not onetime but out-of-period item that we have account for? How do you think about that number going forward?", "Steve G. Filton", "So our expectation at the moment is that these couple of programs that we spiked out will continue into 2014, and will have a favorable impact in 2014 of about $15 million. And so at this point, we would expect that we would include those numbers in our guidance for next year.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Do you think you will be able to accrue for them? Or will it have to be a wait and see?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, I think at this point, we would accrue for them.", "Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe last question. On the psych, I think the margins were down there year-over-year, even though the revenue growth did improve. Any comments there, I guess, maybe besides litigation costs that might have brought down the margins?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, as you said, I mentioned a couple of million dollars of legal fees before. I think other than that, we saw a tiny bit of pressure on things like supplies and some professional fees for our psychiatrists, but -- and our doctors, but nothing terribly specific. I mean, honestly, at a 3.5% revenue growth rate, it can be a little challenging to really be able to post margin expansion every quarter at those rates of growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Steve, I hate to go back to this, but one more time. So the volumes and the mix improved across the entire portfolio except in Las Vegas, where mix deteriorated -- volume continued to improve there, but the mix deteriorated, is that correct?", "Steve G. Filton", "So, I guess, what I would say, Frank, is that in Vegas, volumes were very strong, and payor mix deteriorated pretty measurably, whereas in the rest of the portfolio, volumes were less robust, but payor mix clearly improved.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But some improvement in volume across the rest of the portfolio?", "Steve G. Filton", "I don't have it exactly in front of me, but I think most of the volume improvement was in the Vegas market.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Unrelated. I think you mentioned surgical volumes being up, but just general Med/Surg acuity, was it also up? Like, what was your case mix on the hospital side in the quarter? How much -- did it increase?", "Steve G. Filton", "Our case mix has been -- had risen, and I think it still is above where we were in the third quarter of last year. But over the last few quarters, it has largely leveled out and has been pretty consistent this year.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then with regard to the drag from the owned -- the physician clinics, any plans for further acquisition of those type of clinics in the near term?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think, obviously, in sort of a -- in a micro way, yes. I mean, we're certainly going to continue to acquire and employ physicians where it makes strategic and business sense to us. But I think that the real significant push that we experienced kind of late last year and early this year, which you're really kind of seeing flowing through our numbers now, is not likely to be repeated.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So the drag could very well have maxed out and might even decline over time, is that a fair way to say it?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, what we suggested last quarter was that we expected that the drag would decline sequentially, and it did. And I think that continues to be our expectation.", "Frank G. Morgan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. One last question, and I'll hop. Just on behavioral pricing and your outlook there, and I'll hop.", "Steve G. Filton", "I think behavioral pricing has been, on a per-day basis, in that kind of 2%, 2.5%. And I think our general sense is that it should remain around that level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick numbers questions here for me. First, Steve, your interest expense looked a little lower in the quarter than I would have expected. Can you give us an idea what drove that, and whether it was a contributor to the quarter? And how to think about that run rate going forward?", "Steve G. Filton", "So, Justin, we did receive from the state of Illinois about $4 million or $5 million in interest payments. As you know, we've been talking about for the last couple of years that Illinois had fallen significantly behind in its Medicaid payments because of budgetary issues. And they did issue some interest payments this quarter. Obviously, I think in the grand scheme that just offsets the higher interest expense we incurred in these previous periods, as we financed that increase in working capital. In the quarter itself, we didn't really call that item out because there were some offsets, some of which we already discussed like the legal fees and a couple of million dollars in sort of cost report-type adjustments, which in our minds, largely offset that interest expense benefit.", "Justin Lake - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, obviously, you're a bit of an outlier here among the hospitals that reported so far in terms of volumes. I know a lot of it's based in Vegas. Can you give us an idea, have you seen that volume improve and continue into October?", "Steve G. Filton", "I think the trends have largely continued in October, meaning strength in Vegas and mostly sort of flattish numbers elsewhere.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Raiff with Centurion.", "The question is withdrawn. We'll proceed to the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe one housekeeping item. Do you have an allowance for doubtful account number available?", "Steve G. Filton", "Yes, that will be in the Q.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess just going back to the patient mix. Were there any service lines that were particularly strong or weak, or that you entered or exited in the markets?", "Steve G. Filton", "No, other than sort of what I alluded to before, that I think the surgical service lines were stronger this quarter.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then do you have any data or statistics for us in terms of the numbers of certified application counselors that you have available at the hospitals, either sort of on an average per hospital or on an overall number for all of the acute hospitals?", "Steve G. Filton", "We don't really have any detailed numbers, Gary, other than I believe that we have certified counselors in most of, and certainly all of our larger facilities.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There appear to be no further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton", "Okay. Thanks, everybody for your time, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Michelle, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you. Good morning. This is Steve Filton. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2014. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risk and uncertainties inherent in these forward looking statement I recommend the careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.38 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarters reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night\u2019s earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased 11% to $1.36 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $1.22 per diluted share during the first quarter of last year. On a same facility basis in our acute care division revenues increased 5.8% during the first quarter of 2014. The increase resulted primarily from a 6.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. The revenue increase was due in part to strengthening surgical volumes, additionally payer mix improved in the quarter with less uninsured patients and more Medicaid and commercial insurance patients.", "On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the first quarter of 2014, up 16% during the first quarter of 2013. On a same facility basis revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.7% during the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.3% and adjusted patient days were relatively flat during the quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.1% during the first quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.9% during the quarter ended March 31, 2014 as compared to 28.5% during the comparable prior year quarter.", "The decline is largely attributable to continued length of stay pressures and a reduction in the number of military patients. Our cash provided by operating activities increased 9% to approximately $195 million during the first quarter of 2014 as compared to $178 million in the first quarter of 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 57 days during the first quarter of 2014 from 56 days during the comparable 2013 quarter. Our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 48.6% at March 31, 2014 as compared to 56.4% at March 31, 2013. We spent $92 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2014.", "We\u2019re pleased to answer your questions at this time. And in the interest of fairness I ask that everybody limit themselves to one question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Justin Lake from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Justin Lake - JPMorgan", "Good morning. My question is on reform obviously your great payer mix in the quarter can you give us a little more color on what you saw in terms of the benefit to reform maybe in state that expanded versus that expand commercial mix et cetera? Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I think that I sided in my prepared remarks I think factors that really contributed to the strength in acute care revenues one is the increased surgical volume and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily reform related it\u2019s probably more related to the improving economy and hospitals gaining traction in that regard. As far as the payer mix goes as I suggested in my opening remarks we saw slight reduction maybe a 2% or 3% reduction in our uninsured volumes in the quarter and an increase of a comparable maybe slightly lower amount in our Medicaid admissions our Medicaid volumes and maybe a slightly larger increase in our commercial insurance volumes.", "We saw those trends probably more pronounced in the states that have opted into Medicaid expansion which in our case from an acute care perspective are California and Nevada and Washington DC. We saw in a state like Nevada more definitely more than impact from the Medicaid expansion the State of Nevada has been pretty open about the fact that they\u2019ve had a very robust expansion process, California which just had a more robust commercial exchange expansion process we definitely saw the impacts of that and saw more release would cover California in that location. The difficulty is it\u2019s difficult particularly on based on one quarter\u2019s worth of data to take our payer mix changes and isolate them and identify them as specifically related to reforms.", "So we saw improved payer mix quite frankly in states that are not participating in Medicaid expansion. We saw some payer mix changes that we believe are unrelated to payer mix; they\u2019re more related to the recruitment of new physicians or opening of new service lines or a contract in the market that has gone to a narrower network that we\u2019re benefitting from. So all those kinds of things also at play and it\u2019s difficult for us to isolate any one change. We certainly feel like there was a benefit from reform in the quarter but difficult to quantify with precision.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo from Robert Baird. Your line is open.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "", "I guess just to clarify on the 2% to 3% decline in you paid volumes. Steve are you saying that in terms -- that\u2019s in terms of a percentage of your total volumes? Are you saying that on an absolute basis yourself pay volumes declined 2% to 3%.", "Steve Filton", "So I think it\u2019s the ladder, so our self pay volumes declined and in this case I am using patient days as a volume measure we saw a bit of a spike in our self pay length to stay in the quarter. So our mission is actually and self pay mission has actually declined a little bit more and I am not quite sure how you can really explain what would drive the increase in the length to stay in a particular quarter. But the 2% to 3% decline is a decline in our self pay patient days on an absolute basis.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "Got it. And how do you classify your Medicaid pending? Does that fall under Medicaid or does it fall under you pay receivables?", "Steve Filton", "Medicaid pending we categorize as Medicaid and not surprisingly given the expansion activity in the quarter we definitely saw spike in Medicaid pending and that was included in the 1% or 2% increase in Medicaid overall. So we included counts in Medicaid pending but we reserved for those or we only account for the revenue on our historical portion that we are able to successfully qualify from Medicaid.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "Got it. And I guess to make a note around that the state processes, I guess adjudicating those plans. Have there been any issues that you think could have a potential future impact?", "Steve Filton", "No, I think the only thing I would say is that some states I think Nevada notably I think because of the flood of new Medicaid applications have been measurably behind in processing application and processing payments. I don\u2019t think the state believes and what we believe that will ultimately impact in the long-term, anything it won\u2019t impact cash it won\u2019t impact our ability to take those patients et cetera. But I think there is some administrative backlog there.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "Got it. And my last one just on kind of the uncompensated bad debt trends. There is some confusion of what the right readers your compensating care as a percentage of growth was down slightly, bad debt down meaningfully, the bad debt plus charity up a little. So I guess can you just spend maybe a minute flushing out some of those moving pieces and what the right read is from your perspective?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, so as I think we always do, I think we encouraged people to look at the uncompensated care expense in total that is the cumulative total of bad debt charity care and uninsured discount. And as we disclosed in our press release as a percentage of gross revenue that is down slightly in the quarter that trend is clearly over the last several years been an upward and a fairly measureable upward trends and the fact that it is slightly down I think I Q1 is the meaningful take away in the quarter.", "As you suggest there is a pretty big shift between that debt and charity and our insurance for the quarter is always I think that as far less meaningful. Our hospitals are sort of frequently changing their policies to sort of fit their local needs in terms of how much of uninsured discount they give. In this particular case in the first quarter we increased our uninsured discounts at most of our hospitals and that resulted in just more dollar shifting out of bad debt and into uninsured discount but again I would suggest to people that the real meaningful movement is the total.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Darren Lehrich from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to ask about the behavioral margins, Steve you mentioned a couple of things. We continue to see the length of state pressure, so I can understand that. You mentioned a reduction in military patients; I\u2019d be curious just to get a little bit more commentary on what you think is driving the margins and if you can maybe also comment as to whether there was any weather impact at all in the behavioral business or anything else. So we ought to be thinking about from a margin standpoint as we listed the rest of the year. Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I appreciate, actually you\u2019re mentioning the weather down, I should have mentioned it myself. We didn\u2019t really had any weather impact for the most part in our acute care hospitals because of our geography is we tend to be in market, other than Washington D.C. that really don\u2019t experience much severe winter weather. But behavioral geographic footprint is different, we\u2019re in the upper mid west, we\u2019re in the North East and even in places in the South and places like Atlanta we clearly experience some bad weather in the quarter, probably resulted in a couple of million dollars lower earnings in the quarter, which I think as the years goes on, we should ultimately recover from. As you suggest the length of stay issue has been, one that has -- it's been a continuing one, pretty much uninterrupted for the last few years. We\u2019ve seen so a little bit of improvement in Q4, maybe little bit of stabilization. But that, the trend seems to -- and as we discussed we have largely assumed that that trend would continue in our guidance for 2014. And then lastly, we reference as we did in our year-end call. Some amount of reduction in the business from, as the military -- and even though that\u2019s a relatively small part of our overall business probably less than 10% in all division. If we seen a immeasurable decline it is fairly profitable business, that\u2019s just a function I believe, the federal budgetary pressures obviously in the last year, we\u2019ve had sequestration, we have the government shut down, I think military basis have felt that pinch unlike other insures and other employers if you will, they\u2019ve look for a way to put their employees their soldiers in the lowest cost setting that they can. I think that means trying to keep them out of hospitals or at least trying to keep them on the base hospitals. I think that\u2019s a delicate balance these are flocks that are often, as we all know from just reading the newspaper in need of fairly significant care and I think even there are some early signs in Q2 that pendulum maybe swinging the other way. If not improving that trend at least stabilizing it, so we\u2019ll continue to track that.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That\u2019s great. If I could, just want to follow-up on one team with Alan. As I relates to PIW Alan, you reference GW in the release, I\u2019m just hoping you can help us think about, how are seeing that hospital setting and whether it will be fairly rated with GW and looks like there are prestigious hospital, so can you just comment on few there? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "We are excited about it. And it\u2019s been a very fine hospital for a number of years and they were independent. And now they selected us and we closed yesterday and they will be working closely with GW. Interestingly, the Medical Director of GW is a physiatrist, which is unusual, a very fine guy and knows the hospital well. And we are very excited about, that we\u2019re working together.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Okay. Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "Just as a quick note and to add onto that, GW has always had, has had for some time that we use in patient physiatrist unit. So obviously, adding behavioral debt into the market is complementary to a service they already had, so my plan would be to try and make sure that the hospitals are synergistic with each other in terms of a service.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Collin Lang from FBR. Your line is open.", "Collin Lang - FBR", "Hi, good morning. Steve just on the future side given a very strong performance we saw this quarter. Are there any changes to your underlying assumptions or revenue in EBITDA growth as a balance of the year or is it too early to call the positive trends that we saw in Q1, two trend?", "Steve Filton", "It\u2019s a very good question Collin, and wondered we struggled with in preparation for the release in the call. I think it\u2019s always tough to make a call on long term trend based on one quarter\u2019s results, most flocks remember 2012 in the -- first quarter 2012 we reported really kind of a banged up first quarter with very strong payer mix and you had a hard time quite frankly explaining at the time and even in with respect cut out time explaining it. And as the year went on the payer mix had moderated and we kind of return to more normalize results. Obviously the big difference in 2014 as we have the presence of the affordable care act as I mentioned earlier though however it\u2019s been difficult that sort of tease out the precise impact of that. So the bottom line to answer your question is, we\u2019re not prepared to really change any of our forecast, change in any of our trends, we\u2019re certainly not prepared to change our overall guidance for the year. But we\u2019ve been pleased with the strength of our acute care revenues in Q1. And we\u2019ll certainly continue to track and try it as fast as we can pass out what the drivers of that improvement is and we obviously we can sustain it as the year goes on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Gurda from KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Good morning. Thanks. Steve how long does it take to get a Medicaid get approval on patient on Medicaid is going to get paid for?", "Steve Filton", "I think in the normal course Jason that\u2019s probably one or two months of us and as I said in a couple of states it\u2019s probably going to extend it for the moment.", "Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then so you\u2019re using a sort of Medicaid conversion rate in order to estimate sort of what happened in March.", "Steve Filton", "Correct. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve always done. So for each hospital we track our historical experience or our historical success rate in converting Medicaid pending patients to Medicaid and that\u2019s what we use to book our contractual. So if we have a historical two thirds conversion rate then for two thirds of the patients in Medicaid pending we assume we\u2019re going to pay the Medicaid rate and for the remaining one third we assume we\u2019re not going to get paid anything. And we changed those assumptions as our actual experience changes.", "Jason Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And then lastly you have the potential for new behavioral role coming out shortly, and expectations or new expectations on that?", "Steve Filton", "Our expectation is that there will not be any major surprises in the new behavioral rule I think it\u2019s entirely possible now that the industry is six years into the full implementation of the perspective payments system that there will be tweaks to the rule and changes in how core morbidities and that sort of thing are treated. But I think that our expectation is that our base rate will not be materially impacted by any of those changes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Raskin from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays", "Thanks. Steve just following up on sort of the Medicaid process I\u2019m curious what percentage of your sort of uninsured volumes those that show up at your hospital as uninsured. What percentage of those did you assume in the first quarter were now Medicaid eligible and how did that change relative to 2013?", "Steve Filton", "I\u2019m not exactly sure on answering your question but I\u2019ll do my best. I think as we talked about in our year end call and as we thought about guidance that our assumptions for 2014 were that something like 7% or 8% of our uninsured volumes would be uninsured and then we made further assumptions about I think the most of those would become insured through Medicaid and others through lesser number through commercial exchanges and I think we ramp that a bit as the year went on. But I am not sure I have that the exact assumptions for Q1 or just in front of me.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays", "So I guess what I\u2019m getting at Steve is that it sounds like your process is still conservative in the sense that you\u2019re not assuming any change in the conversion rate the number of people that you think are Medicaid eligible that actually get signed up. But I am just curious are you assuming is there a risk that you\u2019re assuming more of these people Medicaid eligible and therefore may be even that conversion rate might even go down in the future because it turns out that you were being more you were assuming that more people would be eligible for Medicaid now. Is that possible?", "Steve Filton", "So I think that your point and I have this question from others which I think is really premised on the idea that present of eligibility is likely to change sort of the conversation rate I am not sure we\u2019re convinced with that. But if you\u2019re convinced of that that presented eligibility will mean a much greater percentage of patients who quality from Medicaid then I think you could argue that we\u2019re being conservative using our historical percentages. I do think there is a little bit of offset to that in that as where accounting for our commercial exchange patients we obviously don\u2019t have any experience yet as to this whole idea of how many of them have actually paid premiums et cetera. So if somebody presents an insurance card to us we\u2019re able to verify that insurance. There may be a payment risk there that we\u2019re not accounting for as well. So I think in our own minds those two risks to some degree offset each other.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays", "Got you, that was actually my next question and my second question was just on the exchanges. What happens when someone doesn\u2019t pay their premium they get the card they show up at your hospital they receive service the health plan may even pay that. But what happens in a situation where the health plan hasn\u2019t paid that claim yet and it turns out that that individual actually never paid their premium who is on the hook there?", "Steve Filton", "Yes, and so this is one of those questions that I think we are so early in the process does not to really have any experience to be able to answer but my gut is that either the insurance company will not pay the claim until the premium is paid or if they have paid they will make an effort to recoup that payment.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays", "Right, so on your exchange base numbers that have been showing up with exchange insurance. Are you booking 100% of those revenues?", "Steve Filton", "Yes.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays", "You are, okay.", "Steve Filton", "I mean, and the reason for that for the most part is we really don\u2019t have access to that payment information. So again when we verify the insurance I think the insurance company is verifying that there is insurance they\u2019re not giving us payment information. Sometime in the future we may do this much like we do Medicaid pending and if there is sort of a historical percentage of people who ultimately really don\u2019t qualify we may alter our procedures to try and take that into account. But at the moment it\u2019s been too early for us to do that.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays", "Yeah the market assumption sounds like 15% or so who are not paying their premiums, so I didn\u2019t know if you were just sort of thinking, let\u2019s take a haircut.", "Steve Filton", "The part of that is because I think as the first part of your question I think we solved it on the Medicaid pending side we might have some cushions to offset there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Just a question for you around those exchange assumptions. I think you kind if said 7% or 9% reduction on sort, I think that the enrollment numbers seem to have all come in above everyone\u2019s expectations. I guess two questions then. First is, how do you think about that range? You feel better at the high end of the range because of all this or the leasing not to kind of move up here and form assumptions. And secondly I think we can see in payer mix and pricing and acute care margins, some benefits reform how much I guess is unclear. But it\u2019s not as clear what happens on the side, you kind of had some benefit built in at the high end of your range from maybe slight season benefit. Is there any indications in that side of the business we\u2019re seeing something? Just wanted your perspective on this too.", "Steve Filton", "Sure, so as far as the exchanges assumptions go Kevin just to be clear we talk about the experience being better than what most people assume. To be fair about it I mean we gave our guidance two months ago. We were using pretty recent data when we made those assumptions and put our guidance. So I think we were using I forget the exact number, but something close to the 8 million newly insured numbers that the government has been working with. So I think our assumptions were relatively up to date when we made them two months ago and therefore I don\u2019t think they\u2019re terribly out of date in that regard today.", "And like I said I think that we will feel much more comfortable certainly a quarter or two down the road another quarter or two down the road before we start to modify those assumptions one way or the other just given a lot of the uncertainty if it still exists. On the behavioral side as our guidance sort of implied, I think that at the low end of the guidance there was sort of a presumption that there would be no impact from the ACA on behavior. And that was really premised on the idea that from a Medicaid perspective and the idea that most of the benefit or most of the impact in 2014 would be for Medicaid that the behavioral hospitals would not enjoy that benefit because of the IMD exclusion.", "And then I think the further assumption was that for some of the commercial exchange products the nature of sort of the high deductible benefit design in those products would limit the benefit that we might get on the behavioral side as well. So that\u2019s why we saw or we presume that there would be no benefit to the behavioral hospitals in the low end of our guidance.", "And in the first quarter I would say that we really didn\u2019t see any impact. Now again if you assume that one of the challenges is the high deductable nature of the plan in theory that might ease some as the year goes on and those deductibles get exhausted but we\u2019ll see. But I think the bottom line was we would say that there was no visible impact from reform on behavioral in Q1.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s interesting I guess. You should have told me that you were expecting 8 million people back in February, at the time it was 4 million and it\u2019s really looking 5.5 to 6 and their estimate down to 6. So I am surprised that we thought it was going to be as high as it was.", "Steve Filton", "Kevin as we used, all we did to do our assumptions was we used the data that HHS had published and I thought it already by February had reflected 7 million people. But whatever reflected is what we use.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "", "Steve just struggling little bit still to understand why the charity would go up so much? I think the last several quarters we\u2019ve seen bad debt actually pop in one of the sort of rationale around that was that you guys went to operators and sort of had them maybe more aggressively but maybe go after payments as oppose to just sort of writing them off right up front. And now we sort of get into reform. And I would think that a lot of even that just the charity care would go away particularly in Medicaid expansion states. So am I missing anything in terms of the thought process around that?", "Steve Filton", "No, two things Ralph. I mean one is I think just the new ones but from a process perspective I think we\u2019re trying to allow our hospitals to do what they think is best as oppose to the other way around. And you\u2019re right; they have tweaked this number of times. So we have gone in the last few years, we have moved along and continuing in some quarters or in some periods increasing or making the charity care policy more liberal which I think is what we did in Q1 of this year, which just has the effect of shifting some of those unpaid dollars into charity care versus that debt and then in some cases we\u2019ve made the charity policy more rigorous which is simply have the opposite effect which I think is what you saw in \u201913 of shifting dollars into that debt. I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s confusing but at the end of the day all you\u2019re doing is taking uncollected dollars based on gross billings and allocating them among these three buckets. Effectively based on sort of this idea of why a patient hasn\u2019t paid I\u2019ve always viewed that as a fairly stimulus sort of distinction and at the end of the day I am only concerned with what we really are billing (Ph) paid which is why I think they are always focused on our actual cash revenue as opposed to the deductions from gross revenue. But I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s confusing because the accounting powers that they still insist on showing that bad debt on the face of the income statement and nothing anybody cares what I think but the way to solve this problem is simply to take the bad debt off the face of the income statement.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "What was charge master increased to?", "Steve Filton", "I don\u2019t have that in front on me Ralph but I am guessing it was probably 6% to 8%.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if I could just sneak one more in can you talk a little bit more about the acuity mix in the quarter the drivers of that maybe any stats around who much surgery was up and maybe the categories where you\u2019re seeing that strength? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Yes so I think our inpatient surgeries were up like 1% in the quarter and our outpatient surgeries were up 5%. I think if you compare that to where we were a year ago we were down 5% for both in and outpatient so it\u2019s a pretty significant swing don\u2019t necessarily have the service line analysis in front of me but my recollection was that strength was kind of and across the board sort of strength across all specialties and quite frankly across most of the hospital portfolio as well so it wasn\u2019t limited even to certain specialties or even to certain geographies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from A.J. Rice from UBS. Your line is open.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Hi everybody I think I might just to ask first real quick about the capital deployment obviously you\u2019ve done a couple one off behavioral deals lately not anything on the acute care side. Can you just comment on what you\u2019re seeing out there, what you\u2019re greatest positions are and so forth?", "Steve Filton", "I think as we\u2019ve said before A.J. we have the sense that most hospitals for profit, not for profit really reevaluating their going forward strategies kind of taking stock et cetera and I think they\u2019re making all kinds of decisions about how they should position themselves or could position themselves for the future. I think some of those processes are resulting in hospitals who have chosen to look for a partner or to sell out right et cetera we\u2019ve been involved in some of those processes.", "And we continue to be very interested in any hospital that is looking to change their strategy in any form whether that\u2019s looking to take on a partner or looking to sell out right et cetera and we continue to be interested in those opportunities I think a lot of those opportunities as we\u2019ve discussed over the last few years have been focused more on the rural end of the continuum and I think that not surprisingly therefore the rural hospital companies have been more active but I think we believe that going forward the universe of the hospitals that are considering those kinds of changes is expanding to include larger hospitals in larger markets.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Okay, and maybe just follow-ups as we\u2019re now seems to be doing one question plus a follow up specifically on Temecula Valley obviously that opened in the fourth quarter. Is that still a drag for you in the first quarter or is it breakeven it\u2019s a contributing and second can you just comment does that have any impact on the metrics that we should be aware of when we think about your same store volume trends for example?", "Steve Filton", "So clearly A.J. I would not make a good grade school teacher since no one listens to my instructions. But as far as Temecula goes Temecula is and this is that how we anticipate is still a drag in the first quarter and I think we expect that it would be dilutive in the first half of the year and then accretive in the second half. I will say that the overall California market has been fairly strong I kind of alluded to this in some earlier comments I do think they\u2019re benefiting again from the two trends both from increased surgical trends but also from in their case improved payer mix and specifically I think improved commercial payer mix. Obviously California has probably had the most successful state exchange implementation and I think we\u2019ve seen some benefit from that.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Do you need to [indiscernible] your admissions in non-clinical basis in this quarter?", "Steve Filton", "I think it\u2019s a payer mix issue again I mean I think those exchange patients are replacing what patients who are previously uninsured?", "A.J. Rice - UB", "Right. No, I guess I am asking about Temecula Valley is that somehow the press that your same store\u2026", "Steve Filton", "I think there is a bit of cannibalization here A.J. but again I think that\u2019s clearly been included in our guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Taylor from Citi. Your line is open.", "Gary Taylor - Citi", "Good morning Steve. Couple of questions on the same store I just want to go back to yourself paid decline on the patient days and you said, admissions were actually down more than 2% to 3%. Would you care to actually give us that number?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah so I think self pay admissions were down 7% or 8% Gary and then I think the length of stay was up sort of 5%, 6% which that makes the patient days down 2% or 3%.", "Gary Taylor - Citi", "So would it be fair to think about probably double-digit decline in expansion states versus probably much less in Texas?", "Steve Filton", "", "Definitely more pronounced, that\u2019s probably right but I don\u2019t have the data in front of me.", "Gary Taylor - Citi", "Last question, on behavioral you called out -- you said 2 million to 3 million I guess EBITDA of EBIT you were talking about impact from the weather potentially. Does that imply roughly like 1% top line or 1% adjusted patient day impact am I kind of in the ballpark of what you\u2019re thinking?", "Steve Filton", "So you have obviously done the math, I am trying to do it in my head. I think that\u2019s right, that sounds right.", "Gary Taylor - Citi", "I was just thinking what kind of, your average margin on there and take it up to the revenue line and divide it. So that\u2019s what it comes out to around 1%, so there weren\u2019t any other assumptions about significantly different operating leverage or anything as you guys came up with that, doesn\u2019t sound like?", "Steve Filton", "No.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is open.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "", "I just wanted to try to recap to make sure I\u2019ve got it. Are you saying essentially that it was almost a one-for-one swap lower, fewer on ensured days and increased Medicaid? So in other words very little impact from the exchanges so far?", "Steve Filton", "Well and I think that\u2019s part of the challenge John is that we saw an increase in commercial lives which I did say earlier in the call. It\u2019s not clear to us in every case what that\u2019s attributable to. So in a place like California it\u2019s sort of easier to see where that\u2019s attributable to the exchange process in California. But we saw some payer mix improvement in Texas which by the way I meant. So we\u2019re just making the assumption that obviously there is nothing or little to do with the exchange impact, especially in the markets that we\u2019re in, because we just don\u2019t sense that there is not a lot of exchange activity. So we think in those cases it\u2019s recruiting newly recruiting physicians or new contracts that we have or other dynamics. But again this is the sort of ongoing challenge I have mentioned a few times in the quarter I think it\u2019s difficult to take everyone of these metrics on payer mix and attribute a very specific part to reform to the economy and then other dynamics to play.", "John Ransom - Raymond James", "If a patient comes in with an exchange plan, do you even know that it is an exchange or it\u2019s just another commercial plan to you?", "Steve Filton", "Again I think that in some cases the answer is yes, but I think it\u2019s a little too early in the process for us to know with great confidence how accurate we\u2019re about that. I think as time goes on I do believe we will get better data.", "Operator", " ", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Paula Torch from Avondale Partners. Your line is open.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners", "Was curious what are the learnings as you have increased physician employment in acquisitions. Are they generating the returns you have hoped for? How should we think about the growth there and maybe what types of physicians would you prefer to employ versus outsource and maybe you could give us some of the percentages outsource versus employee.", "Steve Filton", "Generally I think when you\u2019re talking about outsourced physicians, I think you\u2019re talking about hospital base physicians, ER doctors, radiologists, pathologists et cetera. I don\u2019t have the exact percentage I mean the vast majority of our ER physicians are outsourced as far as our other house based physicians. It\u2019s really a market by market decision. As far as your actual admitting physicians, as we\u2019ve discussed in our calls I mean it varies by market how many of those and what percentage of those are employed? We employ both primary care physicians and specialists. Although I think our emphasis tends to be on primary care physicians. And in terms of lessons learned, I mean I think all hospitals would generally have the same observations. We like to or the advantage of implying physicians is to integrate them into the hospital and to hopefully have them associated more exclusively with your facility and the challenge is that once physicians are on a salary as oppose to working on their own. The historical I think tendency has been for them to lose some of the incentives and to be less productive. And I think that\u2019s the delicate balance that all hospitals try and work through as they employ physicians.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo", "", "I guess the comments regarding the impact of reform versus the economy. When you think about the impact of the economy, what or maybe some metrics or some of the things you have seen in your market would leave you to believe that there is more or some impact from the economy?", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think the main Gary, as I said at the outset and we talked about couple of time. The increase surgical volume, to me that -- if it\u2019s related to either the ACA or the economy, which seem to be much more logically related to ACA since highly possible it\u2019s related, excuse me to the economy. It\u2019s entirely cost was related to other things as well, again recruiting a new positions, new contracts et cetera, but I don\u2019t know that anybody was really predicting that the ACA will drive more surgical volumes. So to add to that, the best example I can give, the acute care revenue strengthens the quarter that I think clearly didn\u2019t have much to do with that. The other piece is, as a result of more people going back to work but just saying in the market like Las Vegas, I think that we would expect to improve payer mix just from that trend from lower unemployment more people going back to work and getting insurance from their employer. And again in those cases it\u2019s been difficult for us to tease out whose got insurance as a result going back to work and who\u2019s got insurance as a result of a commercial exchange probably.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo", "And then maybe you should follow-up on that, as you look out towards your 2015 negotiations or manage to your contracts are you seeing any impact from the exchanges in terms of mange share looking for more now and that works or anything like that?", "Steve Filton", "I think it\u2019s still pretty early when you talk about negotiating 2015 our benefit plan design and rates, et cetera. So I would say the answer to your question is now, although I think that\u2019s an expectation that we have that as we get into the late summer and early fall and those negotiations are taking place more and earn it, that those kinds of conversations will become more frequent.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Anthony He from RBC Capital Market. Your line is open.", "Anthony He - RBC Capital Market", "Thanks. Just curious to see if you have any update on the AR build up, I believe it was Illinois and Texas?", "Steve Filton", "So our Illinois receivables are actually down I think about $10 million in the quarter, so that\u2019s a good development. We get a $25 million payment on our Texas UPL receivable in the quarter, although I think the receivable also have been filled up some as well. Obviously the Temecula opening and the fact, with our new payer et cetera. New debts contributed on to the receivable build up as well.", "Anthony He - RBC Capital Market", "Okay. And then any update on the, the plan psych bed expansions for the year?", "Steve Filton", "No. I mean again, I think we talked in the call, in the UN call and you know gave a psych bed target for the year which was in the 600 range. And I think we believe we\u2019re still tracking to that number.", "Anthony He - RBC Capital Market", "Can you give a number that you made there in the first quarter or is it\u2026", "Steve Filton", "We do not have first quarter number in front of me, Anton.", "Operator", "Your next question Chris Rigg from Susquehanna. Your line is open.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just the clarification, so what, it assumed in the guidance for the year and you\u2019re dropping in sort of mission versus the 2% to 3% you saw in the first quarter. You\u2019re assuming 79% drop?", "Steve Filton", "That was what was in our guidance.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna", "Okay. The first quarter was -- obviously very strong and you barely saw any benefit relative to what\u2019s you\u2019re looking for the year, correct.", "Steve Filton", "And mostly because of the increase in line to stay in our uninsured volumes, Chris, and the answer to your question earlier, I think with actual drop in uninsured mission was pretty close to what we have guided to.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna", "Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "I have no further question. Thank you. I turn the call back over to presenters for closing remarks.", "Steve Filton", "We would like to thank everybody for their time. And look forward to speaking with them next quarter.

Alan Miller, our CEO is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014.", "During this conference call, Alan, I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.51 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS, increased approximately 30% to $155.6 million of $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to $118.9 million or $1.20 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.", "On a same facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2014 increased 11.5% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.6% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 7.7% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals increased to 19.2% during the second quarter of 2014 from 14.8% during the second quarter of 2013. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5.9% during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the second quarter of 2013, during this year's second quarter as compared to last year's adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 4.4% and adjusted patient days increased 1.8%.", "Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.6% during the second quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.6% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our cash from operating activities was approximately $264 million during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to $212 million in the second quarter of 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 17% to $458 million over the $391 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the second quarter of 2013. At June 30, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 47% as compared to 54.2% at June 30, 2013. We spent $94 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2014 and $187 million during the first six months.", "Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2014, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $5.55 to $5.85 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year as well as the impact of the other items reflected on the supplemental schedule for the six months ended June 30, 2014, represents an increase of approximately 15% to 16% from the previously provided range of $4.80 to $5.10 per diluted share. This guidance range, which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth in last night's earnings release also excludes the impact of future items, if applicable, that are nonrecurring or nonoperational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, costs related to extinguishment of debt, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets, impact of share repurchases and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods.", "Our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program whereby, from time to time as conditions allow, we may spend up to $400 million to purchase shares of our Class B common stock on the open market or in negotiated private transactions and they have also increase our third quarter dividend payable on September from $0.05 a share to $0.10 a share.", "Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time. We would ask that you try and limit yourself to one question each. Thank you very much.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Justin Lake.", "Justin Lake - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning. My question would be on the acute care side. Obviously, great quarter you guys had there. Anything you could share with us in terms of breaking out the outperformance in terms, would you think that the ACA related in terms of coverage expansion benefits versus core improvements, whether economic driven or just business investments you have made, and then maybe even talk to specific markets, that would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. We will try to do that, Justin. So I think as it was the case in the first quarter, I think we believe maybe a little bit more so than our peers that there is a fair amount of imprecision in trying to parse out or tease out the ACA impact and the impact of payor mix improvement coming from other sources particularly the improvement in our underlying economies. I think our best effort would be that in the quarter, if you look at the acute care year-over-year improvement, we would attribute somewhere between the third and a half of that improvement to the favorable ACA impact and the remainder of that improvement to improving economies in our local markets as well as idiosyncratic factors in our markets. And by that I mean the market share shifts, new service lines, et cetera.", "As far as the geography of it, I think we had relatively strong performance across the acute care portfolio but as we said in Q1, I think that the pleasant surprise of 2014 has really been the performance of our Texas markets, Texas not being a Medicaid expansion state and not being one that had set up statewide commercial exchanges, we were not necessarily anticipating a big ACA impact in that state, but generally I think the economy in Texas has improved fairly markedly and that's being reflected in our results. And our California markets as well have been very strong.", "Justin Lake - JPMorgan", "Thanks for all the color.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of A.J. Rice.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Thanks. Hi, everybody, and also congratulations on the beat there. Maybe just to flesh up further on reform benefits. I know the guidance, I think it said reform was $0.15 to $0.20 embedded in the original guidance. Have you updated that number?", "And then specific, seemed like quarter, most of the benefit was Medicaid related. Can you comment it that's still the case? And are you seeing any benefit from exchanges start to kick in at this point?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, A.J. I think that in terms of the latter part of the question, you have described it accurately. The ACA impact in Q1 was definitely more skewed to increases in Medicaid enrollment and clearly in Q2 we are seeing more of a commercial exchange impact, not surprisingly, since I think that the government's data showed that a lot of that exchange enrollment activity was taking place at the end of Q1. And so I think it's starting to filter its way to our business in Q2.", "As far as the ACA impact on our guidance, I would answer that in much the same way I answered Justin's question and that is, I think if you take a look at our revised guidance and you think about that as improved over the prior year, I think we would suggest that somewhere between a third and a half of that improvement is from the ACA and the rest is from other non-ACA factors.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joshua Raskin.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Hi, thanks. Good morning, Steve. The first question just, and I don't want to beat the dead horse, but can you actually tell if its exchange lives relative to just general commercial improvement? Or are you seeing, its better in California, so that's why we think it's exchanges as opposed to economy or something like that? Is there a way for you guys to actually know that?", "Steve Filton", "So I think the way that we have approached it, Josh, is the way that we approached quantifying the ACA impact is to say that in Medicaid expansion states, we are going to attribute any benefit from increased Medicaid enrollment to the ACA and not really do that in the non-expansion states. As far as then the commercial exchange patients go, to the best of our ability, we are trying to identify those patients specifically, but I think that's really where we believe the imprecision comes in that in some cases we can clearly do that and we are very comfortable doing it. In other cases, it is not so clear. Somebody comes in with a Blue Cross card or another card and it is not actually clear to us whether they are exchange patient or not. So that's why we have this sort of range, and feel that to some degree we are estimating that impact.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Got you, and then just specifically on the buybacks. Do you guys have sort of a formulaic approach, debt to cap minimum that you hit and then you start buying back or are you just going to be more opportunistic, based on what the stock price does?", "Steve Filton", "I think the history of UHS is that we have been an active acquirer of our shares from time to time over the years and have generally been an opportunistic acquirer when we have been active. I think the message in the buyback authorization, from my perspective, is obviously just sort of a bullish message on the business. We are just very pleased with how the business is going and its outlook for the near and intermediate term for sure, but also as we talked about in our Q1 call, we have been very diligently paying down debt and reducing our leverage, really ever since the PSI deal more than three years ago. And I think we certainly feel that our leverage levels now are at a sufficiently low level that we are very comfortable with them and don't feel that they need to be a great deal lower, so that if we continue to generate cash at these levels and don't necessarily find other opportunities to deploy capital in the short-term, we will be more than happy to be acquirers of our own shares. And again, we will do that on an opportunistic basis.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Kevin Fishbeck. Mr. Fishbeck, your line is open.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello. Can you hear me?", "Steve Filton", "I can hear you. Go ahead.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So I guess last quarter you guys gave some specific information around the reduction in uninsured as far as, I think in the last quarter you saw extra admissions in the quarter, but length of stay and patient days. Do you have the updated data for this quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So I think that the results in Q2 suggest this, and the underlying metrics having supported, the trends that we saw, I think, in Q1 probably accelerated some into Q2. So the reduction in self pay or uncompensated patients grew to probably 10%, 11%, 12%, Medicaid utilization increased by 9% or 10% and commercial utilization increased probably 4% or 5%. So I think all those numbers were a little more favorable than they were in the first quarter, again reflective of a trend that we didn't see a lot of new trends in Q2, but an acceleration of the ones that we did see in Q1.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that makes sense. Now jus the one last question on Vegas. The minority interest number actually was down year-over-year which is a bit surprising to me. I wasn't sure there was anything in there around the liability accrual that maybe reduced the comp year-over-year or was Vegas actually a somewhat difficult quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. Vegas was ahead of last year's quarter, but I will remind people that the second quarter of last year was the first quarter where we called out a really measurable improvement in the Vegas economy and in our results. So the Vegas market rise was really the only difficult comparison in Q2 to last year and that's reflective in the fact that we certainly cosmetically, our Texas markets or our California markets were sort of outperforming. It's also worth noting, depending on what numbers you are looking at, but on that minority interest line, we had a favorable malpractice adjustment in the second quarter of 2013 and to the degree that that was allocated to the Vegas facilities, it made their second quarter 2013 results look somewhat better and so that's making the comparison again on the face of the income statement a little more difficult.", "Kevin Fishbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Darren Lehrich.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And Alan, congrats on 35 years.", "Alan Miller", "Thank you. Thanks very much.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "So I wanted to maybe ask about behavioral and I know I have been asking this question pretty consistently, Steve, about length of stay in behavioral. It was down, I guess, seems to around 2.5%. I would be curious just to get any feedback here you are getting from the operators about whether you are sensing there is any bottoming at all there? And then on the other behavioral question I would like to sneak in here is just, are you getting any feedback at all about health plan design, now that July 1 has come around and the benefit years post July 1 has to, taking an account, the mental health parity? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So answering your second question first, Darren. As far as benefit plan design and then I think your question is, are we getting a sense that benefit plan design is changing in July to comply with the final mental health parity regulations which become effective in July, I would make two comments about that. One is from a practical perspective, I think all our sense is that the majority of those changes will likely take place in January 2015 when benefit plan design routinely changes. Anyway, for the most part, we will certainly press to the degree that we can for earlier changes, but again I think from a practical perspective, and I think it's part of the reason why we have always sort of tried to create the expectation that the ACA/mental health parity impact for the behavioral business would be more either backend loaded in 2014 or probably even skewed to 2015.", "As far as the length of stay issue -- and one other comment I will make just about benefit plan design is, I think the managed care companies are always going to be ahead of the curve from us in terms of understanding how that's changing. We will see those changes as those patients really start coming to our hospitals, and we get a quarter or two experience under our belts. So we will see. So I think it's probably too early for us to really answer that question in a meaningful way.", "As far as the length of stay goes, you suggest you have been asking this question for a long time, obviously, we have been answering it for a while as well. This trend has existed now and been in place for several years, really, I think since the height of the recession when Medicaid programs really started cutting back length of stay, I think as a means of controlling expenditures. We saw I think a little bit of improvement in Q1. Q2 took sort of another step down, although not a real significant one. I think very much consistent with our expectations. I would just say that in general the behavioral division, I think was right on our expectations for Q2 and just as a financial person impresses me quarter-after-quarter, with just their very strong consistent performance.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "And Steve, just so we are clear that the behavioral margins year-over-year, would they have been positive if the (inaudible) you reserved wasn't in the numbers?", "Steve Filton", "There is a few small plusses and minuses, Darren, and I think you know I could certainly make an argument that we were a tenth of point or two-tenths of a point ahead, but again I think what you are seeing in behavioral, from my perspective, is again is just very consistent margin performance in the high 20s. And to me, the real upside to that is really getting back to your original question, if the length of stay does not even improve, but just level off at some point and/or we do get some of the impact from either the ACA or the mental health parity final regulations, I think that's when you might see note that the next step-up in those behavioral margins.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Frank Morgan.", "Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. I was hoping you could comment a little bit or detail around the surgical volume, both inpatient and outpatient? And I am curious if you are starting to see any kind of change in the mix of the payor mix of that business suggesting that maybe you are starting to see some of this newly insured business that in that area?", "Steve Filton", "Yes, Frank, so the metrics are easy to talk about. I think we had a 4% increase in our outpatient surgeries and a 2% increase in our inpatient surgeries. And I think in both cases, those numbers are really the best surgical volumes that we have posted probably since the recession began. So that's encouraging.", "Again, so looping back to the conversation I was having with Josh Raskin earlier, it's a little difficult for us to sort of parse that out between how much of that increase is reform related or ACA related and how much is not. I think our general sense is that most of that surgical strength comes from the improving economies, people going back to work, people feeling more comfortable about being out at work, those kinds of things than it does from necessarily ACA patients, new ACA patients are having those procedures. But to be fair, we can't tell that with great precision.", "Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets", "Okay and then changing gears, just on cash collection. Are you actually starting to see cash collections on those newly insured Medicaid patients that were coming in the door last quarter? Has that process been fairly seamless? And have you noticed any change there?", "And then finally I am going to hop, what is action -- this is a mechanical question, what is the run or the EPS for the first half of the year that you are using to update your annual guidance? What is the number you are actually using to build off to get to your new full year guidance? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "So I would refer people to the supplemental schedule in our press release, where we adjust for the electronic health record number and the nonrecurring gain we had in the first quarter and that will show you effectively the adjusted earnings that we are using to then say, you know, this is what we are basing our revised guidance on.", "Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets", "So that cash collections on the newly insured Medicaid patients?", "Steve Filton", "So the cash collection and I think our DSOs reflect this, Frank. I think there was a little slowdown in Q1 in some of the states like Nevada, where I think they were frankly overwhelmed with new Medicaid enrollees. But again, as you just see from the general cash flow in Q2 and just that the DSOs, I think for the most part, those initial bumps are working themselves out and we are collecting on both the newly enrolled Medicaid patients as well as the new commercial exchange patients that had a pretty normal, I would say.", "Frank Morgan- RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paula Kurt [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more broadly about the urban acute hospital landscape? And are you seeing some better opportunities for any M&A activity there? Are there any assets you have identified or any particular markets that you are really focused in on? And when might we start to see some activity there at all and what might some of the challenges be in getting anything done in the next couple of years? Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Paula. So UHS has generally been situated in the middle of that continuum that you are sort of suggesting of the rural and urban and however sweet spot, particularly in our acute care division has been kind of the midsize urban, large suburban markets we have tended to try and locate. I think we have a sense that not-for-profit hospitals around the country in those kinds of markets are having all sorts of conversations and evaluating their future, and thinking about how they want to position themselves in the healthcare landscape over the next three years and five years, et cetera. But I will also say that those conversations, historically, I think take a long time to evolve and mature. We are trying to stay on top of them as much as we can and as those hospitals decide that they want to look in a different direction or want to consider other alternatives. We certainly have, as we were alluding to before, the capital flexibility and the desire to respond to those opportunities as they arise.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great, and I just have one follow-up as we think about guidance. I guess in terms of the same facility revenue, let's take it on the acute care side, you had guided to 3% to 4%, with EBITDA flat to slightly up. But obviously, we are much better than not. So where should we be thinking about taking that number in terms of how we are modeling the second half?", "Steve Filton", "I will answer the question just a little differently, Paula, in a sense. And I think what we try to do in revising our guidance was to take our first half of the year performance and for the most part just assume that that kind of improvement over the prior year and over our original expectations continues at about the same rate as it did for the first six months. We obviously then adjusted for a couple of the known plusses and minuses like the Texas Medicaid reimbursement that we disclosed, et cetera. But other than that, it was really pretty much as straightforward as that, and if you go through that same exercise you will land very much within the confines of our range.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, great. Thanks and good luck.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Chris Rigg.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to try to parse out the economic versus ACA improvement a little bit more. I know you about Texas being very strong. But when you think about sort of the relative benchmarks, the inpatient, outpatient surgeries, are there other major regional differences, say in Texas versus California and Florida, et cetera that that might be worth highlighting? Thanks", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Chris. Generally look, I think that obviously you talk about a 4% increase in outpatient surgery, you are going to see some hospitals doing a little better there and others a little worse. But in general, the trends that we have discussed, the improved payor mix trends, the stronger surgical mix trends, really have been pretty much spread fairly evenly through the portfolio, as I said. As I think about 2014 in terms of how we originally envisioned and how it's played out, I think that our original thought was this would be year in which we would feel, as we described, a significant ACA impact in places like California and Nevada, which were Medicaid expansion states and California which had a robust commercial exchange program, et cetera. But what surprised us, I think, was the really strong performance in Texas that I think for the most part is not ACA related. And even the really strong performance in California that is beyond the ACA impact. So that's the sort of geographic trends or differences that I would point out. But I will say that, for the most part, the trends that we describe are trends that we are really seeing across all of our markets and my sense is obviously, given the couple of other acute care companies that have reported so far this quarter, at least give an indication of where they are going to report, those trends seem to be fairly widespread.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay, and then just one quick follow-up. Are you still excluding the California provider tax from the guidance ? I will leave it at that. Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "And the answer is yes, we are still excluding the California provider tax.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ralph Giacobbe.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I was hoping you can maybe just talk about the progression through the quarter. Was it sort of evenly spread? Did it improve month-to-month? And I know it's only few weeks in, but any initial views on July trends?", "Steve Filton", "So I think as some of the sell side surveys have indicated, I think the quarterly, both payor mix and volumes tended to improve as the quarter progressed. I think it's difficult to really give much of an indication of any early signs of the third quarter only because so much of this improvement is really payor mix based and that's much harder for us to measure on an interim basis before the month closes. So I don't think there is really anything we can say that's terribly meaningful about the about the third quarter just yet.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "Okay, fair enough. And if I could sneak one more in. Are you guys seeing any greater mix of out-of-network revenue coming in? Is that helped at all? And within your markets, maybe just remind us of what your position of being in versus being out? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "I think in the vast majority of our markets, we are in almost all the networks, except for some sort of long-standing historical exclusions. I don't think that there has been any developments in recent, you know, in the last year or two where we have really been excluded from a noteworthy contract. And again, occasionally, you will see a significant amount of out-of-network activity or sort of outlier activity but I would say, in general, that's not something that has really come to our attention in this year, at least.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Brian Zimmerman.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks and good morning. I appreciate the color on surgical trends, but I was hoping you could also give us an idea of what acuity looked like in the quarter? And then maybe some of your other service lines in terms of like ER visits in particular?", "Steve Filton", "I think, Brian, the revenue strength, meaning that revenue per admission number, which quite frankly, I didn't go back and try and find the last time we were that high but I know it's certainly been multiple years. But I think that's reflective of obviously the improved payor mix that we have been talking about, but also increased acuity. I think the increased acuity occurs for a couple of reasons. I mean, one, it's a function of the improving surgical volumes that we have talked about already. Two is this whole, what I call the two midnight phenomenon that as payors, most notably Medicare, but other payors drive out the shortest length of stay and by definition therefore I think the least acute patients, the inpatient component that you re left with tends to be a more acute mix of patients, et cetera. So I think that also drives the acuity up, but in general I think acuity has been strong this year and we would expected it to remain so.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs", "And on the ER visits?", "Steve Filton", "The ER visits have been up, I think, 5% or 6% for the year, although again going back to sort of what I call the two midnight phenomenon, the conversion of those to actual inpatient admissions is going at a lower rate than has been the historical case, I think because of the emphasis on making sure that patients meet admitting criteria that will pass muster with Medicare and other payors.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs", "All right, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on last point. Steve, do you happen to have the statistic for the percentage of admissions that came in through the ER and how that would compare year-over-year?", "Steve Filton", "I don't have it in front of me, Gary. I will tell you that historically, we run in the mid-to upper teens, those 16%, 70%. But I know that again over the last two or three quarters that percentage has declined some, although again I do not have the data right in front of me.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, and then could you comment on any impact if at all that you are seeing that you are aware of in South Texas from some of the immigration issues that have been in the news?", "Steve Filton", "Yes, I think we have seen very little. As I watch the news along with everybody else, I think that these folks, particularly the children who were coming across the border are generally being treated in these separate facilities. I have not really heard other than some of the anecdotal story here or there that we are really seeing any of those patients.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, and then maybe just to wrap up, on the behavioral side, are you still on track to add, I think you said it was 600 beds, for the year or are you considering changing that based on some of the volumes that you are seeing there?", "Steve Filton", "No, I think that those bed additions that we have undertaken are generally decided upon based on a fairly long-term view and I don't think our long-term view of this business or the demand has really changed. So we are sticking with our expansion program, not only for this year, quite frankly, but I think we hope to continue the bed expansions at about that same annual rate for at least 2015 and hopefully into 2016 as well.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Whit Mayo.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, thanks. Steve, you have excluded HITECH income and the cost from your guidance for some time now and clearly that's had the impact of understating your earnings in prior quarters. But how do you think about that over the long-term and presumably the cost will continue into perpetuity and the reimbursement doesn't? So I am just kind of curious on your thoughts there.", "Steve Filton", "Well, I think our rationale for excluding them was just the opposite, that the actual implementation of the electronic health record and those are really the cost that we have excluded, really doesn't continue into perpetuity. That was a finite sort of process that began in 2009 or so and will continue for four or five years. I think from a cash perspective, we will largely be through a lot of that impact at the end of 2014, certainly from a cost perspective. And I think again, our rationale for excluding both the HITECH revenue and those cost was, they weren't being recorded on a very ratable basis in many cases and therefore in our minds were a distorting the current earnings power of the company. So again, as you know, we have been very transparent about what those numbers are. We have tended to exclude them from our ongoing earnings in that supplemental schedule we do but the cost are out there so that any analysts can treat them exactly the way they want.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "That's fair. I was just curious. And maybe just on cost for a second, is anything new on either side of the business? I think you and others within the sector have really worked down your cost structure for years now and that presumably helps on any new incremental dollar revenue that flows through, but anything new or worse on supplies, registry cost, anything that we should be aware of? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "I don't think so. Look, I think what you have actually described it pretty accurately. I think UHS and the industry in general really tightened their belt as the recession began several years ago and I am not sure we or they have loosened that at all or much at all. And I will say that because so much of this revenue strength is coming from improved payor mix, there is not necessarily cost that are directly associated with improved payor mix and that's why I think you are seeing such a powerful leverage mechanic on that acute care margin line. To the degree that we are seeing volumes pick up as we did in Q2, obviously there is some increase in costs associated with that and obviously also to the degree that we are seeing surgical volumes pick up, I think our supply expense does tickup commensurate with that. But other than that I don't think we really feel like there is any significant pressure points on cost at the moment.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). This question is from the line of Gary Taylor.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Hi, good morning. Actually I just had one clarification and one question. So it feels like I can get away with that. Steve, you might have said that, I stepped out just a second, but on the Medicaid supplemental payments and the portion those that are out of period, are those included in the same-store metrics that you report or excluded?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So I think you know it's only the in-period revenues that are included in the same-store metrics.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "So it's all been scrubbed already for that.", "Steve Filton", "Right.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Okay, perfect, and then my question. it is kind of interesting, obviously really strong fundamental performances has overshadowed everything else but just a few days ago the biggest thing going on in the space was some of the legal decisions coming out of the court cases and consuming a lot of people's thoughts and you guys are fairly well-positioned in Nevada, California. My question would be, and maybe Alan might want to weigh in on this as well. You do have significant exposure to Texas. There is some ACA benefit there presumably with 700,000 or 800,000 exchange enrollees in that state. I guess the question is, any sense out of the hospital association or yourselves, the willingness of the state of Texas to actually establish their own exchange if it ever actually got to that after some additional legal decisions? Or it still look like, your still best guess would be that Texas would be a standout and probably wouldn't want to move along those lines? Interested in your comments. Thanks.", "Alan Miller", "We haven't heard anything with regard to Texas changing its position at the moment. I think the Governor is positioning himself to run for President with the border business and his position. So we will say. But I think that is a plus what we have been able to accomplish without Texas and exchanges. I think that's a plus. I would expect at some point that this whole thing will be resolved and it will be favorable to us.", "Gary Taylor - Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks?", "Alan Miller", "A.J., still with us?", "Steve Filton", "Well, he can't answer.", "Alan Miller", "He can't answer.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions).", "Steve Filton", "It's okay.

", "As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $0.82 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarters' reported results for the items disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 26% to 137.5 million or $1.36 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 109.5 million or $1.10 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year.", "On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2014 increased 7.9% over last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 4.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.6% increase in revenue per adjusted admission.", "On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.3% during the third quarter of 2014 from 14.4% during the third quarter of 2013.

During this year's third quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 5.4% and adjusted patient days increased 2.1%. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.9% during the third quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased to 27.6% during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 27.3% during the third quarter of 2013.

Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 57 days during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 59 days during the third quarter of 2013. At September 30, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 48.9% as compared to 52.9% at September 30, 2013.", "We spent $123 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2014 and $309 million during the first nine months of this year. In late September 2014, we acquired the stock of Cygnet Health Care Limited for a purchase price of approximately $327 million. Through this acquisition, we have added a total of 18 facilities located throughout the United Kingdom, including 16 inpatient behavioral health hospitals and two nursing homes with a total of 734 beds.", "Cygnet has a national footprint and is one of the largest independent providers of behavioral health facilities in the United Kingdom. They are the leading specialist mental health provider in the UK which includes services for children, eating disorders and autism among others.

The Cygnet facilities generated aggregate revenues of approximately $161 million during the 12 month period prior to our acquisition.", "During 2014, we have opened a total of 242 new behavioral health beds at some of our busiest facilities. We expect to complete construction and open another 258 beds in the fourth quarter, including the opening of the 102 bed Quail Run Behavioral Hospital in North Phoenix.", "Near the end of the second quarter of this year we acquired a commercial health insurer headquartered in Reno, Nevada. Included in our operating results for the third quarter of 2014 is approximately $48 million to $50 million of revenues and other operating expenses recorded in connection with its operations.", "During the third quarter of 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, whereby from time-to-time as conditions allow, we may spend up to $400 million to purchase shares of our Class B common stock on the open market or in negotiated private transactions.

", "Question-and-Answer session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with JPMorgan.", "Justin Lake - JPMorgan", "Good morning. Steve one question here, can you give us an update on the benefits of reform in the quarter versus the Q2 run-rate and then maybe some comments on how to think about a framework for 2015 ACA benefits for the company? Thanks.", "Steve Filton ", "", "Sure, Justin. So I think, what we had said in our second quarter call and I think we acknowledge that our analysis was limited by a number of factors and so it was not absolutely precise. But we estimated that of the acute care improvement year-over-year somewhere around 35% - 40% of it was attributable to the Affordable Care Act and the favorable impacts of that. Another 35% to 40% attributable to an improved economy in many of our local markets and then finally another maybe 15% to 20% attributable to local market factors, market share increases that sort of thing. I think we felt like for the most part those percentages held relatively steady in the third quarter as well. As far as thinking about the impact of reform on next year, obviously I think we're going to wait as I'm sure most of our peers will to see what the enrollment data looks like. Obviously, this year open enrollment for exchange products will be completed by the end of the year, so by the time we give our guidance at the end of February we should have a pretty decent picture of new enrollment both from a Medicaid and an exchange perspective. And we'll base our 2015 estimates in part on that data, much as we did this year although, the data was not available until later in the sort of chronology this year. So, that's how we'll go about framing our 2015 ACA impact.", "Justin Lake - JPMorgan", "One clarification, Steve, you said the breakdown of the growth was similar in terms of how much was ACA in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Obviously, third quarter growth was great but not as significant as the second quarter's growth especially in the acute care business. Should I take that to mean that your ACA benefit in your mind declined in terms of absolute dollar benefit sequentially?", "Steve Filton", "", "I think that's right, Justin. We talked a little bit about the fact that we had a sense in the second quarter because our same store revenue acute care revenue growth in the second quarter which was 11.5% was so significant that there was some aspect of that that was perhaps sort of one-timeish in nature whether that was because of the sort of bolus of enrollment that occurred in the second quarter or some pent-up demand that was exercised in the second quarter. But, it certainly appears as if the growth rate that we realized in the third quarter of 7.9% was still very strong seems to us to be sort of a more sustainable rate going forward. So yes, I think we felt like that real strong revenue growth that we saw in Q2 whether it was attributable to ACA or to an improving economy, decelerated just a little bit in Q3", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Zimmerman with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs ", "Hi, thanks and good morning. I was hoping, if you could give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing in terms of exchange volumes versus Medicaid expansion in states that have done so. Just any more granularity there would be helpful.", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Brian. So I mean I think that we continue to believe that in 2014, the larger portion of the ACA impact is from Medicaid expansion. And we've seen our Medicaid volumes increase by double-digits, certainly in that sort of 12%, 13% range year-to-date. And exchange or commercial volumes increased definitely increased by a measurable amount but by certainly less than that. Again not difficult to be terribly precise about it but I think we would sort of attribute maybe two-thirds of the ACA benefits to Medicaid expansion in '14 and maybe a third to exchange expansion or exchange enrollment.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay and then can you give us a bit more detail on what you're seeing in terms of acuity in payor mix in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Again I think, from a payor mix perspective, the trends are similar to what we've seen all year which is a relatively measurable decline in uninsured volumes, uninsured volumes are down probably 7% to 8% for the year and those are offset by an increase in both Medicaid and commercial volumes as I just noted, and those trends continued into Q3 and I think our expectation is they will continue into Q4 as well.", "Brian Zimmerman - Goldman Sachs", "", "Alright. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks. Good morning. So I guess I wanted to ask two things here. The first, you mentioned the acquisition of a managed care plan and I guess, I'd just be curious to get a little bit of flavor for what you're doing with that plan and, I guess, specifically inside this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about maybe the earnings impact? I know you gave us a revenue number, obviously -- that's a lower margin business. Were there any transition costs of any sort? And just help us put that into perspective.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So from I think a strategic perspective, Darren, the acquisition of the health plan is really part of sort of the broader preparation and, I think, foundation that we're building for the more integrated or the demands for a more integrated health care delivery system that we anticipate and I think, frankly, most of our peers anticipate is going to be required in the future. And so, as we continue to form more integrated relationships with our physicians and some of our long-term care providers, et cetera, and other niche providers, we also I think wanted to have the option in at least certain markets of being able to offer an insurance product, in some cases, the Medicare Advantage Insurance product. And as we thought about how best to create that infrastructure and capability, we looked at potentially building it on our own from scratch or buying it and ultimately decided that buying a small insurance company and the one we chose was in a market that we already operate in Reno, although I don't think there was anything terribly significant about the location itself, because I think for the most part we would like to be able to transform that or transmit that capability to other markets. So that was the driver behind the decision.", "As I indicated in my remarks, maybe approximately $50 million of revenues and expenses in the quarter, slightly dilutive at the EBITDA line and I think we anticipate that it will remain that way for the first, maybe 18 to 24 months of operation at which point we think it would become accretive or positive from an EBITDA perspective. But again, the real goal here is not to create an insurance business that\u2019s going on its own become terribly profitable but really to help us drive some of the results in our markets and alignments that we're really looking for.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just the EBITDA dilution, should we thinking, a few million or is there something...", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I would say on an annual basis, in that sort of $5 million to $8 million range.", "Darren Lehrich - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess I wanted to ask also here about the Cygnet transaction. With regard to the skilled nursing facilities is that, I guess those two facilities, will you continue to operate them or how should we think about that in terms of the enterprise you're buying? And then, what do you think the EBITDA contribution for Cygnet can be on a run rate basis? And then, just I guess specific to guidance, it was not implicitly in the original guidance so how should we put the annual guide into context?", "Steve Filton", "So trying to work backwards, I think that when we announced the Cygnet transaction, we talked about a margin profile for that business that was fairly similar to our own which I think translates to something like $10 million to $11 million of incremental EBITDA a quarter. And I think also it translates to something like $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS accretion in the first year of operation. So to your point, Darren, with a quarter of that to be realized in the fourth quarter, we didn't think those numbers were material enough to change our operating guidance given any other moving parts that we might have. And then as to your first question about the two nursing homes that the company owned, I mean, that's a long standing \u2013 those are long standing facilities that the company owned, not necessarily an indication of a business that we're looking to expand, et cetera. I don't know that we're in any rush to divest any of the Cygnet facilities, but I don't think we also have any desire to expand the nursing home business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Fischbeck \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks. So, I guess a couple of questions. I want to go back to your comment about how -- the reform benefit in Q3 might be a little bit less than the reform benefit in Q2. If I remember correctly your adjusted admission number actually was better in Q3 versus Q2 on a more difficult comp. So, trying to understand, it sounds to me like you're saying that there is demand in Q2 that might have inflated the benefit and that came back to normal, where would we see that if not in the volume number?", "Steve Filton", "Well, again, Kevin, what I was sort of referring to was the fact that our same store revenue growth in Q3 was some 360 basis points better than it was in Q -- than our revenue growth in Q2 is better, 360 basis points better than in Q3. And to your point if the volumes are the same then obviously it's in the revenue per unit and that becomes sort of a mix issue. And again, to be absolutely fair about it I'm not sure that we can specifically identify why the mix was so good in Q2, and returned in our minds to a more normal range in Q3. But I think, the things or the dynamics that we speculated on was potentially the impact of sort of you know utilization occurring as enrollment incurred whether it was Medicaid or commercial, or the fact that you know perhaps, there was some bolus pent-up demand among those newly insured. Again, whether they were newly insured as a result of an improving economy or of the ACA we also had a little bit of as we have disclosed in Q2, some catch up, Texas reimbursement that drove those numbers a little bit as well. So I think that -- it's just the issue of trying to offer an explanation of why that same-store revenue growth was somewhat higher in Q2 versus Q3.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. I guess, in the past when you talked about why you think it's 35% to 40% reform and 35% -- or 35%, 40% economy you talked a little bit about performance in the expansion versus non-expansion states. Can you talk a little bit about what happened maybe in Texas versus Nevada?", "Steve Filton", "", "Yes. I mean I think, I'm not sure that, I mean I do think another dynamic that is affecting that slight deceleration in revenue growth is the fact that the Las Vegas market and I think the economic improvement in the Las Vegas market that drove higher revenues was something that we began to experience in the middle of 2013. So, by the third quarter of 2014 we were clearly starting to lap or anniversary that improvement, and that comparison consequently has become a little bit more difficult. I think we're still clearly ahead in the third quarter of '14 versus '13 in Las Vegas but probably further ahead in some of the other markets like Texas and California whose improvements started later and really didn't start in 2014.", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And I may have missed this from the question before, but did you comment on transaction costs around Cygnet in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "", "I'm sorry no, I did not. But there were no significant transaction costs in the quarter for Cygnet.", "", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "But will you have any in Q4, or they're just not [indiscernible].", "", "Steve Filton ", "", "No I mean, we had basically legal fees and some related transaction fees but no fees for an advisor or anything like that.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Yes. I guess, just a follow up on that last question. You were starting to talk a little bit about Texas given that the recovery in Vegas area lapped. But, I was hoping you could go around some of the other markets and maybe comment on those, where they are and maybe give us some color on how long you think the runway is in the recovery, is there anything different about how long we should expect the recovery in Texas and some other states? How long should that be sustained compared to what we saw in Vegas, and then secondly likelihood of a California provider tax hitting in the fourth quarter? I know it's not in your guidance but, do you still think that's a likelihood and is that still like a $9 million or $10 million kind of number?", "", "Steve Filton", "", "Sure. So, again, trying to take it backwards and at the risk of forgetting something as I work my way back. The California provider tax we did quantify as having the value to us of about $9 million or $10 million annually. As we said in -- when we offered our original guidance early in the year we did not include it in our original guidance, we did not include it in our revised guidance and specifically because it was pending CMS approval and while we ultimately expected that CMS approval will be granted, it was difficult for us to project or predict when that would happen and et cetera. And I think that's still the case. So, we continue to hope that we get CMS approval and that we get those moneys but, I have not projected that in our revised guidance and I think we'll continue to take that position. As far as your other question Frank about the individual markets again, I mean, I think that what we've seen and I think we commented on this after the end of our Q2 reporting was we've seen strength in all of our markets. And I think, that strength can be attributable to both Medicaid expansion in places like California and Nevada and D.C. ", "It can attributed to an improving economy in a number of states including -- and I think notably Texas as well as exchange enrollment in a number of states including Texas and California. I think our sense is that those benefits that is the people who have enrolled in insurance plans whether, they be Medicaid or exchanges as a result of the ACA or people who have gotten or maybe even reentered the insured market because they've returned to the job force, et cetera. I think, we think, those benefits definitely continue for the most part into 2015. I think what we are not necessarily sure of is to what degree there will be new enrollment, ACA enrollment in 2015. I think that was sort of the context of my answer to Justin's question earlier. And I think the other piece that is sort of obvious is there is a sort of initial benefit as these un-insureds reenter the insured marketplace. And while that benefit is sustained, it doesn't continue to incrementally increase. So, while we\u2019re starting to lap the Las Vegas benefit in Q3, maybe and I think from here on out, we won't lap the other the benefits that we started to enjoy in the beginning of '14 until next year. But there will be some element of that occurring next year.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. One final and then I'll hop off. Just looking at the implied range for the fourth quarter given that you're reaffirming guidance, a pretty wide range there, I think it's something like 127 to157. Anything we should be mindful of in considering as we look at that wide range and try to hone in a final number, just anything we should be aware of? And I'll hop. Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "I don't think so. I mean, obviously, it was an intentional decision on our part not to narrow the range. I still we still continue to believe that there are -- there's a decent amount of volatility in the markets, et cetera, but generally are comfortable that we will meet our original range and I'm not sure that any further commentary was intended or required.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning. Just want to go to same facility side of things, you had sizable improvement in the acute care and a bump up on the behavioral side, but when I look at in aggregate we didn't see the same level of sort of margin pull through or improvement. So what outsiders for the organic is preventing the better margin performance. I know you mentioned the Reno health plan, but is there anything else in terms of corporate overhead or other costs that's sort of impacting the margins?", "Steve Filton", "Yes, Ralph. So, I mean, we had 7.9% same store revenue growth in our acute care business and almost 400 basis point improvement in margins. I realized that the audience can be sometimes pretty tough, but I think we consider that to be pretty strong performance on the behavioral side where we already have very robust margins. We had a 30 basis point improvement in margins, again, I think we felt like both of those results were kind of well within our expectations. I think when you compare perhaps the acute business sequentially to last quarter, again, I'll just go back and highlight the fact that the results that we posted in Q2 with an 11.5% increase in same store revenue were a little bit better than what we posted with a 7.9% increase in revenue that's just the nature of the model. But again, I think the third quarter results were well within our expectations and honestly I don't know that we could do a whole lot better than that.", "", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "No, that's fair, Steve. I guess what I was asking more was sort of on an aggregate or consolidated basis as opposed -- I mean, the same store numbers were clearly strong from the acute and the behavioral standpoint. The pull through wasn't there from a total margin perspective, so I'm just trying to reconcile and I know the Reno piece, the Reno health plan probably, to your point earlier, dragged it down. I guess I was just wondering, are there other corporate overhead or other costs that sort of didn't allow you to show through better on the sort of consolidated margin line, not on the same store?", "Steve Filton", "No. And I don't think there are Ralph, I mean, nothing of any material amount.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Credit Suisse", "And then I guess on the behavioral side, you showed sort of continued momentum and strength in the revenue there, driven by the volume side. Any thoughts on sort of drivers of that? Are we starting to see -- do you think we're starting to see some parity benefits take hold or you think it's still too early on that front and then maybe how you expect that to play out in 2015?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I mean, the pace of revenue growth has picked up in behavioral as the year has gone on. I think we were in the sort of 3.5% range of revenue growth in Q1 and then a little under 6 in Q2 and a little over 6 in Q3. And again, in much the same way and maybe even a little bit more so, it's difficult I think for us to precisely identify either in ACA or a mental health parity impact in the behavioral space. But I think the sense in Q3 was that maybe we started to get a little bit of benefit, not terribly material, but a little bit of benefit from one or both of those dynamics. Certainly, I think we had entered the year with a notion that our behavioral business would grow by about 4.5% - 5% same store revenue, so we've done a little bit better than that in the last two quarters. And I think there's a general inclination to believe that a little bit of that is coming from reform/parity.", "Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. All right. Great. And then just my last one. Did you have any headwind from Texas Medicaid waiver cuts or I guess the deferral around that?", "Steve Filton", "So, I mean, I think that question is prompted by the HCA announcement that they had sort of two, I'll call it non-recurring revenue items or will have in the quarter, one is they recognized their RAC settlement in the third quarter. We did not do that. We will recognize it in the fourth quarter when we receive the settlement or sign the settlement, that number is not terribly material. I think it's probably in the $5 million or maybe a little bit lower range. And then HCA announced that it was reversing either some or all of its Texas uncompensated care revenue. We did not do that in part because, we are not in the same counties that CMS targeted with their deferrals. So, we are not in any of those same counties and so we continue to record our Texas uncompensated care revenue at the same rates that we have then.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "", "Hey thanks, good morning. Just first question is really just on Cygnet just meaningful impact on your tax rate looking out over the next year and how do you think -- or how should we think about the growth opportunities in the UK and what's similar and dissimilar versus the U.S. market?", "Steve Filton", "", "Sure. So, from a tax rate perspective Whit, the UK effective tax rate is much closer to 20% than the high 30s that we incur here in U.S., and we should continue to enjoy that lower tax rate as long as we don't repatriate those moneys or effectively bring them back to the U.S. So, I think in the short and intermediate term, the expectation is that on those Cygnet earnings we will enjoy a lower effective tax rate. As far as the growth opportunities, I think when we announced the deal we articulated the notion that I think one of the things that drove us to enter the UK was the opportunity to grow in ways that may be coming a little more difficult in the U.S. We've got a bunch of facilities now in the UK, 18 facilities that are mostly operating at very high occupancy rate so, we have the same sort of organic capacity expansion opportunities that we have here in the U.S. I think, we also have the opportunity to acquire other facilities in the UK and while we have those same opportunities here in the U.S., the opportunity to do that in a big way in the U.S. is certainly becoming more limited, and also we're restrained because we have such a significant footprint with our behavioral facilities here in the U.S. that in many markets and with many acquisition opportunities we are limited by some FTC and similar restrictions that obviously we don't have in the UK. So, we're very excited about the opportunity not only as I articulated in my comments to have acquired this very well run behavioral business in the UK but, to have also acquired a platform that I think, will allow us some of the robust growth in the UK that we've enjoyed here in the U.S. over the last few years.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "", "Is there a range for kind of organic revenue growth and maybe inorganic revenue growth that you think is reasonably achievable out over the next two to three years?", "Steve Filton ", "", "I mean again I think, in terms of the inorganic or the M&A activity, we've always been of the mind that we never really try and frame that or guide to it because, I think we always had the view that we're going to be opportunistic about those opportunities. If there are compelling opportunities to earn an above market return then we're going to pursue those aggressively. And frankly if there are not, then you know we'll be judicious about it. As far as the organic growth I mean I think, that our activities here in the U.S. where we were adding something like 3% to 5% on the incremental bid base here in the U.S. that we've been doing for seven years or eight years, I think that's probably not an unrealistic way to think about what we might be able to do in the UK.", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "", "Okay and my math might be off a little bit but Temecula looks like it's probably off to pretty good start, looks like the third quarter revenues may have in fact, doubled over the second quarter and it does appear to be EBITDA positive. So, just any update on that hospital, how it's trended with your expectations?", "Steve Filton", "", "Yes. So, I don't have those numbers right in front of me Whit so I'm unable to confirm what you're speculating, but I will say that in general, which I have said on our previous calls, our California results have really been very positive this year. And we tend to look at the overall what I'll call the overall Riverside County market that Temecula is part of. And certainly that has exceeded our expectations. Temecula itself as we expected, kind of ramping up and again, not -- I don't have it right in front of me but, I think it may be a little bit short of our internal expectations although, as I said, I think the overall market is clearly ahead of our expectations.", "", "Whit Mayo - Robert Baird", "", "Got it and one last one just on buybacks and I know it's less than a formality to extend or increase your authorization but, how do you think we should be thinking about the pace of buybacks over the next 6 to 12 months? Thanks. ", "Steve Filton", "", "Sure well I mean, I want to put it in the context when we announced the buyback in late July, we did so with the notion that we really felt our leverage levels were as really as low as we wanted or needed them to be and certainly didn't intend for them to get much lower than they were at that time. Now at that time, we were not at all certain that we were going to do the Cygnet deal. Obviously, two months after the announcement of the share buyback, we deployed $327 million of capital to acquire Cygnet. So, in that sense I think we had some capital deployment that we were not anticipating. And so I think our basic approach to share repurchase will be much like we articulated at the time and that is we view share repurchase as another opportunity for us to deploy capital. And we will compare that to the attractiveness of both organic and inorganic opportunities we have, and we'll continue to make that judgment as we move along.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question just on the behavioral side. The revenue per adjusted admission trends to have obviously been sort of zero-ish numbers for a pretty long time. I guess are we getting to a point where length of stay and some of the other impacts there are going to start turning at some point? I mean, obviously, the revenue growth has been very strong on the behavioral, but just curious on the revenue per adjusted admission.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah, Josh. I mean, I think that we've been facing this length of stay challenge for some time. And while I think it is reasonable and rationale to expect that at some point it will level off, we quite frankly and, I'll say, I, personally haven't been very good at predicting when that will be. So I think it while we took the approach that we took this year is we're going to assume that length of stay continues to decline at sort of this 3% to 4% rate that it has been, until we really see some evidence over the course of a couple of quarters at least that that's not the case and it really has leveled off.", "To be fair, I just don't think we're there yet, although certainly at some point we think we will see that. I think you sort of described of behavioral dynamic pretty well in the sense that we're seeing a very steady reliable revenue growth and volume growth and we've seen that for a while. I think the real upside as you suggest at least to some degree in the behavioral business occurs when either that length of stay levels off which we assume will happen at some point, and, or we start to get the benefit from reform and/or parity. And as I suggested in some my earlier comments, maybe we started to get a little bit of that in Q3. But I think we feel like and have always felt more like we would start to see a more measurable benefit in 2015and beyond.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays", "", "That makes sense. And then just last question on the fourth quarter, I know you guys are confirming the guidance which obviously is a wide range. But anything, we should think of as unusual from either of seasonality or a sequential change in the fourth quarter that would be atypical relative to what we've seen in the past for the fourth quarter?", "Steve Filton", "No. I mean, obviously, the normal seasonality should be present but other than that no, I don't think there's anything that we know of that people should be thinking about in terms of their expectations for the fourth quarter.", "", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays", "Okay, unless California provider or something like that happens.", "Steve Filton", "Right, right. That would be obviously something we're not anticipating at the moment.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Hi, everyone. Maybe just a couple of quick ones here. When you think about looking ahead to 2015 and ongoing reform benefit, obviously there's some discussion about potential states expanding. I don't know if you have any particular view on states that if they expand, that would be particularly helpful to you that are likely to expand. I guess also, though, there's clearly the exchange population, and there'll be some natural growth there. But I'm also curious. So we've got some new some of the managed care guys are going to be more aggressive next year. Is there anything you're doing in terms of new contracting, recontracting, approaching that business that's worth noting in terms of 2015 and its potential benefit to you?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, A.J. So, as far as the expansion \u2013 further Medicaid expansion goes, I mean, the two states that are significant to us that have not yet expanded are Florida and Texas. I'm not sure that my commentary on those states is any more valuable than anyone else's. I think they're big states and people are following the developments there. I don't think either of those states is about to imminently expand Medicaid. So, we will follow that along with everybody else. But those are clearly the two states that continue to or would make a difference for us if they did expand.", "As far as next year goes on exchange enrollment, I don't know that we're seeing a whole lot of new developments. I think we anticipated that maybe we would see a greater move to narrower networks next year. I don't know that we are seeing that. I think like all other providers, we are having sort of developing conversations with our managed care providers about changes in contracts to move to, to move away from fee for service reimbursement and to some sort of fee for value proposition, but I think those developments continue to be relatively slow developing and I don't think our anticipation is that in 2015, we will have a significant amount of our reimbursement that will be sort of new or different from our traditional fee for service.", "A.J. Rice - UBS", "Okay. And I know we've talked around some of the growth opportunities in the UK with Cygnet deal. I think one of the things that\u2019s been thrown out is that there are other properties held by the private equity, held by different private equity groups and that there might be opportunities down the road for bigger transactions as well. In your thinking about that, would you say, hey we've got to run Cygnet for a while, get comfortable with market or if one of those bigger transactions came along fairly quickly would you guys be comfortable feel like you have enough of understanding of the market to go for that?", "Steve Filton", "", "You know A.J., I think our experience is opportunities present themselves when they present themselves so, I think ideally I would, sort of echo the position that you just articulated. We'd certainly like to be able to run Cygnet for a while, get used to the new market. But on the other hand we're very comfortable with the experienced management team that we have in place there, and so I will tell you that we're evaluating opportunities as they're arising in the UK. And we'll continue to do so. So, I don't think we will be limited by sort of an absolute prescription that we have to wait.

Just wanted to follow up Steve on the comments or the attribution on payor mix. I think, you said two-thirds is Medicaid, one-third is exchanges is that -- and have you been able to see any difference between the exchange membership that came onboard in April and May which was more late enrollment probably lower acuity any observations there?", "Steve Filton", "", "So, I think I would say two things, Ana. I mean my two-thirds one-third comment I think, it was a year-to-date comment. I think that earlier in the year in the first quarter, it was really more heavily weighted to Medicaid and then in the second and third quarters it began to swing with a little bit less weight towards Medicaid and more to commercial as the commercial enrollment increased. And again, I suspect that dynamic continues into Q4. As far as acuity and I know others have commented a little bit differently but, I think for the most part we feel like the acuity of our newly enrolled ACA patients whether they be Medicaid or commercial patients has been largely reflective of our existing insured population and not terribly different.", "Ana Gupte - Leerink", "", "And have you been able to distinguish you know -- with your systems can you tell us if it's a commercial life or if it's an exchange life at this point? ", "Steve Filton", "", "Ana, I think from the beginning we've said that, I think in some cases we feel we can do that very precisely and in others it is not so clear, and which is I think why whenever we've given ACA impact estimates, we've given a fairly broad range because it is not always absolutely identifiable and easily and objectively identifiable. ", "Ana Gupte - Leerink", "", "Okay one last question. It sounds like the exchange rates are looking still pretty good and the contracts are fairly long-term. Have you had any data so far to see whether collectability of deductibles now might be an issue and put some pressure on the margin?", "Steve Filton", "I think that our accounting has anticipated the idea that the collectability of coachers and deductibles on those exchange plans might be less than what we have experienced historically, I don't know so, I think our accounting has been appropriately conservative in that regard. I don't know that we have enough actual experience to really make that statement definitively however.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna.", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna", "", "Hi good morning. I got in here a little bit late so, I apologize if this was asked. But, I know you talked about Reno in a little more detail relative to what was in the second quarter 10-Q. It looks like the capital being allocated there is coming in a little bit more significant than what I would've expected and so, would just love some sort of qualitative -- a better qualitative understanding as to the strategic rational there. Is it entirely due to market dynamics, capitation or something like that or is this sort of a beta test for something that could become more significant in the future? ", "Steve Filton ", "", "Yes so and we did [indiscernible] about a little bit, Chris so I'll be brief but, I think that it is really more of the latter. First of all, it is not really at all specific to the Reno market, that just happens to be where the plan is located. I think it's really to give us the capability as we think about this sort of integrated healthcare delivery system of the future with closer relationships with physicians and other long term care niche providers and I think the ability in some markets to be able to offer an insurance product maybe a Medicare Advantage insurance product. We think it's just a worthwhile capability to have, that's what really drove the desire to have this what I'll call insurance infrastructure or platform. ", "Chris Rigg - Susquehanna", "", "Okay and then just on the comments on leverage I mean, what is sort of the internal target these days or what's sort of the level you'd like to be at going forward?", "Steve Filton", "", "[Indiscernible] we have a very specific target. I think if you sort of look at our history here, we were comfortable levering up to do the PSI deal to a little bit over 4 times debt to EBITDA, that was obviously an extremely attractive and perhaps a fairly unique deal. On the other hand then, when we levered back-down to into close to the low-2s, I think we clearly felt that was about as low as we wanted or needed to go. So, certainly, within that range and I appreciate the fact that it's a fairly broad range, but we're certainly comfortable operating within that range. And again, we'll operate within that range and be responsive to compelling opportunities as they arise.", "Operator", " ", "There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Steve Filton", "No. I just want to thank everybody for their time, and I look forward to speaking again next quarter.", "Operator", " ", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services Fourth Quarter 2014 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Thank you.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead sir.", "Steve Filton", "Good morning thank you. Alan Miller our CEO is also joining us this morning, welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2014. During this call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. ", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.", "We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $5.42 for the year and a $1.71 for the quarter. After adjusting for a reduction in malpractice reserves relating to prior years and the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 was $1.51.", "On a same facility basis revenues on our behavioral health division increased 6.3% during the fourth quarter of 2014, adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increase 6.8% and 2.8% respectively during the fourth quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 3.2% during the fourth quarter of 2014 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "We define operating margins as operating income and net revenues, less salaries, wages and benefits other operating expenses and supplies expense divided by net revenues. Our operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year increased slightly to 28.0% during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 27.7% during the comparable prior year period.", "On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 14.9% during the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted emissions increased 5.5% while revenue per adjusted emission increased 8.8%. On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 18.1% during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 14.1% during the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $346 million during the fourth quarter of 2014, as compared to $308 million during the fourth quarter of 2013. Our cash generated from operating activities increased to approximately $1.04 billion during the fall of 2014 as compared to $884 million during 2013. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 56 days during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 57 days during the fourth quarter of 2013. At December 31, 2014, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 47%.", "During 2014, we opened a total of 602 new behavioral health beds including 162 beds opened at two de novo hospitals and 440 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. In addition, we already have approved projects to add approximately 550 new behavioral health beds and convert approximately 50 beds from residential treatment center to acute during 2015 and that number could grow as we continue to pursue opportunities to add and convert additional beds.", "We spent $82 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2014 and $391 million during the full year of 2014. During 2015, we expect to spend approximately $375 million to $400 million in capital expenditures which includes expenditures for capital equipment renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.", "In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter we repurchased 321,500 shares of our stock at an average price of slightly less than $102 per share. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 is $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share.", "The guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.12 per diluted share of EHR expected EHR impact expected during 2015 as described in our press release last night. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 6% to 13% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $5.78 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2014 as calculated on the supplemental schedule including last night's press release.", "During 2015, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over our 2014 net revenues. Included in our estimated 2015 at revenue, our revenues associated with the previously announced acquisition of Cygnet Healthcare in the UK and a health insurance company in Nevada. In addition, during the fourth quarter we acquired a 46 bed behavioral health hospital located near Taunton in the United Kingdom.", "Now I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin", "Yes, hi. Thanks. Steve, just wanted to dig in on the 14.8% growth on the acute care same store and maybe get a little bit better sense on the revenue per adjusted admission up 8.8%, maybe any specific markets or any other commentary that can point to that strength? ", "Steve Filton", "Sure, first I think there are a couple of sort of extraordinary things in the quarter, we called out the $11 million Texas disrupt in the press release we also have spoken before about $4 million California UPL that I know some of our peers have recognized as well in the fourth quarter, so if you adjust those things out it probably brings the revenue growth down by couple of 100 basis points still by any measure a very strong and robust revenue growth quarter. Our admission growth seemed to be fairly consistent with our peers who reported similar strong volumes what seems to distinguish the UHS performance in the quarter was at really robust revenue intensity and revenue per unit per admission or per day. I think a lot of that Joshua was driven by strong surgical volumes we had both in and out patients surgical volume growth of approximately5% and for the first time I can remember a long time the inpatient growth actually was outpacing the outpatients. So I think that\u2019s why really drove some of the revenue intensity.", "Joshua Raskin", "And no specific market Steve that jump out?", "Steve Filton", "No I think honestly Joshua when you get a performance that strong, it\u2019s got be pretty sort of pervasive throughout the portfolio and I think our as was.", "Joshua Raskin", "That makes sense. And just last one 15, any sense of the impact of reform that you\u2019ve baked in to the guidance, I know there is no sort of medicated expansion state, so just curious there is got to be some anniversary et cetera, is there a way to quantify the positive benefit in 15?", "Steve Filton", "Yes, I am going preface my answer with first saying but I think as time elapses and each quarter goes by, we find it a little more challenging to be able to discretely identify the reform impact from other sort of pair mix improvements and kind of specifically sort of the general economic improvement we\u2019ve been enjoying in our markets. I will say however that I think our best estimate is that we\u2019ve got and I think again this is fairly consistent with what I understand some of our peers have said, but I think in the acute care division we assume that the ACA impact in 2015 will be able about 6% to 7% of our overall earnings and that\u2019s I think a little bit of increase over 2014.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay and behavioral still sticking with same impact as you saw this year?", "Steve Filton", "Yes I mean I think behavioral we\u2019ve mentioned before that we find it difficult to discretely identify the ACA and I\u2019ll also include in that the mental health parity impact in the behavioral divisions so that we have not really discretely budgeted or guided for that to the degree that we enjoyed a little bit of that in 14 which I think is possible. We certainly sort of included that in the base and the growth of our base but have not really included as we have in the acute care division a specific impact for either ACA or parity.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna", "Chris Rigg", "Good morning. I was just the leverage at this point is down to about 2 times. You've got some internal stuff going on with regard to development but I guess just more generally how are you thinking about capital deployment at this point, share repurchases, more M&A, etc.? Just trying to get a sense and where are you comfortable at 2 times or do you want -- you actually want to see that go a little higher at this point? Thanks. ", "Steve Filton", "Chris, I am going to largely I think reiterate the comments that we made at the end of the second quarter when we talked about the fact that our leverage had declined to a level that we were very comfortable with and that\u2019s when we announced our $400 million share repurchase authorization. And I think we\u2019re in largely the same place we were there now obviously since then we announced the Cygnet acquisition and dedicated about $335 million to that, but we continue to look for growth opportunities both externally and internally in both of our business segments. We announced just in the call, a small acquisition in the UK. We continue to look for other opportunities in the UK as well as other M&A opportunities in both behavioral and acute here in the U.S. and also continue to expand organically I mentioned that new behavioral beds that we\u2019ve got online for next. We talked about our new acute care hospital that we\u2019re building in Las Vegas, so we\u2019ve got a number of things going on but I think we\u2019ve also said that if we don\u2019t find sufficient sort of opportunities for external growth were also more than happy to continue to repurchase shares under the previously announced authorization. So I think from our perspective we're likely to pursue sort of all those avenues in 2015.", "Chris Rigg", "Okay and then just one follow-up. I know we've talked about the IMD exclusion and legislation around that in the past. Can you give us an update for where that stands and just some general parameters in terms of likelihood for this happening sometime in the near future? Thanks. ", "Alan Miller", "So I think that we certainly have done nothing to presume that the IMD exclusion will be lifted in the near-term certainly at least in the context of this conversation the near-term being 2015. But I think the industry in general is becoming more and more positive about the idea that from a public policy perspective that either legislatively or administratively there will be progress on this issue. As you know there is a demonstration project that's part of the Affordable Care Act that lifts the IMD exclusion and about a dozen states and we're participating in some of those states in that project. We believe that the outcome and the data from that demo project will support the idea that a broader lifting of the exclusion makes sense from a public policy perspective in terms of access and cost.", "And again as an industry we continue to lobby hard for that and that remains one of our main priorities again from a legislative/regulatory perspective. So we'll continue to work for, we continue to feel that there is positive movement there but I think it's difficult to predict with any sort of level of precision when there might be a substantive change.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc.", "Jason Gurda", "Good morning, thanks. Steve, just taking a look at the guidance you're expecting growth of about 6% to 13% and I think you did high 20%s this year and you're putting up almost double-digit revenue growth or particularly double-digit in the acute care side. Is the guidance conservative at this point? ", "Steve Filton", "Obviously I am going to tell you that I think the guidance is realistic. I will say this, I mean our performance in 2014 was really extraordinary and then we certainly view at that way and couldn't be any more pleased with it. But certainly feel it will be difficult to replicate as you sort of suggest the sort of growth that we saw in 2014. Think a good portion or a good reason for that is while we were all meaning the company as well as our peers were focused on the potential ACA impact in '14 and I think we largely anticipated that correctly.", "We didn't really anticipate the benefit we were going to get from improving economies in a number of our other markets, particularly in Texas but also in Florida and California, et cetera. And I think as we looked towards next year we are cautious about again our ability to replicate that same level of growth. I think we feel like we'll continue to see improving economies in those markets for the most part.", "Now I will also add that I think in the last month or two we've gotten a little bit more cautious about the Texas economies specifically given the pressures from oil and gas prices. I think we've step back our projections in those markets particularly. But other than that again I just think we're forecasting strong performance in '15 just not quite as robust as we saw in '14.", "Jason Gurda", "Thanks, that's helpful. Then I may have this wrong but it looks to me that the range of your guidance is a little bit wider than it has been in the past. If that's the case is there a reason for that? ", "Steve Filton", "No, honestly we felt like the range was fairly consistent, I mean made a little bit wider than what we had last year but fairly consistent with sort of the ranges that our peers were putting up and there was nothing necessarily be read into it. I think we actually think it's a reasonable range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Steve Baxter", "Hi, this is Steve Baxter on for Kevin. Many of your peers have talked about how their exchange contracting strategy has evolved for 2015 relative to the 2014. I guess could you give us a sense of the flavor of what you learned from your 2014 approach and what you've done differently for 2015? Thanks. ", "Steve Filton", "I think in our case Steve we have said and largely reflective of our experience that we were participating in almost all of the exchange products in our markets in 2014 with the couple of maybe minor exceptions. And honestly I think for the most part that's our experience in '15 again, I think that we're pleased with that. We continue to work with some payers in our markets in the context of potentially more narrow networks in which we would be a preferred provider and again I think we have a couple of minor examples of that in '15 but not as much of maybe we anticipated we would had last year. So I think again the broad description of it is that we are in virtually every product and every network every exchange product and every exchange network in all of our markets which is the couple of very my receptions.", "Steve Baxter", "Okay, thank you. Then just switching to the behavioral side, length of stay was down less than it has been for a long time. Do you think you're getting closer to stabilization or a turning point here and I guess how are you thinking about that for 2015? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "I\u2019ll answer the first part first or the last part first and that is and thinking about for 2015, I think we\u2019ve assumed another decline in length of stay at about the same rate that it has been going down and I think the reason for that is it\u2019s been difficult to sort of project this quarter to quarter, some quarters it looks the decline is slowing a little bit other quarters not so much, so we continue to project that let those length of stay pressure will continue into 15 that\u2019s what our guidance reflects. I will say that I certainly noticed in the fourth quarter that some of the decline is length of stay that we experienced was self imposed or self executed if you in the sense that I mentioned to some degree the conversion of residential beds to acute and we\u2019ve been doing that for a while into the degree that we continue to do that. We will drive the length of stay down our self was because the length of stay in our acute facility is lower than it is in our residential facility. But I do think that\u2019s reflected in that stronger revenue per day that you saw in the fourth quarter because obviously as we shift beds and therefore days in admissions from residential to acute we\u2019ll see a drop in length of day but we ought to see a rise in revenue per day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Paula Torch", "Steve I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on your expectations for 2015 on maybe the safe facility revenue and volume expectations by segment, can you help us or pass that up for us?", "Steve Filton", "Okay, great, thank you, Steve, for that color. I just have one quick last one on Medicaid expansion. I was just wondering if you could share some of your thoughts with us on the potential for more states to expand, in particular Florida, just given Tennessee and Utah reaching dead ends or so it seems for now. What does that mean for Florida if anything and maybe some of your thoughts there? Thanks. ", "Alan Miller ", "Sure Paula, I think on the acute side our expectation of revenue growth is probably in that 6% to 7% range which I think in turn yield EBITDA growth and probably be 8% to 10% range. On the behavioral side, I think that\u2019s a little bit lower and probably more in the range of 5% and 5.5% on the revenue side which translates to 7.5% to 8% on the EBITDA side.", "Paula Torch", "Okay, great. Thank you very much for that color. Then just going back to the acute metrics, how sustainable do you think these trends are in the first quarter in 2015 given the guidance that you just gave us? Is there anything about the surgical volumes that were so good in the fourth quarter that would indicate those would continue to be strong? ", "Steve Filton", "I think the way that we went about budgeting for 2015 was really not to assume that anyone quarter the year was particularly representative and particularly I think not necessarily taken the approach that the fourth quarter exit rate was the rate to use for the full year 15. We had a couple of very strong surgical volume quarters in 14. The second quarter was really strong. The fourth quarter was really strong. I think even in retrospect it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to identify exactly why that was, so I will say that I think the 2015 guidance presumes a more modest sort to surgical experience that when we experienced early in Q4 and something that\u2019s more reflective of our full year experience.", "And to the fair I think the year has started off at least in January with kind of more muted surgical volume and there is a lot of at least speculation in the back half of 14 that there is -- so hospitals to some degree would experience a surgeon volume at the end of the year given the increasing prevalence of high deductable plans and that really might influence patient behavior as people exhausted their co-pays and deductibles late in the year and would take advantage of that. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what really drove the dynamic that we experienced but we certainly has a real strong surgical quarter in Q4 and a little bit weaker as 2015 started, so we at least not inconsistent with that theory. So again I think we just been more kind of rationale or muted about what our 2015 volume should look and I think that what\u2019s reflected in the guidance.", "Paula Torch", "Okay, great, thank you, Steve, for that color. I just have one quick last one on Medicaid expansion. I was just wondering if you could share some of your thoughts with us on the potential for more states to expand, in particular Florida, just given Tennessee and Utah reaching dead ends or so it seems for now. What does that mean for Florida if anything and maybe some of your thoughts there? Thanks. ", "Steve Filton", "Well again I\u2019ll sort of give the short answer is we certainly have not assumed that any new states new for us would expand Medicaid in 2015 which again for UHS I think really means that we have assumed neither Texas nor Florida would expand in 2015. I think we have had a view really from the beginning of ACA implementation that in the long run all states would ultimately participate in Medicaid expansion because it\u2019s just made economic sense for them to do so. Obviously I think in the lot of cases economic sense is being overwhelmed or pressured by political considerations and I think we find those very hard to sort of measure and calculate. So we continue again in our state hospital associations and other forums to work for expansion in those states and then which we operate that have not have not expanded yet. Again don't expect anything necessarily to happen in '15 as you suggest there has been a kind of a struggle in a couple of the states that have tried it. So we just continue to press the issue. Again as an industry especially with both our profit and especially not profit peers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Thanks, good morning. The quarterly progression was pretty lumpy in 2014. I know you don't give quarterly guidance but any general direction on how you'd expect or see it playing out in 2015? ", "Steve Filton", "Ralph frankly part -- one of the reasons why we don't give quarterly guidance as we think it's difficult to do, and I appreciate the fact that folks in your position are forced to do so. I suggest that before you have alluded to the fact that we had as you describe some lumpiness in 2014. Honestly we were unable to predict that. I guess the best advice that I would give to people is to budget 2015 or think about 2015 a bit more ratably and not necessarily try and mimic the sort of seasonal or quarterly trends that we experienced in 2014. Because I think in our own minds it's not obvious that those trends would be repeated in that same fashion in '15.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay, that's fair. And then you've obviously talked about acuity in surgical mix. Can you talk a little bit about payer mix and what you saw there between the various buckets? ", "Steve Filton", "Yes I think we basically fell like our payer mix strength which of course I think at the end of the day was really what drove the outsize performance of particularly of the acute division in 2014 really was relatively stable throughout the year. Now the character of it changed some in the sense that in the beginning of the year the payer mix improvement was clearly more weighted to Medicaid, more Medicaid patients and managed Medicaid patients and I think was a function of Medicaid expansion in some of our large states like Nevada, like California and the District of Columbia.", "And then in the back half of the year we saw a bit more of a ship from the Medicaid impact of the commercial exchange impact. But just generally I think the payer mix was the payer mix improvement was really a constant for us in 2014. And as I said generally the biggest and primary driver of the really strong performance. And again I think as we answered -- answer your question before about the guidance, I think we expect that that payer mix improvement continues into 2015 and our guidance reflects that, but that is does not necessarily continue at the same rate. And certainly one of the sort of muting dynamics that we is that we don't have any new states as we just talked about that we'll participate in Medicaid expansion next year. So to some degree the Medicaid improvement certainly levels off pretty considerably in '15.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. And then one more if I could, I think charity and discounts were up in the fourth quarter. Just trying to understand a little bit the dynamics around that, why that would maybe be the case, and what if anything you're doing as patients present to get them signed up? ", "Steve Filton", "I think that, I'll answer the question a couple of different ways. And I think that in terms of signing patients up like many I would probably speculate most of our peers. We've developed a pretty rigorous process to make sure that we have certified counselors in all of our facilities and that we're both proactively and reactively responding to patients who come to our facilities uninsured and trying to find the most effective and efficient way to get them insured whether that's enrollment in Medicaid or through the commercial exchange opportunity, we're doing all of those things.", "Now at the end of the day I think as said most hospitals are probably building something similar. As far as the swings in charity and the debt I know I am sound like a broken record when I say this. But we find it difficult even internally to explain some of the specifics movements between those buckets. And I always make the point that as a company we analyze uncompensated sort of single unified bucket, and we include bad debt and uninsured discount.", "And again I think if you look at those numbers on a combined basis, it reinforces the comment that I made before which is there has been a significant decline in those numbers in 2014 throughout the year and it's reflective of the ACA and improving economic dynamics that we've already talked about.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "That's fair, Steve. I guess from my perspective I'm just trying to understand the dynamic of when you offer the charity care there's no pressure on the individual to have to pay for it. So I guess my thought process was why wouldn't there be more of a push to bad debt even if you have to write it off the pressure on the individual would ultimately then perhaps force them to consider getting on the roles via either exchanges and/or Medicaid versus just writing it off right up front. Am I not thinking about that right? Or would there be an initiative by -- because I think in the past you've talked about letting each of the individual hospitals determine that. Would that make sense in terms of trying to even push that number lower? ", "Steve Filton", "I think the balance that we and all hospitals walk is trying to reasonable about what is a reasonable level of income and assets poor patient to quality for charity cares, so somebody comes in the hospital with no health insurance and a very low income level and no assets and the general decision is made based on those criteria that there really is no point in making an effort to collect from those patients. I think your question is what don\u2019t you try and collect from as many patients as you possibly can and I would answer in two ways I mean I that one from sort of just public policy perspective we recognized that for people at a very low income level with little assets, it really is just too much of a burden for them to pay some of these bills and then secondly I think from a business perspective it\u2019s an effort that we have found can consume a fair amount of time and money and really yield very little, so again we try and have a charity policy that I think is fairly consistent with the industry that tries to walk that line and collect from people who really can\u2019t afford to pay but really doesn\u2019t try and collect from that portion of the population that really can\u2019t.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "Yes, thanks, good morning. Steve I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments I thought I've heard from you recently on the state Medicaid budgets and pressures in 2015. Just kind of giving us color on why you might be concerned and are you baking in anything in guidance that might not have happened or are these already events underway? ", "Steve Filton", "So Ana I think that the comments that you\u2019re alluding to our comments that I made consistent with what I\u2019ve said earlier in the call that over the last couple of months we have backed off our projections and guidance for our Texas markets and to be fair I don\u2019t think we've seen currently a lot of softness in those market but are just anticipating the possibility of such given the fact that the Texas economy seems to be slowing and again we could see that softness in the number of ways through slightly deteriorating payer mix or slightly lower volumes or through some pressure from either in traditional Medicaid rates or some of the special reimbursement program that we benefit from and so those of the comments you\u2019re thinking about. So in general we didn\u2019t make any specific cuts or assume specific cuts in Texas reimbursement, but just sort of steps back or Texas earnings projects for next year a little bit and on a broad basis in expectation that we might feel some pressure in that economy in 2015 that we clearly did not feel in 14.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. So it sounds like it's more a second order aspect that could happen at the state level rather than just currently insured consumers? ", "Steve Filton", "I think that\u2019s right and also I think it\u2019s current because I mean the fact in the matter is that our Texas markets are really tend not be markets that are directly tie to the oil and gas industry markets like Dallas or West Texas. We tend to be in markets that are sort of more indirectly impacted by the overall Texas economy.", "Ana Gupte", "Then just switching gears to the March 4 hearings in SCOTUS as per your recent discussions with the lobby groups and with Congress and the state officials, what are you expecting or hearing in terms of if this thing gets subsidies get caught off what might happen and who might take the lead in addressing this?", "Steve Filton", "Yes so first of all obviously I mean while we follow this closely as to all of you, we certainly don\u2019t feel like we have any particularly valuable insight into the how this might turnout and so we\u2019re just continued to follow it very closely. If the Supreme Court were to rule against the subsidies, we would certainly work very hard in the various states that we operate in that they don\u2019t state exchange at the moment to get them established but again I think that at least in the short run we acknowledge that would be sort of a difficult hurdle to overcome. So obviously we\u2019ve done nothing in our guidance as I don\u2019t think any of our peers have to reflect the Supreme Court decision if it were to be unfavorable, our guidance presumes status quo, but if decision is in a negative one from our perspective we\u2019ll just work very aggressively with our state associations to try and accomplish the source of works around that people have identified and written about it. And I\u2019ll make the obvious comment here that I think as a company we are less exposed to this than our peers since two thirds of our earnings come from the behavioral business where I think we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve got a much of ACA benefit and therefore really not exposed if this would be a bit of headwind into 2015 or maybe beyond.", "Ana Gupte", "And this 1% you think is an appropriate estimate for exposure, 1%-ish or less? ", "Steve Filton", "I think a number of those sell side estimates have been that are the amount of our overall earnings that are subject to states that have just federal exchanges or maybe 1% to 2% and I think that number tends to be lower for us than for our peers again because it's really just specific to the acute care business. But I think that's a pretty accurate guesstimate of what that impact would be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Darren Lehrich with Deutsche Bank.", "Josh Kalenderian", "This is actually Josh in for Darren. Can you just first talk about your UK pipeline and if you're seeing much over there market?", "Steve Filton", "I think that the UK acquisition landscape is in some respect only what is like here in the U.S. it's fairly fragmented, we obviously as I said just in my prepared remarks announced a small deal of kind of one off acquisition, we're perusing de novo development project right now in the UK and I think pursuing kind of a hole array of other potential possibilities. I think we described when we announced the Signet deal that we thought this was a landscape that was right for continued expansion and was sort of one of the motivations for getting into that markets.", "So our view of that has not really changed, I mean we've been enthusiastic about the early results from the existing facilities that we bought in the UK and remain enthusiastic about the growth opportunities as well, which I think will be both sort of again organic, inorganic, some small over time maybe some large.", "Josh Kalenderian", "And then just in terms of your guidance, can you maybe talk about some of the bigger swing factor that either gets you to the high end low end of that and maybe the level of capital deployment you guys are assuming.", "Steve Filton", "So from a capital deployment perspective we've assumed as we said in our press release and I said it in my remarks somewhere between $375 million and $400 million of CapEx and that's fairly similar to this year's experience. We have historically never included share repurchase assumptions in our guidance and we have not done so this year as well. as far as other sort of pushes and pulls if you will, I think we've already talked about a couple, from a special reimbursements perspective and we include in that sort of broad category -- char there is DSRIP funding in Texas, finding in taxes, provider tax and UPL arrangements. I think overall that reimbursement decline. So little bit in 2015 maybe $5 million or $10 million. I think that we have some dilution in; I assume dilution is probably not the right word. But we had a big improvement in our to market in '14 that facility opened in late in '13 we had a fair amount of startup costs and start up losses and now this year we've been profitable. And so as a consequence that was a big swing, we'll continue to improve in that Temecula market but the improvement in '15 just is not going to be as greater as it was in '14, so depending on how you think about that's a little bit of headwind.", "I think those are the only couple of things that I think we have not mentioned yet, but I would call out otherwise I think it's largely kind of steady as it goes other than sort of what we already talked about where I think we've just been a little bit more muted in how much payer mix improvement we can expect in '15 versus what were able to achieve in '14.", "Josh Kalenderian", "All right, great, thanks a lot. Then just lastly it just looks like from the 10-K there was some additional developments in terms of your ongoing investigation. So maybe can you just provide us with an update on what's going on there and if there's anything new? ", "Steve Filton", "I think that the only real change in our disclosure in the 10-K was the added disclosure that we had received a request from the government from information for a one, incremental facility in Salt Lake City. Other than that I would just sort of broadly say that the investigation continues, we have had some preliminary conversations with the government but I think it's fair to say for anyone who in hospital and I think most hospitals have encountered some version of this process that it takes a long time and I think we would say we're in the early stages and it would be difficult for us to either project with any precision the ultimate resolution and outcome or even the timing of such.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman", "Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One of your peers noted some uncertainty regarding Texas uncompensated care payments. Can you maybe discuss if you've got any uncertainty or range of variability around those payments? ", "Steve Filton", "So I think Gary I hope that what you're referencing is HCA has some of these waiver programs and they had originally reserved for some of those payments when CMS had sort of targeted the earlier in the year and then when CMS sort of lifted there, their deferral of payments, having recognized those payments et cetera. We really", " had none of that back and forth because we were not -- we do not have program in any of the same counties that ACA did that had been sort of targeted by CMS, so I would say that for the most part we have assume that our again Texas special reimbursement which includes those program and DSH and DSRIP will continue next year pretty consistently again with the one caveat that in total and that includes all the states we operate that special reimbursement decline by $5 million or $10 million next year.", "Gary Lieberman", "Okay, great. And then maybe be interested to get Alan's thoughts on the potential for a congressional fix maybe even ahead of a Supreme Court decision or if the government loses the SCOTUS case?", "Alan Miller", "Yes I think that I would be very simple to have a fixed legislatively but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. If you\u2019re following what\u2019s happening with the Republican Party at the moment in all the meetings that\u2019s not going to happen, but that would be very simple, but the Government said that they have not developed the plan B which I can\u2019t believe. So there will be a number of works around. I think the thing to focus on is that 5 million people will lose insurance immediately and I think the public policy on both Democrats, Republicans, etc., that those people should be covered. So I think there will at some point a fixed for this -- should it come negatively from the Supreme Court.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank Morgan", "Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of random ones here. On your ED -- I'm just curious about ED volume growth, maybe with and without the flu impact in the quarter?", "Alan Miller", "So Frank I am not exactly sure about the flu impact ED volumes, I think flu tends to impact ED volumes sort of disproportionally more than admission, I will say that I think our general sense of the flu impact on admission was probably no more than sort of 30 or 40 basis points.", "Frank Morgan", "Okay. And what about just ED volumes in general? Do you have a number there?", "Steve Filton", "The ED volumes were very strong and we definitely saw heighted ED activity as a result of flu but I think also we saw heighted activity just in general and again as I think our admission numbers reflect I mean it was a very strong volume quarter end. Generally admission growth tends to move in proportion to ED volumes and I think that was we experienced in Q4.", "Frank Morgan", "And then secondly on surgical volumes, were there any particular areas where surgery was more strong, particularly on the inpatient side any particular type of procedure that you saw more volume? ", "Alan Miller", "No I think it was really kind of cross the various lines so that was not necessarily isolated to cardiology or orthopedics or even general surgery. It was really -- again as I think I mentioned or in response to a question before when you see this kind of strength I think it tends to be pretty broad based I think all to get to these kinds of numbers unless you have real broad based strength.", "Frank Morgan", "And then finally are there any other developments that will be carrying a drag, a startup drag in 2015 that's built into your guidance? Thanks.", "Alan Miller", "No I think I was trying in response to Joshua question before identified the couple of large sort of pushes unfold that I can think of, but other than I don\u2019t think there are other big headwinds and tailwinds that we have not yet identified.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice", "Hi everybody. Just a couple of questions if I could, I know you talked about -- you've talked around health reform on a couple of answers already but do you have a Q4 run rate of ACA benefit? I know it's maybe not precise but just in general can you break that out between what you think is the Medicaid benefit versus the exchange benefit?", "Alan Miller ", "So AJ, I think that we tried and again caveat this by saving that I think even more so than our peers I think we\u2019ve also described the process of discretely identifying the ACA benefit as less or more emphasize than maybe some people think it might be, but I would generally say our best efforts sort of quantify the ACA impact for 2014 at about $40 million or something like that and I think that the quarterly progression of that there has been somewhat of an increase as the year has gone on and as more and more enrollment has taken place in both Medicaid and commercial exchanges, but it hasn\u2019t been terribly dramatics so I would say if you think about that 40 million distributed throughout the year maybe we had 8 million in the first quarter and 12 million in the fourth quarter something like that just in terms of order of magnitude.", "A.J. Rice", "Okay and then the split between exchange versus Medicaid?", "Alan Miller", "Yes, I think as we mentioned earlier again for the year we\u2019ve think it\u2019s probably about two-third Medicaid related and one-third commercial and I think that shifted I mean that was even more pronounced early in the year and then it got a little bit weighted more to commercial as the year went on, but I think ultimately it was about two-third, one-third split for the year.", "A.J. Rice", "Okay. And you mentioned California provider and the Texas; specifically on California provider I know there's two pieces to it, the managed care piece and the fee-for-service. Are your booking both of those now and do you have both those assumed in your guidance or how much are you showing versus how much are you keeping potentially on contingency? ", "Steve Filton", "Prior to this I think we identified our potential benefit from California UPL to be in sort of $8 million or $9 million range for 2014. We recorded and recognized $4 million benefit in Q4 and that's because as you describe in [AJ] that piece of the program that was approved. And so we've only recorded the income associated with the piece of the government has approved, we have guided or included in our guidance for '15 comparable number and so if there is an approval of the second piece of that program that would be an upside when it gets approved.", "A.J. Rice", "And the similar order of magnitude they're about the same?", "Steve Filton", "It would be another sort of $4 million or $5 million for '14 and a similar number for '15.", "A.J. Rice", "And then just maybe my last one, I know sometimes at the end of the year you have some AR backup in a couple of states. I know Illinois and Texas are notorious for some of theirs. Did you have any of that and how much did that impact cash flow and when do you think you might see that money come through if it is there? ", "Steve Filton", "I don't have that in front of me AJ but we actually disclose those numbers pretty specifically in the 10-K, so you can find them there. But I would generally say that in both cases we actually are in pretty decent shape in both those states, still had outstanding receivables, but not anywhere near the sort of the balances when they were at their highest levels.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with Citi.", "Gary Taylor", "Hi, good morning. Just a few quick ones. Steve, is there a specific EBITDA range that ties to the earnings guidance that you'd be willing to provide?", "Steve Filton", "Gary we have historically not sort of provided EBITDA guidance and honestly I don't have the numbers in front of me. Generally people came back into it but I don't have.", "Gary Taylor", "You gave us some same-store stuff to get pretty close. Is there a case mix number to what kind of support all of this surgical growth or is it more in the commercial side and not really reflect in case mix.", "Steve Filton", "I think it's actually both, I mean I don't have our actual case mix data in front of me but I do recall that case mix as you would expect with surgical volume was up both Medicare case mix and our overall case mix, because again I think I would make the point that the surgical strength that we saw in the quarter was intended to be across all payers.", "Gary Taylor", "Last question, I don't think I heard you comment unless I missed it just on uninsured volumes overall. On the acute side is there a percentage decline or a percent of admissions versus last year that you could share? ", "Steve Filton", "You are right Gary, I didn't specifically sort of speak to that metric other than to say that I think we've seen a pretty steady decline and I think that decline is sort of we've seen a decline probably between 8% and 10% in our uninsured volumes pretty steadily drop here now. Here is a little bit of quarterly variation but I think for the year it sort of comes to that level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.", "Whit Mayo", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just, Steve I know you guys exclude the IT incentive payments and costs from your numbers but can you share what you're spending in terms of CapEx in 2014 from those IT conversions and is there a thought about 2015 and do you have an idea what you think that the normalized recurring expenses are to just simply maintain those systems? ", "Steve Filton", "Sure, so we began the implementation of EHR in 2010, and I think have disclosed previously that originally projected we spent a couple of hundred million dollars and I think that's what we spend, I think most of that spending was over the probably four year period from 2010 to 2013. So actually I don't think there is a lot of IT spending particularly related to the EHR implementation I either of '14 numbers and certainly I don\u2019t think envision a lot of it in '15. I think we're largely through that process; there are small components of it that are bringing enhanced around position order entry and things like that. But again the amount of incremental capital expenditure is pretty small.", "Whit Mayo", "Couple of hundred million is that 200 million 300 million?", "Steve Filton", "No I am sorry, should be more precise when I said couple of hundred, I mean 200 million is the number that we talked about as being our investment obviously a substantial amount of that was recouped through the EHR reimbursement.", "Whit Mayo", "So spread sort of evenly across four years or maybe 50 million of CapEx ballpark.", "Steve Filton", "And I think and again even though these are completely unrelated and if you look at our overall capital spend its remained a pretty constant from '13 to '14 to '15, and I think what has happened although as I say unrelated is that $50 million a year in EHR spending has been replaced by additional behavioral beds spend.", "Whit Mayo", "Yes, and I guess the question that I'm going to get to is that as we think about CapEx over the 2016 and 2017 time frame, the IT spend has gone away, you will continue to add beds although probably not at the same rate and you've got the Las Vegas hospital coming online. So I guess I'm just -- do you think that this CapEx number is one that you can hold for the next few years or will we see it go up? ", "Alan Miller", "So 15 I think it will sort of third year in a row that we\u2019ve run at sort of 375 to 400 range, and I would say that it has included a few years of some EHR spending it included an increase behavioral bed component. All those years have included some new acute hospitals for several year that was the Temecula facility and then for the next couple year that will be the Las Vegas facility, so I think it will tell you in our own model we continue to use a CapEx place holder at about that same level.", "Operator", "So we have no further questions in the queue at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Okay we want to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everybody again at the end of first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Filton. Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.", "During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimate, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in those forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015..", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.80 for the quarter.", "After adjusting each quarter\u2019s reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of Electronic Health Record applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night earnings release.", "Adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 20% to $186.6 million or a $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to $155.6 million or a $1.55 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.", "On a same facility basis in our acute division, revenues during the second quarter of 2015 increased 8.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 3.2% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 19.8% during the second quarter of 2015 from 18.7% during the second quarter of 2014.", "On a same facility basis, net revenues in our Behavioral Health division increased 5.1% during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to the second quarter of 2014.

Operating margins for our Behavioral Health hospitals owned for more than a year were 28.5% and 28.4% during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.", "For the six months ended June 30, 2015, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $532 million over the $458 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2014.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015, as compared to 53 days during the second quarter of 2014.", "At June 30, 2015, our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 42.8%, as compared to 47.0% at June 30, 2014. We spent $81 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2015 and $171 million during the first six months of 2015.", "Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2015, we are increasing our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share.", "This revised guidance which excludes the expected Electronic Health Records impact for the year represents an increase of approximately 9% to 10% from the previously provided range of $6.15 to $6.55 per diluted share.", "This guidance range which is subject to certain conditions including those set forth in last night's earnings release also excludes the impact of future items if applicable that are non-recurring or non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, gains on sales of assets and businesses, costs related to extinguishment of debt, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, impairments of long-lived assets, impact of share repurchases and other material amounts that may be reflected in our financial statements that relate to prior periods.", "We would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch", "Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me?", "Steve Filton", "We hear you fine.", "Matthew Borsch", "Okay. I wanted to just ask on, if you could comment on the factors impacting pricing on the acute care side and what your outlook is on that front for the second half of the year?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Matt. So, the 3 plus percent increase in revenue per adjusted admission was somewhat lower than we ran in the first quarter, but still very much within our expectations. I think it continues to be driven mostly by an improved payor mix, less uninsured patients, clearly our total uncompensated care decline for the quarter as it has the last six quarters now.", "But we are also, I think, in the second quarter had a pretty difficult comparison with the second quarter of last year. So we were -- we again -- we are pleased with the 3 plus percent revenue per unit growth.", "A lot of it being driven by increased government business Medicaid -- more Medicaid patients as result of the continued Medicaid expansion and in those states that are participating.", "And also increased Medicare utilization, which we reported as well in the first quarter of last year, not sure, I have a terribly insightful explanation for that, but I know that, some of the managed care companies have reported a similar dynamic, but we definitely saw increased Medicare utilization the quarter as well. So all those factors I think contributed to the acute care revenue per unit growth.", "Matthew Borsch", "Wouldn't the, I'm sorry, I am missing something here, but wouldn't the, I mean, the higher Medicaid volumes displacing sort of charity care uninsured, that make sense how that's going to positively impact the revenue per unit? But on the Medicare side, is that just sort of the same mix even though obviously Medicare isn't expressly offsetting uninsured, I mean, Medicare is lower certainly than commercial when you think about the pricing mix?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. No. I think you make the right point and I probably shouldn\u2019t have been Matt. So, yeah, I think, to the degree that we've got increased insured business whether it's government or commercial versus uninsured business, clearly that's driving the overall revenue per unit up to the degree that we got more Medicare and slightly less commercial that that tempers it some, yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Matthew Borsch", "Okay. Okay. Sorry, I just wanted to make sure, I wasn't missing something and one last, in terms of the incremental volume improvement and you made the comments on Medicare, which is interesting? But do you still generally see that being two-thirds core economy and one-third ACA?", "Steve Filton", "Matt, we talked about this I think in Q1 and I think from our perspective as each quarter passes we sort of view the exercise of trying to parse out where volume growth is being generated whether its ACA related or economy related becomes more and more difficult, and honestly from our perspective sort of less and less meaningful.", "So I think in this quarter we effectively sort of stop doing that analysis and really are much more interested in things like geographies and service lines and payor mix and that sort of thing and really a focus a lot less on trying to sort of parse out exactly what the ACA related.", "Matthew Borsch", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.", "Michael Ha", "Hi. This is Michael Ha on for Sarah. Just kind of following up on\u2026", "Alan Miller", "Please speak up.", "Michael Ha", "Hi. Can you hear me?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. That\u2019s better.", "Michael Ha", "Hi. So, this is Michael Ha for Sarah. Just kind of following up on Matt\u2019s question, same facility acute care adjusted admissions growth grew by 5.7% -- the same growth in both 1Q and 2Q. In 1Q, you mentioned those numbers, especially volume counts would be difficult to sustain moving through the year. How should we be looking at this for the back half of the year?", "Alan Miller", "Look. And I wish that we had perfect insight into that dynamic. You are absolutely right. So we\u2019ve run 5.7% adjusted admission growth for the first half of the year. That is really significant improvement over what we've been running but I think even if look at in the broader context and look at it back over multiple years in the decade or two, I mean that\u2019s at a high-end that our business has run at in it sort of best day.", "So I think to some degree we have the view that it\u2019s going to be difficult to sustain that level of growth. We -- obviously we work hard to do so and are focused on doing it. But I think to be realistic about it and I think in the way that we crafted our guidance for the balance of the year, we presume that that growth slows some. And I was speaking with somebody last night and made the point that look if we think, acute-care same-store revenue growth is 3% or 3.5% in the back half of the year.", "If you would have asked us that a year ago, I think, asked just about anybody observing the acute care business, they would have been pleased with that sort of growth. So I think we're looking for that volume growth to moderate some in the back half of the year although we will certainly work hard to maintain what we've experienced in the first half.", "Michael Ha", "Thank you. Also, debt-to-EBITDA this quarter was lower sequentially. And you guys had mentioned previously that you wouldn't let that leverage continue any lower from current levels. Taking this into account and seeing that your M&A activity has been slower year-to-date versus peers, how do you see the pipeline compared to last year -- smaller or just as big?", "Alan Miller", "I think it\u2019s always hard to judge but I do think that we have a sense that there is sort of an increased level of activity. We seem to be reviewing a number of deals, potential deals in both the business segments. It's always hard to predict what might materialize or not materialize. But certainly I think we've been of the mind that it looks to us like there may be more opportunities in the next 12 months than they have been in some time.", "Michael Ha", "Great, great. Thank you. And just one last question, on the behavioral front, you saw an increase in length of stays sequentially. Is your conversion of residential beds to acute beds completed? And could that be the driver of the increase or do you believe this is more related to stabilizing trend of length of stay that's starting to pick up?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah. So I think you have to be careful at what you look at. If you look at length of stay a same-store basis, it\u2019s still down 3.5% or so from last year. If you look at it on a total divisional basis, it\u2019s up. But I think that\u2019s largely because it includes the U.K. facilities which clearly have a longer length of stay.", "So I would sort of echo many of the statements that we made in Q1, which is we still see length of stay declining some. Although we also believe that some of that decline is kind of self-imposed or self initiated as we convert more beds from residential to acute. So which I think is reflected in the fact that even though we have lower length of stay and lower patient days, we have higher revenue per day. The 4 plus percent revenue per day growth is, I think, among the best that we\u2019ve seen in some time. And again, I think is reflective of our efforts to convert from residential to acute beds.", "Michael Ha", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice", "Hello, everybody. Maybe first I'll ask you to comment a little bit on the geographies. Obviously with the strong results you're probably seeing strength across the board. But is there anything to call out on geographies? In particular, maybe in addition to Vegas and Texas which we always talk about, anything on the new facilities and how they're coming on line that you've -- in the last -- that you added in the last year or so?", "Alan Miller", "Sure A.J. So I think your comment is well taken in the sense, that I think when you have almost 6% in same-store adjusted admission growth and over 8% same-store revenue growth in the acute division, you basically, I think have to assume and I think it will be correct to assume that there is pretty strong performance across the portfolio. It would be difficult if there weren\u2019t to post those kind of numbers.", "On the other hand, what we did in Q1 was we called out the performance of the Vegas market and the Riverside County market in California. Those two markets again I would say outperform the divisional averages in Q2 and that includes sort of to your question the Temecula facility, which has been open for about a year and half, maybe a little bit longer at this point.", "But I think what's really impressive about that Riverside County market is not only Temecula is doing quite a bit better than it did last year, probably not a surprise and so we\u2019re just ramping up but our other hospitals in that market are also doing better. So that\u2019s a real strong market in addition to the Vegas market which continues to outperform. And I think that's also within our expectations in the sense that through several years of the recession, we talked about what a drag the Vegas market was for us. And we were so used to it being an outperforming market that the difficulties and high unemployment in that market were a real struggle for us.", "But as the market has improved and as unemployment has dropped in the Las Vegas market like 6.5% from the high 15% at the height of the recession, I think our business has in turn improved both volume wise and payer mix wise. And so we see that.", "The flipside is, I think the Texas market was a little bit slower. Again. I think that's a relative term. It\u2019s still up. It\u2019s still has positive volume growth but in terms of our different geographies, it\u2019s probably performing under the average whereas Vegas and California are performing over the average.", "A.J. Rice", "Okay. And maybe just switching gears for a follow-up on the psych business side. Since the first quarter there's been this proposed rule out of CMS mainly related to Medicaid managed care, but it does incorporate some language around at least partially alleviating the IMD exclusion that's impacted your psych business. Can you give us a little flavor for what the impact of that would be if it goes ahead and gets implemented? And any thoughts on timing on when we might see that actually happen?", "Alan Miller", "Sure. Well, as you suggest, I mean that rule was issued, I believe, at the beginning -- early June if I'm remembering correctly. And as a consequence, CMS can issue a finalized rule until early August. And then that sort of the earliest they could do it, they can certainly do it after that. What the rule would do and I think it was pressed for quite frankly by the manage Medicaid companies is it would allow those companies to contract with whoever they chose based on certain conditions. But they would be able to contract for adult Medicaid patients regardless of the IMD exclusion rule.", "So we certainly believe that if that rule is finalized in your anything close to the form that it was proposed and depending on when it is effective, we will get a -- certainly get a benefit from that. Difficult for us to quantify what that benefit is because we never had those patients really before us. So it's mostly guesstimate work at this point but we\u2019re certainly looking forward to the final rule being issued and starting to contract with those manage Medicaid companies for their adult Medicaid patients. We view that as a nice potential tailwind for this business. So we're anxiously awaiting the issuance of the rule.", "A.J. Rice", "Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.", "Steve Filton", "Good morning, A.J.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Josh Raskin", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just on the expense side of things. Overall seeing good control there, I'm just curious, are you seeing anything in terms of wages in your markets, and any market specifically, any pressure, et cetera, on wage growth?", "Steve Filton", "Look, I think it\u2019s always a competitive market, Josh and I\u2019m hoping that's really changed. But I think if you look at it, one of the reasons why acute care margins are up is that when revenue increases and when volume increases the way that it does, there is just the nature of the hospital operating model, there's four efficient providers that\u2019s usually a fair amount of operating leverage to the exercise. And I think our operators deserve credit for doing so.", "So yeah, I mean, clearly as a percentage of revenue, our salaries are down and we\u2019re exercising some of that leverage. Even though I do believe that there is a fair amount of wage pressure in some of our markets.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. But it sounded like, Steve, you don't think that's changed, that wage pressure, nothing you would call out relative to say last year?", "Steve Filton", "No, I don\u2019t there has been significant developments now.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. And then on the psych side of the business, have you guys thought about other lines, ancillary sort of services beyond just the operation of the actual psych facility?", "Steve Filton", "So I'm not exactly sure of what that implies. I mean, again, we do offer a wide array of behavioral services. We tend to talk about them in terms of acute and residential. But we\u2019re one of the largest provider of specialty behavioral services and have been for a long time specializing in things, like eating disorders and sexual trauma and all kinds of other specialties.", "And so we continue to do that. And I think we will continue to do so. I know that you know addiction treatment is kind of a hot topic in the industry. But we've been -- we probably have eight or nine facilities that are dedicated to a CD and addiction treatment. We also have for a long time now had a real emphasis on supporting behavioral disorders within the military. We have what we call our Patriot Support Program and that is a program that is fairly widespread throughout the division.", "So in terms of service lines, I think we touch on most of them and continue to look for ways to expand them. Autism is another one that we\u2019ve clearly emphasized more in the last few years.", "In terms of other behavioral-related services, we had outpatient services in the number of our markets, not really sure what else you might be alluding to. But we\u2019re always open to ways as the largest behavioral inpatient provider in the country always looking for ways to enhance and kind of make that position more robust. So I think we\u2019re open to just about everything.", "Josh Raskin", "Yes. I was thinking outpatient and addiction treatment, etcetera, so that's very helpful. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.", "Chris Rigg", "Good morning. Thanks. I know at this point you're kind of saying it's a fruitless exercise to try to isolate ACA-driven strength, but at the same time, I guess people are still trying to get a sense for how much that could be helping you out in the industry. So is it possible to sort of -- when you think about the pockets of volume strength, commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, where the relative outperformance was in those buckets, where you saw the most pronounced improvement year-to-year volume trends? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean, and I suspect my answer was still be unsatisfactory for you, Chris, in the sense that, I think what we\u2019ve said for a while is that look we assume that the growth in our Medicaid patient base and utilization is related at least in large part to Medicaid expansion. We see it quite clearly most dramatically in those states, Nevada, California, the District of Columbia that have participated in Medicaid expansion.", "Although as others have noted, we've seen Medicaid utilization increases in our non-expansion states as well, I guess most people referred to that as the woodworker fact and we certainly have seen that as well. Some of the commercial growth clearly comes from expansion patients. That\u2019s the trickiest part for us. It has not always been easy for us to identify exactly who is a commercial exchange patient and who is just a regular commercial patient. So that\u2019s where I think we've always felt was the greatest level of imprecision.", "And then as I said in the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve clearly seen an increase in our Medicare utilization, which is difficult for us quite frankly to attribute either to the ACA impact or quite frankly to economic improvement only because historically our Medicare utilization has been relatively insensitive to those sort of factors. But that\u2019s kind of where we've seen our payer mix go.", "Chris Rigg", "Okay. And then one big picture question. I guess with King pretty well behind us, there's a theory that that's a catalyst for additional states to opt into Medicaid?", "Steve Filton", "Go ahead, Chris.", "Chris Rigg", "Sorry. That's a catalyst for states to opt into Medicaid expansion sooner rather than later. I guess could you give us your take as to whether that really is a game-changer, and that you will see states move to expand Medicaid over the near term versus just keep delaying it? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean, honestly, Chris, I wish I could predict this very accurately. I mean, in lot of our case, I think you're really talking about a couple of states that really make the difference. For us the two states that have not chosen to participate in Medicaid expansion that I think would make a significant difference in our acute care operations would be Florida and Texas. I think all sorts of people have speculated on the likelihood that those states might or might not choose to do so in the future.", "I don't know whether the Supreme Court ruling really makes that more likely or not. I don't think we used to have a view that in either of those states that Medicaid expansion is going to take place imminently. So we continue to work for it along with the state hospital associations and others in those states, but I wouldn\u2019t make a prediction as to how likely that is.", "Chris Rigg", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking the question here. So I just want to come back a little bit to the question earlier about the capital deployment. And I guess you talk about interest in other I guess areas in psych, but is there anything on the acute care side in terms of the deals that you might be considering? Or maybe outside of acute, any sort of outpatient sites you're also looking to add? Or any color around the capital deployment here, or whether maybe you're more focused on increasing your CapEx spending?", "Steve Filton", "So Joanna, just to be clear about what I said, what I was clear about saying that we have seen an increased number of opportunities in both of the business segment, both acute and behavioral. And I think it's in both cases sort of across the continuum. Meaning, it\u2019s hospitals it maybe outpatient facilities, it maybe physician type practices, and we are exploring all those items.", "I think the landscape of healthcare is such that it's changing and that payers and employers are looking for more comprehensive and coordinated continuum of care and looking for sort of the ability to go to one or two providers, who can really kind of sort of provide that. So we are very focused on that in both of the divisions.", "And I think that it creates I think a universe of opportunities that is broader than what we necessarily have been used to for the last few years. So we will say now again I -- as I also said before, I think it's always difficult to predict how this is going to sort out and what will really become actionable and what won't. But I think we\u2019re very focused on what those opportunities might be again in both business segments.", "Joanna Gajuk", "All right. And then on the -- more on the policy side here, can you comment about the proposed mandatory joint replacement demonstration, or the bundle that came out? How do you feel it could impact the industry and your business in particular? And also, maybe briefly on the -- I guess the set of hospital payment reforms that came out from the House Ways and Means Committee just recently? I know it's very early stages, but any color you can give us would be helpful. Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "Joanna, I am not going to sort of comment on really specific developments in part because I don\u2019t know that we've had a full opportunity to review them. But I am going to just sort of to reiterate a little bit and maybe expand on the comment I made before. We certainly have a view that the reimbursement mechanisms that have been sort of the historic ones for the industry are changing. They are changing I think incrementally. And I think that change will continue to be incremental.", "But we are doing great many things to prepare for that, to prepare for things like accepting bundle payments and accepting Capitated payments in some very limited instances etcetera, because I think we do think that\u2019s at least part of the future of the industry. And so we\u2019re very focused on that.", "Now exactly what form that\u2019s going to take, to what degree the government is going to initiate that or the initiation will really come from the private sector, hard for us to predict at this moment. But I will tell you, and there is probably not enough time in the context of this call to discuss it meaningfully. But we've got a number of initiatives underway to make sure that we are absolutely prepared for that.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc.", "Jason Gurda", "Good morning. Thank you. Steve, I saw in the news that the Doctors Hospital of Renaissance had filed to expand or double the size of the number of beds, but they have to get approval from CMS. Do you have any sense for how likely that is?", "Alan Miller", "We don\u2019t. As you might imagine, there are others in the market I think who are sort of questioning the appropriateness of that. And so as CMS will have to weigh, I think a number of different factors as they think about that. But for those who followed us for a long time know that the physician owned hospital in the McAllen market is a formidable competitor of ours. When they first opened, we had a fairly significant diminution in our earnings in that market. We\u2019ve regained a lot of that over the years and done a number of things to strengthen our position in the market, including a number of physician integration strategies, a number of physical strategies, physical improvements. And again, I think we feel like we are well positioned in the market regardless of what the physician hospital ultimately is able to do.", "Jason Gurda", "Okay. I'm not sure if you're going to want to comment on this or not, but I'd be interested in hearing maybe an update on your relationship of working with EmCare?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah. I mean, EmCare is the emergency room provider in probably the majority of our acute care hospitals and they provide some other physician contract services in some of our hospitals as well. As with any sort of contract service vendor, we work closely with them to try and provide services that are both satisfactory to our patients and to our other physicians, as well as from our perspective, cost efficient. And I think EmCare is a good solid company. We will continue to work with them. But as always, we will continue to explore all the alternatives to increase patient satisfaction and increase our cost efficiency at the same time.", "Jason Gurda", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Paula Torch", "Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the U.K. for a second. Just wondering how that business is progressing in the behavioral side. Are you happy with it and maybe how much is that business contributing to your overall behavioral revenue, and what are some of the growth plans there for the next 12 months?", "Alan Miller", "Yeah. So, Paula, I think that we talked little bit in Q1 and I will largely repeat those comments in the sense that when we bought Cygnet in the U.K. late in the third quarter of \u201914, they were already operating at what we consider to be high occupancy levels, probably around 80%, maybe the low 80s. We've been extremely pleased because I think they are now operating at close to 90%. And so while we didn't think there was a tremendous opportunity for improvement, we\u2019ve based on our short period of ownership have already experienced some fairly significant incremental improvement that has been very beneficial.", "I will say that -- at the end of the day, we acquired a company that had roughly $170 million, $180 million of revenues and $40 million of EBITDA, something like that. So, it\u2019s not a terribly material part of our behavioral business or certainly of our consolidated results at the moment. But we also viewed it as a platform for growth. We've already in the short time, we've owned them and announced a small acquisition in a number of bed expansion opportunities, both de novo facilities as well, as incremental bed expansions and existing facilities.", "So, I think it is turning out to be everything that we expect it would be and maybe more. And the hope is that it continues to be a platform for growth in the future. And that we will continue to expand both the existing facilities, as well as find other opportunities to acquire streams of EBITDA in that period.", "Paula Torch", "And just as a follow-up to that, 90% occupancy is certainly high. I know you mentioned de novos and bed expansion and so that should help sort of fill in some of that demand. But wondering on the acquisition front, are there some larger players still in that market that you could think about acquiring? And what are some of your thoughts there, I guess in terms of how big you want to actually take this business?", "Alan Miller", "The challenge when asked -- anywhere whether it\u2019s in the U.K. or the U.S. about acquiring other consolidated players is -- unfortunately that decision is largely up to those other players. There are other consolidated players in the U.K. and we certainly are doing our best to stay in touch with those players into the degree that any of those players decide that they are looking to pursue some other strategy, whether it's an exit strategy or joint venture strategy or some sort of partnership to develop new facilities. We\u2019d be interested in all of those opportunities. So the difficulty of sort of pegging kind of a likelihood of that is again, this is largely dependent on what somebody else wants to do or chooses to do so. For the most part although we try and stay on top of it, we have to be reactive to that.", "Paula Torch", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color there. Just one last one, maybe for me. Certainly a very strong first half, you raised guidance. And it seems like the second half we're still taking a little bit more of a prudent approach. So just wondering what type of metrics do we need to see on the revenue side to maybe hit the high mark in that EPS guidance?", "Alan Miller", "So, I would say that to get to the high end of the EPS guidance, Paula, we\u2019d have to sustain most of the metrics that you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter, including the volume growth which I think is probably the most aggressive piece of it as I mentioned before. I think realistically, we\u2019ve assume that there will be some tempering of that volume growth. And I would suggest that the midpoint of our guidance sort of is -- would sort of suggest that there is, at least a bit of tampering of that sort of growth. I think the high end is -- would be more of a continuation of all the trends that we\u2019ve seen in the first half.", "Paula Torch", "Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to again tease out some of the elements of what were the drivers of the guidance raise. Some of this might be, Steve, a repetition or at least a follow-up of what others have already asked. But in February you were pretty conservative. The pull-through to EBITDA was weaker than the street had expected. ", "So firstly, when you raised guidance this time, is this because the exchange enrollment that you had factored in was lower than what eventually manifested itself, or are you more confident at this point in the mid-point of the year on the economic recovery as a driver of the volumes?", "Steve Filton", "Again, Ane, a little bit of your question is sort of based on this idea of what\u2019s driving the improvement -- not to be repetitive but I think we struggle ourselves with exactly what is driving the improvement. I would say again what makes us confident about raising guidance after the first half of the year is simply the acute care future performance, which clearly was an outperformance in the first half. It's really based on the strong revenue growth and I think that strong revenue growth is really driven by this 5.7% increase in adjusted admissions, which honestly is well above what we were guiding to and what we were budgeting for when the year began. And as sort of suggested in my answer to Paula, I think that\u2019s the sort of trickiest variable from our perspective as we think about the back half of the year.", "We certainly believe that our acute care demand will continue. It will be strong. Whether it will be quite as strong as the 5.7%, which again, I\u2019m going to make the point is really at the very high end of our historical trends, not just us as a company but as an industry. Whether that can continue, I\u2019m not clear and again, we've tempered a little bit in our guidance. But I think that's what's really driving the confidence here is that strong, very consistent performance in the first half of the year and especially in Q2, when I think the comparisons were far more difficult.", "Ana Gupte", "And then on the Medicaid utilization that you alluded to that's accelerating. I know the payer mix is not that clear at all times, but any color on whether this is from the Medicare Advantage side of it, versus the government Medicare that's up? And any color on the types of the acuity and the types of procedures and services that you're seeing in Medicare?", "Alan Miller", "Sure. So, we always look at our Medicare and Medicaid blocks of business in total and we look at them as, both the managed portion and the traditional portion in part because they are certainly a continuing shift of patience from the traditional Medicaid and Medicare programs to the managed Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "So if I were to question the directly like that, I would say no, clearly the increase in Medicare utilization is coming from an increase in Medicare Advantage patients. But I don't know that that's all that meaningful because clearly, there are just more Medicaid Advantage patients today than there were a year ago or two years ago whatever. But the overall, we\u2019ve seen more total Medicare and total Medicaid patients. That to me is the meaningful dynamic.", "In terms of who those patients are and what's driving them, as we review our service lines, as we review our surgical lines, et cetera, we see strength really across the board, orthopedics, cardiology, oncology, all the service lines that are traditional sort of Medicare intensive service line. So I wouldn\u2019t point to a particular procedure or diagnoses, et cetera, that's really driving this strength. I think it's pretty much across that board.", "Ana Gupte", "That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve. On the Texas economy and the Medicaid concerned that you had in February and it seems like the oil and gas, and I know you're not fully levered to those geographies, but just broadly speaking the layoffs haven't abated if anything they're accelerating, are you comfortable at this point that there will not be any Medicaid funding pressures or might we see that further down the line?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. So, I think, the answer is little bit of both, I think, that we don\u2019t think there is any immediate threats to our reimbursement funding in the State of Taxes. I think that that\u2019s always over the longer-term you look out the more uncertainty there might be.", "We have seen in an earlier question or in response to an earlier question, I said that, our Texas markets have performed a little bit more modestly than some of our other markets like Vegas and California.", "So, I don't know if that\u2019s the economic impact of a slightly slowing economy. Honestly, Texas is a big state and we\u2019re only in a handful of markets in the State. So I don't know whether our performance or our experience is necessarily reflective of what's going on more broadly.", "But for us at least, Texas has slowed a little bit. Again, I made the point earlier that's a relative term, Texas markets are ahead of last year and both volume wise and earnings wise, but not quite as much ahead as some of those -- some of our other markets like California and Vegas.", "Ana Gupte", "And then one final one if I may, on the consolidation that's now been announced in managed care, out of the two deals, the two mega-deals, would you see both as potentially impacting the pricing dynamic? One is more of a complementary rather than an overlapping commercial-only story. The other one is commercial. Any thoughts on that and what might be the strategic response from the hospital industry?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, it's difficult to respond. I think, first of all, I think, the industry, the provider industry broadly will, I think, raise questions about the lack of competitiveness or diminution in competitiveness that these transactions might drive.", "And I think one of things the industry will point out is that it may not necessarily be or they -- the most appropriate way to look at this may not simply be on a service line business that I think when an insurer in a market gets increased commercial lives and increase manager lives at the same time that increases their market power in the market, even though there might be two different service lines. So I think the industry as a whole will make those points as the government reviews these transactions. And I certainly are not smart enough to know how that\u2019s going to play out.", "I think for us individually, we know we tend to look at these things very much in a market by market basis. We have spend and our focus to a lot of our internal efforts over the last decade or two at enhancing and increasing our market positions in all of our markets, both acute and behavioral care.", "Not that we necessarily had a view that this is the way the insurance industry would sort out. But we had a view that look, we would need as much market power as possible to deal with payers of every stripe of government and private payers.", "And so, I think in general, we're fairly comfortable with the market positions and market share percentages that we have in most of our markets. So in a very specific UHS sense, I don't know that we have any grave concerns about this payer consolidation dynamic. But I think as a provider generally, we think the payer consolidation will provide some limits and some restrictions on consumer choice and consumer costs et cetera.", "Ana Gupte", "That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I think most of the good ones have been taken. You were waiting for some California provider fees, I think, at the last quarter. Any update on those?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. So those were approved and we did record them in the quarter. Gary, it\u2019s a relatively small number for us, probably $3 million or $4 million in the quarter. And for us, it was really just an acceleration of an item that we had sort of guided to or assume would occur in the second half of the year. So it doesn't really affect our sort of full-year guidance or full year expectations.", "Gary Lieberman", "Got it. And then Alan, maybe I'd be interested in your thoughts on the current GOP field of candidates for President?", "Alan Miller", "Well, we have a very exciting 17 candidates, so you\u2019ve heard about that I\u2019m sure.", "Gary Lieberman", "Yes.", "Alan Miller", "There will be a debate on August 6, let see and it\u2019s too early to really say much of anything. So we\u2019ll see.", "Gary Lieberman", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dana Nuntin with Deutsche Bank.", "Dana Nuntin", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. I know you touched on this briefly, but is there any color you could provide on how surgical trends performed in the quarter, maybe inpatient versus out patient?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. Dana, I mean we made the point and I think we\u2019ve made the point and I think we\u2019ve made it actually on the last two quarters that the most interesting development from a surgical trend perspective is that inpatient surgical -- inpatient surgeries are growing faster than outpatient really for the first time in a very long time. And honestly that trend continued into Q2 as well.", "So that to me is the most interesting trend. And then the only other thing I\u2019d emphasize or point out is what I said to, Ana, that as we look at those surgical procedures, there's not a particular service line or diagnosis that\u2019s really driving the growth. It tends to be fairly widespread both geographically and service line wise.", "Dana Nuntin", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo", "Hey, good morning. Steve, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but generally you tend to earn about 21% to maybe 23% of your full year acute care EBITDA within the third quarter. And I think sometimes we forget about the seasonal earnings progression. Just any reason as you look at your internal budgets that would be materially different this time around?", "Steve Filton", "No. I think the historical trend of the third quarter being the softest quarter for the hospital industry in general and certainly for us. I don\u2019t think we would see any reason why that wouldn't hold up in 2015 as well.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. We tend to -- the street sometimes tends to get a little ahead of you sometimes in the third quarter, so just appreciate that. And can you just comment on employment strategy? This hasn't really been a focus I think internally at UHS as perhaps others. And that's perhaps a cultural dynamic in some of your markets. But where do you think you are in the industry as within that particular cycle?", "Steve Filton", "White, I always think -- couple of things. I don\u2019t think UHS sort of emphasizes it, as we talked about the business as much as some of our peers. But it doesn't mean that we have not employed physicians. I think we view, physician employment the way we view a lot of our market strategies and market development and business development strategies and they are very market specific.", "So, there is some markets in which we have a significant amount of physician employment. McAllen is one, Texoma is another. There are other markets like Las Vegas where in general, the market has not seen a lot of physician employment for a variety of reasons, so we\u2019ll see. We continue to do what we think is the most appropriate competitive thing in every market.", "We definitely have a view that physician integration is going to be more and more important as time goes on and we certainly are doing what we can in that regard in some cases, employing physicians, in many cases, working with physicians to integrate our information technologies. We think that's a very important strategy. We\u2019ll continue to do that. But we\u2019ll also continue to be judicious about it because at the end of the day, we think that most hospitals lose money on own physician practices. And obviously, that's an end result that if we can avoid, we will prefer to avoid it.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. And maybe my last one, just to follow-up on Gary's question around the California provider fee. Did you actually receive any payments from the state in the quarter? Can you comment on Texas DSRIP? I can't remember if you have any AR tied up there and whether or not you've received any cash as well?", "Steve Filton", "So as far as California goes Whit, I don\u2019t believe that we received the monies that I referenced in my response to Gary. I think the program has just been approved, and we recognized that although again those are not a big numbers. Texas DSRIP, we definitely have received some Texas DSRIP numbers. And when we file the Q next week, you\u2019ll be able to see that, we\u2019ll spell that out.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John Ransom", "It's really hard to be clever after all these good questions. But I was just as one final one. You guys hired John Rizzo recently. I was just curious about the rationale behind that hire? And what different perspectives you may or may not be looking for? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "He is, we think, an exceptionally fine experienced talent. And we're always looking to improve and add to our talent base our executives and we have high expectation for him. He is a development guy basically, strategy and development.", "John Ransom", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lynch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Jennifer Lynch", "Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. One quick follow-up on the U.K. Can you guys just give us any color on U.K. rates for the behavioral business and how those are acting directionally? And then maybe what you're including in your outlook for those rates through the back half of the year? Thanks very much.", "Steve Filton", "So Jen, when we bought Cygnet, I think we had a view that as we model that acquisition, that rates from the NHS, which 95% plus of our patients, our NHS patient would be relatively kind of flat to maybe up 1% in for the foreseeable future on an annual basis. I don't think any of our current experience in our nine months of ownership or so has really made us think any differently about that.", "So I think our actual performance has kind of fit into that. And I think as we continue to think about the next few years, we still think that\u2019s the right way of thinking about the business. And so any growth from that business is much more likely to come from volume growth than it is from rate growth.", "Jennifer Lynch", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. We thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everyone again next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. And Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Good morning. Thank you. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and forward-looking statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2014, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 30, 2015.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS of $1.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2015. After adjusting each quarter's reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications at our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's third quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 13% to $155.3 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to $137.5 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, during the third quarter of last year.", "On a same facility basis, in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2015 increased 7.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 5.1% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year, and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute hospitals decreased to 15.4% during the third quarter of 2015 from 17.1% during the third quarter of 2014.", "s expected, net revenue growth slowed in the third quarter from the unprecedented levels we have been experiencing in the first half of the year. Surgical volume's moderated a bit, and uncompensated care volumes ticked up as well. At the same time, there was a measurable increase in temporary nursing costs, all contributing to the margin decline.", "On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 5% during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the third quarter of 2014. During this year's third quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year each increased 1.6%.", "Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day each rose 3.1% during the third quarter of 2015 over the comparable prior-year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.5% and 27.6% during the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.", "For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 16% to $796 million over the $690 million generated during the comparable nine-month period of 2014.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 55 days during the third quarter of 2015, as compared to 56 days during the third quarter of 2014. At September 30, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization decreased to 42.8% as compared to 48.9% at September 30, 2014.", "We spent $99 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015 and $270 million during the first nine months of 2015. In connection with our previously announced $400 million stock repurchase program, we repurchased 543,380 shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $72 million during the third quarter of this year. Since inception of the program through September 30, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $166 million and had a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $234 million as of the end of the third quarter.", "In August 2015, we acquired four behavioral health facilities with 305 beds located in the UK. This acquisition increases our behavioral health presence in the UK to 21 facilities consisting of approximately 1,100 beds.", "In October 2015, we completed the acquisition of Foundations Recovery Network. Through this acquisition, we have added four inpatient facilities consisting of 322 beds, as well as eight outpatient centers. In addition, there are over 140 expansion beds in progress for Foundation as well. Foundation is one of the premier names in addiction treatment, is focused on treating adults with co-occurring addiction and mental health disorders through an evidence-based integrated treatment model in residential and outpatient settings.", "Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2015, we're revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2015, to $6.75 to $7.05 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact of the year, maintains the lower end of the previously provided range of $6.75 to $7.15 per diluted share and decreases the upper end of the range by approximately 1%.", "Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Operator: And our first question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, this is Tejus Ujjani joining on for Matthew Borsch. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you could touch a little bit more on the growth in uninsured on the acute care side. I can see that the provision grew faster than the uninsured charges as a whole, and was just curious about that in terms of many differences in collection rates or why that would be the case.", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Sure. So, we did see, as the data that you cited suggests, an increase in uncompensated care in the third quarter. While we saw it throughout the portfolio, I think it was most evident in our Texas and, in specifically, in our South Texas markets. And I think our estimate is that that increase in uncompensated care probably had an impact of maybe 50 basis point reduction in our acute care margins during the quarter.", "Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Antonella Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Yes. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to touch on acute care margin again and speaking with this conversation. So 50 basis \u2013 excuse me \u2013 50 basis point impact to the uncompensated care, wondering if you could tell us how much of an impact the temporary nursing costs were in the quarter and sort of what's going on there? Is there a higher competition, is it tightness? Do you think that's going to continue into the fourth quarter and into next year; any more color there?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Sure, Paula. So, just from an order of magnitude, I think that the impact of the increase in temporary nurse costs was similar to the uncompensated care impact that is in the neighborhood of 50 basis points. Obviously, it is a trend that has been mentioned by a number of our peers as well, which is not necessarily something we were aware of during the quarter. I think from our perspective, we continue to have and generate very substantial acute care demand as reflected in our growing admissions, very healthily growing admissions. And as a result, that is contributing to a need for more employees, particularly nurses. And honestly, I think we're just not filling those positions as quickly and as efficiently and expeditiously as we would hope. To some degree, I think, we probably underestimated the need for new nurses as", "demand has remained as strong as it has.", "As we look forward and project sort of solving this issue or solving the problem, I think we view it as definitely a fixable problem and one that we will address in the fourth quarter and begin to make progress the fourth quarter and certainly begin to really solve the issue by the beginning of next year as we fill those vacant positions. The feedback that I get from our hospitals when we talk to them is that they can fill those positions. They're sort of re-doubling their efforts to do so. And so, we're fairly confident that we will address that issue in the near future.", "Antonella Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Okay. Great. And one more if I may. Just turning to behavioral quickly and the Foundations acquisition that you did, can you update us maybe on the thoughts on the expansion? I know you said 140 beds, I believe. When should we expect those to come online and are they across all of the four facilities? How fast do you expect the addiction piece of your behavioral business to grow, and maybe if you can help us think about some of the future investments there?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Sure. I mean in the grand scheme, the Foundations acquisition is relatively small but we think a strategically important acquisition. Obviously, we're talking about 330 beds out of a total of 20,000 beds, but I think we think that the Foundation acquisition very nicely complements our existing addiction businesses. We probably have eight or nine dedicated addiction facilities in our portfolio today, as well as the fact that we offer addiction services in many of our other behavioral facilities as well. And we think that the Foundations' model as well as \u2013 the Foundations' model in terms of patient treatment as well as their model for patient capture is one that will have relevance for us throughout our other addiction businesses, and quite frankly in some of our other lines of business as well, things like eating disorders, et cetera. So, the 140 beds that are in the queue for Foundations are both additions to existing facilities as well as some de novo development. I think they're all likely to be completed within the 12-month cycle, and we continue to look for other opportunities as well to expand that business, as well as other elements of our behavioral business.", "Antonella Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.", "Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. This is Frank Lee on for Chris Rigg. Thanks for taking my question. Acute care volumes continue to be strong in the quarter. I was just curious if there are any specific regions that are driving that growth you could call out, and then does the revised guidance reflect a similar pace of volume growth in the fourth quarter?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. Frank, so I think the acute care volume growth \u2013 and we talked a little bit about this in general in the first half of the year saying that the strongest performing markets were Las Vegas or Nevada and then Southern California. And as I mentioned before, I think our Texas markets, in particular our South Texas markets, have lagged a little bit over the last few quarters. I think all of those same trends were present in Q3 as well.", "In terms of the revised guidance and how that acute care growth fit into that, again, we revised that guidance at the end of the second quarter, we talked about the fact that the first half of the year acute care revenue growth of 10% was unlikely to be sustainable. It was sort of unprecedented in the history not only of the company but of the acute care industry. And we thought that revenues in the back half of the year and, frankly, going forward would likely moderate to levels more like 6.5%, 7%. And that's certainly what happened in Q3. And I think our revised guidance, taking off the very top end of the guidance, was simply an acknowledgment that those acute care revenues had moderated and would likely continue to do so, and that \u2013 I think we have said that to get to the high end of that range, we'd have to sustain those 10% or so revenue growth levels. And I think the revision at the top end of the range was just an acknowledgment that that was very unlikely.", "Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Thanks. And then, it looks like share repurchases increased pretty meaningfully in the quarter even with the Alpha transaction. Can you help us think about the pace of repurchases going forward and in the fourth quarter given the Foundations acquisition? Thanks a lot.", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. I don't necessarily think that either of the two recent acquisitions, Alpha in Q3 and Foundations in Q4, will materially affect the way we think about share repurchase. Obviously, we have the view that our share price has seen a dramatic decline in the last month or two and is not necessarily, from our perspective, related to real fundamental changes in the business \u2013 in our business trends or in future prospects of the business. So, I think we view the current share price as an attractive investment and we'll continue to look at share repurchase in the same way that we have historically with other capital deployment opportunities, which we think also exist at this point in time.", "I think we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. I just want to go back to the discussion around the margins, the acute care segment. So, first of all, in terms of the comments around the temporary staffing, you suggested you feel like you might be able to \u2013 you feel this oppositions 16:28) in Q4 into beginning of next year, but does it feel like for you that it might be there's something that's more sustaining going on around the industry given that we're hearing viewpoint from other providers talking about similar issues? So any color you might have on in terms of whether you feel this is really fixable in the near term or whether there's something systemic going on around in terms of the labor cost or ability to staff nurses?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Joanna, you know the best that I can offer is that given my tenure in the industry, I can remember some 10 years ago when we \u2013 the industry was experiencing a really severe shortage of nurses and other clinical professionals. And I recall talking to our hospitals at the time and when we talked at that time about hiring and filling vacancies, the feedback you'd get from the hospitals was simply, you just couldn't do it. They're just weren't nurses out there. It didn't matter what we were willing to pay. There was enormous pressure on wages.", "I will tell you that the current environment just doesn't have the same feel to it. Certainly, this issue an increase use of temporary nurses is not unique to us; other companies have reported it as well. So it seems to be a bit more systemic issue, but it also, based on the feedback that we're getting from our hospitals, is one that remains fixable. I mean they're hiring nurses. They're hiring nurses at sort of within our current wage scales, et cetera. So we do have an impression and a feeling that this is really is an addressable issue and one that can be dealt with in relatively near term.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. And then because also in the past on that same topic, there was a margin pressure other (18:23). In the past, I believe, you talk about there is ability in acute care segment to show margin expansion if revenue grows above 3%, I believe; but clearly, it didn't happen this quarter because margins were down 170 basis points year-over-year on same-store basis. So you said 50 basis points from the temporary staffing and then another 50 basis points from the uncompensated care costs, so what else was driving or putting the margins to be under so much pressure given that top line growth was so strong?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Sure. I think it's worth putting the comparison \u2013 the acute care comparison in context. We ran over 17% margins in the third quarter of 2014, and those margins and the EBITDA that the acute care business generated in the third quarter of 2014 was almost a doubling of what it had run in the previous year. And the 17% margin I think was probably the best margin we've ever run in the third quarter in that division. So the comparison was extremely difficult. And even though I think your point is a valid one and well taken, and that is that under normal circumstances if we generate 7% growth \u2013 revenue growth in the acute division, we would expect to have margin expansion. And I believe that that's what we will expect in the future.", "In the third quarter there were a couple of extenuating circumstances, which we've discussed already, but I think it is just that, it is extenuating circumstances as opposed to sort of fundamental changes in the model. I think our general sense is that at these very healthy revenue levels \u2013 and that's what I think we take away from the quarter as the most important message \u2013 we believe that in the future we will be able to generate the margin expansion that we've come to expect at those levels.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So then you have suggested that you don't expect, I guess, the volume growth to remain in the 5% range. So, what \u2013 I mean without giving guidance for next year, but what kind of type of volume growth would you expect over the near term or medium term, I guess, in the acute care segment?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Well, as you suggest, I'm not going to give 2016 guidance for \u2013 and we're not going to give it for another several months, but I will just sort of reiterate what we talked about at the end of the second quarter of this year, and that is that we thought that acute care revenue growth would moderate from the 10% unprecedented levels that we were experiencing to something closer to 6.5%, 7%. That is, in fact, what happened. We're very comfortable at those levels. I'm not prepared to say whether those levels are going to be sustainable completely into 2016, but certainly sustainable through the end of the year. And we're very comfortable that, over the long term, we will generate margin expansion at that \u2013 at those revenue growth levels.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. That's all from me.", "Operator", "And your next question is from A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, everybody. Just a couple things, maybe on the payer mix, drilling down a little bit more \u2013 do you have the details on either year-to-year change and some of the key components of that or the percentages, how they change?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "A.J., I think, as we discussed in the first half of the year, we continue to see growth in both our Medicare and Medicaid utilization, and that's total Medicare and Medicaid, meaning both traditional and managed. What was a little bit different in the third quarter was we saw our commercial volume growth slow some. We had been since the beginning of the ACA implementation and in the economic recovery seeing commercial volumes increasing in the high-single and double-digit, low double-digit ranges. I think that the commercial volume increase in the third quarter was only like 3% or 4% \u2013 still good, but a deceleration from where we've seen. And I think, we saw an uptick in uncompensated volumes as well, uninsured volumes. They had been declining, quite frankly, for a number of periods, and in the third quarter of this year uninsured volumes were up, let's call it, 6% or 7%.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And when you \u2013 I know, you said that when you drill down, Texas was especially the, I'd say, border community, or something I guess, where were you saw some of that, that pressure. When you ask your operators what they see is, is there anything to call out there? I know we get questions all the time about energy patch, which I wouldn't necessarily associate with those types of hospitals, but is there any issue there or anything more broadly or is this just the natural ebb and flow you see sometimes in a quarter-to-quarter swing?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Honestly, A.J., hard to say is the best answer I can give you. You're right that the South Texas markets, McAllen, Laredo, are not markets that are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry. They're not markets where the sort of broader economic metrics like unemployment seem to be deteriorating in any meaningful way. So, the increase in uncompensated care is a bit of head scratcher in those markets. And I think a lot of times it's a mistake to draw broad conclusions from one quarter's worth of results in a particular market. So, I think we'll wait and see and try and evaluate it as it goes forward. But no, I mean, it's not obvious to us what's driving that change.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, just lastly on the capital deployment, I mean, I understand the enthusiasm for your stock, given its pulled back like it has in \u2013 on the buybacks. Any commentary on what you're seeing on the acquisition front, either in acute or psych \u2013 obviously, you did two small deals in the quarter \u2013 but it sounded like earlier in the year you actually thought there might be some things on the acute side. Is there still some things out there or where do we stand?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. So, again, in our second quarter call, we had expressed the view that we thought that the pipeline for potential opportunities was busier than it had been in some time. Subsequent to that, as you suggest, we did two behavioral deals totaling $500 million in total investment. We continue to look at other behavioral opportunities. We continue to look at acute opportunities. We do \u2013 I think we would continue to describe the pipeline, if you will, as more active than it's been in a while. And so, as we always do, I think we kind of look at that landscape, we look at our ability to or opportunity to purchase \u2013 repurchase our own stock as well, and we sort of try and measure each of those opportunities against each other. And obviously, we have an exceptionally strong balance sheet with very low leverage levels which allows us to pursue multiple opportunities at once, and that's going to continue to be our plan.", "Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "A.J., I'd also point out that in addition to the $500 million we've spent, we're very excited about our hospital under construction in Las Vegas. We have built an acute care hospital a year. We're spending between $155 million and $185 million on those hospitals. So, we are making investments in the acute business, and as opportunities present themselves, we are ready to take advantage of them.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Yeah. I guess, I called it a little psych \u2013 I guess those weren't so little, actually.", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "I wasn't going to correct you, A.J.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Steve, I appreciate those comments around sort of what we saw in the last nursing shortage, and I'm just curious on the overall labor pressures. I guess, volume sequentially or relatively similar, so what's causing that need for temporary labor? Has there just been more turnover and you're not sort of filling those roles? Any sense of where these nurses and clinicians are getting hired? Are they going to non-traditional channels at this point? And then, if you could also comment, any physician compensation or recruitment issues within that labor or is this really all just nursing?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "So, let me address the first one. I think on the \u2013 if we're seeing any pressure on physician staffing, I think it tends to be on the behavioral side. We've mentioned this, I think, once or twice before. At least in some specific markets, it's been difficult for us to hire the appropriate number of psychiatrists. And that's been a bit of a drag, both to the degree that we can \u2013 we don't add a sufficient number of psychiatrists, we will see our volumes pressured a little bit. Behavioral admissions were a little bit soft in Q3, and I think as I look around the portfolio, there are a market or two where I would attribute some of that softness to a shortage of physicians.", "Also to the degree that we're using temporary physicians, that pushes our operating expense up in the behavioral division, and you'll see that in the Q a little bit and you'll see the specific pressure on our operating expenses in behavioral \u2013 again, around the margins at least.", "On the acute side, it's a good question. Exactly why this problem is sort of bubbling up at the moment, Josh, my sense is that to some degree there has been a bit of a skepticism out in the field that the really strong volumes that we've been generating were going to continue, and I think there's always a bit of hesitancy to hire nurses when you're not sure if volume strength will continue. So, I think that may have been it. I think there may have been some unnecessary skepticism about the need for those nurses, but I think that's now become clear.", "Turnover hasn't increase for us. I know some of our peers have mentioned that. We're constantly trying to drive turnover rates down, and I'm not sure that we're terribly successful in driving them down, but I certainly think that they've been stable for us.", "And then finally, this idea that there's a lot of these sort of alternate care providers, FED providers et cetera. I think in our markets at least the numbers of those sorts of providers and the amount of people they're hiring is relatively immaterial, so it doesn't seem to me to be the item that's really driving this.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then just one quick follow up, are you seeing any delays on Medicaid enrollment? Are you seeing anything different at the state level in terms of their ability to process and enroll some of these previously uninsured individuals?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. I mean, again, I know that was cited by one of our peers. I checked with our folks this morning because I have not heard that, and they sort of reiterated that is not been an issue for us. So, I don't think that's what's driving our uncompensated experience.", "Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking question. I know you said it wasn't entirely clear what was causing the slowdown in commercial volumes, comparatively anyway. Is there any indication that you're seeing individuals that were previously covered by exchange plans coming off of those plans? Or do you think it's more just seasonal weakness in the third quarter that comes back in the fourth quarter? What were your thoughts there?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. And again, I know that one of our peers cited that as sort of a dynamic as well. And it's an intellectually, kind of intuitively obvious argument. It seems logical that that could be happening. Other than a couple of anecdotal examples that we've been able to gather, we're really not able to generate sort of any measurable data that would suggest we're seeing that in sort of large volumes. We'll continue to watch that.", "Again, Gary, I'm going to repeat a comment I made a little bit ago. I think sometimes, it can be a mistake to draw really broad conclusions about one quarter's worth of metrics. We tried, we're exploring and we certainly dive into these numbers when we see them, but none of these other explanations, at least for us, seem to be terribly obvious or explanations that we could really prove out.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then could you give us an update on the UK behavioral market, the acquisition environment, any update on pricing or reimbursement issues there?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "The operational environment has been very good. We've said from the beginning in the Cygnet acquisition \u2013 is just about a year old at this point \u2013 that Cygnet pretty much every single quarter, and the third quarter was no exception, has exceeded our expectations. Their volumes and occupancy rates are extremely high. They continue to pursue opportunities that include building new beds at existing hospitals, doing some de novo development, doing some small acquisition work and looking at acquisitions of various sizes. So, we continue to be very positive about our entry into the UK behavioral market and are working very sort of pointedly with our local management there to continue to grow that platform.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So I want to again come back to the uncompensated care issue, Steve, if I may. You said it's in South Texas and it's probably not the slow Medicaid application processing. Have you had any kind of anecdotal data at your ED departments or whatever, that some of these people have been in exchanges and are now (33:28-33:33) or is it they just got \u2013 lost their jobs and there's an (33:36-33:37) enroll in Medicaid or exchanges or whatever, and they're not \u2013 they're not insured right now. Did you ever (33:42) get a sense for it and despite that all of you are seeing, how structural is this for 2016 because it meaningfully changes forecast?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. So, a couple of things. I mean I just wanted to clarify a little bit. I mean, what I said was that the increase in uncompensated care was most evident in the South Texas market and that's true. But I don't want to leave the impression that it was completely limited. We saw an uptick in uncompensated care in some other markets as well.", "I mean, again, I think you're asking the question that Gary asked, maybe a little bit differently. I mean we're not able to attribute that increase to \u2013 specifically to commercial exchange patients or subscribers not being able to make their premium payments. We're not really able to subscribe \u2013 or ascribe the increase to anything in particular. And I think that our sort of outlook on this is we'll wait and see, we'll try and gather more data as, you know, another month or two passes and do a better job of trying to figure out what's going on. I realize that there's a lot of pressure on folks all over to try and figure this out immediately.", "I will say this, at the end of the day \u2013 even with the increase in bad debt and uncompensated care pressure, we generated 7.2% acute care revenue growth in the quarter. And if somebody had asked me a year ago whether I would take that, I would have taken that offer in an instant and I'll take it again next quarter if presented to me. So I appreciate the fact that there is a lot of focus on this increase in uncompensated care, but I think sometimes we're looking at the glass in the wrong way. I mean, this glass is half full in my mind when acute care revenues are growing by 7.2% over the prior year.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah. Fair enough. Your volumes were great in acute, and apologies again if this was asked before; I wasn't (35:52) the call.", "On Medicare, in the second quarter as well you talked about very strong volumes. How much is Medicare contributing to your acute volume growth? And is (36:02) lapping or is there something structural that we can carry forward in terms of the volume?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. So the strength in Medicare volumes is something that we've now seen probably for at least three quarters. And I think, as you suggest, probably an explanation for the strength in Medicare volumes is the idea that some of the weakness that we saw a year ago as a result of this shift from inpatients to observation patients has anniversaried a bit. We continue to see observation patients being coded in \u2013 with frequency, but I do think we're lapping some of that. And that makes sense only because all the other explanations that you usually offer for increased volumes -- the ACA impact, or the economic impact -- are generally not relevant to the Medicare population. So I think this idea that we're starting to sort of see some leveling off of some of this pressure on Medicare admissions that we had seen for a few years is a relevant explanation.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "And are you (37:13) the managed Medicare relative to traditional?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "No. I mean, I think generally we find that when a population moves from traditional Medicare to managed, it's usually reflected in length of stay pressures rather than in actual admission rate pressures. So no, I don't think we're seeing a big change between the two populations.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "All right. And then finally, on the budget, do you have any thoughts on that, assuming nobody else asked. Because if they did, then no need to go back into it.", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "No. I mean, I think that there's still some clarification that we as an industry are looking for, but I think with the major change being to alternate site payments and the idea that I think hospitals are not going to be able to use hospital rates for some alternate site payments. I think we may see a slowdown in the way hospitals in general approach some of those off-campus strategies. I would say that this has not been a huge part of the UHS model and, obviously, whatever we have is grandfathered anyway according to the deal as I understand it. So, I don't view it as a real significant change to our operating outlook at the moment.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. Apologies if this was asked, I hopped on a little late. But did you give the exchange volume in the quarter, Steve, and how that has tracked over the last couple of quarters?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Ralph, not specifically exchange volume. I talked a little bit about commercial volume in general. I think, we, as a company, sort of said at the beginning \u2013 with the beginning of this year that we really weren't \u2013 were no longer trying to separate out discreetly the impact of the ACA or exchanges, et cetera, and really haven't done so all year and certainly are not going to do so this quarter. But I did talk about the fact that commercial exchange volume growth slowed some in the third quarter \u2013 not commercial exchange, just commercial volume in general slowed some in the third quarter.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, what about acuity mix in the quarter? Did you give that and was that a favorable impact?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "I didn't give it. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that surgical volumes slowed a little bit. One of the comments that I had made in the first two quarters of this year was that for the first time in a long time, inpatient surgeries and the growth in inpatient surgeries were outpacing the growth in outpatient surgeries. In the third quarter, we sort of returned back to where we had been in the last few years, where outpatient surgeries were growing faster than inpatient. Although both continue to grow at a decent pace, but that's I think an indication of a small decline in acuity and contributed a little bit to that \u2013 again, the slowdown in overall revenue growth.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, just on the \u2013 I guess on the behavioral side with the regs out, sort of the IMD exclusion. To the extent that it does hold, do you see this as sort of an immediate benefit as we head into 2016 or is there something you need to do in terms of outreaching and education that would suggest that any benefit would be kind of later in the year as opposed to early in the year?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Well, I think there is a couple of issues. I mean, one is the rule has yet to be published in final form, and we certainly don't know exactly when that's going to happen. I'm actually told that CMS has a number of sort of pending rules in their queue. And I think there is some speculation they may not get to this one until early in 2016, and we're not sure at that point when the effective date would be. So, that's an issue right away. I mean we just don't know when the rule and the effective date is going to be.", "But when the rule is issued, there is some amount of that work to be done. These patients are being treated for the most part in existing acute care facilities today, and we have work to do to, I think, communicate with those acute care facilities and see if there is an opportunity \u2013 and this is really a market-by-market effort to cooperate with them and \u2013 and see if those patients can't be treated in sort of a more efficient way and mutually efficient way for both the acute care hospital and for us. We also have to work with the managed Medicaid companies to negotiate rates. I don't view that as a big hurdle, but something that has to be done. So, there are a few steps that have to be taken once the rule does become effective. So, at the moment, it's certainly impossible to predict what the impact on 2016 might be at this point.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. All right. And then just a last one, I don't know if you have the stats with you, Steve, or not, but uninsured admissions relative to uninsured adjusted admissions, did one sort of outpace the other? Is there any way to put some context around whether the admissions was growing sort of at a faster pace than the adjusted admission simply \u2013 or specifically for the uninsured?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Yeah. I mean, uninsured admissions, I did say earlier, were probably up 6% or 7% in the quarter. I don't really know what the adjusted admission number is for uninsureds. I would say that generally the adjusted admission number for uninsureds doesn't vary greatly from the admission number, just because we don't have the large component outpatient revenue that we have for our regular admissions. It's basically ER revenue is the bulk of the outpatient revenue that we have. So, there's usually not a huge difference.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. All right. That's fine. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, thanks. Steve, do you feel like the acute care business has just gotten to be much more seasonal over the years? For years you've been earning less in the third quarter, more in the fourth quarter; anything just about physician behavior, vacation, employment benefits? I just don't know why we sit here and conclude that flat growth off of a year where your EBITDA expanded 85% is really a problem especially with this volume. So I feel like a lot of this is an overreaction, but I don't know. I'm just kind of curious as you scan the landscape and see what's going on, everyone's missing for different reasons right now. Just curious if you have any sort of perspective on what you think is occurring?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Well, thanks for the question, Whit. I think that the traditional seasonality of the business has been distorted over the last couple of years with the implementation of ACA, with Medicaid expansion in some of our big states, with commercial enrollment, commercial exchange enrollment, with the I think the dynamic in the fourth quarter \u2013 people exhausting co-pays and deductibles and having elective procedures done in the fourth quarter and that becoming more of an issue as co-pays and deductibles become a bigger part of the overall landscape.", "But I think the one sort of constant in all that is the third quarter has sort of traditionally been the weakest quarter. Honestly, when I saw our third quarter results a few weeks ago before anyone also commented on theirs, I generally thought they were kind of a slight miss that I attributed mostly to seasonality. I'm not actually sure that, having seen what other people have said, I really feel like that's wholly different. I mean again, I think we're \u2013 I'm back to the idea of feeling pretty good about a quarter in which lots of our surgeons and physicians are on vacation, lots of our patients are on vacation, elective procedures are usually down pretty significantly in the quarter, and we still grew our revenue by over 7%. I'm still feeling pretty good about the fundamental performance of that acute division.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "No, that's helpful. And just to be clear there, there wasn't any change in your charity care policy within the quarter, correct?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "That's correct.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And just one last one, just any update on the investigation?", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "No, not really. I think it \u2013 as we've sort of said, at some point we'll begin probably a more serious conversation with the government, but that has not occurred yet.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions. Thank you at this time.", "Steve G. Filton - Chief Financial Officer, Secretary & SVP", "Okay. Thanks to everybody and we'll talk to everybody at the end of the year. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS Fourth Quarter 2015 and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "And I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Filton, CFO. Please go ahead.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Brent. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015. During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates, and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $6.76 for the year and $1.74 for the quarter. After adjusting for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications in our acute care hospitals, as well as the other items attributable to last year's fourth quarter as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased approximately 12% to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $152 million or $1.51 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2014.", "On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.6% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015, over the comparable prior year quarter.", "We define operating margins as operating income or net revenues less salaries, wages and benefits, other operating expenses and supplies expense divided by net revenues. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 27.1% and 27.9% during the quarters ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.", "On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues increased 7.3% during the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted admissions increased 4.8%, while revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.3%. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to 16.8% during the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.021 billion during 2015, as compared to $1.036 billion during 2014. The small decrease is primarily attributable to $199 million unfavorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2015 as compared to 2014, resulting mainly from the timing of disbursements.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased to 52 days during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 54 days during the fourth quarter of 2014. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 45%.", "We spent $110 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2015 and $379 million during the full year of 2015. During 2016, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $425 million on capital expenditures, which include expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.", "In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 478,000 shares of our stock at a cost of $58 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, we purchased an additional 887,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $99 million.", "$77 million remains on the previous authorization, and yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an additional $400 million in share repurchases. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2016 is $7.12 to $7.58 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.17 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2016, as described in our press release. This guidance range represents an increase of approximately 4% to 10% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $6.87 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2015, as calculated on the Supplemental Schedule included in last night's press release.", "During 2016, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $9.75 billion to $9.85 billion, representing an increase of approximately 8% to 9% over 2015 net revenues.", "We are pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, everybody. Maybe just to drill down a little further on the components of the 2016 guidance, Steve, possibly can you give us any commentary around your thoughts on revenue or EBITDAR growth by segment? And are there any other items in there that impact the guidance, like acquisitions, further share buybacks, or new development that we should think about?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, A.J. So, I think we've been fairly transparent over the course of the last few months in talking about our outlook for next year. In terms of the two segments, I think on the acute side, we see revenue growth of about 6% next year in the acute division same store. On the behavioral side, probably a little bit lower, maybe 5%. I think the acute care 6% is split fairly evenly between price and volume, and I think the behavioral 5% is probably weighted a little more towards volume rather than to price. And I think in both divisions, we expect margins to increase slightly if we can achieve those revenue growth levels.", "In terms of unusual items or other things that are not included in what I just went through, we have talked for many quarters now that we will be opening a new sixth acute care hospital in Las Vegas. We estimate that to occur in the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016. That's probably a $5 million to $10 million EBITDA drag on the back half of next year as we have pre-opening and then \u2013 pre-opening cost and startup losses. And it's probably a bit more of a drag at the net income line as the depreciation and interest associated with that facility comes online.", "We probably lose a few million dollars next year on foreign exchange impact in the UK. We probably lose a few million dollars on a decline in, what we call, special Medicaid reimbursement monies which would be UPL and disproportionate share and provider taxes. And I think the only other probably noteworthy item about our guidance is that as has always been our historical practice, we assume that our free cash flow is dedicated to the repayment of debt and all \u2013 the only share repurchase or other deployment of capital that we build into our guidance and build into our model is that which has already occurred. And so, I think it's a fairly conservative way of thinking about 2016 capital deployment because repayment of debt at the moment is the least accretive of all of our capital deployment options.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "And on that last point, I would assume you're including the $99 million you've purchased to date or is that not included in guidance, year-to-date this year?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That is included.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Maybe my follow-up would be just \u2013 so you're assuming that you get a rebound in the psych revenues to your long-term target of at least 5%. Obviously, the last two quarters you've been a little bit below that. Can you comment on a little more? I know you've talked about some shortage of clinicians. Is that still the primary driver and how quick can that be addressed?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I mean I would point out, A.J., that I think one of the drivers of the somewhat softer behavioral revenues in Q4 was a pretty difficult comparison to last year, particularly on the volume side. I think same-store admissions, behavioral admissions in the fourth quarter of last year were up 6.8%. And so I think we always knew that was going to be a tough nut to compare to in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, as you alluded to, we have talked in the last quarter or two about the fact that in some of our markets and I think the national data is supportive of this as well, we're facing a shortage to some degree of psychiatrists, in many cases and in some cases, nursing and other clinical professionals and again in some markets that's causing us to not be able to treat all the patients who present themselves for admission and it mutes our volume and ultimately our revenue numbers in some of those markets.", "We feel like the 5% number that I have identified as being embedded in our revenue guidance for next year is absolutely achievable. We are working our way through the shortages in many of these markets. The comparisons certainly become easier as the year goes on. Next year, I would suggest that, that 5% may be a little bit back-end loaded as we work through the comparisons and work through some of the clinical shortages. But I think we feel like the number is eminently achievable.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "A.J., Steve talked about how we put together the guidance, et cetera, and all of the charges we have as we go through it, I want to point out that Henderson Hospital, which will open as you mentioned in the fourth quarter, will cost us in the short run obviously, but Temecula Hospital, which we opened a couple of years ago, has been running well, well ahead of budget. So, we made some pretty good investments.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. I mean Las Vegas is a market that keeps on giving, I guess, for you guys in Southern California, too, to some degree. Thanks a lot.", "Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Great, thanks. Just want to go into the acute care side of things and the margins and I guess, this is the second quarter of 7% type growth and margin contraction. Just want to see if you go through some of the issues, is it the same issues that were impacting Q3 margins that were impacting Q4, and why do you feel comfortable that margins are going to be up next year or this year?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, I'm not sure where the commentary on margin contraction comes from, Kevin. I mean in my remarks, I pointed out that on a same facility basis, acute care margins were 17.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. So...", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I'm sorry. Then I guess the issues that you talked about in Q3 then, have they been addressed in Q4?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. I think that we had clinical shortages, personnel shortages on the acute side in Q3 as did some of our peers. And what we said at that time was that we thought we could hire enough permanent nurses to generally overcome most of the problem. We thought that we'd make progress in the fourth quarter and continue to make progress into the first part of 2016. And I think that's the way it shaped up. We definitely made progress in Q4, and I think we'll make some further progress in the first half of 2016.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And then I guess the bad debt spiked in Q3, I guess, it was up year-over-year in Q4 but down sequentially from where you were. Can you talk a little bit about the trends there?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I mean \u2013 so I think when you know \u2013 you're looking at the uncompensated care numbers and they are certainly up in Q4. That's almost always going to be the case simply as a function of pricing because of the way we calculate that. Our uninsured admission growth in Q4 actually slowed a little bit. In Q3, our uninsured admission growth was tracking ahead of our overall admission growth, and that trend reversed itself in Q4 while our overall uninsured admissions were up. They were up slightly slower than our overall admissions.", "So, I think our payer mix seems to be settling in to a bit more of a stable environment in Q4. And again, I think we're just extremely pleased at the overall even after uncompensated care is included, 7% plus growth in acute care revenues in Q4.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And do you expect payer mix to be stable into 2016?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think that's generally our expectation, to be fair. Payer mix is probably the most difficult of \u2013 sort of all the assumptions and all the metrics to predict. But our general sense is that the two items that have affected payer mix over the last few years have been the ACA and its favorable impact on improving payer mix. And we think that that has been moderating over the last few years and will continue to moderate next year and it's part of the reason why we think our acute care revenue growth moderates from the 8% or so in 2015 to more like 6% in 2016. And then the improving economies, I don't think we necessarily feel like our local market economies are improving as rapidly as they were in 2014 and 2015, but I think we feel like they certainly will remain stable in 2016.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I think you might have alluded to this a little bit, but just a question broadly on labor cost. I think you mentioned on the psych side still seeing more, I guess, on the physician and I guess a little bit in nursing. But anything more broadly in terms of labor cost and more specifically on the acute care side?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I mean, I think what we said in Q3 vis-\u00e0-vis the acute care labor sort of situation was that we felt like our use of temporary nurses or registry nurses was greater than it should be, that's a function, I think, of a number of things including turnover rates that we'd like to drive somewhat lower, decisions that are made exactly when and how to hire permanent nurses, et cetera.", "And I think we generally attributed the increase in salary expense and the pressure on salary expense in Q3 to some inefficiencies in terms of not hiring as many permanent nurses as we needed to in Q3. And again, I think we felt like that was a transient problem that we can address. And as I was commenting to Kevin, I think we felt like we did address it in Q4. Clearly, the numbers got better. And I think our expectation is frankly they'll continue to improve into 2016.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And you put contract labor and other expense, right? It's not in the SWB line, is that right?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, contract nurses are in the salary line. Contract physicians are in the other operating expense line.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then just a second question, just on the buybacks. You guys have been a little bit more active to start the year. Should we read into that in terms of anything around the M&A landscape or other uses? I mean, you guys obviously don't have a leverage issue, in my opinion, so I'm sure you can do both. But I just want to make sure we shouldn't be reading into the environment or something like that.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, I think, Josh, we share your view that our leverage levels are such that we are flexible enough to do any number of things to respond to M&A opportunities as well as to be a share repurchaser if the market dictates that. Our commentary in the last few quarters and I would repeat it, I don't think it has changed in Q4 is that we think the M&A landscape is still active for us on both sides of the business. We completed two reasonably sized behavioral deals in the back half of last year and continue to look at others into 2016. We've commented that the landscape and the market for acute care deals that are, I think, more suitable in our minds for what has been historically our market profile of more suburban, midsize, urban markets, larger hospitals, larger hospital systems seems more active. It's always difficult to predict which of those deals or how many of those deals might ultimately prove to be actionable or executable. But we certainly feel like it is more active.", "But also, like many of you, I think we have viewed the decline in our stock over the last couple of quarters as really not something that has been justified by the underlying fundamentals of the business, which we don't feel have changed very much over the last six months. And as a consequence, we feel that their degree of confidence in our underlying business and feel like the current valuations of our stock are a compelling opportunity as well. And that's why we've become a more active acquirer of shares as well. So, I think as you suggest and I think, given our balance sheet and our flexibility, we're going to pursue any and all of these opportunities that continue to make economic sense for us.", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yes. Hi. Sorry. Just first, a soapbox comment, which I guess, you've gotten before, that we appreciate the fact that you don't waste 20, 25 minutes of your time and our time reading through the press release and go right to questions. So, thank you very much for that. Let me ask about the bad debt trend, recognizing that the strong acute revenue growth was more important than that. Can you give us any granularity? I know last quarter, you talked about the South Texas market being an area where you saw an uptick in uncompensated care. Is that continuing or is there anything to spike out from there?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, Matt, I think from a geographic perspective, we have said now, frankly, for several quarters that if you look at our acute care results overall, the Las Vegas market, the Southern California market has generally been tracking above the average acute care result. And I think that's true across the board in terms of volumes and revenue and payer mix and bad debt. And we've said that the Texas market and markets, because we have multiple markets in Texas, have generally been lagging the average. And I think that was true in Q4. I'm not exactly sure why that is. Obviously, there is a great deal of focus and speculation that that's oil and gas-related and driven. We tend not to be in markets that are directly impacted by the oil and gas business. So, I'm not certain that that's the main driver or the only driver for sure. But certainly, our Texas markets for the last several quarters have been underperforming the acute care average.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you for that. And one more question, if I could, on a different topic. Amidst all the pressure on insurers, on the ACA exchange business, what are you generally seeing in terms of the dynamic for commercial rate negotiations, both as it relates to that business and generally, the larger core group business as well?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, let me address that, I think, both in terms of volume and price. And I'll make the comment, and I think we've been making this comment and expressing this view longer and probably more adamantly than some of our peers and that is, we've always found it difficult to precisely carve out our ACA experience and separate out exactly what our ACA commercial experience and rates are versus our overall commercial experience. And I would say, we continue \u2013 and honestly, as the ACA has progressed and we're now well into our third year \u2013 actually into our fourth year of it, I think that we find that even more difficult.", "So, my commentary is probably more about commercial rates just generally than about ACA rates, specifically, and that is we don't see tremendous changes either in our rate of increase. I think our commercial rates have increased still average in the 6%, 6.5% range. It varies to some degree by contract, by market. But I think that's still our average. And I don't think we're really seeing significant changes in other terms. In benefit plan design, we're not seeing an emphasis on narrow networks that I think we actually expected we would see more of, et cetera. So, I think as we enter 2016 and as we think about creating our model for 2016, it is more of the same, as much as anything.", "Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. That's it. Sorry. Go ahead.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the staffing shortages and maybe, more particularly, I think you mentioned psychiatrists. That doesn't sound overly transient. But maybe you could talk through the dynamics there, how you can sort of fix that and whether this is also an area of higher wage pressure that we should expect on the behavioral side of the business going forward.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So, look, I think that your comment, Ralph, in the sense that I believe we're facing psychiatrist shortages in specific markets because I think, nationally, the data suggests that the number of new psychiatrists over the last decade have not kept up or have lagged the overall number of new doctors, so the percentage of psychiatrists is actually declining. And I agree with you. That is a kind of more structural issue. I believe the market tends to correct for that, in that as the demand for psychiatrists increases, as psychiatrists' earnings increase, more and more people get attracted to the field, more and more practicing psychiatrists will choose to devote at least some of their hours to clinical activities, rather than to academic or other activities. So, I do think there is some market correction that goes on for all this.", "In addition, I think \u2013 and the trend, what my commentary about this being a transient problem is really meant to imply that I believe we can pull levers in our markets to address the issue. We can more aggressively recruit for psychiatrists. We can bring psychiatrists into a market that has a shortage. Your comment that that may cost us more money and, in fact, I think does cost us more money if you look at, one of the reasons I think that our behavioral margins have come under pressure is because the cost of acquiring psychiatrists has also gone up in addition to there being some pressure on our volumes.", "And the other thing that I think we do in markets where the regulatory environment allows us to is we create physician extenders, nurses and other clinicians who can do some of the tasks that psychiatrists are sometimes asked to do. And that helps us as well in terms of not having enough psychiatrists. So, we're doing all those things, and pulling all those levers and aggressively focus on the issue. And to some degree, I think, our confidence that we're going to do those things better than some of our peers in our markets causes me to comment or to believe that this is a transient sort of issue that we can overcome.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. But the behavioral revenue up 5%, we should think of an ability to still get to sort of EBITDA growth on a same-store basis of at least that 5% versus maybe a little bit below?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's certainly what we have embedded in our guidance.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, all right. Fair enough. And then just quickly on the acute side, you posted volume trends well in excess of peers for several quarters now. I know you are in a smaller subset of markets and have a little bit of a smaller hospital base. But any sense of dynamics within your specific markets about whether you think all hospitals within your areas are seeing similar trends? Do you think you are taking market share? Have you seen hospital closures? Just anything that stands out around the disproportionately better volume trends you're seeing? Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think as your question suggests, Ralph, it's a combination of factors. We tended to be in markets that were disproportionately hurt by the recession and had higher unemployment rates. I think that a number of sell-side folks did analysis during the recession of where unemployment was the highest. And when they compare the public companies, I think we often fared the worst during the height of the recession in places like Las Vegas, and Southern California, South Florida, South Texas.", "But what we suggested at the time and we believed was that when the economy recovered and when those local market economies recovered, we would benefit disproportionately from those recoveries. And I think that has certainly been an element of what has happened over the course of the last few years. As Las Vegas has come, I would suggest, roaring back, we've really benefited from that, for example.", "But I think we also believe that in many of our markets, we are aggressively increasing our market share. Both Alan and I mentioned the fact that in our big California market, which is Riverside County, we built a new hospital several years ago. In the Las Vegas market, we're building a new hospital to open later this year. We continue to take those very obvious actions and other not-so-obvious actions to cement, enhance and increase our market share in most of our acute care markets, and I think we have done that fairly successfully over the last few years as well. So, I think both of those dynamics are at play when you see the really robust and industry-leading acute care revenue growth that we've been putting up.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Ryan Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. This is Ryan Halsted on for Gary. I was hoping you could drill more into your behavior revenue growth guidance. The 5% is towards the low end, I guess, of your \u2013 of past ranges and certainly below where you have grown in the recent past. So I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little more color on the reimbursement environment and what makes you a little cautious on that outlook.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Ryan. So, actually, I think as the conversation and commentary has been so far in the call, the issue for us is not so much caution about the pricing environment which I think, actually, has been fairly healthy, and I think even if you look at Q4, the 2.5% pricing growth on our revenue per day in behavioral is, quite frankly, as good as and a little better than we expected. So that I don't think is the concern going into or the caution \u2013 I should say the caution going into 2016.", "I think the caution is some of the volume pressures that we've seen over the last few quarters, and I think those volume pressures are manifested in a few different areas. The area that we talked about the most historically and certainly over the last few quarters has been length-of-stay compression that even when we were posting really strong admission growth, length-of-stay compression was muting or diminishing that growth to a degree. I think the length-of-stay pressure is starting to alleviate some and so we're hopeful that will continue, but the admission softness that we've seen as a result of \u2013 again two things. Very difficult comparisons in the beginning of 2016 that I think clouds some of our guidance for the year, and then some of the issues we've had over the clinician shortages that we've been talking about and while, as I've said in my previous commentary, I think we can address those. It may take a quarter or two. So, I think that's really what has caused us to be a little more muted about our behavioral revenue growth.", "And obviously, in the long-term, we think that the tailwinds for behavioral revenue growth have a lot of potential. We haven't really talked in this call about the potential for the IMD exclusion being partially or fully lifted. But we believe that will occur and when it does, that will provide an opportunity for another step-up in behavioral volumes that we're likely to see not so much in 2016, but in 2017 and thereafter.", "Ryan Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then my second question. If you take a look at your segment EBITDAR on a same-store basis, I realize there was some margin pressure on the behavioral side. But just even on a year-over-year EBITDAR growth basis, it looked like, combined, the segments were up nicely. But then comparing that with the consolidated EBITDAR, the growth year-over-year wasn't as much. So, I was just wondering if there was anything on a non-same-store basis or on a corporate overhead basis that I should be thinking about, or am I not thinking about this correctly?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I mean there's nothing that really stands out, Ryan. I will make the comment that we did have a favorable malpractice adjustment last year, and I know just from talking to some analysts last night that not everybody was taking that into account. So, I would just ask people to go back and make sure they've \u2013 we, if you will, equalize that adjustment in our supplemental schedule. So, I would just sort of ask everybody to focus on making sure they've done that.", "I think other than that, I can't think of any really significant changes other than as we disclosed. Last year, we acquired an insurance company, insurance product in our acute care division last year. That's been a little bit of a drag, although I don't think it's a huge needle mover.", "Ryan Halsted - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Hi, Steve.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Ana.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Again, coming back to bad debt, you had improved your bad debt pretty nicely, I think, sequentially. And in the third quarter, a lot of the companies had issues. For the most part, there has been some improvement into the fourth quarter. There was speculation around exchanges. The, I think, ACA talked about Medicaid application processing in communities taking that write-down on collectability of the consumer cost sharing piece of it. Was this just a spike and a blip in the third quarter? And do you feel out of the woods and so we should look at your bad debt slap now into 2016 taking the baseline from 4Q? Or are there any uncertainties as you look at your revenue cycle management and you're trying to drill down into what happened there?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So, to be perfectly candid, I think we struggled in Q3 with explaining the increase in uncompensated volumes. As you suggest, some of our peers offered explanations that included some level of disenrollment in the exchanges as exchange participants found their premiums going up where they suggested that maybe some exchange participants had game the system and enrolled to get certain care but then disenrolled when they got that care. Those explanations seemed reasonable, and we can sort of find anecdotal examples within our own experience to support those explanations. But don't really have the vast database to really be able to validate them in any pervasive or comprehensive way. And I think our fourth quarter experience would suggest that even if those explanations were valid in Q3, they didn't necessarily extend into Q4.", "The other question you asked about, which I think, we certainly would concur with the experience. I mean we have seen that as the ACA has been implemented and as exchange plans have become more prevalent and many of them have high deductable, high co-insurance components to them that the level of \u2013 or the amount of the bill due from the patient has gone up, and as a consequence, the level of bad debt on that portion of the bill has also gone up. We believe that our accounting for that change has been real time and current all along and has been reflected over the course of the last several years in our current results. So, I don't feel like \u2013 we feel like there's any catch-up required in the way that we're recognizing that phenomena for financial statement purposes.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve. And on the volumes, just coming back to the acute care volumes, I think it sounds like you're saying to an earlier question that it was more secular growth than share shifting from other players in the markets that you are in. As you saw the 4Q trends on both volumes and on acuity and then coming into the first quarter, anything you are seeing in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter from a seasonality perspective or the acuity or types of decisions that would tell us what the drivers of that volume growth is?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So just to go back, and I would say that what \u2013 my answer before was really meant to say that I think our acute care revenues in general are benefiting from both the improvement in our end market economies, as well as the ACA benefit. And honestly, I think, sometimes, it's difficult for us to distinguish precisely between the two and market share gains as well. So, again, I think all those dynamics are contributing.", "In terms of, I think, forward-looking into just the early part of 2016, I think \u2013 and I think most of the surveys have suggested this that the end of 2015 and the beginning of January were slow from a volume perspective on the acute side. I think that may be attributable to the fact that it was a late starting and relatively slow flu season. But I would say over the course of the last six weeks from the middle of January to the end of February, acute care activity, at least at our hospitals, seems to be pretty robust and certainly doesn't give us any pause about being able to continue to achieve the numbers that we identified before.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "And one final question on the IMD exclusion. There was a very recent news flow, I think, last week that CMS sent this to the Office of Management and Budget. Were there any changes or markups from the behavioral hospital industry and/or managed Medicaid in the version that has gone there relative to what we saw last May?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We believe that the version, particularly in terms of the provisions that are most relevant to us, remains intact and viewed the news item that you point out as a good one or a positive one in the sense that, even though the process is moving albeit a little bit slower than we would like, it is moving. And as I was saying before, I think we expect the pending CMS rule to be issued sometime this year. And we would hope that the effective date would be no later than the beginning of next year and that would provide a tailwind for our behavioral business and our behavioral volumes going into next year.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thanks, Steve, very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey. Thanks for the question. Steve, I apologize if I missed this, but did you provide an update on how your UK operations are performing?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We didn't. We didn't get that specific question. The UK commentary over the last few quarters has been that both our original Cygnet acquisition as well as our subsequent Alpha acquisition and our smaller one-offs and new beds are really generally doing quite well. Occupancy rates for our UK behavioral hospitals, on average, are in the low-90s. And we continue to look for further expansion opportunities and the ability to grow that platform in the UK, which we continue to remain very enthusiastic about.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Do you think the review of the Priory transaction, Acadia's transaction with the Priory Group, do you think that would provide some opportunities for one-off facility pickups?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Obviously, hard for me to answer that question because I think it's a function of: A, what the trade commission in the UK decides to do, if anything, when they review the transaction; and, obviously, B, what Acadia decides to do with their portfolio of hospitals, either in response to the trade commission action or in response to other priorities that they may have. So, again, I think we're looking at all opportunities in the UK. And we'll respond to any and all opportunities that arise, whether they're from that transaction or from, I think, a host of other sources that we're obviously exploring at the same time.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And lastly, in April, the comprehensive joint replacement bundling initiative begins. I'm sure you've made arrangements to prepare for that. Maybe if you could discuss that a little bit.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, all of our acute care hospitals have participated in Medicare's bundled payment demonstration project so far. I think and, again, I don't believe our experience is in any way unique. I think we're finding the data that Medicare is providing, both in terms of the amount and level and timeliness of that data, to be somewhat insufficient for us to be able to really participate in this in a meaningful way and make meaningful changes. So, I think we're probably likely to actually step back our level of activity and step back in when I think the program is working more efficiently and I think some of the kinks are worked out. But to your point, I mean, I think we've on, from an infrastructure perspective, prepared and feel very prepared for what we think is going to be the long-term trend in this industry, which are more coordinated, more collaborative payments, more risk-based payments. We've done a lot of work over the last several years to be prepared for that and I think feel like we are.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. Just curious, any commentary around surgical volumes and ED volumes, what were they and how does that compare to recent trends?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, Frank, I think surgical volumes, as has been the trend for the last few years, continue to outpace even our admissions growth. And I think on the surgical side, surgical volumes are up overall. In Q4, we returned a little bit more to what we've been seeing, the historical pattern where, I think, outpatient volumes are up like 4% and inpatient volumes are up 2%. We went through a few quarters where inpatient was actually outpacing outpatient and that was really contributing to some very strong revenue and revenue acuity. This is a bit more normalized, but, again, in the end, still helping us put up 7% acute care revenue growth, which we're quite pleased with.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Got you. And just curious, you announced an acquisition back in the fall. I haven't heard you really talk much about it, in the addiction treatment area, the Foundations acquisition. I just wonder if you could give us an update there on how that transaction has been working and from our perspective, we thought it had a chance of being relatively accretive and just any color there? Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And I'm sorry, Frank. You faded in the very beginning at least for me. Were you asking about Foundations?", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yes, yes.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. I'm sorry. I thought you were. Yeah. So Foundations, which was a behavioral acquisition that we did in October of last year, really, from our perspective, was intended to enhance our presence in the addiction recovery business. UHS has been in the addiction recovery business for as long as we've been in the behavioral business, for 30-plus years. But the Foundations' model, business model, is a bit different. It's a bit more of an out-of-network model, although it's a fairly balanced in and out of network source of patients. And it's much more of a direct-to-consumer marketing model than our traditional referral-based model.", "And what we thought is that the Foundations' approach and the Foundations' infrastructure and their very nuanced patient capture system and technology that they have would be a nice complement both to our existing addiction treatment businesses, as well as to other like-diagnoses businesses, things like autism and eating disorders.", "And I think that's really the way it's shaping up. So I think that the early results from Foundations are good and they're encouraging. But I think what we're really most excited about is really taking the best of both of our models, if you will, and combining them, not only in the addiction business, but in some of these other similar diagnoses and service line businesses. And we think the real payoff is further down the road.", "Frank Morgan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Just one final one, if I can, a clarification on your discussion around CapEx, including construction of the hospital. I'm assuming that's just the one in the Vegas area. Or was there another one that you are contemplating that you are allocating some capital for? Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's the only acute care hospital. We have a couple of de novo projects that are on the \u2013 in some stage of development on the behavioral side as well. Obviously, those are smaller dollars.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hi. Hi, good morning. Most of my stuff has been answered. But I'm curious about a couple of things. So, you guys can put capital in broadly three different buckets. You can continue to add on in the UK, you can do American behavioral, American \u2013 or American addiction assets or you can look at large U.S. acute assets. Do you have any preference or is it all case by case?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And, John, I would add to that which I know you didn't purposely leave out, the opportunity to repurchase our own shares which we've been doing as well.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Sure, sure.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Look, I think we have always made the argument and I think we make the argument because we really believe it that we are relatively ambivalent about where we invest our next dollar of capital. And I say \u2013 I use the term ambivalent to mean that we would like to invest our next dollar of capital wherever it is going to earn the best return or certainly earn over our hurdle rate of return. And if there are opportunities in each of those buckets that you described, I think we feel like we have the opportunity and the financial and capital flexibility to do that.", "On the other hand, I think one of the hallmarks of UHS as a disciplined investor over the years is that if those opportunities are not compelling and they don't meet our return hurdles, we're okay with waiting until we find some that do. And I think that's going to be our approach going forward. It's been our historical approach. And I think the only comment that we've made in the last few quarters is we think that pipeline is fairly active, and we would hope that we'll be able to find some actionable deals out of that pipeline.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And I guess as a follow-on to that, did you guys look at any intensity in the \u2013 at the Priory deal? And was there anything about that that you didn't like, either the price or the mix of assets or just doubling down in the UK?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I mean I'm not \u2013 we're not going to comment on any specific transaction. But I think that most of the transactions that get announced in the public space are transactions that are made available to most of the public players. And on those transactions, we certainly do our due diligence and do our work. And I think we look at the opportunity just as I described, what's the historical growth rate of the assets that are being sold, what's the likely future growth rate, what's the price.", "And as a consequence, what's the likely return. And there are deals that we either choose not to participate in, or somebody chooses to pay more for. And that's okay with us. I think we historically have gotten most of the deals that we thought really made compelling sense. We don't get them all, but I think we have found that our relatively judicious and deliberative approach to capital deployment has served us well over the years and continue to believe that's the case.", "Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "John...", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. Yeah.", "Alan B. Miller - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Steve had covered it very, very adequately. But as you pointed out, we have a number of areas that we can invest. I think we are a prudent investor and it's a question of which appears to have growth possibilities, what's the price and we're indifferent with regard to which area we put it into. But we are certainly concerned about the level of debt of the corporation and the equity and you know that.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So would you \u2013 as the world moves more to outpatient, you have got this impressive fleet of inpatient assets. But are you thinking \u2013 is there any thought in the board level down the road that maybe we need to make a bigger step in an outpatient basis? Or do you think you are adequately covered just blocking and tackling market by market?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I mean, John, we don't talk about outpatient as a discrete business strategy because I think we believe that there's an integrated outpatient strategy in every single one of our acute care markets. We certainly acknowledge the trend that everybody has seen over the last few years of a shift of traditionally inpatient procedures to outpatient and I think in virtually all of our markets, we could discuss in some detail how we've tried to take advantage of that, the facilities that we have either built on our own or acquired, the specific marketing emphasis that we've taken on. But again, I think we have not embarked on a sort of a discrete outpatient strategy, meaning that we've not necessarily been interested in obtaining or embarking on outpatient revenue growth outside of our markets. But we're very aggressively pursuing the strategy within our existing markets.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And then just lastly, what is spurring \u2013 a couple of you, you and your peer group, there seems to be just a little bit more at the conversation level for acute care assets. And I'm talking about the type of acute care assets that you're screening, not rural or small market. What do you think is driving that?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think, John, that as acute care hospitals, in general, think about the changing healthcare landscape. They see, as a question before suggested, a move \u2013 a long-term move from fee-for-service reimbursement to some sort of risk-based reimbursement whether that's bundled payments as we were talking about before or ACO-type payments or capitated payments. That's a huge change and a huge change in the requirements and the expertise of running acute care hospitals and I think a lot of the hospitals that we've talked to worry about their ability to compete in that new landscape, either from a physical facility perspective and information technology perspective, a relationship with physician perspective. I think there are a whole host of changes that hospitals will have to make. And some hospitals, certainly not all, but some hospitals, I think, are deciding that they prefer to have help either greater expertise or greater capital infusion or some combination of both as they embark on those challenges. And in my mind, that's probably what's driving this increased level of interest and activity.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Well, I've taken more than enough time. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you. Good morning. I just have one question on the acute care business. You mentioned the gain in market share as well as seeing benefits from end market economies and the ACA. And just wondering on the market share side if you can remind us what kind of investments you are making there to keep that edge and to grow your market share. And do you think that that's a piece that could continue on into 2017 and beyond?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. That's a difficult question to answer in a short way, Paula. Because again, I think it is largely a market-by-market discussion, because I think that the strategies in each market are not necessarily the same. But we certainly have talked over the years about investing in physician ownership and physician practices. We've invested in information technology so that we have a more integrated approach with our physicians. We've invested in physical facilities and continuing on to what I was saying to John, and upgrading our outpatient capabilities in particular. We've acquired a number of outpatient facilities in our markets over the last few years.", "So, again, in the context of having a few more minutes to talk about it, I'd love to talk about maybe some of the individual strategies and individual markets. But suffice it to say at this point that I think it's a multi-pronged approach in each of our markets.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Okay. That's fair. And just maybe if I could just follow up, you talk about the secular improvement and how much room do you see for economic improvement in some of your markets? Are we full here or do you think there is still some room like in areas like Texas, for example?", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. Look, I'm not a macro economist by any means, Paula. So, I answer questions like this with a lot of trepidation. But I will say that during the recession, we saw the negative impacts of this long and profound recession over the course, I would argue of, in some cases, four years or five years in some of our markets, beginning as early as 2009 and continuing in many of these markets through 2013. And so, it would not be surprising to me if the recovery in those same markets was over a similar period. And we're probably three years or so in most of these markets into the recovery. So, while I think the impact is probably starting to diminish, I would still think we have another year or two of positive runway in a lot of these markets.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Thank you. That's helpful.", "Operator", "And sir, we have no further questions at this time.", "Steve G. Filton - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody's time and patience this morning and look forward to talking with everybody again in a couple of months after the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Baird & Co., Inc.", "Rice - UBS Securities", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Gary Taylor - JPMorgan Securities", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services First Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "And Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016.", "During the conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend the careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.", "We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company reported net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.93 for the quarter. After adjusting for the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share was $1.98 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.", "On a same facility basis in our acute division, revenues increased 12% during the first quarter of 2016. The increase resulted primarily from a 7.8% increase in adjusted admissions and a 3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals increased to 21.1% during first quarter of 2016 from 20.5% during the first quarter of 2015.", "On a same facility basis, revenues in our behavioral health division increased 3.5% during the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.4% and adjusted patient days increased 1.0% over the prior-year first quarter. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.2% during the first quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior-year quarter.", "On a same facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division decreased to 27.8% during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 28.4% during the comparable prior-year period.", "Our cash provided by operating activities increased 71% to approximately $464 million during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $271 million in the first quarter of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding declined to 51 days during the first quarter of 2016, and our ratio of debt-to-total capitalization decreased to 43.3% at March 31, 2016 as compared to 44.6% at March 31, 2015.", "We spent $127 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year.", "During the first quarter, we opened a total of 182 new behavioral health beds, including 57 beds opened at a new de novo hospital located in Oklahoma and 125 beds opened at some of our busiest facilities. Many behavioral health construction projects are underway, including six new de novo hospitals totaling 562 beds.", "In February of 2016, our board of directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $800 million. In conjunction with this program, during the first quarter of 2016 we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $152 million or approximately $113 per share. Since inception of the program through March 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $377 million or approximately $117 per share.", "Alan and I will be pleased to answer questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Tejus Ujjani", "Hi. This is Tejus here joining on for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. Regarding behavioral, you'd mentioned a shortage of psychiatrists last quarter that led you to turn away patients. Can you provide any update on that? As well as any increase in expense to attract and retain these doctors?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So, if you look at the behavioral revenue growth for the quarter of about 3.5%, it's pretty consistent of what we were running in the back half of 2015. And I think many of the same dynamics are in place. We had a pretty tough comparison in the first quarter of 2016. So we were not really disappointed with those numbers. They met our expectations, and our behavioral results in general were very much in line with our budget for the quarter.", "But we continue to face both psychiatrist, nursing and other clinician shortages in some of our markets. And in some cases, that is muting or depressing what would otherwise, we think, be higher demand and higher volumes. We have a number of initiatives in place to try and rectify those dynamics in those situations. And we believe, as we said at the end of the year that our behavioral revenue growth should increase as the year goes on, as those comparisons become easier and as some of those initiatives begin to get more traction.", "Tejus Ujjani", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.", "Frank Lee", "Hi. This is Frank Lee on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. Same-store revenue in the acute care business was very strong in the quarter. Do you have a sense for how much of the growth was attributable to economic improvements in your market or increasing market share? And then are you able to size the impact of the leap year for the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. Look, I think it's always difficult to precisely size the impact of leap year. I think on an admissions basis, the extra day just mathematically gives you about 3% more admissions. But in terms of overall revenue, it's a little bit harder to do. Obviously, however you slice it, the revenue growth in the acute care division for the quarter was extremely strong and well in excess of the 6% revenue growth that we anticipated in our guidance and in our budget for the year.", "Again, I think it's difficult to parse that growth out into individual pieces. We still continue to get some benefit from the ACA and expanded Medicaid enrollment and new commercial exchange enrollment, although certainly that benefit is diminishing now that we're into its third year. We continue to benefit as our markets improve economically, and that certainly continues as well.", "But I think one of the most encouraging aspects of the quarter from our perspective is the single biggest admission growth for us was in our Medicare payer class. And in theory, Medicare patients are probably largely unimpacted by both the ACA dynamics and by an improving economy.", "And so I think what that's reflective of is just general strength of the franchises that we're operating in our local markets and the initiatives that our operators have put in place for some time now to create more and more physician integration in our markets, to focus on really important service lines to us like orthopedics and cardiology, and to really just focus on business development.", "I think that we have had for four or five quarters among the industry-leading admissions from an acute care perspective. And while I know the other companies have yet to report, my guess is we'll certainly be in that position again this quarter.", "Frank Lee", "Okay. Thanks. And then the bad debt bed ratio was pretty flat year-over-year after a few quarters of volatility. Do you think that the bad debt has stabilized at this point? And do you have a view on where that will go for the rest of the year?", "Steve Filton", "Always difficult, as Yogi Bear would say, to predict the future. But for us I think, again, very strong payer mix in the first quarter, Medicare admission growth growing faster than our overall admissions, Medicaid growing at about the same pace as our overall admissions, commercial admissions growing slightly lower, but uninsured admissions flat to actually slightly down and obviously that is an extremely favorable payer mix.", "Again, hard to say exactly how sustainable that is, but I think we generally feel like the acute care business is running very strongly at the moment, and certainly makes our sense of what was possible in our guidance and in our budget seem extremely achievable at this point.", "Frank Lee", "Okay. Thanks on lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Hey. Good morning. This is Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin today. Thanks for taking the questions. So, just coming back to the previous commentary around strengthening the volumes in acute care business, so that was really helpful. But also, can you talk about the markets because, I guess, seems like Vegas, I guess, was indicated that things are going well there. So anything that changed maybe in other markets or should we just think about all the trends in 2016 in terms of strong Nevada and California and Texas not that strong, and any color in terms of market performance on acute care pricing?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Joanna. I mean I think that the practical reality is when you post revenue numbers as strong as we did in Q1, the strength by definition has to be pretty pervasive. It's almost impossible for a single market to drive those kinds of overall strong numbers. Generally, however, I would just sort of comment that many of the trends that we've remarked on in recent quarters have remained in place.", "You alluded to the fact that our Vegas market has been performing quite well, and that continued into Q1. Our Southern California market has also performed very well. Our Temecula Hospital, which is now in its third year of operation, is performing particularly well, and that's driving some very strong numbers out of Riverside County, California.", "Washington, DC, has been a strong market for us and was in Q1. We see some weakness in the South Texas markets, which we've remarked on previously, although even their volume numbers were certainly improved in Q1 as well.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Great. And then, turning the topic a little bit on the behavioral side, I guess in terms of the recent circulation or rather the final regs from CMS regarding managed Medicaid and allowing plans to pay for behavioral health in freestanding facilities. So, when we think about it, how are you going to think about these changes taking effect in reality for you specifically? How long, I guess, it would take for the full patterns really to change? Should we think that this would take a year or longer in terms of how it would actually be reflective in your operations?", "Steve Filton", "Well, again I think, Joanna, our commentary on the lifting of the IMD exclusion has been I think reasonably consistent over time and that is we, I think, like others in the freestanding behavioral industry, view the lifting of the IMD exclusion certainly as a positive development, albeit one that will show its impact or reflect its impact gradually over time.", "It will require some effort to get access to this patient population. And I think we've always said, it's difficult to quantify what the potential benefit will be at the outset. But we I think share what is generally a consensus view that the benefit and the potential benefit is significant.", "I'll also make the point, and I know we've talked about this a number of times previously, that we view the lifting of the IMD exclusion and our ability to take these patients that have previously been seen in acute care hospitals with behavioral units in a broader context of trying to integrate with the behavioral units in acute care hospitals in our markets for all their patients.", "We have opened over the course of the last few years a number of leased units that we are \u2013 leased behavioral units that we are leasing from some big not-for-profit acute care hospital systems around the country. We have a number of other similar conversations underway to accomplish the same thing.", "And while the lifting of the IMD exclusion might help accelerate and expedite those conversations because now we can treat adult Medicaid patients as well, most of those conversations are even broader than that and include Medicare patients, they include commercial patients. And frankly, we view that overall as one of the most significant business development opportunities for our behavioral hospitals over the course of the next few years.", "So it's an important development, but I think one that fits into really kind of an overall strategy that we're extremely enthusiastic about.", "Joanna Gajuk", "Right now, we agree that those changes will take time till it'll be very positive. But then I guess on the flip side, the commentary around the continued shortage of clinicians on the behavioral side, I guess, with those changes and potential I guess for additional volumes coming your way, would I guess the shortage make things I guess more difficult when this is really happening where you have the IMD exclusion. But then this would actually create more pressure on labor. Is that the way you think about it? Or do you kind of think that there are some [indiscernible] in terms of the shortage to kind of moderate or rather be able to offset that?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I'm going to answer the question quickly, because I want to give others on the call a chance to ask their questions as well. But I think the issue to keep in mind is that this adult Medicaid population that's affected by the IMD for the most part is currently being treated. They're being treated in acute care hospitals with behavioral units, and there is staff, there are nurses, there are psychiatrists in place today treating those patients.", "So we can reach agreement with acute care hospitals in our markets to get access to those patients, whether we lease the beds or manage the units, or joint venture the units, or they close their units. The presumption, I think on our part and what has played out at least in our initial conversations, is we will have access not only to the patients, but also to the clinicians who are treating those patients. So it's not as if we will have an incremental need to hire staff to treat those patients.", "So, can we move on to the next...", "Joanna Gajuk", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Steve Filton", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Paula Torch", "Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to start my first question on the strong acute care metrics. I wonder, Steve, can you talk about the pace of volumes throughout the quarter and maybe if we saw a pickup through to March and has that momentum continued into 2Q?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I think, Paula, our experience, what seems to me was the shared sort of industry experience based on commentary I've heard from others and some of the surveys that I saw during the quarter, the quarter got off to a relatively slow start I think probably as a result of a very late flu season. Volumes picked up in maybe later January and then February. And then at least for us, March was a very strong month. Again, we do get the benefit of the leap year day and some of the calendar timing with Easter and Good Friday, et cetera.", "But also, I think it's early in the second quarter but most of the trends seem to be holding up reasonably well. Again, I'm not about to predict that we can sustain that sort of really remarkable acute care growth we saw in Q1, but we feel just good generally about how things are going in our markets and how strong the underlying business is.", "Paula Torch", "Okay. Great. Thank you. And then on behavioral, certainly a nice uptick year-over-year in the net revenue per patient or adjusted admission, but maybe not as much as we were expecting given the easier compare. So can you maybe give us some color on what drove that? It seems like the results met your expectations, but just wondering what gives you the confidence to be able to reach sort of your 5% same-store revenue growth in 2016, which would certainly imply a ramp up from here. Thank you.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So you're absolutely right, Paula. It implies a ramp, and for those who remember, I think we specifically talked about that in our year-end call, saying that we believe that the 5% behavioral growth was achievable, but would likely be somewhat lower in the first half of the year when comparisons were more difficult than while we were implementing and trying to gain tractions on some of our recruitment strategies and strategies to fill those nurse and psychiatrist vacancies. And then the second half of the year would become easier to achieve the 5% and probably exceed it, as the comparisons became easier and those initiatives got traction.", "So, again, from our own perspective, the Q1 behavioral performance was almost precisely in line. And obviously that provides us with a challenge to improve as the year goes on, but that's the way \u2013 that was our expectation of the way the year would play out.", "Paula Torch", "Okay. Thanks. Can I squeeze one more in? If not, I'll move on.", "Steve Filton", "Quickly, quickly.", "Paula Torch", "Okay. Sure. So, just your occupancy in behavioral, I think it was about 76%. So this still shows some room there with the beds you currently have and you're adding another 500 beds throughout the rest of the year. So, wondering how we should think about filling those beds? Is there a potential to fill them with Medicaid Advantage (sic) [Medicare Advantage] lives or is the mix really going to be more towards doing some of these JV partnerships with not-for-profits? I'm just wondering how you can leverage your current bed occupancy versus having to add new beds for this new volume that's going to be coming into the system.", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. So, I mean, if you go back and look, you will see that our occupancy percentage in the behavioral business in that sort of high-70%, 76%, 77% range, has really been very consistent, I would say, for the last seven years or eight years. And what that means is that during that period, we've been adding beds fairly aggressively. And, obviously, the implication is we are filling those beds as quickly as we're adding them and maintaining our occupancy percentage.", "The reason we're adding beds with a 76% occupancy level is because in markets and in situations, we're clearly turning away patients because of volume constraints. And the economics of it are such that after you turn away more than just a handful of patients, it almost always makes sense to add beds. And so we continue to do that.", "Now, I will say that in my remarks where I talked about, for instance, the de novo development projects, those projects were undertaken really without regard to the IMD exclusion. Obviously, these have been under development for some time. And so those projects are all in our minds justified by the demand in those markets regardless of whether or not there is sort of incremental demand associated with the IMD.", "So, as I said, I mean, in some ways, I think those are sort of discrete kind of activities. I think we think that the overall demand for behavioral has been strong, continues to be strong. We're going to add beds to meet that. And at the same time, we're going to continue these conversations with acute care hospitals in our market to get access to their behavioral patients and all their behavioral patients, not just their adult Medicaid patients, but their commercial and their Medicare and any other patients as well.", "Paula Torch", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, is it your sense that market growth within your geographic regions are just experiencing sort of similar levels of growth or can you share any sort of market dynamics you can point to on why you may be growing disproportionately faster than others, whether it be struggles of other maybe not-for-profits, maybe hospital closures? Anything along those lines that you can kind of point to above and beyond obviously your own initiatives?", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Ralph. Look, I think, it's a combination of both. I mean, we've talked about this certainly before that. Obviously, we are in some markets that were hit fairly hard during the recession three years or four years ago. Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida had disproportionately higher unemployment rates in those markets than the national average, et cetera. And so, as those markets have recovered, I think we have benefited economically disproportionately perhaps than some of our peers.", "But I think, at the same time, and I think the strong start to 2016 really belies this idea that as the ACA benefit has really sort of largely anniversaried itself, as the economic improvement has largely anniversaried itself, I think what you're seeing in the beginning of 2016 is the strengthening of our franchises in those now very healthy markets, et cetera.", "We've been working a lot over the last few years to shore up our physician relationships and our physician integration arrangements, acquiring practices and integrating in other ways, focusing on certain service lines. And I think that's all really starting to pay dividends. And, again, I'll highlight what I did earlier in an earlier response, which is when that growth is in Medicare, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we're probably gaining market share, since that's not a patient population that is inherently growing or seeing more demand, et cetera.", "So we have not historically sort of really tried to parse out market-by-market market share data. But I think we generally feel that in most of these markets that are performing well, not only are the markets doing well, but that we're gaining market share in those markets as well.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. All right. That's fair. And then, I mean I guess that brings up sort of the \u2013 what you see on sort of the acquisition opportunity side? I mean, to the extent that you are seeing struggles, yet you haven't done an acute care acquisition in a while. I mean do you think those opportunities are going to present? Or do you think that maybe people aren't growing as much as you may or others maybe not be growing as much as you are now, but they're still showing healthy growth and so you think there's still a reluctance to have sort of willing sellers out there?", "Steve Filton", "Look, I think we've said and you have heard me say for the last several quarters that the pace of activity, particularly on the acute care M&A side, has picked up. Now that means conversations and processes, et cetera. And our experience is, on the acute side that takes some time. These are largely not-for-profits that are being sold and their decision-making process tends to be somewhat elongated.", "But we've said for some time we're confident that there will be opportunities. There'll be compelling opportunities. And as I sit here today, I'll say with even greater confidence that I think we will definitely have opportunities in 2016 to deploy capital in the acute care space that we will find compelling, and I believe others will as well.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. That's helpful. Last quick one, just to clarify. Did you mention \u2013 did you say that you thought the leap day impact was a 3% benefit to volume or was there other factors that maybe drove 3% growth?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. So, I mean, basically all I'm saying is, if you have 90 days in the quarter and there's an extra day, it's a little over 3% just natural admission growth that you're likely to see. But it's also a little bit hard to then sort of parse that into a revenue piece because obviously not all of our revenue reimbursement is on a per-day basis. So the comment that I was making before was mostly about admission growth and the metrics, the cosmetics of those metrics.", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. And maybe we could follow up offline. I just \u2013 I mean I think we typically take a bit as just 1 day over 90 days sort of just 1%, maybe 2%. So it just seemed a little bit high. But we can maybe follow up offline. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo", "Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Steve, can you talk a little bit about surgery and any particular strength in any service lines in the quarter, including ER? And then maybe just touch on behavioral and health, your acute psych versus RTC volumes that are trending?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. So, on the acute side, generally I would say that besides that sort of payer mix commentary that I've offered before, we've seen extreme strength in our surgical volumes. I think that in-patient surgeries were up something like 4% in the quarter.", "Out-patient surgeries were up like 7%, which was again some of the strongest surgical growth we've seen. Our Medicare case mix index was among the highest we've ever seen. I think that's reflective obviously of the surgical volume and continued a trend that we saw in Q4.", "So, obviously, I think beyond the volume strength which we've already commented on, we're seeing a lot of sort of high quality revenue and high acuity revenue strength as well.", "On the behavioral side, I will say, I mean the one sort of issue between the acute and the residential business is the residential business is not subject I think nearly as much to this whole psychiatrist shortage issue. So the residential admissions have probably held in a little bit stronger than the acute admissions.", "And frankly, I think, at least from a cosmetic perspective that tends to hurt us, because at least of the public companies we tend to have a behavioral revenue sort of profile that is weighted more to the acute rather than to the residential business.", "Whit Mayo", "And sort of ER trends in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I think ER trends, I'm sorry, Whit, are pretty consistent with the overall volume trends. In the markets where we're seeing significant admission growth, we're seeing generally some fairly high ER growth.", "I will say that in a couple of markets where we are seeing more of a proliferation of urgent care and FED-type development, freestanding ED development, we've seen our ED visits go down a little bit, but honestly our admissions in most of those markets are un-impacted as we continue to get those admissions through our hospitals.", "Whit Mayo", "And maybe just on medical admission, short stay, observational, any change in the trend line there?", "Steve Filton", "I think those trends have remained fairly constant.", "Whit Mayo", "Got it. And my last question is just back on the IMD. And my understanding is that the rule is effective this July allowing health plans to contract with providers. Is that your understanding as well? And from a practical standpoint, when do you think you could actually take admissions of this patient population?", "Steve Filton", "I think your interpretation is correct, Whit, in the sense that I believe what the rule provides for is that states have the option of lifting the IMD exclusion and effectively allowing freestanding facilities to begin to take these patients as early as July.", "Again, it's at the state's option and we're not sure exactly what each state will do. But we are anticipating that at least in some geographies we'll be able to begin to have access to those patients as early as July.", "Whit Mayo", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of A. J. Rice with UBS.", "Rice", "Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. First of all, I guess I'll ask on the cost trends on the acute side. So I know sometimes when you have strong volume, you get the leverage of your existing SWB base as well as supplies, et cetera, flowing through the margin side. And then sometimes the growth in volume is strong for an extended period and you start having to add staff or scramble even to get staff. Where are you at on that spectrum? I mean, how would you put that other quarter in context for that maybe a little bit?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I mean, in the back half of 2015, A. J., we talked about the idea that there was certainly some pressure on salary and wages within the acute division, not so much in terms of head count or numbers of employees, but in what we describe as premium pay, which would include things like the use of temporary nurses and over time for our own staff, et cetera.", "I think while we've made some improvement in that regard, we continue with the revenue growth that we saw in Q1 and with the admission growth and demand, we've continued to see pressure on those wage rates and on that premium pay. And as a consequence, I think that when we file the Q and you'll be able to drill down and you can see it in our consolidated results that most of the leverage we're getting on this strong revenue growth is on the supply and other operating expense line and less of it is on the salary wage line, because we're still seeing a fair amount of pricing pressure, if you will, on that line.", "Rice", "Okay. All right. And then you guys nicely upgraded the buyback authorization, doubled it. I know, if I remember right, and maybe my memory's not serving me well, but typically UHS waits till you're closer to running through your prior authorization to adding another one of the order of magnitude. Are you indicating anything there about maybe being more active on the buyback front? You've been pretty steady the last year. Give us some thoughts on that.", "Steve Filton", "Well, just to be clear, I mean, the board increased the authorization back in February and in large part did so because we were on the verge of exhausting our previous authorization. So I think what you described as our historical practice is exactly what we did back in February.", "Rice", "Okay. All right. I'm sorry about that. Maybe one last question on the IMD you haven't been asked yet. Do you have contracts in place with the managed care guys or is that something that will take some time to put in place, or how quick can you put those in place?", "Steve Filton", "I think, in some cases, we already have contracts in place. We have been taking adolescent Medicaid patients for many years. And so, in a number of geographies and a number of instances, we already have existing managed care contracts for the adolescent Medicaid population. And we can either extend those contracts to the adult population or just modify them, et cetera.", "It varies a little bit I think in every geography, but I actually do not believe that the contracting piece of this whole IMD exercise is really the more difficult piece. I think, again, it's those conversations and hopefully those collaborative agreements with the acute care hospitals that are really at the crux of this.", "Rice", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. My question was about just to go a little deeper into the sources and the drivers of this Medicare-based volume that you're seeing on the acute side, trying to understand if you can see from your payer mix or any anecdotal evidence that this is just new members that are aging into Medicare that perhaps were under-insured or uninsured during their pre-Medicare days. Or is it existing patients and you're marketing more aggressively to them as a hospital chain? And is there any difference between fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Advantage?", "Steve Filton", "So maybe a few different comments I'll make. I mean, we continue to see over time a shift out of traditional Medicare into Medicare Advantage, and that continues, and I expect will continue for some time. What I was trying to allude to before, and maybe I was too nuanced, is I think the idea that our Medicare population and admission is growing as quickly as it is almost by definition has to mean that we're taking market share. Because while I think the overall Medicare population could be expanding somewhat, it is certainly not expanding at the pace that our admissions are expanding.", "So I think almost by definition, the fact that our Medicare population is growing as much as it is suggesting that in many of our markets we are taking market share from our competitors. And I think it's because of all the real focus, et cetera, that our operators are bringing to service lines and to physician relationships, and I think all of that is paying dividends.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. So it's about market share. Then the two changes that \u2013 and these things take forever sometimes, we had the Two-Midnight rule lapse, and then recently I think CMS is backing off of that rule altogether. Simultaneously, there are these value-based withholding of 25,000 primary care physician pilots that they've put in place. So one's sort of a positive and a tailwind and it feels like one's a bit of a headwind, but maybe more long term I think. How is this going to play out through 2016 and then into 2017 in terms of the timing that you anticipate, either positive or negative on a net basis?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. Look, I think, Ana, as your questions suggest, I think it's difficult to predict for some of these things how they're going to affect macro trends. And I think to the degree that they affect macro trends, it will be over a longer period of time. So I think, from our perspective, it is not likely to have significant short-term or even intermediate-term impacts. Over the longer-term, we'll see.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. Not even on the Two Midnight rule? I mean, it's just get out altogether...", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. I mean I think that the effect of the Two Midnight rule probably lapped or anniversaried several quarters ago. So I don't think that's having a big impact. My response to Whit's question earlier about changes in sort of observation days or short stays, et cetera, was that we're really not seeing big changes in those dynamics. I think, again, that impact was probably several quarters ago.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. Then separate question on the bad debt, which continues to trend favorably and now you're back to what you had about a year ago I think in the second quarter. Would this adjacent category live up in the third quarter as you continue to see more data with your revenue cycle management practices and all? Any more color on the driver?", "Steve Filton", "Look, Ana, we've conceded on several occasions that the increase in uncompensated volumes back in the third quarter of 2015, which we experienced and quite frankly many of our peers seemed to experience as well, was something that we really couldn't explain with I think great confidence. People suggested at the time that maybe it was some level of dis-enrollment in commercial exchanges, as premiums were going up or as people had gotten the care that they were seeking.", "We can never sort of prove that in any kind of pervasive way. But I think what our experience in Q4 and Q1 would suggest to us is that it was a bit of an anomaly and a bit of a blip in that the uncompensated trends which had been more stable in the last couple of quarters, seem to be more reflective of the environment that we're really in.", "Ana Gupte", "Got it. Thanks, Steve, for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe some comments on your priorities for use of capital at this point. It seems like the average repurchase price for your shares is a little bit south of where the stock is now, which I guess is a good thing. And then how do you feel about the opportunities on behavioral in the UK at this point?", "Steve Filton", "Gary, I think we always say and we say it because I think we mean it that we are relatively agnostic about where we deploy our capital, meaning that we will likely deploy our capital wherever we think we can earn the best returns. And I think that we were an active share repurchase in the first quarter and continued to some degree into the second quarter because we thought our shares, particularly given the strength of our business, were an attractive investment. I think we'll continue to consider that as we move forward.", "But I think we've also said that we see a number of compelling M&A opportunities in both the behavioral and acute space, and we have the financial flexibility to pursue those and we will. I think we have a longstanding and well-earned reputation, however, as a judicious acquirer and a judicious evaluator of these opportunities and a judicious steward of capital. And I think we'll continue to uphold that reputation in the future.", "So we're going to look at all these opportunities. We never really prioritize because, in our minds, the priorities are as we see these specific opportunities and as we evaluate these specific opportunities.", "Gary Lieberman", "And what about in the U.S. on acute care side? I think you might have said at some point that you think you were seeing more not-for-profit or potential not-for-profit deals around there?", "Steve Filton", "I think we are. And I think I said before, we continue to be actively involved in a number of conversations in that regard. We just find that those processes and those conversations tend to be a bit elongated and they take some time. But we believe, as I said before, that with some high degree of confidence that we will deploy capital into the acute care business in 2016 at levels that we probably have not in a while.", "Gary Lieberman", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Wedbush Securities.", "Sarah James", "Thank you. Can you talk about the growth that you're seeing so far this year on your UK behavioral health business? And then, in the past, you've talked about occupancy rates in the 90% range. So maybe you could update us on any near-term plans to add beds in that market?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I think everything you said remains true. We are running occupancy rates in the UK both in \u2013 it's still a relatively new business for us, but in the Cygnet business that we bought at this point a-year-and-a-half ago and then the Alpha business that we bought maybe six months ago, we're seeing those very high occupancy rates.", "And as a result, we're really taking all the actions in the UK that we've been taking in the U.S. for many years and that is, we're adding beds to existing facilities where the demand justifies that. We are building some de novo facilities in UK where the demand justifies that. We've done some tuck-in acquisitions in the U.K. We did a larger acquisition with the Alpha deal six months ago, as I said.", "And we continue to look at all those kinds of future opportunities in the UK as well with all the same sort of caveats and dynamics that I described here in the U.S. So we'll deploy capital in the UK behavioral space if it makes compelling sense to us and we're looking aggressively to do that.", "Sarah James", "Got it. And could you size for us how many beds that you know that you're adding so far just with the growth within existing facilities and the de novo start-up plans for this year? What is the overall bed growth in the UK going to look like?", "Steve Filton", "I mean, I actually do not have the UK numbers in front of me. I mean, we have talked broadly about 600 to 800 new beds in our behavioral division overall, and those would include new UK beds.", "Sarah James", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.", "Gary Taylor", "Hey. Good morning. Sorry I jumped on a little late. So, if I ask something that's been asked, just tell me to read the transcript and I will. First of all, Steve, did you comment specifically on emergency room volumes? I know you'd talked a little earlier about geographically some of the volumes strengthened by payer, but on ER?", "Steve Filton", "We did.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay.", "Steve Filton", "So I will suggest to go back and read the transcript.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay. Let me do that. And then my last one on the \u2013 just going through the concept of the new IMD regulation, do you have a sense of where your presumably newly negotiated Medicaid adult per diem might shake out versus general acute care hospitals or maybe where your current child and adolescent Medicaid per diems kind of shake out versus hospitals?", "And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, do we think, given presumably a lower cost structure in freestanding, that from a rate perspective we might get to the point where Medicaid HMOs have a compelling financial incentive to attempt to steer volume in your direction as opposed to just picking up initially probably the ER diverted patients that they can't find a bed for?", "Steve Filton", "Yeah. Look, it's really I think a thoughtful question, Gary. And again, I think we're sort of approaching this in kind of a two-phase sort of process. I mean, the one, as I stressed, is we would like to reach collaborative agreements with many of the acute care hospitals in our markets that are providing in-patient behavioral services.", "We think, generally, and this is certainly not true of every single acute care hospital, but we think generally acute care hospitals are not very good providers. They're not efficient providers of behavioral services. They have so many other things that they're doing that it's just not a top priority of theirs, and we generally feel we can do it better, we can do with higher quality, we can do with better efficiency. And we're trying to make that argument to our acute care colleagues, if you will, in our markets around the country. And I think, in our minds, that's sort of the first step in getting access to these adult Medicaid patients.", "The second is more I think along the lines of what you are suggesting, which is as a freestanding industry, and certainly UHS I think has a reputation of being able to provide these services more efficiently and at both high quality and lower cost, then we're certainly prepared to make those arguments to our managed care payers. But, quite frankly, I think ours are aware of that dynamic as we are with the rest of their patient population. So, that to us I think is more of a secondary argument. We'd like to get the acute hospitals sort of to partner with us first and then we'll kind of make our pitch to the MCOs.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in queue at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. We'd like to thank everybody and look forward to talking with everybody next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Universal Health Services second quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you.", "And, Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2016.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" and similar words that represent forecasts, projections, and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to your questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.89 for the quarter. After adjusting each quarters' reported results for the incentive income and expenses recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $191.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to $186.6 million or $1.85 per diluted share during the second quarter of last year.", "On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2016 increased 7.4% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.9% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year and a 1.3% increase in revenue per adjusted admission. On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care division decreased to 17.7% during the second quarter of 2016 from 19.1% during the second quarter of 2015.", "On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.0% during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015. During this year's second quarter as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 0.3%, and adjusted patient days increased 0.2%. Revenue per adjusted admission and adjusted patient day rose 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively, during the second quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior-year quarter.", "On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our behavioral health division were 28.1% and 28.7% during the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our cash provided by operating activities increased approximately 50% to $801 million over the $532 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2015. Our accounts receivable days outstanding decreased slightly to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 54 days during the second quarter of 2015.", "At June 30, 2016, our ratio of debt to total capitalization increased to 45.5%, as compared to 42.6% at June 30, 2015. We spent $120 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2016 and $248 million during the first six months of 2016. Included in our capital expenditures were the construction costs related to the ongoing construction of a new 142-bed hospital in Henderson, Nevada, which is scheduled to open in the fourth quarter of this year. Also included were the construction costs related to a new four-story patient tower at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was recently completed and opened. In addition, early in the second quarter, we opened Skywood Recovery, a new 100-bed substance-abuse treatment center located in August (sic) [Augusta] (4:56), Michigan. Skywood is part of our expanding Foundations Recovery Network and provides integrated treatment for substance abuse and co-occurring mental health disorders.", "Last month we completed the refinancing of certain components of our debt, including 1) the issuance of an additional $400 million of our 4.75% senior secured notes due in 2022, which were issued at a yield of 4.35%; 2) the issuance of $400 million of 5.0% senior secured notes due in 2026, and 3) a $200 million increase in borrowings pursuant to the Term Loan A facility of our credit agreement.", "These financings generated aggregate debt proceeds of approximately $1 billion, of which $400 million was utilized to repay the 7.125% senior secured notes that matured in June 30, 2016. $445 million was spent in connection with our previously disclosed May 2016 purchase of third-party minority ownership interest in our six acute-care hospitals located in Las Vegas, Nevada. And the remainder was utilized to repay other floating-rate debt.", "In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2016, we purchased approximately 235,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $29 million or approximately $123 million (sic) [$123] (6:25) per share. Since inception of the program through June 30, 2016, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $406 million or approximately $117 per share.", "Alan and I are pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. So, Steve, I wanted to start off maybe in asking about the behavioral volumes. They were a little bit weaker than we were expecting, and wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color around the drivers of that weakness. I realize that compares were more difficult last year and that you're still working through some of the labor shortages, but how is that going forward, and what are you thinking about those volumes in the second half of the year?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Paula. So I think, as you suggest, we've really, I think, been talking about the pressures on our behavioral volumes for almost a year now. I think beginning in the third quarter of last year, we began to clearly see the shortage of clinicians, psychiatrists, and nurses, and to a lesser degree other mental health technicians, as hampering our ability in certain facilities \u2013 in a relatively small number of markets and a small number of facilities \u2013 hampering our ability in some cases to admit all the patients who were being presented to us for admission.", "I think those dynamics \u2013 and we said this when we gave our guidance for 2016, we thought that those dynamics would persist through the second quarter of this year. We also suggested that they would improve in the back half of this year, in large part because, number one, the comparisons would become much easier, as they will, and also because a number of the initiatives that we've been working on and putting in place to mitigate this problem would also begin to gain some traction. So I think that the softer volumes in Q2 were somewhat disappointing to us as well, but largely expected. And I think our sense continues to be that they will improve in the back half of this year.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Is it possible to parse out how much of the softer volumes were because of this dynamic with the labor versus just overall weakness in general?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure. So our general sense, Paula, is that our original guidance for the year contemplated about a 5% increase in behavioral same-store revenue. And that was really broken down into a 3% to 4% anticipated increase in volumes, in patient days, and a 1% to 2% increase in price. On the pricing side, I think we're absolutely where we expected to be. And so we're basically showing flattish volumes as compared to that 3% or 4% increase that we were anticipating. And I think we believe that that entire gap and that entire difference can be attributed to the shortage of clinicians and that if we're able to solve and resolve that problem, we should be able to get back to that sort of 5% overall revenue growth level and that 3% to 4% volume growth level that we anticipated originally.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up to that. I'm curious if you could share with us some of the initiatives that you have in place to mitigate this. Is it paying out higher wages, training programs, maybe more effective recruiting? I mean, anything that you can kind of tell us there that you've been doing that you feel will really drive this home in the second half?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure. Well, I think, frankly, Paula, it's all those things and more. Obviously, in a tight labor market, wage rates matter. And so, in markets in which we are experiencing shortages, we've conducted extensive compensation surveys and have modified our wage rates to make sure that we're competitive with the marketplace. And every marketplace is different. We have also hired more people and dedicated more people to both the physician and nursing recruiting processes.", "And, finally I think we're very focused on the retention aspect and not just the recruiting aspect, because \u2013 for two reasons. I mean, obviously, to the degree that we're able to retain our nurses, we don't have to, by definition, recruit for their replacements. And to the degree that we recruit replacements, we want to make sure that they stay with us as long as they possibly can. And so our chief nursing officer in the behavioral division has focused a lot of her attention on a new and sort of reinvigorated onboarding process in which we're making sure that nurses are properly trained and have a clear career path and have the appropriate sort of mentoring resources dedicated to them, et cetera.", "So, as I said, in every market the approach is somewhat different, and it's tailored to the market. But it is by far sort of the number one focus of the operators in the behavioral division at this point.", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners LLC", "Okay. Thank you, Steve, for the color there.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna Financial.", "Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi, this is Frank Lee on for Chris. Thanks for taking my question. The same-store revenue in the acute care business remained high in the quarter relative to the full-year outlook. Could you just provide a sense for how much of the volume growth was attributable to economic improvements in your markets versus increasing market share, or if there was any other unusual activity to call out there?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Frank. I mean, I think we have said, quite frankly, for the last few years that it's difficult to parse out acute care revenue improvement. Obviously a couple years ago, the real focus was on parsing out the ACA impact versus the economy, and I think clearly the ACA impact has shown diminishing returns for the last few years. We're still posting strong acute care volume numbers.", "Obviously, because we're the first report this quarter, I don't know how we'll compare with others, but my sense is these are still going to be fairly robust volumes, and I think what we've said all along is I think that we largely feel it's a function of the just strong local franchises that we have in markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, South Florida, and the economic improvement in those markets, but also our market position and our ability to take market share in those markets. I think it's very difficult to sort of parse the 4% improvement in same-store adjusted admissions among those various factors. Suffice it to say that we still think that's a pretty good number and well within our expectations.", "Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay, thanks. And then the same-store operating margin in the acute care business was down year over year by a decent amount. Is that primarily related to some of the staffing shortage issues that you had discussed in the acute care side? And then can you talk about the progress that you've made on the initiatives that you've put in place to rectify those shortages? Thanks a lot.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, so I think \u2013 and we talked about this certainly last quarter and I think for several quarters really, again, beginning in the second half of last year. Look, I think that as a result of the improving U.S. economy and the improving economy in our local markets, we have seen a tightening of the available labor force in all or most of our markets. That tightening, I think, is manifested somewhat differently in the two divisions that we have. We just talked about on the behavioral side, quite frankly, we're just not able in some markets to find sufficient nurses and physicians. And as a consequence, we're forced to turn patients away.", "On the acute side, I think, it's manifested more prevalently in higher use of what we describe as premium pay, which would be overtime or shift differential payments that we make to our current employees or the use of temporary or agency nurses, where current employees are not available. And certainly that use of premium pay on the acute side has contributed to the margin pressure in Q2, as it did back in Q3 of last year. But I think we continue to sort of focus on that, and it got better in Q4 and Q1 of this year, and I think our sense is that we'll continue to focus on it and it is a solvable problem on the acute side.", "The one other comment I'll make on the acute side vis-\u00e0-vis margins is, while I think the volumes on the acute side were well within our expectations, the revenue per admission growth of 1.3% is probably 50, 75 basis points short of where we thought we'd be. I think that's a bit of a weaker patient mix, and that's mostly maybe a growth in uncompensated patients in the quarter, not by a material amount. But I think mostly the big change from Q1 is, in Q1, our other non-uncompensated volumes were just so strong, particularly our Medicare volumes were so strong, that they offset a bit of the uncompensated tick up in volumes. In Q2, as Medicare and other commercial volumes moderated some, the uncompensated rise had a bit more of an effect. So I think the staffing pressure or the premium pay pressure, along with the slight payer mix deterioration, probably explain the bulk of the pressure on acute care margins.", "Frank Lee - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Matthew Borsch with Goldman Sachs.", "Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. This is Tejus on for Matt. Thanks taking the question. Just to follow on acute care volumes. We were expecting them to moderate in 2Q, but was this in line with your expectations? Any additional weakness to call out? And then also anything you can talk about in terms of regional differences between, call it, Nevada and then more the Texas, Florida, California markets would be helpful.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Tejus. So our original guidance for the year was something like 6% acute care same-store revenue growth, and we broke that into components \u2013 pretty evenly broke that into pricing and volume. So the 4% same-store adjusted admission volume growth we saw in Q2 was, as I said, well within and frankly ahead of our expectations, while the pricing was slightly lower. But overall acute care revenues were pretty close to what we expected.", "In terms of regional differences, I think, most of \u2013 we clearly saw an overall moderation in acute care revenues in Q2 from the really extraordinary levels of Q1. We absolutely have said all along that's what we expected would happen. And obviously the Q2 performance is much closer to our original guidance. I think the regional commentary that we've given for probably a year now still holds in Q2 of this year, which is that markets like Vegas and California and Florida have been sort of overperformers, and the Texas markets, namely the South Texas markets and Amarillo, probably have been the weaker performers.", "Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks very much. And can you touch on the other operating expenses; that looked like it increased this quarter.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think those other operating expenses are distorted a little bit by the impact of our insurance company. We had about a $25 million to $30 million increase in both premium, revenue and in claims expense in the insurance company in this quarter. We record that in our acute care division, and we record the expenses specifically in other operating expenses. So I think if you adjust that $25 million to $30 million out of both revenue and other operating expenses, those numbers, at least for us, will certainly look like much more in line with expectations.", "Tejus Ujjani - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with BoA.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question. So I just want to come back to the discussion about acute care volumes, which \u2013 to your point, it wasn't really surprising to see deceleration but actually deceleration from these very elevated numbers in Q1 was (19:51) deceleration might have been surprising to some. So can you just parse it out a little bit more in terms of the different sort of parts of your business? And specifically maybe talk about the surgery performance in Q2? Because I guess we're hearing from some of the medical device companies that the volumes decelerated in terms of surgeries, but the deceleration was not as dramatic. So just can you touch base or could we just talk a little bit about the surgeries, inpatient versus outpatient performance in the quarter?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Joanna. So our inpatient surgeries increased by about 2% in Q2 versus a 4% increase in Q1. And, again, I think we thought that 4% increase for inpatient surgeries was above what we thought we could sustain. The outpatient surgeries rose by about 7% in Q2, and that was pretty similar to the Q1 performance. So again, from my perspective, our surgical volumes in Q2 were very much in line with our expectations.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "Great. And just touching based on the Vegas minority interest purchase and the impact specifically for the company. So Community kind of talked about maybe the annual impact of $60 million. So is it fair to kind of assume there's maybe $36 million impact for your interest on the minority interest since it's after taxes, is it roughly in the ballpark number annually?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So let me just remind to everyone that, first of all, the transaction was not completed until the beginning of May. So we only have two months of the transaction's impact in the quarter, and we've estimated that the positive impact for us would be somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02 a month. And so we've got $0.03 to $0.04 in Q2 and $0.12 to $0.16 or so for the year, or for the eight months, that should be our favorable impact for the year.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "So that's net of the higher interest expense? Because I guess there was also (22:04) debt, but you raised additional debt to fund the purchase of $400 million-plus \u2013 purchase. So is the $0.01 to $0.02 per month, is that net of that higher interest expense, or it's just -?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yes.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "Okay.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yes. So it's the increase in earnings as a result of having the full impact of the Vegas earnings, less the interest expense on the $445 million to fund that buyout, and obviously also less the tax impact of the additional earnings.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "Great. That's helpful. And on the last topic in terms of your UK business and the Brexit and your outlook there going forward for that part of the segment in terms of any currency things or impact on the actual business in terms of maybe any pressure on staffing there, or the government funding, so any color you might have on the UK business, that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, yeah, I mean, first of all, let me just kind of set the sort of relative importance of the UK to our consolidated results. As opposed to some of our peers, it's a relatively small footprint in the UK. About 2% to 3% of our consolidated revenues this year will come from the UK. We have said from the outset that our original investment in the UK, which is equal to roughly about $500 million or so, has been hedged, so from a currency risk perspective we are protected on currency fluctuations. Finally, I think, while obviously Brexit made a lot of headlines, I think in terms of its impact on the fundamentals of the behavioral business in the UK, it's had virtually none in the short run. In the longer term, we'll see. I think obviously, as you know, many, many details of the Brexit process have to be worked out involving labor \u2013 folks in the labor force, et cetera, so we'll see how that all plays out. But again, at the moment, no impact, and I think just keep in mind that it is a relatively immaterial part of our business.", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "We've done very well with regard to our acquisition. We paid reasonable prices for the acquisition both in Cygnet and Alpha, and we're very pleased with them. But it relates to how much you pay and how good is the management, and we've been pleased with what we have.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "Great. And just very quickly on that point. It sounds like there could be some assets for sale in the UK, so would you be still interested to grow that business given the maybe special uncertainty around Brexit and whatnot that might happen?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think it's premature to speculate, obviously. We don't know what assets might be for sale. I think it's always sort of a given that when assets are for sale, whether in the UK or in the U.S., and they're of a high quality, we're certainly interested in taking a look. But we don't even know what the specifics may be in the UK, so it's probably too early to comment.", "Joanna S. Gajuk - Bank of America", "Great. Thank you. That's all for me for now. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned a weaker payer mix on the acute care side. Are there any numbers that you could share with us, Steve?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, uncompensated volumes were up probably kind of 2%, 2.5% in the quarter. Honestly, I think they were up by a similar amount in Q1. As I think I said earlier, I think the difference was in Q1 other volumes were just so strong that they tended to really offset any impact of that increase.", "I think the other sort of commentary I'd make about uncompensated care in general is we take our total uncompensated care \u2013 all of which we disclosed in the press release, the bad debt, the charity care, the uninsured discount \u2013 and we take that total number and compare it to our gross revenue, which I know is generally not a metric most people use very much. But I think from our perspective it takes into account the gross pricing impact that runs through those numbers. And while our second quarter uncompensated care experience was measurably higher than last year's second quarter, it's still lower than it was in the back half of last year. And so I think our general notion is that we're seeing kind of a slight uptick in uncompensated care, but it's reasonably steady over the last three or four quarters.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Any reason to think that the trend in the second half of the year will be different? Do you feel like you're seeing pressure earlier this year and that it's going to continue, or that this is just sort of an anomaly?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. Look, as Yogi Berra always said, it's hard to predict the future. But, look, I think our general sense is that we may see a continued uptick incrementally in uncompensated care. It doesn't have the feel to us of a big measurable change. But payer mix is probably the element of our business that's most difficult to project. So I don't want to make too many really definitive statements in that regard.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the IMD exclusion. Are you seeing anything yet? I realize it's still pretty early. And then maybe just comment on that in light of the comments or the issues with hiring psychiatrists. Do you think that that is going to prevent you from seeing any benefit with regards to that?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I mean, I think we've consistently said, Gary, that we view the IMD benefit as a meaningful one but also one that will be impactful and have an impact on us over time and also will be part of kind of our broader efforts to penetrate the acute care hospital segment of the behavioral industry \u2013 that is, acute care hospitals who have their own behavioral units.", "I think your first comment is absolutely right. I mean, we're sort of two or three weeks into the effective date of the new IMD managed Medicaid rule, and I think any commentary or any reaction we'd have at this point would be purely anecdotal. I think honestly we've always had the view that probably the biggest impact doesn't start to occur even until the beginning of next year, when managed care plans have all their new plans in place and start to direct and redirect business in different ways.", "But I think, finally, I think the other comment that we've made on previous calls and I think we're still very much believers in, is that I think we believe that the IMD or we view the lifting of the IMD exclusion in the broader context of our very pervasive and very aggressive program to try and collaborate with acute care hospitals around the country and to help gain access to their behavioral units. And obviously the lifting of the IMD exclusion removes one of the hurdles that I think has always prevented that from happening in a pervasive way. But, again, I think that whole process is one that will continue to take place and continue to have an impact for many years to come.", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, thanks. Just have a couple quick ones. Steve, I don't know if you gave any comments around just surgery trends, ED trends, and outpatient visits in the quarter.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So I did comment on the surgery trends, Whit; you can just go back and look at that. On the ED side, I think our ED visits were up 1% or 2%, which is a kind of moderation from where we were in the first quarter but pretty consistent with our overall sort of admission number moderation, and outpatient visits were up in the 5% to 7% range. Again, that's fairly consistent with our first quarter results.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And any update on Henderson and just the timing of the opening? I heard you say the fourth quarter, but should we expect any start-up, or pre-opening expenses this year, or \u2013 ?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Whit, Whit -", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Speak up.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Can I ask you to repeat that? I didn't hear you.", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Please speak up.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Sorry about that, Alan. Just wanted an update on Henderson, the timing of the opening. I heard you say that it'll be in the fourth quarter but didn't know if we should anticipate any pre-opening expenses this year or if that will be more 2017.", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "The opening ceremony is October 6, and we'll be taking patients shortly thereafter. We are very excited about it. We've been very good in that area. One of the good areas \u2013 Temecula, which we opened a couple of years ago, has just been \u2013 exceeded all of our expectations. Henderson completes our coverage of the market. We're very excited about that. And we opened a Spring Valley tower, and that's now in operation, so we're really looking forward to success in Las Vegas in addition to what we have currently.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "And, Whit, just to answer your specific pre-opening questions, so as part of our 2016 guidance we said that there'd be a $10 million EBITDA drag from Henderson in the back half of the year, both in Q3 pre-opening costs and then in Q4 opening losses. That number frankly just mechanically will be a little bit larger because it didn't originally contemplate the fact that we buy out the Community interest, so it's probably $2 million or $3 million higher than that, but that hasn't changed, and that was in our original guidance.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And just last one. I know you don't provide quarterly guidance, but the Street has had a historical tendency to get ahead of your internal budgets in the second half and prior year, so just any comments or observations would be helpful. Thanks, Steve.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Look, I'll just talk about the trajectory of the year from our perspective. We talked in the first quarter about the fact that we were ahead of our own internal budget, but I think that we also conceded that the results in Q1 were further ahead of consensus than they were of our own internal budget. I think in Q2 we were pretty close to the Street consensus. So I think our view is if we continue to meet our own internal modeling and expectations in the back half of the year, with the benefit of the Community buyout impact, which was not contemplated in our original guidance, we should still be very comfortably in our guidance range, probably close to the upper half of that guidance.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just taking a step back on the psych business, the trends have looked relatively similar to acute the last several quarters, and I think the historical perspective is the psych business has been a better growth business and more opportunity. And I'm curious if you feel like we've seen sort of more of a maturation of that business. And I guess as you guys think about your valuations when you're looking at assets, what do you think in terms of valuations for psych assets versus acute care assets, and do you still think the growth dynamics in psych are noticeably different than acute care going forward?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I'd answer the question, Josh, in a couple of different ways. I mean, one is, in terms of the growth prospects of this business \u2013 the behavioral business, that is \u2013 we remain fairly bullish, and that is because, as I indicated in earlier remarks, we believe that there's demonstrated demand for this business. And quite frankly I think there are a number of dynamics that would suggest that that demand does nothing but increase. We could have a whole long conversation about that, but things like the incidence of addiction illness and the need for addiction treatment and the opioid epidemic in the U.S. and the continued incidence of mental health issues in the elderly population, there's just a whole host of reasons to believe that, I think, the demand for mental health services is going to increase.", "And in fact we believe we demonstrate that in our hospitals. We've been unable to demonstrate it in our financial results because of this clinician shortage. I think we have the view that in the short run we will make inroads and significant inroads in that clinician shortage in the short run. And in the long run, the market itself will correct for this, as it has when the acute business suffered through a nursing shortage some 10 years ago. And just nurse salaries went up and more people enrolled in nursing schools, and the supply and demand balance sort of was restored. And I think the same thing will happen here, both with psychiatrists and with nurses on the behavioral side.", "In terms of commenting on valuations of the two businesses, I think it's difficult for us to do. We clearly look at individual acquisition opportunities on a standalone, discrete basis and the growth potential in an individual behavioral facility or individual behavioral company versus an acute is really dependent on the markets they're in, what their specific market position is, what the strategies are for growth, et cetera. So we certainly don't go into any acquisition, either acute or behavioral, with a notion of kind of there's a fixed sort of a valuation that make sense. I do think UHS has a reputation for being fairly judicious in its acquisitions and its deployment of capital. I don't see that judiciousness changing, but I think it's a market-by-market issue.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then so, Steve, one of the health plans yesterday made comments around some higher-than-expected costs in substance abuse. They were talking about I think mostly exchange patients and individual patients. I think there was a lot more focus on the West Coast with some of that. Are you guys seeing anything in terms of substance abuse upticks or anything in the exchange membership where you guys think you're seeing a little bit better volumes?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I mean, as I said, Josh, I think that there's all sorts of data out there that suggests that both the incidence of addiction illness and obviously the corresponding demand for addiction treatment is growing. I think when that happens \u2013 when there's a growing demand for a particular service, the payers start to focus on it more. I think one way that we're seeing that manifested is I think the payers are more focused on this whole out-of-network segment of the addiction treatment business. I think a bunch of companies have grown up around that model.", "We were very targeted, or we made a very targeted decision, when we bought Foundations, that they were a company that had both out-of-network and in-network business, split pretty evenly, and that they in our minds and I think we've seen them in the short time we've owned them navigate very freely between sort of the two segments. So if this business shifts to more of an in-network model, we think we'll be prepared to make that transition more easily than a number of these other companies that have focused almost exclusively on that out-of-network model.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That makes sense. Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Kind of going back to a topic. Obviously, there was a big difference in your bad debt expense in 1Q and 2Q. I know you called out the higher uninsured. Your internal model for the back half of the year, how should we think about the bad debt number relative to what you experienced in 1Q and 2Q?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So what I was saying before, John, is that I think our uncompensated volumes have been growing in the first half of the year by \u2013 in that kind of 2%, 2.5% range, and I think that's consistent with what our model for the year is, and that's I think we would, if pressed, suggest is what we would expect in the back of the year.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So does that mean a high 8%'s or a low 7%'s (39:52) bad debt? That's what I was trying to figure out. I was looking at the percentage number, and it was obviously a lot higher in the second quarter than the first quarter.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, so two things. I mean, one is, as I suggested in some comments earlier, we really don't look at bad debt on its own. I think you have to look at it in combination with charity care and uninsured discount.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "And again, I mean, I think the way that I sort of think about it, John, is I'm back to we talked about acute care revenue growth, net revenue growth, which is after bad debt and after charity care and uninsured discount, of about 3% for the year. And I think that's what I would guide people to think about for the back half of the year.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "And that would take into account the growth in uncompensated volumes.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Great. And then just to go back to the \u2013 I mean, congrats on the Community deal, obviously accretive. How do you think about the \u2013 I was a little curious about the cash flow impact of that deal. Was Community just getting a chunk of the earnings and you had all the CapEx, or is there a cash flow obligation that you pick up moving to 100% ownership? I just wasn't exactly sure how the cash flows worked in that deal.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So it was mostly, John, a cash flow deal. That is, Community's 27 roughly percent interest was in the cash flow of the joint venture, both the earnings and the capital expenditures. So you are correct that, as we move forward, we'll have a larger share of the CapEx there. Now, obviously we've just finished up a significant \u2013 and Alan commented on a couple of very large projects that are just finishing up.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So I think we're going to return to, at least in the short run, a bit more of a normalized CapEx spend in that market. But, yes, we'll now have 100% of it.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "So when we think about your purchase multiple, it's really an EBITDA kind of purchase multiple, not a pre-tax earnings purchase multiple or something like that?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think that's right.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Hi, everybody. First of all, maybe just quickly on the \u2013 your cash flow number was good, your debt-to-EBITDA is down at 2.2 times, which I think is sort of below the low end of your target. Any thoughts on capital deployment from here? I know you got asked about the Acadia potential divestures, but more broadly, acquisition pipeline versus opportunities for share repurchase, given where you're at and the capital base?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, A.J. I mean, look, you've heard me say this before, and I'll repeat it just because it's true, and that is acquisition spending is probably the most difficult aspect of our business to predict. So as we sort of try and measure what sort of opportunities we have, that's sometimes difficult to do, but we've been an aggressive acquirer of our shares over the last, I would say, six or nine months. We have tried to be an opportunistic acquirer, and I think we'll continue to do that in the future and take advantages when we think the stock is at a particularly valuable level. So, as you suggest, we certainly have the financial flexibility to do all that, to respond to opportunities as they arise but also to continue to be an aggressive acquirer of our own shares.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And I thought I'd just ask maybe on the payer side, both from the managed care and the government side. On the managed care side, any update on how contracting's going for 2017 at this point? I know it's early, but typically you have a fair number of contracts reworked. Any change in approach you're seeing from pricing or terms that they're asking for? And then I would probably also ask you, on the Medicare side, there seems to be this push toward bundled payments. Have you had any experience so far? I know they rolled out the joint replacement bundle payment in April. So it's still fairly early, but just any early experience on that?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So I think we feel, A.J., that we're prepared for what I think we view as sort of the inexorable move to more risk shifting, which would include more bundled payment \u2013 methodology payments. We were volunteers in some of the early Medicare demonstration programs. We can remain in some of those. We've exited some. I think it's a developing and a continually evolving area. But I think we have worked now for probably the last two or three years to make sure that we're prepared for it. And so I think we remain prepared. Obviously, Medicare announced just within the last couple of days an expansion of their bundled payment program, but a number of the details, I think, are still somewhat fuzzy. So it's difficult to, again, make any precise predictions.", "As far as managed care contracting, I think we're probably still 45, 60 days away from the real sort of height of the 2017 renegotiation process. But I would suggest that we're not seeing huge changes, either in our rates or in the structure of those contracts from what we've been experiencing over the last few years.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah, thanks. Hi, Steve. Good morning. The question I had \u2013 and I wonder if anybody explored this; I'm just a little late to the call \u2013 is on connecting the dots between your deterioration in bad debt from 1Q to 2Q, and again the same thing on your acute volumes. Does that give you pause around what the driver of the volumes is? Are you still thinking this is economic rebound rather than exchanges? Which seems like the more obvious thing given the tick up in membership in the first quarter, and it's consistent with what the managed care companies are complaining about and where the claims costs are being incurred.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, Ana, I think we have touched on it. I'll just reiterate a little bit of what I've said before. I mean I think we're running about 2% to 2.5% increase in uninsured volumes. I think that's consistent with what our original guidance and original model was. So, no, I mean, I think \u2013 and we talked at great length in Q1, when we really had extraordinary acute care volumes \u2013 that those were largely driven by Medicare volumes. And I think that was reflected in our very strong pricing. The moderation in our Medicare volumes in Q2 has caused the pricing to again step back some. But I think we're largely in line in Q2 with what we expected to be our overall same-store acute care pricing. So from my perspective, I'm not sure that there are any sort of sinister dots to connect, but we'll certainly see how this continues to play out.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. But did you see anything specific in terms of geographies? You had pretty solid year-over-year growth. Now I'm just trying to compare to the baseline in 2015 and 1Q relative to 2Q. So was it just about comps, or was it something else? I guess that it's tough to look at the actual (47:42) numbers, but -", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Well, again, I mean, I'll just remind people that in first quarter our acute care same-store revenue grew by 12%. That's about as an extraordinary number as you're going to find, and I think anybody who had the expectation that we could sustain a number like that was simply kidding themselves, and we certainly didn't encourage people to think that way. So when we moderate to something closer to 7% in Q2, again, I think that's going to wind up being a number that's going to be pretty competitive amongst our peers \u2013 we'll see \u2013 but doesn't reflect any significant or unexpected changes in payer mix.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "And then on the outpatient side, just a final question on this. The theme again has always been from the insurers that this mix shifting is to outpatient. It feels like there's a accelerated mix shift to outpatient surgery, or even ambulatory surgery as ortho procedures and cardio and all are just seeing more convenience and ease in an ambulatory setting. Are you seeing something that points to something structural in this arena and going forward that might actually really put pressure on the inpatient side? And then connecting it to the value-based care question earlier that the incentives will be far more to try to mitigate costs with a risk-sharing reimbursement mechanism over time in acute.", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Jesus.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "We certainly have seen the continued shift to outpatient that, as you suggest, I think, virtually every provider in America has recognized. Again, I'm just going to go back and say that even with that continued shift, which has been underway for years now, the 4% same-store adjusted admission growth in Q2 is certainly well within our expectations and I think is a reflection of even with that shift to outpatient that we're still seeing growth on the inpatient side for all the reasons that I described before: strong franchises, taking market share from competitors, recovering economies, et cetera. So, yeah, I mean, we see that same dynamic that everybody else sees, but we're still posting pretty good inpatient numbers at the same time.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Got it. Thanks for the perspective. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, just want to go back to uncompensated care and bad debt. I mean, is it all uninsured, or are you seeing any sort of bad debt creep in the uncollectible from out-of-pocket that might be having an impact versus just the uninsured and any changes to your collection percentages that you've seen?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Ralph, and again, this is a trend, I think, that has now been underway for a while now. There's no question that over the last few years, the amount of the hospital bill that is due from the patient because of copays and deductibles has grown, and as a consequence the amount we collect on that portion of the bill has declined. So 10 years ago, we collected 55% to 60% of the patient portion of the bill, and today that number's probably dropped to 45%. That's been a gradual change; we've accounted for it. It has contributed to some degree to the rise in uncompensated care, but I think we've also always said that two-thirds of our overall uncompensated care numbers are the result of those who purely have no insurance, and I think that remains largely the case.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then I joined the call a little late; I'm not sure if you had mentioned this. Did you give exchange volume in the quarter or growth you think that the exchanges had? I know it's a small number, but just if you had that.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. We didn't, and I don't think we ever have, in large part, because in contrast with some of our peers I think we have always viewed it as a relatively difficult thing to do with precision, to identify patients who have exchange coverage versus those who might have just regular commercial coverage.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. All right, fair enough. And then just last one, your other revenue within acute seems to be sort of ramping. I know it's a small piece, but I think that's the health plan business. So can you maybe just talk about the growth there in terms of capturing lives, I guess, and maybe refresh us on the strategy there? Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So we acquired a health plan, a provider-based health plan in the Reno market, just about two years ago at this point. I did comment before that we had about a $25 million to $30 million increase in the quarter in both premium revenues and other operating expenses. The rationale for acquiring that business, which we have talked about on previous calls, more so at the time that we made the acquisition, is really to prepare for this risk shifting that several of the last questions have focused on. But as more of the risk shifts to the provider, we will have to shift our focus to more of sort of an underwriting exercise, and we think that having that insurance infrastructure and that insurance expertise is helpful when you're doing that sort of analysis, and that continues to be our belief.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no other questions in queue at this time.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Okay.

Rice - UBS", "Josh Raskin - Barclays Capital", "Paula Torch - Avondale Partners", "Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Ana Gupte - Leerink Partners", "Gary Lieberman - Wells Fargo Securities", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to today's fourth quarter earnings call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Filton. Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. We welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ending December 31, 2016. During the call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecasts, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.", "We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the Company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $7.14 for the year and $1.78 for the quarter. After adjusting each period for the incentive income and expenses associated with the implementation of electronic health report applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $176 million or $1.80 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $170.7 million or $1.71 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2015.", "On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues decreased 9.3% during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted admissions increased 4.7% while revenue per adjusted admission increased 2.6%.", "On a same-facility basis, operating margins for our acute care hospitals decreased to 16.5% during the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to 17.2% during the fourth quarter of 2015. On a same-facility basis revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.2% during the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Adjusted admissions and adjusted patient days to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.1% and 1.4%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 0.5% during the fourth quarter of 2016 over the comparable prior-year quarter. Operating margins for our behavioral health hospitals owned for more than a year were 26.0% and 26.8% during the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.", "Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.288 billion during 2016 as compared to $1.021 billion during 2015. Contributing to the increase is a $200 million favorable change in working capital accounts experienced during 2016 as compared to 2015 resulting from the timing of disbursements. Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained unchanged at 52 days during each of the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015. At December 31, 2016 our ratio of debt to total capitalization was approximately 48%.", "We spent $124 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $520 million during the full year of 2016. In 2016 we completed and opened 221 new acute care beds including 130 beds at our newest acute care facility, Henderson Hospital in Henderson, Nevada and 437 new behavioral health beds, including two de novo facilities. During 2016 we expect to spend approximately $475 million to $500 million on capital expenditures which includes expenditures to capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities.", "As previously announced, at the end of 2016 we completed the acquisition of Cambian Group, PLC's adult services division consisting of 79 inpatient and 2 outpatient behavioral health facilities located in the United Kingdom. Working in conjunction with our existing behavioral facilities located in the UK we believe these newly acquired facilities will ensure that we're well positioned to serve patients, customers and communities with a broad range of innovative treatment services and products.", "In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced during the third quarter of 2014 during the fourth quarter of 2016 we repurchased 475,000 shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $52 million or $109 per share. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2016 we have repurchased approximately 4.39 million shares at an aggregate price of approximately $514 million or $117 per share. $286 million remained on this previous share repurchase authorization at the end of 2016.", "Our estimated range of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $1.746 billion to $1.821 billion, representing an increase of approximately 5% to 10% over the $1.653 billion of EBITDA generated during 2016. Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $7.70 to $8.20 per diluted share. This guidance range excludes the unfavorable $0.15 per diluted share of EHR impact expected during 2017 as well as the impact on our provision for income taxes and net income attributable to UHS resulting from our January 1 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as mentioned in our press release.", "This adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 5% to 12% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $7.32 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016 as calculated on the supplemental schedule included in last night's press release. During 2017 our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $10.62 billion to $10.76 billion, representing an increase of approximately 9% to 10% over our 2016 net revenues. Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.", "Justin Lake", "First question just in terms of the behavioral business, I wanted to see if you can talk about whether there's been any impact to behavioral operations post the BuzzFeed article. And if you could talk to - I know it came out in December - potentially even January and February and what you have seen year to date here, Steve, that would be great. And also any change in the level of activity on the investigation post that article, as well.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. When the BuzzFeed article came out which was in early December, we obviously speculated at the time and anticipated that we did not believe the article would have much, if any, impact on our underlying behavioral operations, on demand, on our referral sources, on the behavior of our clinicians, et cetera. Unfortunately we went into our quiet period about a week after the article so we didn't really comment with any great specificity after that.", "So, it's with a measure of relief that I'm happy to say that with the passage now of several months that all that we represented at the time really seems to be valid and verifiable, that there's been little impact on our underlying business. I think you see that in our Q4 volumes which incrementally improved during the quarter and continued to get a little bit better with each passing quarter. And I think we can say that in January and February that improvement continued. So, again, from an underlying operational perspective, we see no material evidence that the BuzzFeed article has had an impact on us.", "In terms of the investigation, we filed our 100K last night and if you read the legal disclosure section you'll see that there's really no change to the disclosure there which I think is an indication that our conversations with the government and the activity with the government has also not changed, at least in any way that's apparent to us, in any measurable way since the BuzzFeed article came out.", "Justin Lake", "And if I could just ask a follow up on behavioral, the EBITDA guidance that you've given for the year, can you talk about what you'd expect in terms of - I know you don't give quarterly guidance - but how you see the ramp in both behavioral volumes for the year and behavioral EBITDA growth for the year and what you think EBITDA growth in total would be for behavioral organically and M&A? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. What we have talked about, quite frankly, for some time now is that beginning in the middle of 2015, really with the third quarter of 2015, our behavioral revenues and volumes became more muted and we largely attributed that moderation to difficulties in finding an adequate number of clinicians, mostly nurses but to some degrees psychiatrists and mental health technicians, in certain markets to service the demand and the patients who were requesting services at our facilities.", "We've been working on that issue ever since and have and have said that we believe in the back half of 2016 that we're beginning to make some incremental progress and that our expectation was that by the time we got to the end of 2017, we would be back to what we consider a normalized run rate which would be something like 5% or 5.5% revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. I think if you look at the cadence of how we expect that recovery to continue, I think it's what creates, in large part, the range of our guidance for next year.", "So, I would say the midpoint of our range for next year assumes that that recovery in our behavioral revenues and volumes takes place rather ratably over the course of the year. The low end of the range would suggest it takes place a little more slowly and I think the high end of the range would suggest it takes place a little more quickly than that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of A.J, Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice", "Just maybe to follow up on the guidance a little further, can you just maybe give us some flavor for how your assumptions relate on the acute care side and also any commentary on your capital deployment assumptions? I know you were buying back stock in the fourth quarter. Are you assuming that continues this year?", "Steve Filton", "Again, I think that our acute care guidance for next year is really something we've been talking about for some time and that is, while we're extremely pleased with our robust acute care volumes and revenue care growth in 2016, we acknowledge that they are industry-leading numbers and, frankly, industry-leading numbers by quite a large margin. And obviously certainly we're going to try and stem those numbers as much as we can but, realistically, feel like some moderation is likely.", "The guidance for next year presumes that acute care same-store revenue growth moderates to something in the neighborhood of 6% next year and that that would translate to 7% or 8% EBITDA growth. And while you didn't ask this and while we don't normally give quarterly guidance, I will mention that, as people look at their quarterly models, they should just keep in mind that, particularly in Q1, our comparisons for 2016 are very difficult on the acute care side. So, I would, again, suggest to people that that's something you keep in mind as you think about the cadence for next year.", "As far as capital deployment goes, historically, our convention has been to simply reflect in our guidance the share repurchases we've made already at the time of our guidance but then not assume any further share repurchases and a just really assume that all of our free cash flow goes toward the repayment of debt which, in our case, would be the repayment of relatively low-cost debt. So, from a guidance perspective, it's a fairly conservative position to take, but consistent with what we've historically done.", "A.J. Rice", "And just maybe a follow-up - I know the last two quarters you talked about the fact that the IMD exclusion has given rise to a number of discussions with acute care guys that have units and are either looking to potentially have you managed, outsource, even acquire assets. Can you just comment on what that looks like? Is the acquisition pipeline in behavioral in particular stepped up in any way? Maybe some flavor on that.", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So, I would note this - in the fourth quarter of 2016, our overall Medicaid volumes have grown by about 3.5%, our overall rotation days, compared to the 1.5% divisional-wide growth. So, our Medicaid volumes are growing faster than our overall volumes. It is impossible for us to attribute that directly to the impacts of the IMD exclusion being lifted, et cetera, but it seems to be consistent with the idea that we'd be getting some benefit from that.", "At the same time, and I don't think the two are absolutely directly related, but, as you suggest, we have talked a great deal of the last few quarters about the fact that we are having much more frequent conversations with acute care hospitals about, in some way, penetrating and sharing in the economics of their behavioral health facilities. And we probably have about a half a dozen arrangements that we've had a place for some time representing executed transactions already reflecting that.", "Those numbers are already embedded in our same-store results. I think we concluded that there was no point in trying to extract them or really call them out separately. As we move forward, I think we will identify these new arrangements separately and talk about EBITDA impact, et cetera.", "We announced in the third quarter, for instance, two joint ventures to build new behavioral freestanding facilities with acute care hospitals, one in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and one in Spokane, Washington. Neither of those will have an impact in 2017. They will both open in 2018 so they don't really have an impact on guidance but it's something we continue to work on.", "And then we probably have about a dozen other conversations that I would describe as likely resulting in some sort of arrangement but still a little too early to discuss them with any level of specificity. And then, quite frankly, a number of other conversations that are at much more preliminary levels or preliminary stages.", "So, we continue to view the opportunity to penetrate or integrate the behavioral units within these acute care hospitals as a tremendous development opportunity for us, not just in the next year or two but, frankly, for the intermediate and long term. And we will continue to report on those as we do then. But other than the about half a dozen that, I think, as I said, are already embedded in our same-store numbers, I don't think those conversations and those new arrangements are likely to have a material impact in 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Josh Raskin", "First question, Steve, for you, just on the outpatient environment, the competitive environment, and what you're seeing in your markets. Are you seeing any additional competition from freestanding EDs or surgery centers or even urgent care centers? I'm just curious what your reaction is on the acute care side?", "Steve Filton", "I know that a number of our acute care peers have talked about that dynamic of increased outpatient competition from all the sources that you mentioned - freestanding EDs, ambulatory surgery centers, et cetera. And certainly we have noticed and continue to feel the same dynamics.", "Now, I will say that it appears, if you look just look at the relationship between our admissions and adjusted admissions, that we haven't had the negative impact on our outpatient revenue that at least some of our peers have had. I don't necessarily have any real explanation for that other than it may well be that in some of our more mid-sized urban or suburban markets that outpatient pressure is not quite as severe as it is in some of these really large urban markets.", "That's really mostly speculation on my part. It does look, as you compare our outpatient numbers to our peers, that our outpatient volumes are holding up a little bit better, although certainly we feel the same pressures from these niche outpatient providers that our peers report, as well.", "Josh Raskin", "And do you see that, Steve, in, think of, bigger market - Vegas or DC - versus McAllen, or something like that? Are you seeing that urban versus suburban differential?", "Steve Filton", "Honestly, Josh, I almost have the view that in markets like McAllen and Las Vegas, that outpatient push occurred even earlier. Those happen to be two very, what I would describe as entrepreneurial from a physician perspective, market.", "So, while something like freestanding EDs are a relatively new development and concept, things like physician-owned surgery centers and even a physician-owned hospital, when it comes to the McAllen market, are things that we have been dealing with for years and years. So, I also think that maybe one of the issues is that, again, in some of our larger markets, we are maybe a little bit further along on that outpatient competition curve and so the comparisons don't look as difficult for us.", "Josh Raskin", "And then just a quick question on the guidance, you guys added EBITDA this year, and I'm just curious - was that more just helpful for modeling purposes or are you guys thinking about management from a different perspective, EBITDA more of an emphasis than EPS, or any internal management change around metrics?", "Steve Filton", "No, it's really just a function of giving people what they want. I've been asked by investors for a couple of years to include more detailed information, particularly about EBITDA, in the guidance. So, we thought it would just be useful progress.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paula Torch with Avondale Partners.", "Paula Torch", "I wanted to start my first question with maybe the ACA and talking about behavioral volumes. I know that you said it's hard to parse it out. It's certainly hard for the Street to parse it out. So, I was just wondering, do you have any systems in place to help you track where admissions are coming from? How much of a benefit do you think that the ACA has actually been to your behavioral business? And in your opinion, do you think repeal-replace would do away with essential health benefits for mental health or substance abuse? And anything that you're hearing out of Washington? Our feeling is that this space is pretty immune. I just want to know from your perspective how immune do you think this segment really is?", "Steve Filton", "Paula, I think what we have said up to now is that our view is that the Affordable Care Act has had relatively minimal impact on our behavioral business. The biggest impact we think it's had on our acute business has been on the Medicaid expansion side of it. And on the behavioral side, because most of those new Medicaid expansion patients are adult patients, and because the IMD exclusion has precluded those people from being treated in most freestanding behavioral facilities, that really wasn't a benefit for us.", "And on the commercial exchange side, because so many of those plans were high deductible plans, and because behavioral bills tend to be much smaller, we felt that, besides the anecdotal patient here or there or the incidental patient here or there, there really has not been a pervasive positive impact on our behavioral facilities that there has been on the acute facilities.", "As far as what the prospects are going forward, as you suggest, speculating how modifications to the ACA are going to deal with the essential health benefit piece of it is very hard to say at this point. While there's been tons of talk about repeal and replace, or repeal and repair, or whatever, there's very little agreement on any details because. The President suggested just a couple of days ago, this is a very complicated subject, and I think everybody's realizing that.", "So, I think it would be difficult to speculate how we'd be impacted, although I think we share the view that you articulated, Paula, which is that we believe that behavioral care and behavioral treatment in general is viewed positively at both the federal and state levels at the moment, and that it is not a segment or space that is under a lot of scrutiny or pressure. So, just our general expectations are that it will be treated favorably however the details are worked out progress", "Paula Torch", "And then if I could just move quickly to the UK, I know the CMA is conducting a phase 1 investigation of your Cambian acquisition. I know that this is small in terms of your total business as well as your behavioral business, but I just wonder how those discussions with the CMA are going, if you started to identify any assets that you might possibly need to divest in order to satisfy their findings. And maybe it's too early but could you give us a sense of timing there and what kind of synergies you might be able to get from this acquisition?", "Steve Filton", "Starting backwards, we never imagined that there would be significant synergies from this transaction. As you articulated, Paula, our existing footprint pre-Cambian in the UK was relatively small. So, there was not a great deal of overhead to be ultimately synergized, if you will, between the new Cambian business and our existing business, maybe ultimately $1 million or $2 million of ultimate savings. And we certainly haven't even included that in our guidance, or the assumption of that in our guidance.", "We certainly did our own due diligence before the transaction with trade restraint attorneys in the UK and had them look at the geographic overlap of the businesses we were acquiring and those that we already had, and generally concluded that we thought there was relatively minimal overlap and risk of CMA issues. But of course we won't know that until the CMA does there work.", "We have been providing information to the CMA almost from, I think even the time that we announced the transaction. They, of course, just announced this past week or last week that they were beginning their formal process. We don't really have a lot of feedback from them. We view this at the moment as just part of their routine exercise. As they communicate with us, we'll keep folks updated, but at the moment it's really impossible for us to know what direction and with what rigor and scrutiny they're going to approach this.", "Paula Torch", "Okay And then I just have one more follow-up, if I could. On the behavioral pricing, it was a little bit weaker, certainly sequentially. Was that just a function of tougher comps? Or maybe there's any color you can give us on pricing?", "Steve Filton", "I think the one nuance is that our year-over-year UK pricing, even though as you again articulated is a relatively small component of our business, the pound declined in value about 22% from the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2016. And that dramatic decline, even on our relatively small UK business, was enough to drive that same-store pricing metric down about 100 basis points. So, when you adjust for the currency fluctuation, we're at about 1.5% price increase, which is pretty consistent with what we've been running, and pretty consistent with what we, frankly, expect is a sustainable number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "I just wanted to go back to the improvement that you expect in the behavioral business because, as you mentioned, this has been going on since Q3 of 2015. I think at that time the initial thought was that once we comp against that in the back half of 2016 we'd be seeing acceleration, and it hasn't come back as quickly as we would have thought.", "Do you have any data around what's driving the sequential improvement as time goes on? Is there something that you're looking at from a workforce addition perspective, that you're onboarding nurses at some pace over the next few quarters that gives you visibility that this is going to happen? Or is it more about comp against easy numbers? Can you just provide a little more color as to why you're confident?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I think from the outset, based on our previous experience, I can think in my 30-plus years with the Company of maybe two or three other nursing shortages, relatively severe nursing shortages, that I have been through, mostly, honestly, on the acute side. They tend to, I think, have a life cycle to them because I think the market, as markets generally do, tend to correct themselves. So, as a nurse shortage becomes apparent and nurse wages and demand for nursing hours increases, the market responds in a macro way by more and more people enrolling in nursing school, by part-time nurses working extra shifts, by retired nurses coming out of retirement and working an extra shift here or there. There's a natural increase in the supply of nursing hours.", "Now, that takes some time, and I think historically has taken 18 to 24 months. So, if you peg the beginning of this shortage as right around the middle of 2015, we're just about at the 18-month mark with the end of 2016. So from a macro perspective, there's some of that, just expectation that the market itself and the macro environment will begin to improve beginning in 2017.", "Certainly as a Company, we have not been just sitting on our hands waiting for that to happen and we've been aggressively implementing our own initiatives to increase our recruitment activities and our recruitment focus and our recruitment infrastructure and our internet application process, and a million other things, as well as trying to focus on better retention policies for the nurses we do hire. That's been an enormous focus of ours, as well, so that once we hire nurses, making sure that we have mentoring programs and educational opportunities and career advancement incentives all in place so that we keep the nurses who we to hire.", "Now, all that, to be fair, is relatively generic, et cetera. I think what ultimately gives us confidence is that over the last couple of quarters, we clearly see the amount of nurse vacancies being reduced and a lot of those vacancies being filled. We see a number of the units that we have closed or in facilities where we've capped the census or limited the census. We've seen those caps either reduced or lifted.", "Now, what we do think Q3, and what we said we expect it to continue into Q4, is that there is this transition period, that as we hire new nurses there is some increased expense as we begin to pay them their salaries, but they are going through orientation, they're going through training. Frankly, one of the tactics that we've had to adopt in some cases is hiring less experienced nurses, more nurses who are directly out of nursing school so they require, frankly, more training, more orientation, which just elongates the period of time it takes.", "But it's really that visibility that we have, Kevin, into how many vacancies are open, how many beds we been able to re-open they gives us the confidence that, as we've been talking all along, will really begin to make some traction in 2017 in building those volumes back up to the pre-Q3 2015 levels.", "Kevin Fischbeck", "Based upon that last comment, though, about the timing of costs and everything, does that mean that from an EBITDA growth perspective you would expect EBITDA growth to obviously follow a similar pattern but maybe even more so because at the beginning you're going to have more costs and less revenue, and then by the end the costs stay the same but the revenue accelerates? Or, how do you think about the margin improvement as the year goes on?", "Steve Filton", "I think about it in a couple ways. I think that what we experienced in Q3 and, to some degree, continue to experience in Q4 is some, what I would describe as, duplicate costs, meaning we're paying these nurses, and we have that expense but they're not yet really productive. That is, they're not on the floors treating patients or they're not on the floors treating what we would describe as a normal or average workload of patients as we bring them incrementally into the system. Obviously at some point we will get past that incremental investment and this new expense, et cetera, and I think that will begin to occur in the first quarter of 2017.", "I DO think there is an ongoing level of increased expense. We've had to raise wage rates in a number of markets. We're using temporary nurses in markets at an added cost. And we've added temporary psychiatrists, quite frankly, in some markets that we haven't had to do in a long time.", "And I think the way we've reflected that is, we've talked about exiting 2017 with something like 5% behavioral revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. If we were having this conversation two years ago, I would have probably suggested at that time that 5% revenue growth translates to maybe 8% or 9% EBITDA growth. The moderation, I think, in the EBITDA growth assumptions is a reflection that some of this wage pressure and wage increase is more permanent in nature and something that we're going to have to deal with on a more permanent basis.", "So, I think about it, again, in some ways, as some of these costs are temporary, some are more permanent. But I think we've reflected all that in our guidance for next year and in the assumed and projected ramp-up in our earnings and revenue growth for next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana Gupte", "I wanted to go back to the acute side. Can you just remind me, firstly, why the margins compressed again by 80 basis points year over year in 2016 relative to 2015? And how should we think about the puts and takes around wages and staffing and pricing and contracting and just normalized margins into 2017 and beyond?", "Steve Filton", "Again, I don't think there is anything terribly new in Q4 in terms of the dynamics we've been discussing. Obviously, our volume and revenue growth on the acute side has been rather robust for a while now. But we've seen choppy performance in the resulting EBITDA, and not necessarily the pull-through on margins that we would normally expect. I think the biggest reason for that is, again, the labor shortage and the pressure on nurse wage rates that we've experienced on the acute side.", "We've said all along that I think the labor shortage has manifested itself in the two divisions in different ways. On the acute side, I think the labor shortage has manifested itself mostly through higher use of premium pay, overtime for our own nurses, and the use of temporary or registry nurses.", "And, by the way, I think it's related to our strong top line. One of the reasons why I think we're experiencing more labor pressure than some of our peers is because our end-market economies are improving faster, unemployment is dropping quickly. There are more labor shortages in our markets, I think, than in some of our peers' markets. That's why, quite frankly, our demand is growing so much. But at the same time there is this offsetting dynamic of higher pressure on wages.", "I think our expectation next year is that we will see some stabilization both, again, at a macro level and also we'll see some improvements from some of our own initiatives. And, as a result, I think we're expecting the acute care model to show somewhat moderating revenue trends next year but a return to what we would describe as a more normalized pull-through of EBITDA. So, with revenues growing by 6%, we would expect EBITDA to grow by 7% or 8%, and margins to expand.", "Now, again, I will make the same comment I made to Kevin - if you had asked me this question two years I would have said that maybe with 6% acute care revenue growth, EBITDA margins would expand 8% or 9%. And I think the fact that we've moderated that view is a reflection that we think that some of these wage increases are more permanent in nature.", "Ana Gupte", "Then on the bad debt side, again, you did well this quarter. Your AR receivables you said were trending well. One of your peers has had issues on AR receivables and collectibility from commercial peers. I was just wondering if you were seeing anything. It is related to exchanges or any other businesses that maybe put some pressure going forward?", "Steve Filton", "I think those who listen to our calls and commentary will know that we tend not to really focus on bad debt as a distinctive line. But we tend to focus much more on our overall net revenue growth and net revenue per admission growth on the acute side net of bad debt expense. Our net revenue growth per admission was about 2.5% in the quarter. That's really largely within our expectations, and I think continues to be so.", "Now, look, much like I was saying about outpatient competition before, I think we feel like some of the dynamics our peers have talked about we certainly have experienced, as well. There's no question that over the last few years payers have shifted more of the ultimate payment burden to the consumer and to the patient, and we are collecting, we're being asked to collect more, on co-pays and deductibles from the patients themselves than we have been asked to collect from insurance companies historically. And that is certainly a tougher exercise and we certainly are making changes in our approach, in our systems, et cetera, to do that more effectively.", "think we feel it has certainly having an impact and has somewhat pressured our overall net revenue yield over the last couple of years, but I don't think we feel like that's accelerated in any material way in the last quarter or two. And I think we just feel like that's a trend that, again, is now just a part of the business and something that we've kept in mind as we've created our 2017 guidance.", "Ana Gupte", "Okay. And if I could squeeze one last one - that was very helpful, Steve - on the acute volumes, you talked a lot about the economy in your specific markets, some of your visibility into peer mix. At earlier times, I think maybe a year ago you used to talk more about Medicare and perhaps driving more volumes through whatever clinical practices and treatment guidelines and the like. Is anything coming from there at all?", "And then, finally, on 1Q, is there a positive impact from the flu? You've talked about tough comps, obviously, given your performance last year. How does the leap day comp all work into 1Q guidance - or just 1Q performance since you don't have guidance?", "Steve Filton", "We have tended, I think, to artificially describe the middle of 2015 as the end of the ACA era. And obviously the ACA has continued to have an impact. But I think our point of view was the most dramatic and meaningful impact from the ACA really occurred in 2015 and the first half of 2015.", "And I think since, the back half of 2015 and in the four quarters since then, the payer mix dynamics that we've experienced have been pretty consistent. You repeated them, to some degree. The strongest growing segment of our payer population has been the Medicare population. Medicaid is probably second. We have seen our commercial volumes decline a little bit, and we have seen our uninsured volumes tick back up. And, again, again I think all of those dynamics have really been fairly consistent for the last four quarters or so.", "We view that, again, as indicative of the underlying strength in our markets because I think Medicare business is largely unimpacted by the ACA. It's largely impacted by a lot of the economic recovery issues. It just, I think, is reflective of the strong market share position we have in our markets, our ability to take market share and grow demand, et cetera. And I think we have a view that continues.", "As far as the flu, interestingly, I think in most of our markets, I know that generally it's been a relatively busy flu season, particularly over the last four to six weeks. I think in most of our markets it's been a pretty moderate flu season. Now, again, I think we tend to largely ignore the transient impact of the flu either way. But I will say that I don't think we're benefiting greatly from the flu in our markets.", "And, finally, I think the leap year, leap day, that's just a mathematical issue. It just makes what for us - which I already said earlier - was a very difficult comparison in Q1 just even a little bit more difficult, but not something that I think has any real impact on our ultimate and full-year guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Lieberman with Wells Fargo.", "Gary Lieberman", "Steve, in the past you've talked about a shortage of psychiatrists in some markets actually forcing you to put a hold on patient admissions. Is that still the case and to what extent?", "Steve Filton", "When this labor shortage really started to manifest itself in the middle of 2015, we talked a lot about the psychiatrist shortage because, quite frankly, in the beginning that's what I think was most impactful on us. I think what we found was that we were able to devise ways to mitigate the physician and psychiatrist shortage more easily. We used things like telemedicine. We used things like physician extenders, RNs and psychologists, doing some of the work that psychiatrists had traditionally done, to fill in for that. And I think it proved to be fairly effective.", "While we continue to have some pockets of psychiatry shortages in a few markets, I think we don't view that as a really pervasive issue at this point. Relatively quickly the bigger issue became nursing shortages and we really couldn't find the same kinds of solutions, meaning there were not technical solutions. You really can't replace a nurse with telemedicine. They really are at the bedside. They're the hands-on provider. You really can't extend the nurses' duties with people under them because the people under them tend to be non-professionals. So, the nurse shortage proved to be a little bit more intractable to us, so that remains an issue.", "Again, just back to my overall comments, I think we feel like we've made progress on our clinician shortages in general. I think you've seen that reflected in slightly improving, incremental improvement in volumes in Q3 and Q4. We obviously would hope that the pace of those improvements will accelerate in 2017, and expect that they well.", "Gary Lieberman", "And then maybe just a follow-up on the benefit from the IMD exclusion or the potential benefit. Are there things you need to do proactively, like making sure you're in appropriate plans and actually going out and marketing to referral sources? Or is it more reactive just from the perspective, that patients that show up at the hospital you're now allowed to accept them as opposed to previously turning them away?", "Steve Filton", "We have to do what you said, which is, in order to have access to these managed Medicaid patients, we obviously have to make sure that we are a contract provider with the appropriate managed Medicaid plans in particular markets. I think for the most part we have been able to accomplish that and that has not been a real hurdle.", "I think the hurdle, which may have been under-appreciated, quite frankly, by providers as well as by investors, has been that this pattern of referrals and this pattern of patient behavior has been in place for decades. These adult Medicaid patients have been accustomed, I think, to going to acute care emergency rooms when they need care. And our ability to step in and just redirect what are these decades old patterns in a very short period of time is somewhat limited.", "Now, again, I think we're trying to do that. And we can certainly engage with the managed care companies to help us in that endeavour by competing on the basis of price and offering lower rates. But I think what we've concluded is that the more economically effective way to get to those patients is in some sort of collaborative venture with the acute care hospital - getting them to close their units down and send their patients to us, or getting them to lease their behavioral units or freestanding behavioral facilities to us, or joint venturing their facilities with us, or joint venturing new facilities with us.", "We've done every version of what I just described and we continue to negotiate with more acute care hospitals to do every version of what I just described. I think ultimately that's the way that we will really enjoy the benefit of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, although, again, in the short run, as I was suggesting, I think we're already seeing, we're likely to see some incremental benefit just from an increase in Medicaid utilization, which clearly we have already experienced.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert W. Baird.", "Whit Mayo", "Maybe just an update on Henderson, I know it's early but how is that hospital tracking versus planned? And is that new capacity having any impact on your existing presence within the market? I think it's a lot closer to Dignity's facilities. But just curious how this is playing out versus your initial expectations.", "Steve Filton", "It's still relatively early, Whit. The facility opened in the beginning of October. We had consistently guided and told people that it would have an impact on EBITDA - an EBITDA drag, if you will - of $5 million to $10 million in the back half of 2016. I think that the actual results are absolutely in that range. I think our expectation embedded in our guidance for 2017 is a turnaround and some level of accretion.", "And, honestly, I think the turnaround at Henderson would otherwise have provided a bigger tailwind for us in our 2017 guidance except for the fact - and these are unrelated but I think they wind up mathematically offsetting each other - but we've got a schedule in the 10-K, for when folks get a chance to read it in more detail, that shows our Texas Medicaid reimbursement and our expectations that our Texas Medicaid reimbursement will go down $16 million or $17 million in 2017. That decline, unfortunately, I think, largely offsets the improvement in Henderson. What I think we were hoping would be a standalone tailwind really doesn't. It winds up just being an offset for us.", "As far as cannibalizing our existing business, you described as very quickly, I think every other hospital that we've opened in the last 10 or 15 years in Vegas has, to some degree, cannibalized some existing business, mostly on the [indiscernible] side of the market. But in the case of Henderson in the southeast part of Las Vegas, that's been a market that has historically been dominated by Dignity. And I think we have the view that most of the market share that we would take would be from Dignity. That seems to certainly be the outcome in the first few months of operation.", "Whit Mayo", "Are there any other supplemental reimbursement changes we should be aware of? LIP? California provider fee? I think you got a little there. Just curious if there's anything we should be mindful of.", "Steve Filton", "I don't think anything else that's a material change for next year or this year.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. And maybe just one last one - DSOs ticked up a bit. I don't know if that's just Cambian mathematically flowing into the financial statements. But just any color to share would be helpful.", "Steve Filton", "Yes, I think they're actually flat between the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year.", "Operator", "And we have no other questions in queue at this time.", "Steve Filton", "Okay. We would like to thank everybody for their time and look forward to speaking with everyone again at the end of the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:UHS) Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 26, 2017  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Analysts", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Tanya and I will your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UHS Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Filton. Mr. Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. Welcome to this review of Universal Health Services results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements.", "For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors, and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.91 for the quarter after adjusting for the favorable impact from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09 as discussed in our press release, and the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the Supplemental Schedule included with last night's earnings release.", "Adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $188.1 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, during the second quarter of 2017, as compared to $191.1 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, during the second quarter of last year. On a same-facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the second quarter of 2017 increased 5.1% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 6.0% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year.", "On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 2.2% during the second quarter of 2017, as compared to the second quarter of 2016. During this year's second quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year decreased 3.7% and \u2013 excuse me, increased 3.7% and adjusted patient days increased 1.4%. Revenue per adjusted admission decreased 1.4%, and revenue per adjusted day increased 0.9% during the second quarter of 2017, over the comparable prior-year quarter.", "Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first six months of 2017, we are revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $7.50 to $8 per diluted share, from the previously provided range of $7.70 to $8.20 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the expected electronic health records impact for the year, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, decreases both the lower and upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 2.5%.", "For the six months ended June 30, 2017, our cash provided by operating activities decreased to $534 million from $836 million generated during the comparable six-month period of 2016. The $302 million decrease was caused primarily by a $217 million unfavorable change in other working capital accounts, resulting primarily from changes in accrued compensation and accounts payable due to timing of disbursements, and a $92 million unfavorable change in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the UK.", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased slightly to 51 days during the second quarter of 2017, as compared to 50 days during the second quarter of 2016. At June 30, 2017, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 46.1% as compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We spent $118 million on capital expenditures during the second quarter of 2017, and $262 million during the first six months of 2017.", "In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 984,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $116 million, or approximately $118 per share. Since inception of the program through June 30, 2017, we have repurchased approximately 5.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $641 million, or approximately $117 per share.", "Alan and I would be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice with UBS.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, everybody. A couple of quick questions, if I could ask maybe. Just looking at the technical financials, on the non-same-store psych business, it looks like, I guess, that's mainly Cambian. It looks like you might have had pressure on that result. Was there anything else in there that you'd highlight, and how is Cambian doing right out of the box here?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "A.J., I think, as we'd discussed in the first quarter, and I would reiterate in the second quarter, that Cambian operations are performing pretty much as we expected. When we acquired Cambian late in 2016, we talked about an ongoing run rate of about $45 million of EBITDA, and I think we're on track with that, with the exception that in the first six months of ownership, we had a sort of transition services agreement with the previous owner where we were paying for some of their administrative services. And that depresses the EBITDA a little bit; I mean, not a great deal.", "But I think from an operating perspective, the facilities have been performing as we expected and the expectation is that they'll continue to do so. Now, we do have a negative currency adjustment and have had that just in terms of \u2013 that affects, frankly, more of our existing operations than the Cambian operations.", "I think what you are looking at in terms of the non-same-store behavioral results is about $13 million or $14 million of unfavorable adjustments in the quarter relating to a couple of items: a non-recurring one-time adjustment to disproportionate share monies in one particular state and some malpractice expense adjustments. Those are offset, to some degree, by $5 million or $6 million of favorable adjustments in the acute division. The net of $7 million or $8 million of unfavorable adjustments is something we didn't disclose on a consolidated basis because we didn't view it as material.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. All right. Thanks. Then I guess, stepping back, if I look at the results, it looks like maybe a little bit of puts and takes in acute, but I would characterize that as largely in line with expectations, maybe a little bit ahead, and that to the extent there was any variance, it was mainly on the behavioral side. I'd love to hear you confirm that.", "And then drilling down, it seems like the behavioral variance is largely in length of stay, which I know we've talked about; a couple of payers in the Medicaid side that you've been trying to negotiate with, that have put pressure on length of stay. Have you been able to drill down and give more flavor as to what you're actually seeing with that length of stay and whether it can be corrected quickly, I guess?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, I will confirm your characterization, A.J., of the acute results for the second quarter as being in line. I think they were very much consistent with our expectations. In particular, we're pleased with the strength, particularly the volume strength on the acute side, but, again, the overall result is, I think, very much in line.", "On the behavioral side, again, I think your characterization is fair. The 2.2% revenue growth, even when you adjust that for the negative currency swing between years, I think that number becomes something like closer to 2.75% same-store revenue growth on the behavioral side, and that's still a little bit lower than where we expect it to be at this time of the year. We probably expect it to be closer to something like 3.5% and I think you've identified the variance as the length of stay, I mean, that admission growth number which I think now has grown for four consecutive quarters, is really well within, and, frankly, probably a little bit ahead of our expectations and I think is reflective of what we have been saying all along, that the underlying demand for our behavioral services across the portfolio remains strong, but the length of stay decline that we've experienced in Q1 and Q2 is not something we anticipated when we gave our original guidance.", "I think most of the commentary that I would make on that length of stay contraction is similar to what I said in Q1, and that is that I think it's a result of really two dynamics; one is that we are seeing more Medicaid patients who tend to have a lower length of stay than the rest of our payers. We believe that probably the impetus for that increase in Medicaid utilization is the benefit of the IMD exclusion being lifted, and \u2013 but I think one of the things that's happening in the short run is, there is some adverse payer mix selection, and that increase in Medicaid patients is crowding out some of the Medicare and commercial patients who, in many cases, are probably better-paying patients, and also those with higher length of stay.", "The other issue, I think, that we talked about, and I think you were sort of alluding to in your question is that within the Medicaid payer mix in that patient population, we're seeing some more aggressive behavior on the part of payers. I think our point of view is that over the course of the next few quarters, we will either, where it's clinically appropriate, be able to impact that length of stay and restore it to where it was, or I guess I should say, and/or the admission growth will continue and will offset that impact of the length of stay decline.", "And so in our minds, we will get to where we targeted, from the sort of 3.5% same-store revenue growth that we thought, and we're probably 75 basis points behind there, I think we feel like we will get to that 5% revenue growth that we thought we'd exit the year at. We'll get there, but it will probably be a quarter or two behind schedule.", "A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gurda with KeyBanc.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, Good morning. Thank you. Steve, can you provide an update on how the UK volumes on the behavioral side look compared to the U.S. volumes?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean I think, Jason, I don't have the exact data in front of me, but I think the UK volumes are growing. I mean, honestly, we are more capacity-limited in the UK than we are here in the U.S.; we run at occupancy rates in the UK that are probably in the low 90s as opposed to the high 70s that we operate here in the U.S., but I think, we're growing admissions in the UK by that similar, sort of, 3% to 4% number that we're reflecting on the U.S. side as well.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the acute care side, the soft revenue per adjusted admission growth, is that from the mix shift that we saw in the first quarter?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I think that's really a mechanical issue that because we are reimbursed almost exclusively on the behavioral side on a per-day or per diem basis, the effect of a decline in length of stay is that revenue per admission declines, and that's what you're seeing. I think the way that we do our model is, we do it based on revenue per day rather than revenue per admission, and the revenue per day growth of roughly 1% in the quarter is very consistent with what our expectations were.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Actually, I was referring to the acute care side...", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I'm sorry.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "...where I think you had lower growth in surgery volumes compared to medical volumes.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. No, I think on the acute side, that's exactly right. I mean, I think to some degree, Jason, the growth in our admissions on the acute side, the outsized growth which, I think, has been, and my expectation, will continue to be generally better than our peers' is a function, to some degree, of seeing more of those lower acuity admissions.", "I think some of those lower acuity admissions over the last few years had been converted to observation patients, and one of the things that I think we said over the course of the last few years is that at some point, the pendulum would begin to swing back, at least partially, the other way, and more of those observation patients would qualify for in-patient admission where they've met clinical criteria, et cetera, and I think you're seeing that happening.", "So, we're seeing a bit more of those lower acuity admissions, but obviously to a degree that's also driving the revenue per admission down. I think also as our peers have noted as well, we continue to see and have seen, I think, for the last couple of years, an incremental increase in uncompensated patients, a slight decline in commercial patients, particularly commercial exchange patients, and I think those trends continue, although I don't think they were particularly \u2013 there was anything particularly dramatic or new in the quarter.", "Jason W. Gurda - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. This is actually Joanna Gajuk filling in for Kevin. Thanks for taking the question here. So, just to follow up on the last point; in terms of the payer mix that you mentioned that you feel like you continue to see slight declines in commercial patients and increase in uncompensated or uninsured patients, so, should we expect these trends to continue, and so, I guess, if that's the case, should we expect the sort of flat pricing to continue for the rest of the year for the Acute Care business?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Joanna, I would answer the question by saying that the 5% revenue growth \u2013 same-store revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter was similar to our expectations; and we said at the beginning of the year that our expectations for acute care revenue growth were in the 5% to 6% range for the year, with the understanding that those numbers would get better as the year progressed because the comparisons get easier.", "I think when we gave that original guidance, our presumption was that revenue growth would be split pretty evenly between volume and price; and, I think we would sort of stick to the overall revenue assumption, and I think we'll likely trend that way. But if we continue to generate higher admissions, I think that revenue per admission will be lower. But I think we continue, as I think A.J.'s initial question indicated, our acute overall results are very much in line and our acute guidance remains very much in line with what it was originally, and that is something like 5% or 6% revenue growth.", "How we get there between admissions and volume may change, but I think we're comfortable with the overall revenue guidance.", "Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That makes sense. But then staying on the acute, right, so you're talking about the 5% to 6% revenue growth, and I guess, the margin did not really improve that much as you would expect; and, I assume there is partial impact in there from the health fund business. So correct me if I'm wrong there. And then, is there anything else you would highlight? I guess the fact that you're talking about a lower acuity and increases in payer mix, but I guess that's reflected in the \u2013 not much of a margin improvement in that segment.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I think that, as we've talked about probably over the course of the last few quarters, probably the single biggest impairment or, I guess, obstacle, I guess, is a better word, to growing those acute care margins has been the wage pressure and the labor pressure. I think on the acute side, we continue to run higher than what we would consider to be ideal levels of premium pay that is over-time and use of temporary nurses, in particular.", "I think our general sense over, again, the course of the year in our guidance was that those pressures would become more muted in the back-half of the year when the comparisons became easier, and that's still our expectation.", "Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And on the labor front, any color in terms of the psych business in terms of how you are progressing in terms of the pressure there? Thank you.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, we first began to talk about the labor pressures and the labor constraints probably in the middle of 2015, actually, initially, I think, as a shortage of psychiatrists, and then later more as a shortage of nurses; and we really began to talk about it because we began to see our admissions more muted. As I said in response to, again, I think A.J.'s initial question, those behavioral admissions have been growing for the last four quarters, I believe; and in my mind, that's reflective of the progress that we're making on that labor front. So, as we fill more of those positions, our admissions go up.", "To be fair, we have not completely solved or resolved that problem and we still have pockets of either nurse or physician shortages, but clearly in my mind, the 3.7% admission growth that we posted in Q2 reflects the fact that we've made a significant amount of progress on that issue and expect to continue to make progress as the year goes on.", "Joanna Gajuk - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is Austin (20:53) on for Sarah. So, we're looking a little closer into the behavioral health business and, I guess, we're just kind of wondering, how has the competitive dynamics of hiring behavioral health nurses changed over the past year?", "Unknown Speaker", "Can you speak up a little, please?", "Unknown Speaker", "Yeah. Sorry about that. How has the competitive dynamics of hiring behavioral health nurses changed over the past year and have competitors become more aggressive with their hiring process to either gather or retain their nurses?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Austin. So, I think we've been pretty clear about this. I mean, I think what happened beginning in around the middle of 2015 is that, as the economy continued to recover and, in particular, as unemployment rates went down, and especially in certain markets where the labor market seemed particularly tight and competitive, we saw that our competitor hospitals were hiring away nurses and physicians, and that wage rates were being elevated and became more competitive, et cetera.", "And I think one thing that became \u2013 I don't want to say it was a new phenomena, but it certainly seemed to accelerate and be at an elevated level was we really began to see acute care hospitals hiring away our behavioral nurses; not that we had never seen that before, but I think we were seeing it at a rate and a frequency and a scope that we had never really seen before and quite frankly, continue to see it. Now, we have responded by adjusting our own wage rates and by doing any number of other things to both attract, and I think, in particular, to retain nurses once we have them hired, but certainly we would characterize the market for both nurses and psychiatrists as more competitive today than certainly it was, I'd say, two or three years ago.", "Unknown Speaker", "All right. Great. Thanks for the color. So, it looks like you guys did make some progress on that front with behavioral health adjusted admissions growing by 3.7% during the quarter, which is better than we anticipated. So, I mean, how do you see the ramp for the remainder of the year and into 2018 for behavioral health adjusted admissions?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, again, I think our original guidance for the year presumes that we would exit the year at about 5% revenue growth rate, which we sort of further broke down to the sort of 3% or 4% volume, and 1% to 2% price. As I suggested earlier, I think we're at a rate in Q2, of about 2.75%, if you adjust for the currency change; which is about 75 basis points from a revenue perspective behind where we thought we'd be in. That, I think, accounts largely for the miss in Q2, as well as for the guidance or the guide down in the quarter.", "But I think our expectation is that we will get to that 5% revenue growth, just maybe a quarter or two later than we expected, and it will either be as a result of, as I said, our being able to impact that length of stay decline where it's clinically appropriate, or from the admission growth, just continuing its upward trajectory, because honestly, that 3.7% admission growth or adjusted admission growth that we saw in Q2, as you suggest, not only is higher than what you expected, but it was higher than what we expected, and quite frankly, it's right at a level that we thought it would take us to the end of the year to get to this.", "So, we certainly have an expectation that it can continue to grow and that the underlying demand will support that growth. And so, we believe it'll continue to trend up at least for the foreseeable several quarters.", "Unknown Speaker", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The question \u2013 the first question I had was, while your \u2013 the provision for that flip-downs look relatively stable, the charity and uninsured discounts, as a percentage of revenue trended up quite meaningfully. Can you give us any color around what's going on there?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, Ana, for those who have listened to our calls for a long time, I'm sure I'll give an answer that sounds familiar although maybe frustrating to those who focus on this. We always say that we really, internally, focus entirely on sort of, the cash net revenue per admission or net revenue per day depending on which division we're looking at, as opposed to individual shifts between charity care and uninsured discount and bad debt expense, which we acknowledge, fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and which we struggle with explaining.", "I think on the acute side, as I already discussed in response to, I think, it was Jason's earlier question, revenue per admission was relatively flat in the quarter. I think that had more to do with mix of patients and lower acuity patients than it did with payer mix, although, I did acknowledge, as many of our peers have talked about over the last several quarters, that we continue to see an uptick in uncompensated patients and a downturn in commercial patients, particularly commercial exchange patients. Those phenomena, however, I think have been present for at least the last six maybe even eight quarters.", "Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "So, there isn't any acceleration in either attrition off of the marketplaces and/or from a macroeconomic perspective and oil-heavy economies that you're seeing more uninsured patients in any accelerated way?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Not, I think, in an accelerated way; I think we've seen that, again, those trends in place now for a while and quite frankly, I think they continue with each passing quarter. But no, I wouldn't characterize that trend as accelerating.", "Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Then on the behavioral side, back to the length of stay, you alluded to Medicaid and then to some degree, private payers; CMS has just come out with a, kind of, an initial suggestion around moving to a different, more value-based oriented behavioral reimbursement, and putting all of that together, do you see this as broader pressure that maybe hard, more challenging to avert even in the back-half of the year in 2018, or is this something that from better negotiations and it's more tactical and it can be brought back to historical?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Look, I think it's hard to say; I don't know that we have a perfect inside into how this length of stay trend is likely to develop. I think that there is sort of a natural tension between payers who would like to see patients discharged earlier and providers, and particularly the psychiatrists who are making that length of stay or that discharge decision, who feel like patients are sometimes being asked to be discharged by their payers sooner than medically appropriate or medically necessary.", "We'll continue to do everything that we believe the clinical record suggests as appropriate, to keep patients as long as our psychiatrists deem is appropriate, but, how those trends develop over time, I think, it's hard for us to say. I will make the point that the length of stay for acute psychiatric patients is already, on average, sort of in the high single-digits, so, changes to them \u2013 and I'm not a clinician, and I'm not going to get into sort of the clinical aspects of this, but changes to what is already, I think, we believe a relatively low length of stay, for patients who are quite ill in many cases, can be, I think, significant and we're going to continue to work with our payers to make sure that our patients stay for the appropriate length of time and get the appropriate amount of treatment.", "Anagha Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Steve, for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Actually just wanted to follow-up on the last point, Steve. When we think about the length of stay pressure, I guess I had always assumed it was more on the longer length of stay at a residential treatment side, but what are you saying it's sort of broad based and you're seeing it even on the acute side at this point?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, I think, Chris, and this may be what's informing your point of view is that back in the 2013-2014 period, when we also experienced a length of stay decline in the behavioral division, we did at that time, describe it as primarily focused on the residential business, our long-term patients, but I think over the last couple of quarters \u2013 and then that length of stay by the way stabilized, I think in 2015-2016. Over the first couple of quarters in 2017, the length of stay pressure that we've been experiencing has really been in the acute side of the business, the acute behavioral side of the business and not on the residential side.", "Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. I guess how much \u2013 you sort of alluded to this, you can get to the 5% target just if you get the admissions growth to a high enough level; but I mean, what is your level of confidence that you guys can sort of affect stabilization and the length of stay versus just the payers backing off a little bit? I think, I guess I'm just trying to figure out how much is in your control versus third parties.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Look. I think that this is a push and pull sort of dynamic, the payers are always pressuring providers for, in our minds, the lowest possible length of stay and again, the ultimate decision, I think, comes down to a question of clinical appropriateness and certainly on our end, that's being made by a treating psychiatrist. We hope that on the payer end, it's also being made by someone with a clinical background who has the best interest of the patient at heart as well.", "It's difficult for me to predict. Obviously, we suggested, or I suggested at the end of Q1 that we would hope to be able potentially to impact length of stay in Q2 if it was clinically appropriate and that really didn't happen. So again, the only point that I'll make is, I think we believe we can get to our revenue guidance number; even if we don't get to it by the end of 2017, we can get to it early in 2018 through some combination of a continued increase in admissions and potentially a stabilizing length of stay number.", "Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay and if I could just slip one more in; on the acute care side, could you give us a sense for what type of revenue growth you're expecting for the second half of the year? And I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, so again, our original guidance on the acute care side was 5% to 6% revenue growth for the year, and as I said earlier, kind of split pretty evenly between price and volumes. At least, that was our original assumption.", "The notion always was, that would be a sort of increasing trajectory as the year went on because the first half of the year comparisons from a revenue perspective were quite difficult, and the comparisons in the second half of the year were markedly easier. And again, I think that remains our projections. I think the acute care performance, as in an earlier question, suggests it was very much in line; and our guidance, and our guidance both from a revenue and an EBITDA perspective, remain the same for the back half of the year.", "Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo with Robert Baird.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hey. Thanks. Steve, just wanted to ask a quick clarification question. The 2.2% same-store revenue growth in the behavioral business is actually 2.8% after currency, correct?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Correct.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That would be the best same-store growth in a year, and you're expecting almost a point of improvement in each quarter in the second half to get you to kind of a 4% to 5% range, is that correct?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think something more in the 70 basis points or 80 basis points a quarter, Whit, you know, is probably...", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "But just over 4%?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That would be the best same-store growth in probably two years. And with that type of growth, you do believe that you can grow your margins year-over-year?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. I think, Whit, if we get to that 4% growth, we should see \u2013 and the model suggests and the historic performance would suggest, we should have some margin expansion at those levels.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Got it. And maybe just an update on capital deployment, how you're ranking priorities and just maybe update us on your joint venture development opportunities; just wasn't sure if there's any developments worth discussing.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah; a couple of different questions, I guess. I mean, from a capital deployment issue, I don't know that there are any sort of imminent opportunities to deploy significant amounts of capital through M&A, but we continue to explore those opportunities all the time. We talked at the end of Q1 about ramping up our share repurchase activity in Q2, which I think the numbers suggest we did, in fact, do. And I think as we think about the model for the balance of the year, we think that our share repurchase will probably be at a minimum at those same kinds of levels as we saw in Q2.", "As far as the joint venture strategy on the behavioral side, those conversations continue to be quite active. I think we've already announced a number of those ventures, including some new hospitals that are being built in partnership with big acute care partners that will open sometime in 2018. I think when we get to the end of the year and we give our 2018 guidance, we'll be more specific about how we expect the joint venture strategy to specifically impact our earnings going forward; but, I will say that the conversations and the continued planning remain quite active on that front.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Got it. And maybe just one last one; wasn't sure if there's any update with the government and the DOJ as it relates to the investigation, just any developments worth sharing. Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "No, I think as we said \u2013 or I said in Q2, in public forums and conferences, et cetera, that it certainly seems to us that the level of engagement with the government, the frequency and the scope of our conversations and contacts have increased over the last few months. We are cautiously encouraged by that and believe that it suggests that we hope, I guess, that we're in the later innings of this process.", "I don't think we are far enough along to be able to, with any level of precision yet, predict a finite outcome or even the timing of such an outcome; but again, I think we remain cautiously optimistic that we're a lot closer to resolution on this process that has been ongoing for, now, close to five years, than we were \u2013 I don't think we necessarily had that same view even as recently as maybe, let's say, six months or nine months ago.", "Whit Mayo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. No, very helpful. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. First, let me follow up on Whit's question there on the OIG, Steve. I know this is obviously a sensitive topic; just curious, I mean, the \u2013 I guess it has been four years you've been receiving requests intermittently. Now, you're saying that the OIG discussions have increased. Can you tell us, have they kind of laid their cards on the table, so to speak, in terms of what their concerns are? And if so, is there anything there, if they have told you those concerns, that you think could have a material impact on your business or do you feel like you have reasonable counter-arguments for most of their concerns?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Look, I think we've suggested for some time, Justin, that we believe that the crux of the government's point of view was that patients were either inappropriately admitted or their length of stay was inappropriately longer than it needed to be, or their clinical treatment was inappropriate. We, I think, have said from the outset that we didn't necessarily share the government's point of view at all and have, I think, made a bigger argument to the government where we've been presented with some of their points of view, which I think has been in a fairly limited number of cases that we had a dramatically different point of view.", "But that's the nature of these investigations and, look, I think, there is some heavy lifting that remains to be done on both sides and, again, I just think that our point of view is, we hope that we're a lot closer to that, to both parties being willing to do that heavy lifting and get to a conclusion than we've been in a while.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Got it. That's helpful and then Steve, the \u2013 my impression is that the \u2013 from a cadence perspective, the behavioral business, I think, you've been saying publicly in those same conferences that behavioral \u2013 this ramp in behavioral revenue looks like it was on track for most of the quarter. It sounds like it must have turned down in June relative to April and May; can you tell us what happened there specifically, and then given it did turn down so late in the quarter, if there's anything you could share with us in terms of how July is looking relative to June, that would be really helpful. Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I think that we did make comments during the quarter that talked about sort of the strength in May, et cetera, which is sort of the implication being that June was weaker than we expected, and we did make those comments because at that point we were in our quiet period. I wouldn't read too much into it. It looks to me like July has bounced back some.", "I mean, I think if you step back, and again, I'm just going to return to sort of the cadence that I talked about, and I think Whit was sort of suggesting in his comments, the admission growth in particular has been on an upswing for the last four quarters and that translates to revenue growth being on that same upswing. And I think we believe that both of those trends are going to continue, albeit probably a little bit more slowly than our initial 2017 guidance implied.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to ask or drill down on that IMD issue, and I'm sorry if I missed this number, but approximately what percent of your acute short-stay admissions now are coming from IMD? We know they were zero a year ago. I'm just curious, what percent of the admissions they recommend and, I mean, excuse me, they represent, and also what the length of stay actual comparison is for Medicaid versus the rest of your book?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, it's difficult to say, John, in the sense that IMD patients, or patients who are coming in as a result of the IMD don't necessarily carry a Medicaid card that says IMD, et cetera. I think we take the point of view that we have seen our Medicaid utilization increase since the IMD exclusion was lifted, and we make sort of, a default kind of \u2013 or we reached a sort of a default kind of conclusion that the increase in Medicaid utilization is a result largely of the IMD exclusion being lifted, but it's difficult, with any precision, to sort of identify the precise number of patients who really are at our hospitals, are eligible to be admitted to our hospitals because of the IMD exclusion, and I apologize...", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "No. Maybe a different way of asking it would be, what's Medicaid mix then in short-stay business? What was is it a year ago? What is it now? How much did it go up?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I don't have those statistics right in front of me. I will tell you that I think our overall Medicaid utilization, which obviously includes traditional as well as managed Medicaid, is in mid-40s, et cetera, for our consolidated behavioral business.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "And what was it a year ago?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I don't have that data, John.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. And on the other part of the question, do you have at least just a directional sense \u2013 I mean, is it 7-day length of stay versus 10? I mean, is it something like a couple of days shorter, or do you have just a directional sense of what the difference is in length of stay?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Do you mean Medicaid compared to our other payers?", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah. Yeah. Correct.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I think the Medicaid length of stay on average in the acute side of the business is probably in that six-day to seven-day range, probably Medicare is in the seven-day to eight-day range, and I think commercial was probably in the low teens, kind of 12-13 days.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And just on another point; you guys continue to carry around a great balance sheet; your cousins yesterday at National (43:18) have stepped up their end-market purchases of acute care hospitals. Are you seeing \u2013 I know you guys are very patient and strategic, but are you seeing more opportunities there? Do you agree with that strategy? And also, on the kind of flipping over to the behavioral side, you know, are you seeing any addiction type assets that are interesting as well? Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. Look John, we've always been interested in the in-market hospital acquisition opportunity. The challenge for that is, we're in a relatively limited number of markets and that means that there are a relatively limited number of hospitals that might be available to us.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Right.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "In the past year, as an example, however, we bought Desert View Hospital in the Greater Las Vegas market, that's in, to be fair, a smaller rural hospital, but one that we think rounded out our presence in that market. We obviously also built the Henderson Facility that Alan has mentioned on several of the calls and it has been doing quite well.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, we continue to look for those opportunities in all of our existing markets whether they're inorganic M&A or organic capital capacity expansion. On the behavioral side, yeah, I mean, there are \u2013 I think the addiction corner of the behavioral market seems to be the sort of, hot, sort of market. We entered that kind of new style addiction business a couple of years ago when we bought Foundations. Part of our thought process when we bought Foundations was that it would provide a platform for us to continue to expand that business and we wouldn't necessarily have to do it through M&A which, we view as relatively expensive. I think most of the addiction assets that have been for sale over the last couple of years seems to be pretty expensive. So, we're growing the addiction business where we think it's appropriate, mostly, I think through organic means.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. I hopped on a little bit late, so, Steve, not sure if you gave the payer mix that's in the quarter. If you haven't, it would be helpful to know sort of what it was on a year-over-year basis as well.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. Ralph, I mean, I think we've talked about sort of the payer mix trends in the two divisions; on the acute side, continuing \u2013 which are all continuing a decline in commercial utilization, an increase in uncompensated, on the psych side, an increase in Medicaid, but I've really not gone into more specifics on that.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And as you look to 2018, can you maybe just talk about the pricing backdrop, your expectation for your sort of, pure managed care rates, Medicaid rates, Medicare rates? And then some of the acuity mix pressure that you've seen over the last couple of quarters, do you think that's kind of a comping-in thing as you don't see those pressures in the next year, you think there's more pressures as you think about sort of the acuity side of the equation from a pricing perspective next year?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I mean, I think that the pricing assumption that we made for our 2017 guidance, which is blended pricing on the behavioral side of 1% to 2% and blended pricing on the acute side of maybe 2.5% to 3%, is probably what \u2013 I mean, again, I'm not about to start to give 2018 guidance at this point, but as I sit here in mid-2017, it strikes me that that outlook at the moment, and things certainly can change between now and the end of the year, but that outlook seems reasonable for next year as well.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. But could you just put that into context? The last couple of quarters obviously is \u2013 particularly on the acute care side, you had negative and sort of flat pricing all-in. So, is there a way to sort of context as we think about next year? From pure rate perspective, it sounds like maybe 2%-2.5%, but do you think there's going to be sort of pressures on either acuity and/or payer mix that's sustained?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, so in response to a previous question, I think it was Joanna from Bank of America, what I said was, I think we were comfortable on the acute side with the assumption of a 5% or 6% same-store revenue growth rate in the acute business; and while we expect over time that that will be split pretty evenly between price and volume, it is conceivable that in the short run, like you saw in the second quarter, it may be skewed more towards admissions if we're getting those lower acuity admissions, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we were comfortable with the overall revenue growth of 5% to 6%.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "We do not; other than to thank everybody for their time, and we look forward to speaking with everybody next quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on Risk Factors, and Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.", "We would like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.", "As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $1.47 for the quarter. After adjusting for the favorable impact from our January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, as discussed in our press release, and the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health record applications in our acute care hospitals, as disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS was $143.4 million or $1.49 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2017, as compared to $157.2 million or $1.60 per diluted share during the third quarter of last year. ", "As mentioned in our press release, our financial results for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2017 were unfavorably impacted by an after-tax aggregate of approximately $14 million to $15 million or 14 - resulting from the following, an unfavorable after-tax impact of approximately $8 million to $9 million or $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share, related to the hurricane expenses and estimated business interruption impact incurred by 28 of our behavioral health facilities located in Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, and our three acute care hospitals located in Florida, and an after tax charge of approximately $5 million or $0.05 per diluted share recorded in connection with a court order in Texas related to certain litigation.", "Generally, our facilities impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, did not sustain extensive property damage, and the vast majority have resume normal operations. However, a portion of the beds at our 124 bed behavioral health facility located in Houston, Texas, remain closed. And although our three behavioral health facilities located in Puerto Rico are operational, these facilities which have 240 beds in the aggregate, continue to operate on auxiliary power in areas that have suffered extensive damage to surrounding infrastructure and properties. It\u2019s difficult to predict the impact that the hurricanes may have on the future operating results of these four facilities.", "On a same facility basis in our acute care division, revenues during the third quarter of 2017 increased 2.2% over last year's comparable quarter. The increase resulted primarily from a 3.5% increase in adjusted admissions to our hospitals owned for more than a year. On a same facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 1.8% during the third quarter of 2017, as compared to the third quarter of 2016.", "During this year's third quarter, as compared to last year's, adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 1.1%, while adjusted patient days decreased slightly. Revenue per adjusted admission increased 1.3% and revenue per adjusted patient day increased 2.6% during the third quarter of 2017, over the comparable prior year quarter. ", "Based upon the operating trends and financial results experienced during the first nine months of 2017, we are revising our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.25 to $7.50 per diluted share from the previously provided range of $7.50 to $8 per diluted share. This revised guidance, which excludes the effect of electronic health records impact for the year, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, decreases the lower end of the previously provided range by approximately 3.3%, and decreases the upper end of the previously provided range by approximately 6.3%. ", "For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our cash provided by operating activities decreased to $878 million from $1.4 billion generated during the comparable nine month period of 2016. The $258 million decrease was caused primarily by a $128 million unfavorable change in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the UK, and a $101 million unfavorable change in the other working capital accounts, resulting primarily from changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of disbursements. ", "Our accounts receivable days outstanding increased to 53 days during the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 50 days during the third quarter of 2016. ", "At September 30, 2017, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 45.4%, as compared to 47.4% at December 31, 2016.", "We spent $156 million on capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2017 and $419 million during the first nine months of 2017. During the quarter, we completed and opened 27 new acute care beds and 135 new behavioral health beds at existing facilities. ", "In conjunction with our $800 million stock repurchase program during the third quarter of 2017, we have repurchased 870,000 shares of our stock at an aggregate cost of $94 million. Since inception of the program, through September 30, 2017, we have repurchased approximately 6.34 million shares at an aggregate cost of $736 million. ", "Earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority provided the final ruling regarding the phase two investigation of our acquisition of Cambian Group PLC\u2019s Adult Services Division in the UK. The final ruling requires us to divest one 18 bed facility which generates less than $1 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The final ruling represents a reduction in the number of divestment sites identified in the phase one decision. ", "We\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from Justin Lake. Mr. Lake, your line is open. ", "Justin Lake", "So Steve, first question is, your guidance appears to imply a pretty steep ramp in the core EBITDA of the company in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And I'm assuming there's about $15 million of drag still in the business from the two psych facilities and the continued hurricane impact to Puerto Rico. So if I look at that, can you tell us, how do you bridge down from 3Q to 4Q? Is t - do you expect a big ramp in the behavioral business? Is the acute going to get better? Help us understand that sequential improvement. ", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Justin. So I think that the way we approach the guidance for the balance of the year was to suggest that the miss that we had in the third quarter and the issues that generally caused that miss, which were I think largely transitory, would however continue into Q4. So to the degree that there was a continuing impact from the hurricane on the four facilities that I mentioned in my opening remarks, that would persist into the fourth quarter, to the extent that we continue to suffer lower than expected results at a handful of behavioral facilities with regulatory challenges. Those challenges will continue into the fourth quarter as well.", "In terms of the ramp in the fourth quarter, I think that we - that was embedded in our original guidance for the year, in our original notions of the trajectory of earnings for the year. And that was the sense that the back half of the year would continue to get stronger, both from a behavioral volume perspective, as well as from a relief on the labor pressures and wage pressures on both sides of the business. So I think it's a combination of those sort of two dynamics that really inform the way that we came up with the guidance for the balance of the year. ", "Justin Lake", "So just to follow up, you're expecting a meaningful ramp from 3Q to 4Q, both in volumes and in some release on wage pressure similar to what you expected before, despite the fact that it didn\u2019t look like it happened in Q3?", "Steve Filton", "I think that's correct. And I think the other issue which I should have mentioned is the sort of continued improvement at the Henderson facility, our new facility in Las Vegas which, at least from a cosmetic standpoint, will be included in the Q4 - excuse, me in Q4 in same store results, which will make the same store results look stronger. And the other point that I mentioned, Justin which I think is just an annually recurring point is there is I think normally a step up from Q3 to Q4 due to just the seasonality of the business. ", "Justin Lake", "Great. Thanks for all the color, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Raskin. Mr. Raskin, your line is open. ", "Joshua Raskin", "Good morning Steve. Maybe just not germane specifically to the quarter, but I'm just curious where you stand as you guys are coming in towards the end of the year with line extension. Maybe on the acute care side, is there any change in appetite around ASCs or maybe free standing EDs or even urgent care centers? And on the behavioral, is there any more focus on substance abuse or maybe other types of clinics in that segment?", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I think on the acute care side, and I think honestly, Josh the answer to these questions, while I think there are some sort of global generic answers I can give, I think that in many cases or most cases, we really do look at these questions on a market by market issue. On the acute side, we certainly acknowledge, as have most of our peers, that there is a continuing trend I think driven mostly by payers to move patients into what they perceive to be the lowest cost setting of care for patients, whether that\u2019s ASC or freestanding imaging centers or urgent care centers or freestanding EDs, et cetera. We have certainly entered any and all of those businesses to some degree in certain markets. We have ASCs in a number of markets. We are building APDs in several markets and have had I think some relatively notable success in the early stages of that. We\u2019ve got freestanding imaging centers, et cetera. We've got physician operated urgent care centers again. And I think we really view it on a market by market basis, but certainly it's informed by, as I said, this global view that payers will continue to look to shift patients to the lowest cost care setting that they can. ", "I think on the behavioral side, it\u2019s a similar sort of notion. I mean we have a very large behavioral health presence with the largest freestanding operator in the country. And I think our continuum of care, both here in the US and in the UK, really spans the continuum of services and includes acute services, residential services, specialty services, addiction treatment services, et cetera. And I think in every market, we continue to look for where there are gaps in service lines in that particular market. So I don't know that on a global basis we're necessarily sort of looking to expand in any of those businesses, but within individual markets, we're certainly doing our best to fill in those service gaps so that in most of our larger markets, we're providing a pretty I think extensive continuum of services. ", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay, great. And then just a second question on the acute care side. It feels like it's becoming a little bit of a buyer's market. There seems to be a lot more facilities for sale than necessarily buyers out there. So I'm curious. You guys have always been so opportunistic. It seems as though UHS has had a really good sort of timing historically around movement of assets. Is the acute care segment more attractive? Are there new markets that you're actually looking at, at this point?", "Steve Filton", "Josh, I think we have been looking at potential acute care opportunities for some time. We like the acute care business and feel like if you can be in an attractive, growing market with a good market position, you can be successful. We believe that certainly we've demonstrated that with our own acute care results. Obviously, I think this has become, as you describe it, kind of a seller's market, to some degree because we've got a number of distressed operators who are looking to deleverage, et cetera. ", "I think our general impression is that the assets that they are selling, at least in these early phases of their divestiture plans, are the less attractive assets. And unless they really provide sort of some in-market synergies for somebody, they're not necessarily all that attractive. And I think most of these sales have been going to other in-market providers. Should that change and should either of these distressed sellers or other sellers, other not-for-profit sellers, begin to sell assets that we think fit, are a better fit for our profile of strong market positions in growing markets, we certainly would be interested because we feel like we've got a proven track record of being able to operate in our own outstanding returns in those kinds of markets. And in the interim, we continue to invest in the acute care business within our own markets, building new facilities and adding capacity where that's appropriate as well. ", "Joshua Raskin", "Perfect. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Fishbeck. Mr. Fishbeck, your line is open. ", "Kevin Fishbeck", "Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could parse out the EBITDA impact from the hurricanes among the two divisions, either - I guess both maybe on an EBITDA basis, but then also maybe from a volume basis. ", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Kevin. So I think on the volume revenue side, we feel like the hurricane impact, coincidentally I don\u2019t think these events, is about the same on both sides of the business and it's probably in that 100 to 110 basis points of volume and revenue, because obviously there's no sort of pricing dynamic associated with the hurricane impact. In terms of EBITDA, we talked about a $12 million to $13 million - sorry, EBITDA impact, I think you're talking about probably eight or so on the behavioral side and four to five on the acute site.", "Kevin Fishbeck", "Okay. And I guess one of the things that is still interesting to me, I guess in response to my earlier question, is that you're still looking at the same kind of rebound and reacceleration in the business. I guess one of the metrics that you wouldn\u2019t expect the hurricanes to impact would be length of stay on the behavioral side. So I just want to make sure that that's right because that seemed to still be a pressure because now the third quarter in a row where that's a pressure. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and why you think that that's not going to be continue to be a pressure on site?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean so I think that in Q3 we did actually see the length of stay decline, diminish from the rate at which it was declining in Q2. So I think sequentially we made some progress. I think our point of view that we articulated last quarter was we certainly feel like there are some things that we may be able to do to impact length of stay where that's clinically appropriate. But then if we couldn\u2019t, that we had a point of view that the underlying demand was strong enough and the reservoir of unmet demand of patients looking to be admitted to behavioral hospitals, was strong enough that we just needed to improve the efficiency of our throughput, so that if beds were being vacated earlier because of length of stay pressure, we just needed to increase the throughput and fill those beds sooner, again always where clinically appropriate. And I think that's our point of view and why I think we had the perspective that this 5% same store revenue growth target that we've essentially set for the behavioral division, because that's what we were running back in 2000 when we started to see some diminution in that number, is achievable. It\u2019s really the confidence that allows us to say that is this the metrics that we continue to see internally that demonstrate a there's a significant reservoir of unmet demand.", "Kevin Fishbeck", "Okay. And then just to follow up on another comment you made before about that the labor pressure is going to improve. I guess what gives you - is there any data points that you're seeing right now that actually indicate that? Because again in general, we're hearing companies talk more about labor pressure rather than less about it, but you seem to be thinking that this is something that's going to get better over the next few quarters. So any color or comment you give us that that's taking place?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean so I think, and it may be - look, I think these trends tend to be relatively market specific. And while I think more companies are talking about it today, I think we were probably one of the earliest companies to really highlight this issue back in the middle of 2015. And honestly it may be a function of being in markets that are faster growing than the national average and that recovered at least at a disproportionately more aggressive pace than the national metrics would suggest, places like Vegas and Southern California and South Florida, et cetera. So I think we have a point of view that's informed by our previous experience with labor shortages that two things happened during labor shortages. One, on a macro basis the market tends to adjust for the labor shortages. More nurses enroll in nursing school, part time nurses take on more hours, retired nurses come back and work extra shifts because wage rates are going up and there's an attractive sort of economic equation for them. So I think we see that happening at a macro level in our markets. ", "But the other issue I think is that because we've been facing this issue now for I think almost two years, and we've been focused on it and we've been addressing it, I think we\u2019re finding that we're making internal improvements in our own markets, both at the rate that we're recruiting mostly nurses but other clinicians as well, and also the impact they were having on the retention of those that we recruit by implementing aggressive mentoring programs and career development programs and providing incentives for our employees, again most notably nurses who come to work for us to really want to stay in our organization and build their careers with us.", "Kevin Fishbeck", "Okay. Then my last question to follow up on that last point. The company specific side of it because I think for the last year or two, you kind of talk mostly about how things normally work out over time, and there hasn't been as many clear cut things. Do you have any more specifics around either how many nurses you're bringing on or what your turnover rate has been as you've made progress on retention?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I mean so I guess a couple of things. I mean I think again on the acute side of the business, I think that the way that the labor shortage was manifested primarily was through margin pressures, that even though our revenues and volumes were quite robust and have been quite robust for the last few years, I think our acute care margins haven't always been where we would have expected them to be, given those revenue growth rates. And I think it's because of those wage pressures. I think that the acute margins have been improving and that's the ultimate. I can give you other statistics about the things you asked about, retention and recruitment rates, et cetera. But in my mind, the proof is in the pudding and it's the margin improvement over time that's really demonstrating our improvement there. ", "On the behavioral side, I think the labor shortage manifested itself in weaker volumes. And for the most part, I think volumes have been, particularly admissions have been increasing for the last year or so. Now Q3 was a bit of a hiccup, but I think that was impacted by a bunch of different things, including the hurricanes, et cetera. But I think generally, we feel like we've continued on this trajectory for the last four or five quarters of improving our volumes on the behavioral side. And again in my mind, that's the proof in the pudding that we're improving that labor situation and filling the vacancies.", "Kevin Fishbeck", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And Mr. Filton, just to let you know that Mr. Miller has joined.", "Steve Filton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You\u2019re welcome. And your next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe. Mr. Giacobbe, your line is open. ", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Good morning. I just want to start on the acute care side, Steve. Even if we add back the hurricane impact, it looks like trends slowed a little bit from the mid and even high single digit revenue you\u2019ve been posting. I think you mentioned some other things to kind of consider. Can you sort of call anything out? And then along those lines, just the acute care pricing, down 0.6, a little bit worse than what we've seen of late from you. Maybe just walk through the dynamics there just around pure price versus payer mix versus acuity mix in terms of where there is disproportionate pressures. ", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I think there's a least several questions embedded in what you've asked. So I'll try to cover them all. I mean one is, in terms of the overall acute care revenue growth, I will just remind everyone that the comparison that we're facing in the third quarter to last year's third quarter, is quite robust. We had 9% revenue growth in last year's third quarter, really an extraordinary number. So it was always going to be a tough comparison, I think on the revenue side. And as a consequence, I think where we landed in Q3 was not far off from where we thought. Obviously, I think you need to adjust the 2.2% revenue growth on the acute side for the hurricanes by 100 basis points or 110 basis points. You\u2019re in the sort of low threes there. I think the only other thing worth noting, and I sort of alluded to it before in response to, I think somebody else\u2019s question was that a little bit of it is sort of the pace at which capacity comes on the acute side. So we opened our Spring Valley tower in Las Vegas last year in the second quarter of 2017. So that anniversaried or that impact was anniversaried in the third - the second quarter of 2017. We opened in \u201916. We anniversaried in \u201917. Just as an example, I think Spring Valley\u2019s revenues for the first six months of the year grew by like 15%. In Q3 they were sort of flattish. Now, that trend will I think kind of reverse itself in Q4 when, as I mentioned, I think to Justin before, Henderson will come into our same store numbers. And I think that will make the same store numbers look a lot better. If you want to sort of normalize all that, you can just look at our total numbers and not the same store numbers. But I think we continue to make pressure.", "In terms of the specific pricing question that you asked, we talked about this a little bit on the Q2 call. I think one of the dynamics that we're seeing that is cosmetically affecting our metrics is that out West in particular in Nevada, in California, we're doing I think a better job of qualifying those short stay patients as in patients rather than observation patients. And the result of that is a higher level of admissions, but a lower level of revenue per admission. Now, I think we have a point of view that over time, our acute care revenue should grow by roughly 5%, 5.5% and it should be split pretty evenly between price and volume. But in the current climate, as I think we're making those changes on the observation status, it's skewed more towards admissions than it is, or more towards volume than it is to revenue. But I think the ultimate dynamic is the same and ultimately will settle in at that roughly 5%, 5.5% growth rate that will be split pretty evenly between price and volume. ", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then you mentioned working capital drag in the UK and DSOs were up a little bit. Can you maybe just flesh that out for us? And as you think about next year, any thoughts or expectations around operating cash flow and CapEx at this point? Thanks. ", "Steve Filton", "So we have hedged our balance sheet investment in the UK from the initial investment several years ago. And generally the way that has worked is as the currency translation rate has declined, we had a cash flow benefit and as it has strengthened a little bit in the recent quarter, the settlement of those foreign currency exchange contracts have a negative impact. So that's what you're seeing in the cash flow statement. In terms of the DSOs, I think that's largely a mechanical issue we have in the UK when we bought the Cambian assets. They had a practice of billing the NHS in advance. And because we converted them to our system and our practice is to bill in arrears, we made that change to be consistent. That created sort of a short term working capital crunch in the UK, but not something that is, in my mind, a significant issue going forward. ", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. And then just the cash flow and CapEx at this point, any thoughts around that for next year?", "Steve Filton", "I mean we'll give specifics when we give our guidance at the end of the year. But I mean I think our cash flows generally should grow at the rate at which our EBITDA grows. I don't see any sort of significant cash flow pluses or minuses going into next year in CapEx. Also I think ought to continue in roughly the same rate that we're running in 2017. ", "Ralph Giacobbe", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Borsch. Mr. Borsch, your line is open. ", "Matthew Borsch", "Maybe I can just pick up on the UK topic and just ask you what you're seeing in the UK market, if you\u2019ve seen any pressures on volumes. And get you had alluded last quarter to that occupancy is actually your challenge there. And wonder if you just update us on that as well. ", "Steve Filton", "Sure. I mean I know that the topic of the UK was particularly intense yesterday given the release of one of our peers. I think it's worth noting, I think everybody knows this, but I'll just remind everybody, that our geographic footprint and presence in the UK is dramatically smaller than our peer who was addressing the issue yesterday. Having said that, I think we have said that our UK facility is operating at fairly high occupancy rates. They continue to do so. Other than specific facility issues, I don't think we have seen any particular pressures or issues with volumes in the UK, nor on the labor side. I mean we acknowledge that the labor market is a tight one in the UK, much as it is here in the US. But labor issues tend to be market specific, just I think as they are here in the US. And we really haven't been experiencing those sorts of accelerating issues in the last few quarters. I will note and I made the comments about the final CMA report in my opening comments, that we're now prepared and are actively integrating the two companies now that we\u2019ll be beyond the CMA process.", "Cambian has always had a history of having great success in the temporary nursing area and the use of registry. They use very little of it. We think they have some real best practices that we'd like to migrate to our legacy Cygnet facilities in the UK. So now that we are going to be able to integrate the two companies, we're looking forward to hopefully even making further improvements in that regard, and if anything, reducing the amount of temporary nurses and registry that we use in the UK, following along the historic success that Cambian has had.", "Matthew Borsch", "And Steve, if I could just on a different topic, as you're looking at the - all the headlines on the ACA exchange enrolment and in light of Anthem\u2019s announcement yesterday of pretty broad, not complete but pretty broad exit from exchanges, how are you thinking about that directionally in terms of impact on your plan for 2018? And is there anything that you can do as it relates to participation in different payer networks that that might make any difference there?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. Look, it's difficult for us, Matt to be terribly proactive in this regard, in the sense that we really don't know in our individual markets what the level of enrollment is in the exchanges or disenrollment, et cetera. So it's a little hard for us to react in advance. Generally we have the view that in virtually all of our markets, there remain viable commercial exchange choices for those who want to enroll. And so that is helpful. I think in terms of network participation, again with very rare exceptions, we are network providers in virtually every network in every one of our markets. So I think we're already well positioned. If there is movement amongst products or amongst companies to be able to benefit from that. so I think at one level, we're just going to have to wait and see from a macro basis what level of disenrollment there is in the exchanges come next year. But I mean in terms of being in all the networks, I don't think we could really do that any more extensively than we currently do. ", "Matthew Borsch", "All right, sounds good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Frank Morgan. Mr. Morgan, your line is open. ", "Frank Morgan", "Thank you. Steve, I was hoping you could give us some detail on the bed expansion schedule over there, what will be coming on in the fourth quarter and what you're assuming for next year. And then secondly, in terms of any other drags on the business end, on the behavioral side of the business, I know there were some issues at a couple of facilities, but any assumption about that continued drag as it relates to guidance for the fourth quarter? And then finally, any details on this court order payment? I was going back looking through the filings and I didn't know which one it relates to. But any color there would be great. Thank you. ", "Steve Filton", "Sure. So I think I'll do it in reverse order. The court ordered issue is old litigation in one of our south Texas facilities literally that goes back 15 or 16 years. A court order came through in the last few months requiring us to make the payment that we disclosed in the quarterly release. We\u2019re appealing that payment and hope to either have it reversed or substantially reduced. But because it was so old and didn't seem terribly relevant to our current operations, we recorded that item in the other segment, not in either of the two operating segments. ", "As far as, I think you were alluding to the behavioral drags, specifically I think I mentioned this again in answer maybe to Justin's original question on the call. I mean we definitely saw a drag in two or three facilities on the behavioral side that are experiencing regulatory challenges. I think they've been relatively well publicized in Oklahoma and in Massachusetts. As we try and work out our issues with the regulators in those states, rectify what they believe are the corrections we have to make et cetera, it's a bit of a double whammy because in the current environment, in the current quarter and quite frankly into next quarter, we expect we'll have a lower than sort of ordinary referral stream and lower than expected volumes. But we're generally keeping our expense structure in place in the hopes that we're going to rectify this relatively soon and will be able to get back to relatively normal operations. ", "So I think what I was saying in response to Justin earlier was that we assume that the drag from those facilities that we experienced in quarter three, would be fairly similar in Q4, but that as we entered into 2018, we would either rectify the revenue side of this and essentially get back to where we were. Or we would have to right size the facilities and adjust our expenses to a lower, a more permanent sort of revenue reduction. So we'll deal with that, but at least in Q4, the assumption was as we continue to work with the regulators in the States in those markets, it will be the same magnitude of result.", "Alan Miller", "And then I think your bed expansion question, which was your first question, we will - it's not always the most ratable sort of thing, but I think we've been adding beds at a pace of about six or 800 beds a year on the behavioral side. That\u2019s certainly been our target, and I think that has not changed for us, and we would expect something along those lines in 2018 as well.", "Frank Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ana Gupte. Miss Gupte, your line is open.", "Anagha Gupte", "Good morning. Steve, wanted to follow up on the behavioral side. So as you point out, it's encouraging that your length of stay pressure hasn\u2019t gotten worse sequentially. I wasn't sure when we met with all of you in September. Given that, and I think your commentary about volume being largely impacted by it sounds like transient issues on hurricane, maybe more seasonality or whatever, what is the timing do you think now of you getting back to that normal revenue growth rate? You had given us an update in the second quarter it being in mid-2018. ", "Steve Filton", "Yes. I don't think that's really changed, Ana. I mean again, I think from the original guidance back at the beginning of the year, the original guidance sort of was premised on the idea that we could get to that sort of 5% targeted same store revenue growth rate in behavioral by the end of 2017. And I think we really changed that view at the end of the second quarter to say now this was now more of a first half 2018 issue, either Q1 or Q2. Again, I think given some of the challenges in Q3, I guess I would conservatively say it's probably now more a Q2 of \u201818 issue. But I think it's all really from our perspective, just elongating the timeframe on an incremental basis rather than changing any sort of fundamental view we have about what the real underlying metrics of the business are. ", "Anagha Gupte", "And on the length of stay, can you tell us and any more color on why it's stabilizing now? It sounds like from all your comments, this is coming mainly from mix shifting to managed Medicaid and managed Medicaid payers putting in a lot of pressure. Has this been kind of a one-time thing because of the IMD exclusion and it then subsides and you kind - your comps get easier so next year you\u2019ll have a flattish number? Is that a fair assessment?", "Steve Filton", "Generally, yes. I mean I think there is - we're talking about a relatively short length of stay for these Medicaid patients to begin with. So I think there is quite frankly almost by definition, a limited amount of downside in terms of how much the length of stay can be reduced without really impacting the clinical outcomes and the quality of care for these patients. That\u2019s number one. Number two is I think, because we're now focused on this issue, I think we're just doing a better job of really documenting the clinical needs of these patients and the need, where appropriate, for them to stay longer where that\u2019s clinically appropriate, et cetera. So I think it's a combination of kind of a natural floor on this issue, as well as our just doing a better job representing the interests of our patients and our clinicians.", "Anagha Gupte", "And as far as - so given that you\u2019re seeing it's a natural floor, do you think you would still need to invoke mental health parity or any other kind of legal routes to pressure them, not necessarily in court? Or is this pretty much something that\u2019s behind you at this point?", "Steve Filton", "No. I think and I think we've said this before, I mean I think we have sort of a menu of options available to us that just range from day to day interactions with the payers and providing them proper documentation, et cetera and extend all the way up as you suggest, to ultimately having to take a payer to court. And obviously that's the last sort of resort that we would try and avoid. But again, I think that we're going to pursue what we think is best for our patients and what our clinicians advise us is best for our patients to whatever degree we have to. And again, I think we would hope that in most cases, that can be mutually agreed upon with the payer, but if we need to be more aggressive, we'll do that as well. ", "Anagha Gupte", "And a final question. Can you give us an update on the regulatory settlement that you\u2019re seeking with the federal and state agencies, and the magnitude of that and timing?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. That\u2019s a slow moving process. It has always been a slow moving process. I mean I think we have expressed a more positive view I guess on our part in the last quarter or two, that the government seems more engaged and more interested in bringing this investigation to conclusion than they have been for a while. But to be, I think realistic about it, I think we're still well into the middle of next year at the earliest before we could realistically bring this to conclusion. We feel like we're working as - on as focused basis and as aggressively as we can on our end to provide the government everything they have asked for and to keep moving this along. And we hope that they\u2019ll respond in a sort of similarly interested way, and have every reason to believe at this point and hope that they will. ", "Anagha Gupte", "Great. Thanks so much, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gary Taylor. Mr. Taylor, your line is open. ", "Gary Taylor", "You've answered almost everything I had. Just last one. On the four Puerto Rico behavioral facilities, do you have annual revenue and EBITDA contribution from those combined facilities?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. Sure. So just to clarify, Gary, I mean I think that it's three facilities in Puerto Rico and one in Houston that has beds closed. But the fundamental question I think, probably on a combined basis, those facilities have annual EBITDA of maybe $10 million or $12 million. So it doesn't seem all that material. But I just want to make the point that in the short run, because I think of a dynamic that I described before where effectively we\u2019ve reduced substantially the amount of revenue we have. We may have increased the expense, but we certainly have reduced the expense. As we sort of wait for the markets to get back to normal and we try and do right by our employees, the drag that those facilities I think could provide over the next quarter, is I think far greater than their actual EBITDA. So I think we have the sense that it could be another $5 million or $6 million drag in the quarter because we've got reduced revenue and not reduced expense. So they're not all that large facilities, but that's why in the short run I think they have an outsized or potentially an outsized impact.", "Gary Taylor", "So you could actually run a loss near term?", "Steve Filton", "Correct. That's exactly the issue.", "Gary Taylor", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Whit Mayo. Mr. Mayo, your line is open. ", "Whit Mayo", "Back to the two behavioral hospitals that you referenced that were a drag in the quarter from regulatory issues, did you actually give the dollar amount that it impacted the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. so - well, I'm not sure that I did, Whit, but I think that number is probably in the 7, 8, $9 million range at the two or three facilities that I think are facing sort of current regulatory challenges. That was the drag in the quarter.", "Whit Mayo", "Got it. And just - sorry, I had a couple of numbers written down here that may be a little inconsistent, but the hurricane drag on a EBITDA basis, that was how much for the behavioral business in the quarter?", "Steve Filton", "Somewhere in that $8 million range.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. So looks like adjusting for those two items, EBITDA would have increased 1.5% or so year over year. So a little bit better trajectory I guess on the underlying business. Is that how you would characterize it?", "Steve Filton", "I think that's fair.", "Whit Mayo", "Yes. And then on - in terms of same store revenue or just admissions volumes, patient days, how did the hurricanes impact the topline for the behavioral segment?", "Steve Filton", "So I think we said that we believe that the impact was about 100, 110 basis points on both volumes and revenue.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. So that would get you to, close to 3% same store revenue. Looks like maybe the highest year over year increase in five or six quarters. So just want to make sure we're looking at this correctly. Maybe my next question just on capital deployment. You bought back some stock. You continue to pay down debt. Leverage is in the low twos at this point. And I know the message has sort of been, doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay down a lot of debt here and we're going to get more aggressive on buybacks, but it doesn't seem like you're getting terribly more aggressive. So just anything to read into this? Just curious on any updated thoughts as you think about the balance sheet and leverage going forward. Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "And I think all the comments that you made which were meant to articulate I think our position remain the same. We do - we are more than comfortable with our current leverage levels. We don't want them to be any lower. We\u2019ll continue to be I think an active acquirer of our shares at these levels. We do try and balance that and manage that against any other external opportunities that may arise. There are not always easy to forecast or predict in a precise way. So there is a bit of a struggle to manage that, but I think otherwise everything else you said about leverage and about the attractiveness of repurchasing our own shares remains true.", "Whit Mayo", "Okay. Maybe one last one and I\u2019ll get back in the queue is, I know you're not giving guidance for 2018 at this point. I mean presumably you're in the midst of the planning process. And I just didn't know if you\u2019re looking at Street numbers and you see any discrete headwinds or tailwinds that you\u2019d like to call out at this point. Just I don't know, maybe just a frame of how you're thinking about the businesses generically next year, just to give us a little bit of help in framing up where we should be for 2018. Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So we certainly are not giving guidance today and will not give 2018 guidance until most likely the end of February, which is our normal practice. But I think I have mentioned already previously in this call, as well as at other times. Our general sense of the trajectory of the two businesses, we kind of believe that the behavioral business will sort of get back to what we would sort of describe as kind of a normalized 5% same store revenue growth rate sometime in the middle of 2018. We think that the acutes, which have been running pretty consistently, at least at the 5% to 6% range, will continue to do so into \u201918. So you can sort of I think presume the EBITDA growth that goes along with that.", "In terms of some of the pushes and pulls that go along with that, some of the special reimbursement items are still difficult to project. We\u2019ll certainly be able to give more precise guidance on that sort of - on those sort of issues as we get closer and as we give our formal guidance. But again, I think we've talked about how we see the fundamental trajectory of the two businesses is pretty candidly and frankly, pretty consistently for a while now.", "Whit Mayo", "Yes. Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ransom. Mr. Ransom, your line is open. ", "John Ransom", "Good morning. Most of my questions were asked, but just a more philosophical question. Hospitals have been moving into the outpatient business for a decade plus. It\u2019s not new. But I just see more rhetoric and I think more awareness from consumers that just because it's outpatient, if it's owned by the hospital, there's a premium that's paid, versus say a physician owned surgery center. A, do you think that's a legitimate criticism? And B, is that something that the industry can address by becoming a bit more sensitive to the elasticity of demand? Because it looks to me like there are emerging - with the freestanding urgent care clinics, with physician and surgery centers, that there are lower cost options out there than what hospitals can do, even though they call it outpatient. Is that something you guys think about at all and is that a legitimate issue to be focused on?", "Steve Filton", "John, I think it's a legitimate issue. I'm not sure, and certainly a lot has been written about consumerism and the consumers making these choices. I think from our perspective, this still largely remains of payer driven issue. And to your point, I mean at the end of the day, payers have a clear line of sight, I think most of the time about where the most efficient and cheapest care is being provided. And we have to be competitive as hospitals to compete with the niche providers who are providing that same care. So I think this is more of an issue with - between the providers and the payers than necessarily between the providers and directly with the consumers. ", "I also believe that as the reimbursement landscape continues to evolve and we move to more bundle payments or ACO payments or even ultimately the capitated payments, the leverage will swing back to the providers, to the hospitals and the physicians who will control more of that healthcare dollar. And when they control the healthcare dollar, I think they'll be able to steer that business back to where they're providing it as opposed to where these niche providers are providing it. So again, this is a slowly evolving and slowly developing dynamic, but I think that's the direction we'll continue to move in.", "John Ransom", "So is it also fair to say that it may be relative to expectations in the early days of the ACA. Have the new age payment structures with managed care, they've been slower to evolve for than you might have expected. And if so, if that's true, then why do you think that is, other than it's just really complicated and payers are bureaucratic and slow to move?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So I think the first part is absolutely true. And again, as I've said in answer to a number of questions already today, look, healthcare I think is very much a local market business and a lot of these trends move at different paces in different markets. We tend to be kind of smaller, probably not a great description, but less developed, less mature I'll call them, managed care market. So I think some of the trends don't develop as quickly in our markets as they do maybe in some others. But yes. I mean look, we've cited for instance the development of narrow networks as something that we generally look forward to and felt like we would benefit from. And we've seen some of that and we've helped engineer some of that in our markets. But it's been slower than we expected. ", "And look, I think your point, John about it being complicated is not something that should be overlooked or taken too lightly. I think one of the reasons why payers are slow to move on these things, and why quite frankly, providers are slow to move is because it is complicated and you do need a lot of analysis and information to make sure that everybody can continue to sort of be viable and prosper when you change the reimbursement landscape in a terribly significant way. So I think it'll continue to evolve, but it will be at a measured pace. ", "John Ransom", "Yes. And just one more on this topic. As you know, of course CMS took a step back on CJR and it's voluntary versus mandatory. How was - is UHS - do you have a uniform approach to this where you might do it in some markets and not in others? Or is it more of a market by market decision? And just kind of where are you on the post-acute bundling of particular hips and knees?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. So, and I think we may have talked about this publicly before, but UHS was actually I think a pretty aggressive early adopter of the bundled payment initiatives and volunteered in many of our markets, if not most of our markets, for the initiatives. I think we felt like we were well positioned, particularly in partnership with our physicians to benefit. And I think for a lot of the reasons that CMS has stepped back in terms of timeliness of information and the sort of fulsomeness of the information available to allow providers to manage through these issues. We, I think we became a little bit disillusioned and sort of disenrolled from a lot of these programs. But I think we've spent a lot of time and focused being prepared for these. And when I think the payers, both the government and the private payers are ready to move forward with them, I think we feel like we\u2019ll be well positioned and prepared to move forward with them.", "John Ransom", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sarah James. Miss. James, your line is open. ", "Sarah James", "I wanted to go back to the comment on resolving the nurse shortage on the behavioral side of the business. So in the past, you\u2019ve talked about bed closures because of the nursing shortage. Can you just remind us what percent of beds were closed or kind of the headwind experienced on admissions from those bed closures? And then the resolution that's coming in 4Q, should we think about that as being all the beds reopening, which I think was the goal you had stated in the past? Or is it a step towards that, but not quite reaching a full reopening of the beds? Thanks.", "Steve Filton", "Sure, Sarah. So I mean I think what we said when this - we first started discussing this problem, which as I mentioned earlier was probably a good two years ago, we. were careful to note that this was really a market specific issue, that there were a half a dozen markets that were particularly difficult for us, maybe 20 some odd facilities. The reason that we don't necessarily sort of give these closed beds numbers or percentages of beds that are closed, et cetera is because I think those who follow the industry like to think of this as sort of a static issue, that there's kind of a number of closed beds at the outset and then you just continue to work that number down. I mean the reality, as you might imagine is, it's a fluid sort of issue and a facility that had a problem is able to solve its problem, but then another facility comes into it. ", "What I said I think in response to an earlier question is, ultimately the way we've measured our progress, particularly on the behavioral side of this, is the continued growth in admissions over the last year or so. The labor shortage was a problem that manifested itself on the behavioral side ultimately and originally through a pretty dramatic decline in admission growth. And I think in our minds, the way that we're able to convince ourselves that we're ultimately solving that problem is through the recovery of admission growth and the rebound in admission growth. And even though as somebody asked before, we certainly track a lot of other metrics like vacancies and turnover and number of nurses in training and orientation. Ultimately the proof in the pudding is, are we able to open these beds and are we able to increase admissions? And we feel like for the most part, we've been able to do that, albeit in an incremental way. The progress has been slow, but we've been able to do it pretty slowly and steadily for the last year or so. ", "Sarah James", "And will you reach the full benefit of the additional admissions in the fourth quarter or should we still think of this as a work in progress?", "Steve Filton", "Yes. so I think, again what we've said is, for a variety of reasons, I think it will take us to the first half of 2018 to get back to the 5% targeted behavioral growth. One of the issues that continues - we\u2019ll continue to work on will be the labor shortage. So I don't think that will be - and by the way, I don't think even when we get to the 5% growth, that it'll absolutely mean that we've solved, if you will, the labor shortage. It will just mean that we've kind of returned to at least sort of a status quo that we were at back in the middle of \u201815 when the problem really began to accelerate. ", "Sarah James", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?", "Steve Filton", "I do not, other than to thank everybody for their time, and we look forward to speaking with them at the end of the year. Thank you.

My name is Angela, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. Mr. Steve Filton, you may begin your conference.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. Alan Miller, our CEO, is also joining us this morning. And we both welcome you to this review of Universal Health Services' results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.", "During this conference call, Alan and I will be using words such as believes, expects, anticipates, estimates and similar words that represent forecast, projections and forward-looking statements. For anyone not familiar with the risks and uncertainties inherent in these forward-looking statements, I recommend a careful reading of the section on risk factors and forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.", "We'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions. As discussed in our press release last night, the company recorded net income attributable to UHS per diluted share of $7.81 for the year and $2.31 for the quarter. After adjusting each period for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the favorable impact from January 1, 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the depreciation and amortization expense associated with the implementation of electronic health records applications at our acute care hospitals, all is disclosed on the supplemental schedule included with last night's earnings release, adjusted net income attributable to UHS increased to $189.6 million or $2 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $176 million or $1.80 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2016.", "On a same-facility basis, in our acute care division, net revenues increased 6.5% during the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to a 7.3% increase in adjusted admissions. On a same-facility basis, net revenues in our behavioral health division increased 1.6% during the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted admissions to our behavioral health facilities owned for more than a year increased 2.5%, while adjusted patient days decreased 0.7% during the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue per adjusted patient day rose 2.9% during the fourth quarter of 2017 over the comparable prior year quarter.", "Our cash generated from operating activities was $1.183 billion during 2017 as compared to $1.334 billion during 2016. Contributing to the $151 million decrease was an unfavorable change of $144 million in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the UK. Our accounts receivable days outstanding remained unchanged at 52 days during each of the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016. At December 31, 2017, our ratio of debt to total capitalization declined to 44.7% as compared to 47.7% at December 31, 2016. We spent $139 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $558 million during the full year of 2017.", "In 2017, we completed and opened 471 new behavioral health beds, including de novo facilities. During 2018, we expect to spend approximately $600 million to $625 million on capital expenditures, which includes expenditures for capital equipment, renovations, new projects at existing hospitals and construction of new facilities. Also, in January of 2018, we acquired the Gulfport Behavioral Health System, a 109-bed behavioral health care facility located in Gulfport, Mississippi.", "In conjunction with our share repurchase program that commenced in 2014, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of our stock at a cost of approximately $101 million or $100 per share. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2017, we have repurchased approximately 7.35 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $836 million or $114 per share.", "Our estimated range of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2017 is $1.758 billion to $1.837 billion, representing an increase of approximately 3% to 7% over the $1.709 billion of EBITDA generated during 2017. In addition, our 2018 guidance range includes an estimated favorable impact on our provision for income taxes and net income attributable to UHS of approximately $142 million to $152 million resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as discussed in last night's press release.", "Our estimated range of adjusted net income attributable to UHS for the year ended December 31, 2018 is $9.25 to $9.90 per diluted share. This guidance range also includes the favorable impact of approximately $1.52 per diluted share to $1.63 per diluted share resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.", "This adjusted EPS guidance range represents an increase of approximately 23% to 31% over the adjusted net income attributable to UHS of $7.53 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017 as calculated on the supplemental schedule included in last night's press release. During 2017, our net revenues are estimated to be approximately $10.92 billion to $11.06 billion, representing an increase of approximately 5% to 6% over our 2017 net revenues.", "Alan and I will be pleased to answer your questions at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Steve, on the behavioral side, can you give us some color in terms of, ex the hurricanes and ex some of the regulatory challenges you're facing at a handful of facilities, what was your view of same-store revenue growth and behavioral EBITDA year-over-year?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Justin. So, we discussed in our third quarter conference call two non-recurring items in the third quarter. One \u2013 and you've referenced both of them, one was the impact of the hurricane or various hurricanes in the third quarter. We estimated that to be about $7 million or $8 million in the third quarter and suggest that that impact would continue into the fourth quarter, largely in our Puerto Rico facilities and, to a lesser degree, in a couple of Houston facilities. And, in fact, we had another sort of $7 million or $8 million drag in Q4.", "Similarly, we discussed, as you referenced, three, what we described as regulatory-challenged facilities in Q3 that amounted to a drag of $9 million or $10 million in the third quarter, and said that it would also persist into Q4. It did. We also said that, by the end of the year, we would resolve those issues. We have resolved those three facilities in the sense that in Boston and in Dallas, we have decided to close the facilities in question partly because we have a broad network of hospitals in those two markets where we think we can treat most of the patients that were being treated at those two hospitals. And then, in Oklahoma, where we have lost a significant Medicaid contract or state contract, we regained that contract as of January 1. So, we're back on a more favorable trajectory in our Oklahoma facility.", "Having said all that, I think when you make the adjustments for those items in Q4, we believe that same-store behavioral health revenue was about \u2013 grew by about 3.5% over last year's fourth quarter and EBITDA was generally fairly flat, maybe just down very slightly.", "Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then, it looks like mix was the key driver of why we didn't see the hope for behavioral same-store revenue improvement on an adjusted basis. Can you give us some color on what you saw there? And then you're two months into the first quarter, any updates you can give us on both volume and mix on the behavioral side and how you see things trending through the first two months of Q1? Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think as the metrics suggest, our admission growth, our behavioral admission growth in Q4 was generally within our expectations. Length of stay, which has been a pressure point at various times during 2017, did pressure our overall volume growth and therefore, our overall revenue growth in the quarter. And I think, Justin, as your question suggests, we believe that most of that pressure was a result of payer mix issues. And when I say that, I really mean just an increase in Medicaid patients and a decline mostly in Medicare patients. And our Medicaid patients generally have a lower length of stay. So, to the degree, we have more Medicaid and less Medicare patients, our overall length of stay will naturally decline somewhat, and I think we saw that in Q4.", "Our expectation is that the underlying demand for our behavioral beds and our behavioral services remains rather strong. We're going to continue to market and focus on all of those who are demanding our services, but especially for Medicare and commercial patients for whom we may have seen some slight decline in business. And that will help restore both the length of stay and the revenue trajectory so that we can get back to this 5% same-store revenue growth target that we have talked about for some time and that we \u2013 our guidance assumes that we'll achieve that sometime in the middle of 2018.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. I apologize if I missed this, but your revenue rebound in the acute care space, clearly, some of those is hurricane related, but the part of it that was not hurricane-related, where was that geographically? Can you talk about that a little bit?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, I mean, again, Peter, when I think you say some of the rebound, I assume you're talking sequentially from the third quarter.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yes, correct.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think when you compare to the fourth quarter of last year, we are getting several benefits in our acute care revenues and EBITDA. One is, and we talked about this a number of times during 2017, a fairly significant turnaround in our health plan operations. That's really more of an EBITDA issue. But in the fourth quarter, there's probably a $15 million, $16 million turnaround in our health plan results in Q4, largely as a result of a very soft fourth quarter last year.", "There's also, as much has been written about and talked about, a very significant flu impact in Q4. And while I think we always find it difficult to sort of absolutely precisely define what the benefit is, I think we believe it probably helped our admissions and our revenues by 150, 200 basis points in the quarter, and probably contributed an incremental $9 million or $10 million of EBITDA in the quarter.", "And then finally, I think as at least one of our peers, Tenet, has discussed at some length, we did have sort of a catch-up California provider tax revenue in the fourth quarter of $6 million or $7 million. So, that's probably $30 million to $33 million of, to some degree, non-recurring EBITDA. Now, again, I think even if you adjust the fourth quarter results, the fourth quarter acute care results for those non-recurring items, it was still a very, very strong quarter. But it's helpful to sort of keep that in mind as you think about what the ongoing earnings power of the segment is.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. And then just one more, if you don't mind. The additional funding for the opioid crisis, some of that's going to be headed towards behavioral health treatment. Have you thought about how you're positioned to capture some of that and what could you capture of that today and what do you think it'll mean for the company over the next year or two?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think it's worth noting, Peter, that we have a well-established addiction treatment business that would include the treatment of patients who are suffering from opioid addiction. Today, I think we would estimate that somewhere around 10% of our behavioral revenues are addiction treatment related. Again, difficult to make it a terribly precise number because so many patients who have addiction illness also have other diagnoses, and these dual diagnosis patients as they're referred to are often \u2013 or they're not always characterized as addiction patients.", "But with 10% of our revenues currently coming from addiction treatment and a comparable number of our beds dedicated to that service, we are, I think, in a good position to respond to the needs of every one of the communities that we service. To the degree that there are more funds available from the government, in particular, a lot of, I think, those funds are being directed towards outpatient treatment, and we've already opened some new outpatient services to specifically respond to that. There are new medically-assisted treatments for opioid addiction that we've begun to pilot and experiment with those as well.", "So, to your question, I think we are well aware of obviously the focus on the opioid crisis and on the additional monies that may flow from the government. I think we're in the very early stage of this, so it's a little hard to know exactly what those monies are going to be for, exactly how they're going to be allocated. But we're certainly very much on top of it and prepared to respond to the needs as they arise.", "Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray.", "Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thank you. So, one topic that's been coming up increasingly is a focus on capital allocation for higher acuity on the acute side and that becoming a competitive environment. Can you talk about how you see UHS positioned? What your plans are for driving acuity mix and how you see revenue per adjusted admission on acute trending going forward?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Sarah. So, I think that \u2013 and this is not terribly new, but I think for some time now, some of the lower acuity procedures that had historically been done in the hospital setting have been moving out and into different and more ambulatory settings and the business that remains in hospitals tends to be skewed towards the higher acuity patients.", "In that regard, I think for several years now, much of our capital spending on our acute care segment has \u2013 particularly within our hospitals has been dedicated to that \u2013 those higher acuity services. We've expanded a lot of our emergency rooms where many of these patients are entering the system. We've expanded our operating room capacity and technology and things like cardiac cath labs, et cetera.", "At the same time, I think we've made an effort to make sure that we're also participating in this trend of moving lower acuity patients to sort of more ambulatory, lower cost settings. And so we've invested over the last several years in freestanding emergency rooms in a number of our communities, in ambulatory surgery settings, outpatient imaging settings, et cetera. We always view health care as a very local business. In every community and every market, it's a little bit different and the needs are different and our responses are different. But effectively, I think we've been trying to target our capital spend to meet sort of those two trends of higher acuity patients remaining in the hospital and lower acuity patients being shifted to more ambulatory settings.", "Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "So putting that all into perspective, how would you see the revenue per adjusted admission trending over the intermediate term compared to where they have been historically?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Look, we have talked about, we're feeling that in our acute care segment, a 5% to 6% same-store revenue growth rate is a reasonable target. Furthermore, I think we've identified an expectation that that revenue growth rate would be split pretty evenly between price and volume. So you're talking about 2.5% or 3% revenue per unit growth in \u2013 on the acute side. And obviously embedded in that number is some of this acuity again, what I prefaced my remarks to you saying, I don't think that this trend towards higher acuity patients in the acute business is necessarily new. So I think it's embedded in the numbers that we're projecting in our guidance for next year.", "Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.", "A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi, everybody. Just a couple of questions as well. First of all, on the outlook for 2018, you just said, I guess, a 5% to 6% same-store revenue growth in acute. Maybe can you give us a flavor for what's embedded in terms of EBITDA growth on a same-store basis in both sides and maybe in the behavioral segment for the year? And is there any other puts or takes that we should remember as we think about laying out unusual items? I know the hurricane, hopefully they won't recur at the same level in the back half of the year, but any other things to highlight?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, A.J. So, I think when we talk about the projections for next year, they are kind of same-store recurring projections as you repeated. On the acute side, I think we're talking 5% to 6% revenue growth, which in our minds translates to 6% or 7% EBITDA growth. On the behavioral side, as I alluded to in my earlier comments, our expectation is that by the middle of 2018, we ought to be able to get to this 5% revenue growth and 6% or 7% EBITDA growth, but that's a ramp up as the year goes on. So, embedded in our guidance is a more blended 3% to 4% revenue growth for the year, maybe 2% to 3% EBITDA growth.", "There are \u2013 we do get the benefit, I think, of some non-recurring items. We talked a lot about them already in answer to the questions about the fourth quarter and in the third quarter. And I think if you go back to the second quarter, we had some additional malpractice expense, and we had some Massachusetts dish (21:38) unfavorable adjustments. I think you can presume that all those items don't reoccur and that's probably in total another $25 million, $30 million of non-recurring items, non-recurring unfavorable items in 2017 that don't reoccur in 2018.", "A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Unfavorable to EBITDA line?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. And again, I will say that sort of offsetting that, and you can see this in the 10-K that we filed last night, is a $30 million reduction in provider taxes year-over-year. So part of the reason I haven't highlighted the sort of non-recurring items, I think they largely cancel out and the same-store results for the most part is what you see flow through.", "A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And then maybe conceptually, you guys have the lowest leverage in the sector, strongest balance sheet, I guess, and you also, as you said in your prepared remarks, you're picking up $150 million of additional cash flow from tax reform. Any thoughts of where we go from here in terms of capital allocation? I know you love to do deals, but it seems like they've been coming pretty slow. You've been active on the buyback, you certainly could be a lot more active if you wanted to, dividends even, some companies you're talking about are accelerating capital projects, what's \u2013 give us some flavor for what you're thinking?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Look, we're extremely pleased that we have as much flexibility as we do with our balance sheet as you have suggested. And obviously the benefit from the tax cuts just enhances that position. UHS has a reputation for being very judicious in terms of how we deploy our capital, both from an M&A and a CapEx perspective. I think we'll continue to do so.", "On the other hand, as we've already talked about a little bit in this call, we're very focused on spending dollars and enhancing our market franchises so that they really can compete across the continuum, whether it's in behavioral or in acute care. We'll continue to do that. As we move into next year, we'll continue to explore all the alternatives, and where it makes sense, we'll continue to be an active acquirer of shares and returner of capital to our shareholders because we think that often that's a compelling deployment of capital for us as well.", "But we're not going to sort of set targets at the beginning of the year or make any firm commitments because it's something that I think we continue to evaluate all the time based on the opportunities that are presented to us. And I think as you kind of alluded to in your question, the most variable of all those metrics are the M&A opportunities. At any point in time, we're looking at generally a series of M&A opportunities, some of which seem attractive, some of which seem compelling, and we often pursue them. And to your point, not a ton has wound up being actionable or executable in the last several years, but that doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to spend times on those that seem worthwhile and have in our minds a reasonable chance of actionability.", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "A.J.?", "A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yes. Hi, Alan.", "Alan B. Miller - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Hi. Steve has covered the waterfront. I don't want to skip the part that we like our stock, and we think it's a good value. And we have been buying consistently, and we're always looking at it.", "A.J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. That's great. All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. Just wanted to dig into length of stay a little bit. It sounds like you're saying that length of stay is under pressure in part because of payer mix shifts, but I want to understand why you're seeing those payer mix shifts. Is it because fundamentally the Medicaid business is just seeing more demand growth because of things like IMD et cetera or do you think you're somehow losing market share in commercial and Medicare, just some status on that.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, actually I think in some respects, Kevin, you answered your own question. I think that we are seeing more Medicaid patients because the IMD exclusion has been lifted and because in any number of our facilities we can now be reimbursed for adult Medicaid patients for whom we were unable to be reimbursed for many, many years. So, that I think has contributed to the surge in Medicaid patients to a degree.", "I think that there is a lot of competition for some of these other payer classes like Medicare and commercial, both with other freestanding facilities and also with acute care hospitals who operate behavioral units. One of the things that we have focused a great deal on is the idea that a number or many Medicare behavioral patients also have certain physical or medical surgical ailments, and payers sometimes and patients and families presume that they can be better treated in an acute care setting.", "We've focused very much on an ability to treat those kinds of patients, or at least a subset of those kinds of patients, in our behavioral freestanding facilities as well. So, we're very focused on treating those elderly behavioral patients who also may be medically compromised. I think that there's been increased competition for those patients. So, I think it's a function, again, as you suggested in your question, of both just an increased flow of Medicaid patients because of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, and an increased competition for some of those other patients, particularly Medicare patients, amongst all providers.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "In the past, you talked about getting to that 5%, 5.5% range, and then when length of stay started to pressure, you kind of said, well, we can still probably get there. We just need to accelerate admissions more. And we really haven't seen admissions really accelerate, obviously, to close the gap. That would be necessary to get to that 5% to 5.5%. So it sounds like you're saying that at least in the short term, there's some pressure from competition. I mean, how do you think about that ramp to 5%, 5.5%? And if length of stay continues to be flat or down a little bit, where is the biggest opportunity to kind of see that acceleration from here in admissions?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean \u2013 and I'm not sure that I wouldn't characterize the trend a little differently than you, Kevin. I think we saw our admissions decline fairly precipitously back in right around the middle of 2015. We largely attributed that decline to labor shortage and a shortage of clinicians, mostly nurses, but to a lesser degree, psychiatrists in some markets. We spent a good year or so addressing that issue and I think began to really make progress on filling many of those vacancies in the middle of 2016.", "And I think if you go back, you'll see that actually admission growth from about the middle of 2016 to the middle of 2017 really did increase pretty ratably and steadily, which I think, now, I think, is where your question is more valid. It stalled a little bit in the last couple of quarters because of this length of stay pressure. I think what keeps us or why we remain confident is that when we look at the number of patients that are being presented to our facilities, who sometimes we're unable to treat, either because we don't have all of the clinicians we need, or we don't have all the beds we need, or because they're medically compromised, as I was recently just alluding to, I think we think the demand is there, and that's why we continue to talk about being able to get to that 5% number.", "Now, again, I'll be the first to acknowledge that this has been kind of a greater slog and has taken more time than we originally anticipated. But I think we believe firmly that the underlying demand remains strong and is sufficient to get us back to that 5% growth.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, this is still a labor issue in your view. If you had enough staff, you'll be seeing a lot more volume than you're seeing right now.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think it's a combination of issues. I think it is a payer mix issue, as I suggested. It is still in a few handful of places. It's a labor issue. It is in some places a physical bed and physical capacity issue. And finally, in some cases, it's a sort of the ability to treat certainly medically compromised patients. So, I wouldn't say it's a single factor.", "Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.", "Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. First question is just, it's been a while since we saw one of the behavioral health acquisitions and we see Gulfport now. And I'm just curious was, are you seeing a change in pipeline? I know you mentioned already that the M&A is the least certain of the capital deployment areas. But have you seen any change in trends there? Is the pipeline a little bit more robust or less robust at this point? I'm just curious on the behavioral side.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, obviously, we \u2013 again, I think sometimes you have to take a step back when people say that the acquisition pipeline and activity is really slow. And I mean, we did the Cambian acquisition in the UK just a little over a year ago. That was a fairly significant acquisition. In the U.S., we've talked about the fact that we've been very focused on these integration or joint ventures with acute care hospitals and integrating with them and penetrating their behavioral businesses.", "We have in our 2018 plan and embedded in our guidance is an opening here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, of 126-bed hospital that we're building in partnership with a not-for-profit hospital. That'll open at the end of the second quarter. We have a hospital in Spokane opening at the end of the third quarter, a 100-bed hospital in partnership with the Providence system out in the Greater Seattle market. And then, the Gulfport deal that I mentioned in my remarks is a similar sort of deal. I mean, that's an acute care hospital that we began talking to. And in that case, they simply decided to sell us their behavioral unit.", "So, we have a great many of those conversations continuing to occur. And we think that's a fairly lucrative aspect or avenue of growth for the behavioral business although one that we concede sort of, again, progresses rather slowly as these not-for-profit hospitals are fairly deliberate in their decision making. But, I think, the three projects that I outlined are good examples of how this is sort of coming to fruition and will continue to come to fruition for a number of years to come at this point.", "Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC", "Got you. And that's part of the targeted bed openings that you guys have talked about, right?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Correct.", "Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC", "Okay. Got you. And then just lastly, on your share buybacks, is there a magnitude in guidance for 2018? Did you put any in there?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. I think in our guidance, we presume that roughly half of our free cash flow will be dedicated to share repurchase and the other half to sort of undesignated M&A opportunities.", "Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC", "Okay. All right. Perfect. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to just ask about the Henderson facility that came into the kind of the same-facility base in the quarter. If you could just sort of break that out and let us know how much that contributed, that'd be helpful? And as part of that question, I'm hoping to sort of understand how long that tailwind might last? So what does the ramp period typically look like for a new hospital in your minds and if you have an estimate for sort of the productivity of that facility today relative to kind of a mature state, and how long you think it would take to get there, that kind of thing, that would be helpful for us.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure, Steve. So I would say that a typical acute care hospital opening, new opening, probably takes close to 24 months to ramp to call it maturity. I know Alan, in particular, has talked about how over the last few quarters Henderson has ramped beyond our original expectations. I think that's fairly typical of the new hospitals that we've opened in the Las Vegas market over the last 10 years. It's just such a vibrant market and such a strong franchise from our perspective that those hospitals tend to ramp.", "So Q4 of 2017 was the fifth quarter of Henderson's short life. And they're ramping pretty close to, I would say, maturity which in this case, I think, is measured in comparison to how our other hospitals in the market operate. We don't disclose the profitability of individual hospitals, but I will say that Henderson continued to grow in the fourth quarter. It was probably \u2013 contributed another $6 million or $7 million to our acute care EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter. I think there's another $5 million or $10 million tailwind from Henderson in 2018 as it continues to mature, but because it has ramped up so quickly, I think much of that benefit is already embedded in our results.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. That's helpful. And just one on the guidance. It looks like the EBITDA margins at around the mid-point is about flattish. Could you just give us a flavor for kind of the puts and takes in that?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, I guess I would need to look at it more carefully. I mean, I think that the reality is we're expecting EBITDA for our operations to grow sort of in the low-single digits, and then we get some benefit from a lower share count. So, I think that's how you get to that sort of mid-single digit EPS growth for us.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "I was thinking about the EBITDA margins just year-on-year kind of...", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Oh, EBITDA margin.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Yeah.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. And I think that's largely a function of the continued ramp up of the behavioral business. So, if \u2013 as I, I think in answering A.J.'s question before, talked about behavioral revenues growing at 3% or 4% and EBITDA growing at 2% to 3%, their margins are actually contracting a little bit. The acute margins are expanding a little bit, and that's, I think, you get those flattish margins. I apologize. I wasn't focused on the margin question.", "Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Understood. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I'd just like to come back to the question around the interplay of the payer mix. The capacity that you have through the de novo build out and the staffing and clinical adds versus the competitive intensity, so is this \u2013 what you're saying right now that you are turning away Medicare patients in favor of the Medicaid influx because you don't have capacity or is it that the Medicare patients that are going to other freestanding facilities or are the acute care facilities almost just keeping the good ones, I don't know, good is relative, but the higher price, higher length of stay Medicare patients for themselves, while sending new adult Medicaid from ER on the Friday night.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "So, Ana, I mean I don't know that it's possible for me to be terribly more precise than what I've said before in the sense that we certainly know a great deal about the patients that are coming to our hospitals. We don't necessarily always know exactly what patients are going elsewhere and what other hospitals or hospital systems in the marketplace are experiencing vis-\u00e0-vis market share, et cetera, especially in real time necessarily.", "So, as I tried to sort of answer Kevin's question, I think we're seeing a surge in Medicaid patients because of some of the changing dynamics in the regulatory landscape. One of the challenges that we have is that we're a business that receives our patient demand effectively and satisfies it in real time. We're not scheduling patients for admission the way a hotel is or the way an airline is or even quite frankly the way an acute care hospital might schedule its elective patients. Most of our patients are being presented to us on an emergency basis day to day, and it's a little bit harder to manage demand in those settings.", "And I think what I \u2013 again, I'm not sure I can be any clearer than I was with Kevin, but to say we're seeing more Medicaid patients and because of some challenges whether that's now the lower length of stay or more competition for those other payer classes like Medicare or clinician shortages or capacity shortages or medically compromised patients, all those factors are sort of contributing to the challenge of both managing payer mix and managing overall volume. But I think we remain confident that the underlying volume remains quite strong in the behavioral business.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. Just asking another way, would the 2.5% adjusted admissions growth ramp up for 2018 from 1Q on and are you seeing that ramping up, and any color on 1Q, perhaps if you can give us \u2013 as you bring more staffing capacity and capacity on stream, should we expect the adjusted admissions itself to go higher and then length of stay and pricing can do whatever it's doing.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. It's difficult to predict and project particularly this early in the quarter. I know it doesn't necessarily seem so early on March 1, but obviously, all we've seen for February are volume numbers, which quite frankly look fairly encouraging. Behavioral volumes look strong in February. I think the year got off to somewhat of a slow start on the behavioral side. I think a severe weather, winter weather in a lot of our markets curbed some of our demand, particularly on the outpatient side. But February volumes look strong. But to be absolutely candid, I haven't seen any information on February payer mix or service line mix. And so, it's very difficult for me to comment on any sort of outlook for the first quarter beyond that, and obviously we still have March to go as well.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. So, thanks for that color, that's very helpful. Just moving to the UK knowing I know it's small for you, but there has been talks from the peer around a shift in local governments and some \u2013 that demand going to the competition and others perhaps, I don't know whether they're getting treated or is it kind of creating a pent up demand situation. Can you give us any color you're seeing at all in UK on the census?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Well, I think it's worth reinforcing your first comment, which is that our footprint in the UK is extremely small in comparison to our public company peer. And therefore, I'm not sure that our experience is necessarily indicative or their experience is necessarily indicative of ours. I will say that 2017 was largely a transition year for us.", "As I mentioned in a previous response, we did the Cambian acquisition at the very end of 2016 and spent most of 2017 working with the CMA in the UK on the outcome of that acquisition and what facilities would have to be sold. We were very pleased with the outcome of that process. We had to sell a single facility with less than a $1 million of EBITDA. And so, I think we felt like that work and that interaction with the CMA was worthwhile.", "But part of the outcome of that process is we were not able to combine our two businesses really until very late in 2017. So, we really weren't able to share best practices or achieve any synergies, et cetera. So, I think for us, 2018 will be a much better gauge of what we can do in the UK. Look, we would acknowledge that like in the U.S., it's a tight behavioral market, but I think Cambian in particular has had historical success at really minimizing the use of temporary nurses and registry. And we're hoping to use their best practices in our legacy facilities.", "And I don't know that we've seen the same pressure on our volumes that our public company peer has seen. And, again, we're in a much smaller number of markets and in different markets. But I think we've said pretty consistently, we haven't necessarily experienced those same issues.", "Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC", "Got it. Thanks for the color, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. Steve, when you said 471 behavioral beds, was that a 2017 number or a 2018 number?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "That was a 2017 number.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And did you tell us what you're contemplating for 2018 at?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I didn't. I will tell you that I think that number is probably a little bit higher, maybe in that 500 to 700 range.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And what will you spend on that to do that?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I think, on average, a new behavioral bed is probably in that $250,000 a bed range.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Obviously, it's dependent on where they are, et cetera, but I think that's a good average.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And are those all add on to existing facilities, new facilities? Are any of these in some of the JVs you had talked about?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. So, like the two facilities that I mentioned before in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Spokane would be included in that number.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "And then, I think the bulk of the rest would be bed additions at existing facilities.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Last question, can you talk a little bit about what you're budgeting in terms of labor costs for both segments?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "I think we have the view that labor inflation in both businesses is probably in that sort of 3%, 3.5% range. I think the focus, which is a little bit different in each of the business segments, I think on the acute side, their main challenge, as a result of the labor shortage, has been increased use of what we describe as premium pay, the use of temporary nurses, the use of overtime. We've seen that number come down considerably in 2017 and our projections, I think, presume that it comes down more in 2018.", "On the behavioral side, the issue has been not so much labor inflation as much as it's been a difficulty in filling all those vacant positions. Again, I think, as I've already mentioned, I think we made a lot of progress in 2017. I think we presume that we'll continue to make more progress in 2018 and all that's incorporated, I think, in our guidance.", "Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citigroup.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go back to the pricing side. It remains a little bit soft in the quarter. I know there was some acuity due to the flu, but California provider maybe should've helped balance that. So, I'm just trying to get a sense, is it payer mix, pure rate or something else that's kind of causing the drag? And as I look at 2017, it's been flat to down. So, just trying to understand kind of the visibility around that 2% to 3% embedded in for 2018.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. And, again, I think you've addressed some of it yourself, Ralph. I mean, I think that the surge in flu patients tends to really sort of drag down that revenue per unit. I think as most people understand, flu patients tend to be lower acuity, lower revenue per unit patients. And if we add 150 or 200 basis point of an increase in volume due to those patients, it has a pretty impactful impact or effect on that revenue per unit calculation.", "We've been saying for some time, however, that there's also been pressure on payer mix. I don't think this is terribly new or different in Q4. But for a number of quarters, maybe a couple of years now, I think we've continued to \u2013 really, I think since the ACA was fully implemented, we've continued to see the number of uninsured patients sort of gradually tick up every quarter, the number of Medicaid patients go up and the number of commercial patients come down. And I think that trend continues into Q4.", "And then finally, we've talked a fair amount in the last few quarters about the idea that, particularly, in some of our hospitals on the West Coast, which, in my mind, includes California and Nevada, we've seen a shift in very aggressive behavior on our \u2013 the part of our payers who have been very aggressive about categorizing our acute care patients as observation rather than inpatient patients. That behavior has been moderated some and we're seeing more of those patients being admitted. The cosmetics of that are our admissions go up and revenue per admission goes down because, again, they tend to be the lower acuity patients.", "So I think all of those factors contribute to sort of the dynamic that you see in the quarter, which is very strong admissions, driven by the flu, driven by this sort of shift back from observation to inpatient, et cetera, but it drives down the revenue per unit. I think in a more normalized sense and over time, we see revenue per unit and admission growth to be more comparable each in the 2.5% to 3% range.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just want to talk a little bit about the competitive backdrop in the acute segment within your markets. Whether you think that's sort of more just a gauge around growth in the population? Is it \u2013 do you think you're just gaining market share? Are there may be closures in your markets? Just trying to get a better sense as you sort of look at the results of the sustained and what seems to be pretty outsized volume results, both versus peers and industry even trying to tease out some of the dynamics that you talked about in terms of observation, visits and the like?", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Sure. I mean, look, I think it's worth noting that the trends that you're asking about, Ralph, have been in place for quite some time and we've been outperforming our peers for a number of years now. And quite frankly, I think if you go back to pre-recession periods, we were outperforming our peers generally. And I think it's mostly about the markets that we're in. The markets that we're in tend to be growing faster than the national averages. We've had a long time \u2013 for a long time, we've had a slide in our investor presentation which has indicated that our markets are projected to grow at often twice the rate of the national average, and so we clearly benefit from that.", "But then it's that sort of double whammy, if you will, of enhancing the franchises within those growing markets. So, Las Vegas is a perfect example where the market itself, with the exception of a few years before the recession, but the market itself has been one of the most robust and fastest growing markets in the U.S. for several decades now. We benefited from that, but we've also benefited by building new capacity, by increasing our market share in the market very considerably, et cetera.", "And obviously, while Las Vegas is our single largest market, I think that pattern has been repeated by us in a number of other markets, including Riverside County, California, including in the District of Columbia, including in several of our Florida markets. So, again, I think that that pattern has repeated itself and is really what has benefited our acute care performance.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And if I could squeeze one more in. I know you talked about capital deployment, I may have missed it. What about a more meaningful dividend? Specifically any thoughts or comments around that as well. Thanks.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, we didn't \u2013 I didn't specifically address that in my previous comments, Ralph, but I think that everything is on the table and the company is open to and willing to look at a lot of different alternatives. As you know, tax reform only passed a couple of months ago and so, a lot of this deliberation and analysis is still ongoing and still in the early stages.", "Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions, sir.", "Steve G. Filton - Universal Health Services, Inc.", "Okay. Well, we thank everybody for their time and I look forward to speaking to everybody at the end of the first quarter.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's fourth quarter and year-end conference call.
