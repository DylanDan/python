And we refer you to the Appendix in the presentation materials available on our Investor Relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information.", "I will now hand you over to George again to take you through the numbers.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Gerald.", "Our performance this quarter was in line with our expectations despite challenging conditions in a number of our markets. We were particularly pleased with growth in U.S. pharmacy volume and market share as the early benefits of our new pharmacy contracts started to come through.", "We continue to work hard to secure regulatory clearance for the Rite Aid transaction and we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2017. So now let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter.", "As we expected, currency again had a negative impact, the U.S. dollar being around 16% higher versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year. Sales for the quarter were $29.4 billion down 2.4% versus the comparable quarter.", "On a constant currency basis, sales were up 0.9%. Without the extra day in February last year, this would have been up 2.2%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 20.5%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion up 14% and diluted EPS was $0.98 up 15.3%.", "Adjusted operating income was $2 billion down 4.9% and constant currency was down 2.7%. We estimate this would have been broadly flat taking into account the leap year impact. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.5 billion, up 3.7% and in constant currency up 6.2%.", "Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.36 up 3.8% and in constant currency up 6.1%. The adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen was 23.7%. This was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to reduced estimated annual tax rate associated with our current year pretax earnings, an incremental discrete tax benefits.", "Year-to-date the tax rate on the same basis was 24.5%. For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2017. I will not go through this in great detail but you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.94 up 3.7% versus the same period a year ago.", "Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $2.46 up 5.1% and up 7.7% on a constant currency basis. So let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA.", "Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $21.8 billion, up 1.5% over the year ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 2.4%. As 2016 was the leap year, when we calculate comparable sales and prescription figures, we exclude the 29 February, 2016.", "Adjusted gross profit was $5.9 billion down 0.6% over the year ago quarter with the impact of the extra day in 2016 holding back growth and adjusted gross profit by over 1%. Lower retail gross profit was partially offset by an increase in pharmacy.", "Adjusted SG&A was 20% of sales, an improvement of 0.1 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was improved versus comparable quarters for 15 consecutive quarters.", "As a result of the lower adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin was down 0.5 percentage points of 7.1% resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion down 4.9%. So now let's look in more detail at Pharmacy.", "U.S. Pharmacy total sales were up 3.7% mainly driven by increased retail script volume. We filled 246.7 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 5.9%.", "On a comparable basis for stores which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 4.2% with scripts filled up 7.9%. This was the highest quarterly growth rate in more than seven years and was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and strategic pharmacy partnerships which we announced last year. We are pleased both with the progress of Medicare Part D an early indications of the benefits derived from our new pharmacy contracts.", "Within sales volume growth and brand inflation was partially offset by reimbursement pressure which was in line with what we had anticipated and by the impact of generics. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.4%, up approximately 100 basis points over the year ago quarter.", "Total retail sales were down 2.7% on the same quarter last year. This includes the impact of previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations and the impact of the leap day in the prior year. Comparable retail sales were down 0.8% in the quarter and what was a challenging environment. The claims in the consumables and general merchandize and personal care categories partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness and beauty categories.", "Adjusted gross profit was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to the decline in sales. Despite the difficult market conditions, we were pleased with growth in our key categories. This was reflected by our absolute performance, as well as recent market share gains.", "Based on the latest Nielsen data for the 13 weeks ended 25 February, we gain share in the health and wellness, beauty and personal care categories. However, we know there is more to do and after taking further actions to help drive future performance. These include simplifying our product offering, further emphasis on our omni-channel capabilities, and expansion of our beauty differentiation program.", "While still early in the journey, our own brands are performing well and currently represent over 15% beauty sales in our beauty differentiation stores. We have now recruited beauty advisors across more than 1800 stores which is helping to drive No7 sales and gross profit.", "Repurchase levels of No7 products are been very encouraging and Soap & Glory has also got off to a good start. Following the successful introduction of No7 and Soap & Glory, we are planning to introduce another of our own brands Botanics, into our existing beauty differentiation stores in the next six months.", "Looking ahead we are now developing plans to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar year. So next, let's look at the progress of our cost transformation program.", "In our previously announced cost transformation program, we set ourselves an ambitious target of delivering $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. I'm delighted to announce that we achieved this target ahead of plan. We now expect that the cumulative pretax charges associated with this program will be approximately $1.8 billion. This is in line with our expectations with an expanded program was announced in April 2015.", "These costs are higher than we anticipated in October primarily as we now expect to close around 60 more stores. The program will be completed as expected by the end of fiscal 2017 and the full benefits will be realized in future periods.", "We continue to expect but approximately 60% of the program costs will be in cash over time, the principle items being future lease obligations. So now let's look at the results of the retail pharmacy international division.", "Sales for the division were $3.1 billion, down 1.9% in constant currency again impacted by the leap year. Comparable store sales decreased 0.9% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales were down 3.7% on a constant currency basis due to decline in the U.K. which is partially offset by growth in other markets.", "In Boots U.K. comparable pharmacy sales were down 5.2% mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.6% reflecting Boots growth in the U.K., Republic of Ireland, and Thailand.", "Within the U.K. Boots comparable retail sales increased 0.7% versus the year ago quarter supported by solid December trading. Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 4% in constant currency to $1.2 billion mainly due to lower pharmacy margins in the U.K. reflecting the reduction in funding and the impact of the leap year - leap day in the prior year.", "Adjusted SG&A in constant currency dollars was flat versus the year ago quarter. However adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was 0.6 percentage points higher of 31% as a result of the largely fixed cost elements of the cost base.", "Adjusted operating margin was 7.8% and 1.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $242 million, a decrease of 16.7% again in constant currency. So now let's look at our pharmaceutical wholesale division.", "Sales for the division were $5 billion up 0.6% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Growth was held back by the sale of Alliance Healthcare Russia in March last year and also by the leap year. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 5.2%. This was behind the Company's estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales. With challenging market conditions in Continental Europe partially offset by growth in emerging markets and the U.K.", "Market growth is particularly strong in certain emerging markets due to the timing of price increases. Adjusted operating margin which excludes ABC was 2.9% up 0.2 percentage points on a constant currency basis.", "Adjusted operating income was $226 million up 59.4% in constant currency. Excluding the $79 million and adjusted earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 8.4% in constant currency reflecting procurement and cost benefits.", "Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.9 billion. During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $1.4 billion. This reflected our seasonal reduction in inventories, as well as an improved receivables position.", "Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $261 million. This was lower than in the first quarter mainly due to phasing. As I said last quarter, we continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and U.S. beauty program, as well as the upgrades to our IT systems which we have previously talked about.", "This resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.6 billion. Today, we announced a new share repurchase program of up to $1 billion in this calendar year with the flexibility to do this due to the changes to the pending Rite Aid transaction announced in January.", "So turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we have maintained guidance and continue to expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.08. Remember our guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year and no material accretion from Rite Aid or from the new strategic alliance with Prime announced on Monday.", "So I\u2019ll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George.", "So, as you have seen we have once come to you with quarterly results pretty much in line with our expectation. However, the drivers behind the results given depending on where we are with the development and continual transformation of our businesses, but we have many different levers to pull to fine tune the company and that is our some confidence in our ability to deliver solid financial performance.", "This quarter much of the most visible work we are reporting have been in driving efficiency within the company further improving the cash flow from the businesses and the cost factor. We are doing this while we continue to operate as likely and efficient balance sheet as we work to complete our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid.", "Even in the balance sheet however, you can see the signs of our drive for constant improvement. We are returning an element of value to the shareholder through our new share buyback program without undermining our intention of profitable leverage the company following the closing of the proposed Rite Aid acquisition.", "The U.S. Prime pharmacy market is performing very much, as we believe it would. Pricing pressures are increasing. Further rest the steady and our relenting volume growth in the use of medication. To meet these challenges, we believe that collaboration and corporation is vital. It is vital across healthcare system as a whole and between all the components of Rite from the regulators to the individual pharmacy who serve their communities every day.", "We have proved time-and-time again that by shaping our business to anticipate and address what is clearly identifiable trend, we can operate growing and thriving businesses in this environment. As we grow and develop our company, we seek to ensure whether the structure and nature of our business is properly aligned with the needs of the market.", "In this we will never do anything that we are not convinced if in the long-term interest of our shareholder. If we do not believe this to be the case we will not do it. A very good example of our commitment to working in partnership is our strategic alliance with Prime. This puts in place a new pharmacy contract between our two companies and brings together our central specialties and mail order businesses, infrastructure in which we have just over 50%.", "It is designed to improve our scale and competitive position in our service, competitive pricing and improved market access. Relationship like this are about more than just improving what we have today, they can create an entirely new set of opportunities for us to approach the market, achieving more together quicker than either of us could do alone and in a structure that has ensured we both benefit fairly as a result.", "While this will not have a significant infrastructure on our adjusted earnings per share this fiscal year, it is benefiting our volume and sales and as we integrate this business over time we believe it will benefit our adjusted operating income. Equally important, it establishes a strategically beneficial alliance to deliver future growth by better addressing the needs of a changing market.", "Since the announcement our strategic alliance has already contributed to Prime winning two significant contracts which demonstrates how well it is being received by the market. And we are addressing some of the legacy business issue in Walgreens and are seeing a script volumes return, we are in a much better position to begin to address the operational challenges which market demands will continue to place upon us.", "The retail market in the U.S. has it's own economic and the competitive pressure. There is no doubt that it is harsh and unforgiving economic climate in which to be reviewing and updating a retail offering, but we are making progress.", "You have heard George talk about the early indication of success in our strategy for beauty of using our strategy and brands to differentiate our trend. The growth we have seen in the health and wellness and beauty category sales and underlying margin in our stores is encouraging.", "Our decision to expand the beauty differentiation of strategy reflects the positive response we have heard from our customer. With revolution of our Walgreens beauty offering, we expect to see leading surpass the beauty brands sowing in path of the growing range in our store. Of course our work in beauty is only part of the changes we intend to make to change and enhance this retail mix and offering record outdoor.", "This work is mainly simple, not quick as we do it we must constantly monitor each individual change, carefully balancing the space and location of each product needs, and the overall customer experience. There are however plenty of example of how successful this can be if you get it right.", "Turning to Rite Aid, I am still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion, but there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected. We are constantly and currently cooperating with FTC, Rite Aid and Fred's to get the necessary approval and close the transaction.", "At the same time we are working to be in a position to certify compliance. We believe that we can achieve these in the coming weeks and we are still working towards our revised timetable to obtain a clearance by the end of July. The changes to the bill that we agreed in January demonstrate our absolute commitment to ensure all transactions that meet our demanding financial and strategic requirement, while allowing us the ability to address any reasonable demand that may be made for us in obtaining regulatory approval.", "In terms of guidance as George said, we are reiterating our estimate range for the full fiscal year. Looking to the second half and beyond, there are some big challenges ahead and there's a lot of hard work but a huge amount of opportunity. Overall therefore we have confidence that in our ability to continue to generate and capture true value for our shareholder for this year and beyond.", "Thank you. Now I will hand you back to Gerald.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, Stefano. We will now open the lines for questions. Vince?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Robert Jones", "Great, thanks for the question. Given the really strong same-store script comp this quarter, that's 7.9% you guys highlighted, can you share any thoughts on maybe why you didn\u2019t see a stronger corresponding increase in the front end? Seems to be a little bit of a disconnect between the strength and the script count and then the performance on the front end comp.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Bob, it's Alex here. Yes, I think in the prepared remarks George and both Stefano said, it was a tough market first of all. So we saw good growth in a tough market, particularly in healthcare which you expect to see the link to the pharmacy business and also through investment in beauty care we saw again some solid growth.", "Where we didn\u2019t see growth in the front end was really in the seasonal businesses. It was a tough Valentine's Day for the whole market. And also in food where there's quite a lot of deflation driven by competition and some commodity pricing that sort of affect us last summer is still running.", "We do track as best as we can link sales and we are confident that we are seeing the link we expected. I'm also very confident as the market moves on this new volume and the new food will improve the front end performance against the strategy that we have clearly laid out.", "Robert Jones", "Okay, great. Thanks. And then I guess just going back to the Rite Aid deal on the timing. Stefano you talked about this obviously dragging on longer than you anticipated, I guess where exactly are you in the FTC seeing eye-to-eye? And then I am curious, do you think the deal can get approved given the current configuration of the FTC or does there need to be more commissioners added in order to gain approval?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, as I said, I am still positive on this deal. I believe that we have a strong argument to defend this deal. I cannot comment on the organization of the FTC. It will be up to them to decide whether they have enough people or not to judge on the quality of this deal.", "We are doing what we can together with Rite Aid and Fred's. We are collaborating very well with the FTC and as I said, we are preparing our Fred's to be ready to 35 compliance if we will decide to do so.", "Robert Jones", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Eric Percher", "Thank you. Stefano, I\u2019d like to come back to your comment around Prime. The FEP win was notable and not something we expected to see on their own. So it seems like early success. As you talk about the opportunities mid-term and long term, do you see a role as enabling fulfillment in dispensing, or do you see Walgreens as having a role in enabling pharmacy benefit management as well?", "Stefano Pessina", "We believe that we are in the market. We have to follow the needs of the market and to be as useful as possible.", "Eric Percher", "So are there elements of Walgreens negotiation with manufacturers of purchasing that you think are value in the pharmacy benefit space? Can you add on to what Prime has already created there?", "Stefano Pessina", "To be honest, I believe that the market is evolving, is changing. And for sure, we will have a role to play in this market and we will try to, let's say, face all the opportunities that we will have in this market.", "Eric Percher", "Okay, fair. Two words quickly, is the buyback at all impacting fiscal year '17 guidance?", "Alex Gourlay", "Given the timing that we've just earlier this week announced that would be the buyback of up to $1 billion. It won\u2019t have any material impact in this year's earnings where we stop buying back shares.", "Eric Percher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa Gill", "Thanks very much and good morning. Just given your comments around the challenging front-end environment and the comments of not seeing as much pull through on uncertain whether you talk about seasonal or more commodity or food, how do you think about the layout of your store going forward?", "Alex, I think I heard you say that you did peephole through on a little bit of beauty, as well as healthcare. Do you think about your strategy around retail clinic and maybe perhaps growing that more. How do you think about a strategy around lab, not talking about Theronas, but more of blood drawing, more services in that aspect as we think about healthcare, and to Stefano's comment around the changing and evolving landscape as we think about healthcare needs.", "Alex Gourlay", "I think you are absolutely right. We've clearly got great corners. We had a platform of course is a great digital platform. So we have definitely got the right presence in the market. We don't have the right products in this space so we have physically in our stores. And we are doing something about that. I mean, as George said in his prepared remarks, we are now going to accelerate the reduction of our unnecessary SKUs. We've already been working hard in areas like seasonal before this I\u2019m going to go further particularly as we look our lower volume stores are going forward.", "We are very committed to finding the right products on the right healthcare solutions for this space that we free up and we've got good experience in Europe, for example, with our opticians business and with the health and care business. And of course, we've got good experience here in America with clinics.", "So you\u2019re absolutely right. We are really thinking very hard in testing and trialing different ways by which we can offer customers more particularly as we move more health, wellness, beauty convince model. And that's very much part of our thinking.", "But it will take some time. I think as we said before to get the right customer experience, the right partnerships, and particular under economics but we are comfortable to find that model in this marketplace.", "Lisa Gill", "Great. And then just one follow-up for George. If I look at the comps were basically up 8% on the pharmacy side but sales were up about 4%. How do I think about that? I mean, clearly I am sure generics was part of that but there is something else, is that the reimbursement component of it that's a drag?", "Gerald Gradwell", "It's the combination if you look at the relativity of generic deflation relative to what's happening on the brand mix is always the other factor and to much lesser extent, the reimbursement element.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gerald Gradwell", "That's a combination.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, sir.", "John Heinbockel", "How do you guys think about the evolution of limited networks going forward, the composition of those, in a lot of cases, is the economics more likely to be around Walgreens versus CVS in some of those networks or can it be kind of be more of kind two of you and other retailers not participating? How do you think that evolves?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, John, it's Alex here. I think we play in the marketplace and the marketplace is definitely evolving towards narrower networks. We really work hard to figure out what the payer or the marketplace wants, whether that be the commercial marketplace or Med D, and obviously Medicaid as well, and we work on economic model to see what the volume evolves look like.", "So we don\u2019t try and drive the marketplace in that direction. We believe strongly in partnerships. We have no best interest apart from looking after our customers and giving good value, a combination of price and service. But there's no doubt the marketplace is evolving towards narrower networks and we have to operate and participate in that marketplace.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay. And then completely different, given your expertise in beauty, is there an opportunity for stand-alone beauty stores? And I say that from a perspective of getting access to brands that you might not be able to - and sort of Walgreens box. Is that an opportunity, you simply have too much to do inside a drugstore to think about that?", "Alex Gourlay", "We think the opportunity is very much inside of a drug stores and new towards more of a health and beauty convenience specialist, that's what we\u2019re seeing the investment and the growth rate now. The future of the business will be focused on many ideas, but at the moment we\u2019re absolute focused on making the very most of the 8 million customers who use Walgreens today both online and in the pharmacies.", "And also developing a more appropriate beauty offer and we're seeing some really good things happening in the early stage of this promotion of this strategy and we're going to continue to drive it and as George has said already, this will be remarks we\u2019re moving to another close in stores with a beauty differentiation project. So that tells you the confidence we have in the strategy.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay, thank you,", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steven Valiquette of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Steven Valiquette", "Thanks, good morning everybody, congrats on the results. Yes I guess just on the Prime Therapeutics the network deal that started back on January 1. Does that care if there's any more color on whether the amount of additional arts volume was in line with your expectations or perhaps slightly better. And also are you able to comment on how many of the 14 Blue plans have signed up for the Walgreens network deals so far?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Steve. I can\u2019t obviously again comment on the second one, but we can tell you that\u2019s absolutely in line with expectations and I can also tell you that we are pleased and also Prime are pleased on the owners of Prime are also pleased the Blue\u2019s plans who own Prime. So we satisfied with the progress we\u2019ve made the next phase for us is to give the members of the Blue\u2019s a better value and obviously we\u2019re looking at ways we can do that as the market evolves.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay. And just quickly on Rite Aid not sure if you can comment on this or not, but if for some reason the FTC were to decide that Fred's cannot be buyer of the Rite Aid stores the divestitures. Should we assume that one option would be that Walgreens could then still go back to drawing board with other potential buyers of those that in stores or if Fred is not the buyer does that essentially kind of bring it in to the potential Walgreens Rite Aid merger just that you\u2019re able to comment on that or is too early to think about that next scenario?", "Stefano Pessina", "For the time being Stefano here, for the time being we believe that Fred is the right buyer we believe that they have particular in the configuration \u2013 we are proposing now. They are absolutely a legitimate player in this industry if for some reason this will not be the case than we will review our options of course and we will take a decision.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay. All right, great thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Hi, good morning guys. George it looks like you're continuing to make good progress in lowering G&A obviously tracking ahead of schedule in that $1.5 billion target. So how should we think about the opportunity going forward and the flow through for the rest of the year of the - efforts that you put in the past in terms of driving more G&A dollars down?", "George Fairweather", "I mean on the particular program that we talked about today we obviously are very pleased to have achieved our target the program will conclude as we previously announced \u2013 around the end of this fiscal year. Some of the benefits of that will obviously \u2013 it will continue to see and see more of in the coming years. Given that nevertheless looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our sort of businesses is just a way of life.", "So we will absolutely continue to look for opportunities year after year. They will come in different places they may be in different geographies, but there are always opportunities to drive efficiency. And so it's just a never ending we\u2019ll continue this program will finish, but we\u2019ll continue to look for more opportunities.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Got it, thank you.", "Stefano Pessina", "Stefano here sorry people say well cutting cost is something that \u2013 is an end you cannot really rely on it forever, but it\u2019s not just a matter of cutting cost synergies and savings are not just coming from reducing cost. Very often it depends they can depend on a different organization.", "And so if you have let\u2019s say an approach to the business which is completely open minded you can continue to drive efficiency and reduce cost. Just changing the organization and this is really worth what we have done for many, many years and worked I believe we are relatively good at doing. And so we continue to believe that we will able to drive efficiency for many years independently on the obvious cost cutting that everybody can see.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Yes appreciate the color Stefano. To follow-up Eric\u2019s question earlier on FTP and specialty I was just wondering how would you describe \u2013 the pipeline do you have right now in terms of that partnership with Prime on the specialty side in terms of pipeline for new contract or should we think of this as a, kind like one-off wind where it\u2019s kind choppy and also what is the pitch that you guys make to potential client and what differentiate the Walgreens and Prime specialty offerings?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi guys Alex here, I think \u2013 it\u2019s pretty clear about what has gone here is got the attention particularly with the Blue\u2019s plans which we are very pleased about and really the pitch is really quite a simple one. Prime Therapeutics really wants that to make sure that the value they create is passed through the Blue\u2019s members in different ways and what we do is really as a back shop operator particular of meal order and also specialty. I feel is to make sure that we\u2019re really efficient and give great service to at least and a dispensing process.", "So this was a win for Prime Therapeutics FTP and obviously we believe with our greater scale and our expertise in dispensing prescription and specialty and central fill. So that\u2019s gives extra capability to Prime and not use to be seem to be marketplace as well.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Got it. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken", "Just following up on the specialty questions so how was your sort of view of that market and the right competitive landscape and the right level of profits sort of evolved as you thought about the launch of Alliance Rx because it\u2019s obviously been area there is a lot of scrutiny, there is a lot of questions on what the right dollar level per script or what services should be required or should not be required. How do you feel like you bring a bit of different viewpoint to may be a market that had been somewhat stagnant in the last couple years in terms of its evolution?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, it\u2019s Alex again, I think that - we bring is that forward that efficiency it\u2019s the marketplace but that went all over and they\u2019re not for sure you know there is others who are larger of being that efficiency as well.", "But secondly we bring the opportunity of the network pharmacies as I said before we don\u2019t just a central fill we actually own independent of Alliance Rx you the special network that are those in the center of excellence primarily based during the HIV. And also we have now a couple of hundreds specialty pharmacies we\u2019ll show you a host of hospitals a host of specialist doctors.", "So again we offer you know with different register market and we offer a different approach. And we also believe strongly in this area that we should be paid for the service and the care we provide these are expensive complicated medications. We have pharmacists who are playing to the top of the certificates when they\u2019re taking care of patients who are on these medications and we want to make sure that we are adequately remove to that part of the process and other remuneration belong to the other bits in the system.", "For example the PBM for example the insurance company we want to be well rewarded for giving the care that are pharmacy gets in that way.", "Ross Muken", "And may be on the big picture side one of the managed care organization have talked about sort of more integrated model or have talked about running a presence closer to the individual obviously you have some of the best real estate and you have also been quite great at lowering cost and prices for individuals and varying that high level of service.", "How of your conversations with managed care around sort of what else you can provide to them or how you were sort of dispensing organization and other services fits in with their goals. How is that conversation evolved over time and what should we be focused on in terms of sort of future opportunities high level or big picture that could go on in those relationships?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes I can talk again, so again you know we have that I just seen - are sourced effectively a couple hundred and over clinics in different ways. And in these conversations they focus on really our strategic ability to become a very efficient and very localized dispensing service for them not really resonates with them.", "And secondly, we have as you said the real estate whether they can actually come in and have the lower cost ways of delivering services in the community outside of their more expensive systems. So these really are the two areas that we talk about a lot and we have a lot of different ways of doing that, a lot of ways of working whether it be with advocate here in Chicago.", "So again it's - and anyway for sure the conversation are good and we are learning together and again goes back to partnership we know what we\u2019re good at I mean all of the areas where we want support and for sure clinic started to integrate is example of that.", "Ross Muken", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Yes, good morning. A couple thought questions here, first of all when we think about the script comps up 90 basis points quarter-to-quarter. Should we think about these comps continuing to accelerate through the back half of the year when you think about the opportunity to capture membership and volume from these partners? Do you think that it was all captured in the first quarter or we'll see an uptick later in the year?", "And second question is about kind of like the cadence of margin, should we expect to start seeing margins that are associated with these groups improving in the back half of the year?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Ricky, it\u2019s Alex again. Yes, I think that we did have a helpful uptick in seasonal illness on this flu side for weeks which spiked some of the numbers for us presently in Q2. So the way I think about it is that these are driven by two factors the smaller uptick in flu and also all of these contracts and the main started 1/1, so two months and then with beauty started as 1/12 and the member Med D which again we sort of a good season Med D again started 11. So we are confident that the way we have at the moment is what we expected on the strong volume we\u2019ll therefore continue.", "In terms of margin, I would think again I\u2019ll go back to the operating margin for us it really is leveraging our fixed assets as we continue to offer market competitive prices not below market but market competitive prices and drive volume through our fixed assets. I mean spent levers are more as they have always said in the second half of the year compared to first half of the year. It's important to look at the annual results as George has reiterated and again we are keeping our guidance for the full year between 7% and 11% EBIT growth.", "Stefano Pessina", "But remember Stefano here, but remember that our goal has always been to keep the overall operating margin as flat as possible and the dynamic in these market and many other market is that the U.S. to give more to your customers you can get a little more from your suppliers and you can become more efficient.", "And so at the end combining these three elements you have to manage to have a margin overall year-on-year more or less flattish if possible.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay. And following up on that when we think about getting more from the suppliers and getting more efficiencies on the back-end. Do you still see opportunities to improve kind of fact purchasing efficiencies or growth scale for WBAD? One contract that is going affect up in the market it comes to mind is the Express Scripts AmerisourceBergen contract. Do you see an opportunity there?", "Stefano Pessina", "It had always opportunities in the market and we are looking at the market very carefully and we will try to see all the opportunities that we will see in the market.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay. But is there something that is kind of fact already included in guidance or is that could be potential outside?", "Stefano Pessina", "When we give our guidance we try to put in the guidance all the elements that we believe certain or very likely I cannot give you more details as you can easily understand.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "And then lastly on the tax rate, tax rate came in lower than we anticipated how should we ", "think about the tax rate George for the remaining of the year?", "George Fairweather", "I think really it always looks at the year-to-date effective tax rate and if you look at that from an adjusted basis as I said that was around 24.5%. So I think tax obviously you know mix can change quarter-by-quarter but looking at year-to-date I think it\u2019s perhaps the best way of thinking about this discrete items of course the timing of those, there was a little bit uncertain and they can go up or down but think of the year-to-date.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is open.", "Michael Cherny", "Good morning everyone, and thank you for all the details so far. Maybe to ask Ricky's WBAD question a little bit of a different way. As you think about the general deflation you\u2019re seeing across the market, how do you think about the trade-off in terms of what you're seeing across the market what you can't control versus what you're doing with regards to sourcing.", "And on go forward basis depending on how you\u2019re planning for what an uncertain scenario to place in an environment how is that positioning you in terms of being able to drive either incremental sourcing or essentially eating some of the potential challenge you have on the pricing side?", "Stefano Pessina", "We make certain functions and on the basis of these assumptions we have our internal targets. And I repeat the assumptions are taking a really into account all the different pieces of information that we have on the market.", "Alex Gourlay", "And so it's all in here, and I think we're in the market so we see how the market is changing in terms of price pressure and we except that. And we\u2019re always working on the 1 areas. One is sort of we actually buy that and how do we continue to not just save money as Stefano has said but to recreate the organization and move money we\u2019re into invest and as we can grow, and grow volume.", "So I think \u2013 we've never had and I defy that the pricing pressure is there but it\u2019s never and we\u2019ve always been aware of it and always trying to anticipate that in our guidance. So is the market and got to operate within it and for sure we believe we have a strong strategy for the market in the U.S.", "Michael Cherny", "Great. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Your line is open.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the question about operating margin in the back half of the year how should we think about it by segment international retail operating margins in the back half should that continue to be challenge at a similar level as you in the quarter or are there opportunities there and also the U.S. is that something that you expect to flatten out in the back half?", "George Fairweather", "I mean obviously we haven\u2019t given specific guidance by segment we had first provide by reiterating our overall guidance figures I mean in terms of thinking about sort of the modeling. There is going to be a number of factors that you've got to think about and firstly we will we are consolidating the new Prime deal from Monday when we completed it. You need to think about that in factoring the U.S. model recognizing obviously that is a specialty on mail business with different dynamics.", "In terms of the international businesses, I think as we've said in the prepared remarks there is still the challenge in the U.K. with the NHS having cut the reimbursement that will continue the basis has performed robustly as we said over key customer period. But retailing is still itself quite challenging particularly in the U.K. which is our largest market. And then on wholesale sales, wholesale always a its kind of business or division that operates in a number of markets you can always get certain mix affect quarter-by-quarter.", "So it's tough to model I know quarter-by-quarter but I did point out in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets we had some growth really in the period when you get price changes in the market where people tend to buy ahead of customers buy ahead of the price change and that was the notable impact in the second quarter.", "Alex Gourlay", "And it\u2019s Alex again. Just really quickly on the U.K. as George has said the reimbursement pressure was the main reason for the decline, really there was two things government did one they normally do which is they buy margin which is normal in the U.K. contract. But secondly this year on December they actually remove some of the service payments, practice payments. And again if you look on new deals, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s a big issue in the U.K.", "So that really is the reason why we\u2019ve had our increases and operating profit. These two business had a good December and that we\u2019re focusing and controlling our costs it\u2019s really driving as we always do, you need a bit of products particularly in beauty and some marketplace and developing new pharmacy services. So we\u2019re looking to stabilize our business, but the impacts or the government action has been strongly share our main U.K. business.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great, thanks for the color. And just a quick follow-up on the beauty initiatives and the remodel just wanted to get an update on what you\u2019ve seen from those if you\u2019ve seen an uplift of comps not only beauty section but also the overall store and some these mover of markets and if so could you quantify that at all?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Alex again, I mean really it so wildly on the 2,000 stores if you would call we had about a marketplace in Phoenix which we tested and trials I mean took the best model and remained that really last year into the first 2,000 stores. So far so good we\u2019re seeing that the beauty brand is growing we should expect it to do and over time we\u2019ll develop you know the offer in the marketing around that new beauty offering. But this trial is to tell the affect that is going to have on the rest of our business but we remain confident and will have a positive impact.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is open.", "David Larsen", "Hi, can you talk a bit about how you\u2019re going to roll up the Prime partnership into your P&L. So like for example obviously with this $2.9 billion contract that Prime just won in specialty. Like how much of that is going to flow through your P&L like when we think about central fill for specialty I guess what portion of specialty would that be any kind color there would be great? Thanks.", "George Fairweather", "Well just on the accounting side I mean we will account for it on a fully consolidated basis. So when you're looking at our of sales, our adjusted operating income then you will obviously see a 100% of the entities results coming through, but then when you're actually looking at an earnings attributable to our shareholders to the WBA shareholders, we strip out and align the proportion that is attributable to Prime itself and I think as we said we own just over 50% of the business. So when you thinking of EPS then it will be our share if you thinking of operating it's a 100% also in the accounting books.", "David Larsen", "That\u2019s great. So for FEP win that $2.9 billion in revenue all of that is going to flow through onto your P&L and then if they win say mail in a year or so that would also all flow through into your P&L that full $2 billion or $3 billion for now and $2 billion or $3 billion for specialty for revenue?", "George Fairweather", "Anything that goes through the venture that the new combined venture as to say we show a 100% in revenue 100% in adjusted operating income but then we strip as I say at the lower end of the P&L that the Prime share. So when we are looking at adjusted earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance staffs got their share netted out.", "David Larsen", "Okay, great. And then I think Prime uses WBAD as well, right through ADC. So the value-add or pitch to managed care clients is both - I mean there's a significant cogs benefit there I would imagine right for the managed care\u2026", "Stefano Pessina ", "We cannot comment on that. We cannot comment on the contact that Prime have or we'll have.", "David Larsen", "Okay, thanks. Congrats on a good quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hi, thanks guys. Most of my questions have been answered but I just had one regarding the U.S. profitability in the pharmacy as we look out, you know, if the Rite Aid deal does not get approved, how should we frame it as we move out over the next year or two or three with all these contracts that has been signed specifically the profitability of the pharmacy?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Scott, it\u2019s Alex here. Again, as we have been really clear, we are independently working hard on our pharmacy strategy independent already and we feel very confident with the network we have already is strong enough to be very competitive in the marketplace.", "Anything that we achieve when the FTC gave a decision to approve Rite Aid will be incremental as George has indicated in the EPS numbers and also in terms of the synergies we announced as part of the deal.", "Stefano Pessina ", "And also you will appreciate that we will not be able to integrate all the stores of Rite Aid overnight. There will be a period portfolio of certain number of years where we will have to rely mainly on our stores. And in the meantime, we will integrate all the stores of Rite Aid. So you cannot see the effect immediately.", "Scott Mushkin", "Right. And then looking at the front-end, obviously the beauty part of it seems to be working out that well and I just want to clarify, do you see another 100 stores are going to get the enhance beauty between now and the end of the year? I just want to make sure is that number correct.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Yes, it's roughly under 2000 just now, and it moves up to roughly 50,000 over a state of just under \u2013 we're going to see just approaching 8300. So, 3000 will have this by the end of this \u2013 really the end of the summer effectively.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay. And then any thoughts on what those stores do in comparison to the rest? I think you are a negative 0.8 comp on the chain but those stores perform 100, 200 basis point better, any parameters you have on that?", "Gerald Gradwell", "No, again it's really early on and the way we measure this really is about the underlying retail margin, the operating margin in particular and the more we see increases, relatively speaking, in beauty care and healthcare but in the beauty care, the more we see the retail underlying margin improving over time in a sustainable way.", "We are working around, I'd say, the rest of the model. As Stefano said in his opening remarks, we are changing this model in quite a torrid time in the U.S. for market changes. So we are very pleased with the progress we are making. But that's how we measure it.", "Scott Mushkin", "So then my final one is pretty good quarter considering all the headwinds that the business faced. As we look out over the next 6 to 12 months, do you see any change in the headwinds that the business is facing? Do you think it's abating? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel, or is it going to continue to be this difficult as you move through the next 6 to 12 months? And that's it for me, thanks.", "Stefano Pessina ", "Well there are headwinds but we hope that we will be able to have also some tailwinds. And so we hope that at the end we will be able to deliver what we have promised.", "Gerald Gradwell", "I would just reiterate. If you just think of the guidance that we've given, we have maintained our guidance today. If you do the maths, then that implies to 7% to 11% year-over-year growth and that includes approximately a 12% headwind for currency.", "So if you exclude the headwind and obviously currency can go one way or the other but if you exclude the headwind then the guidance implies 9% to 13% year-over-year growth and underlying adjusted EPS. So I think that really I think gives us strong indication of what our thinking is and what we see how the businesses is performing overall.", "And as we said at the start of the year, this would be a more second half weighted in the year. The first quarter, second quarter has come out very much in line with our expectation. So that's really how we're thinking about how the business is performing at the moment.", "Scott Mushkin", "Perfect guys. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Most of my questions have been answered already, but I just wanted to clarify why you feel like you have more flexibility. I think in your prepared remarks, you tied together the new buyback program would be the latest Rite Aid developments. Maybe I am reading too much into it. But did the earlier comments just reflect any - do they reflect any greater or less confidence in a merger going through, or is the flexibility just a function of the lower offering price for Rite Aid?", "Gerald Gradwell", "The flexibility is simply obviously the lower price and the timing. I mean, we've been very clear that in terms of our policy is solid investment grade. We worked very closely with the credit agencies as you would expect which is important for our debt investors.", "And with the timing of the transaction with the revise consideration and with - what continues to be a very strong cash flows, I think you\u2019ve seen again from this quarter's results that simply is why we've decided to announce what is the relatively modest buyback program. It's fine tuning is how I would describe it.", "Ajay Jain", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Gerald for any closing remarks.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you very much indeed, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for our calls. Sorry for the technical problems we had at the beginning, but I believe you could all hear after we restarted. So thank you very much indeed and the IR team are available to take all and answer any questions you might have in the coming days, weeks, months whatever.

", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Stefano for some opening comments. ", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you Gerald. Good morning everyone and welcome to our fiscal third quarter earnings call. The past six months have been significant for us in delivering on the benefit of the merger and structuring the business for the future, but there is a lot more to do. As you have seen today, I have been appointed by the Board as Chief Executive Officer, replacing the Interim appointment that I was previously fulfilling. The Board has decided that bearing in mind the pace of change and the amount that we have still to do, there is a benefit to stability at the senior level in the organization and to focus on the operational and strategic task before us, rather than appointing, orientating, and educating someone new to the business during the period. ", "The role presents me with certain personal and logistical challenges, but with the support of the Board and particularly of Jim Skinner as our Executive Chairman, I have agreed to accept the appointment in the best interest of the company, my colleagues, and of course my fellow shareholders.", "Today, I am pleased to be announcing another strong financial performance, in deed the first quarter to reflect a full three months of the combined company. Although it may not always appear so from outside the business, it has been a very busy period for us since I last talked to you. As I have mentioned, our focus has naturally been on putting in place the changes and the restructuring we need in order to deliver the full benefits of the enlarged company and position the company for growth in the immediate long term.", "Given that the deal was consummated only six months ago, we are still in the early stages of this process, but we have been working hard and fast to deliver on our plan, in fact better than our plan, and I am pleased to say that the benefits of this work are already beginning to be seen in our results with reasonable growth in revenues and margins and continuous strong cash generation. Really, the first avenues in which you can see the impact are tight cost control and disciplined financial management, but I want to assure you that we give our operations the investment they need to grow and prosper.", "We have accelerated our cost reduction process and have reaped certain benefits earlier than expected in this quarter. Of course, we cannot extract these benefits more than once. However, the process of identifying benefits is ongoing, not final, so when we have completed this first wave of restructuring, we will reveal it and review all areas of our business to identify further potential cost saving.", "I must commend my colleagues throughout the company for their willingness and openness to accept change even when it is most uncomfortable in the interest of improving and growing our company, and I would assure them that change is a sign of life and if embraced in this manner, it becomes more of an ally than an enemy. It\u2019s a reminder that while we must prioritize our work if we have to achieve everything we want to and promise to, we cannot ignore any element of the business when it comes to our [indiscernible] for efficiency and best practice. ", "I will handover to George now for him to take you through the results for the quarter and give you some color on what I have just said. George?", "George Fairweather", "Thank you Stefano. Good morning everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Today, I will begin my remarks by taking you through key highlights of our fiscal 2015 third quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of each of our three divisions before updating you on progress we have made in implementing our cost savings and continuing to execute our synergy programs. I will conclude by taking you through our updated guidance for fiscal year \u201815 and comment on our fiscal year \u201816 goals.", "As Stefano said, the benefits of the work carried out since Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed at the end of December are already beginning to be seen in our financial results, enabling us to deliver another strong quarter. Looking at the highlights, net sales for the quarter were $28.8 billion, an increase of 48.4% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $1.4 billion and on an adjusted basis was $1.7 billion. The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by the consolidation of Alliance Boots as well as growth in our retail pharmacy USA segment.", "GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion or $1.18 per diluted share, while adjusted net earnings were $1.1 billion or $1.02 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 59.5% in GAAP net earnings per diluted share and an increase of 22.9% in adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year.", "Net interest expense in the quarter was $151 million and our adjusted tax rate was 30%. Finally, the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the quarter was $1.1 billion. This includes the cost of 144 million shares issued on the 31st December as part of the second step consideration for Alliance Boots. It should also be noted that the third quarter results last year included three-month equity earnings as a result of Walgreens\u2019 45% interest in Alliance Boots compared to fully consolidated results in this year's third quarter. ", "Now I will take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP earnings of $1.18 per diluted share for the quarter reconciles to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.16 per share reflect additions of $0.05 of LIFO provision cost in retail pharmacy USA, $0.06 of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and an additional $0.11 of restructuring related costs, from our cost optimization and store closure programs. ", "These additions were more than offset by removal of $0.29 gain on our warrants to acquire Amerisource Bergen shares and a net 9% gain from special items, which include the release of a capital loss valuation allowance totaling $0.12 combined with a $0.01 loss on the sale of Walgreens infusion services, and $0.02 from an adjusted tax rate true-up. ", "So, now I will take you through the performance of each of our divisions in the quarter. To remind you, our results are reported in three segments; Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International, and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD, as well as an allocation of corporate related overhead costs.", "Responding to feedback received at our Analyst Day in April, you will see that we are providing additional detail on segmental performance within the press release and in this presentation. This quarter, we have provided gross profit, SG&A and operating profit on a GAAP and adjusted basis for each of our segments. We plan to continue this practice going forward. ", "So now let's start with the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. Retail Pharmacy USA total sales for the quarter were $20.4 billion an increase of 5.3% over the third quarter in the prior year. Please remember of course that we sold the majority stake in Walgreens infusion services on the 7th of April. With our minority position our share of earnings in the company now flow through the post-tax earnings from equity method investments in the income statement. Sales in the division, on a comparable store basis, increased by 6.3%. SG&A on a GAAP basis was $4.5 billion and on an adjusted basis was $4.3 billion. ", "We continued to see strong progress in controlling SG&A expenses this quarter, including benefits associated with our cost savings program. This is a significant driver, of the quarterly year-on-year performance. As a result GAAP operating income for Retail Pharmacy USA was $1 billion while adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. ", "So looking now at the pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail; comparable store sales for pharmacy were up 9.1% for the quarter. We sold 226 million prescriptions, including immunizations on a 30-day adjusted basis. That was an increase of 3.8% over last year's quarter with prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 4.1%. ", "We continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D scripts along with positive underlying share trends. Our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased to 19.3% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. The benefit of positive sales growth was however substantially offset by Pharmacy gross margin pressure, consistent with our expectations. Retail product sales increased by 2% in total, comparable store sales increasing by 1.6%. The growth in retail sales was driven by performance in key destination categories, including health and wellness.", "We're pleased with our progress in driving profitable sales growth and margin expansion, while at the same time focusing on operating efficiencies and focusing on working capital efficiencies. Additionally we continue to enhance our successful Balance Rewards program by recently releasing Balanced Rewards with everyday points. We now provide our active customers with a more consistent platform to receive loyalty points on most pharmacy and retail product transactions. We also encourage healthy life style choices by awarding points for positive health and well-being decisions.", "So turning now to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division; for Retail Pharmacy International division pharmacy led health in beauty retail businesses in eight countries. At the end of the quarter we operated 4,565 retail stores and adding -- net increase six doors during the quarter. As a reminder our biggest operations are Boots in the UK followed by Mexico. We've also retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, The Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands and Lithuania.", "Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.3 billion. GAAP operating income was $205 million, while adjusted operating income was $249 million. Adjusted operating margin at 7.6% for the quarter was 1.5 percentage points higher than in the second quarter, which remember included only January and February performance. The margin is typically lower in these early months of the year reflecting the seasonality of sales.", "So now let's look more closely the performance for the division. On a pro forma constant currency basis comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 3.1%. This reflects Boots UK growth of 2.4% complemented by higher growth in emerging markets, most notably in Mexico and Chile, where we are making good progress in integrating these businesses, acquired by Alliance Boots in August 2014. In the UK Boots resale sales were driven by good performance in both the beauty and retail health care categories.", "Orders on our UK website at boots.com and orders during the quarter were up approximately 50% over the same period last year with approximately two-thirds of our website orders collected in store. At our Analyst Day back in April we talked about the importance of our product brands. We're very pleased with the growth in sales during the quarter of No7, our award winning beauty brand. This was in part due to the May launch of a new marketing program in the UK, the No7 Protect & Perfect ADVANCED Serum. We were able to state for the first time in the UK that this innovative product was the first serum clinically proven to deliver ground breaking anti-wrinkle results that get even better over time. ", "As well as developing our existing product brands we continue to add brands to our portfolio, which resonates with our customers. Following on from the acquisition of Soap & Glory last year we are delighted to announce today that we've acquired Liz Earle from Avon. Liz Earle is an award winning premium skin care range that uses naturally active ingredients and is recognized as one of the leading botanical brands in the UK.", "So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Pharmaceutical Wholesale division total sales for the quarter were $5.7 billion. On a pro forma basis, which assumes constant currency and excludes acquisitions and disposals, sales increased 0.2% compared with the same quarter in the prior year. As we discussed in the last earnings call, Wholesale performance in any quarter is impacted by performance in larger geographies, including the UK, Germany, France and Turkey as well as by the unique business model. ", "GAAP operating income for the division was $162 million, while adjusted operating income was $171 million. Adjusted operating income margin was 3%, broadly flat versus the second quarter and consistent with our expectations. The key driver of profit growth continues to be our synergy program. Net synergies in the third quarter totaled $194 million, making a total of $504 million for the fiscal year-to-date. As we've said before synergies this year continue to come primarily from our drug procurement activities. As you can see from the numbers, we're on track to reach our target of at least $650 million of net synergies in fiscal year 2015. ", "For fiscal 2016 we continue to expect at least $1 billion of combined quantifiable net synergies. As we work increasingly close together as a combined management team, there are of course an increasing number of other synergies being identified and actioned, many of which are simply not practicable to quantify. Consistent with our prior reporting these synergies are allocated across each segment and do not include any benefit from our relationship with the AmerisourceBergen. ", "At the same time as driving our synergy program, as you know we are very focused on costs. As previously announced we have a target of $1.5 billion goal of cost saving to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. The expected pretax charges associated with this program as previously stated are between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion of which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. ", "Good progress was made during the quarter in reorganizing our retail pharmacy USA field operations, but we're continuing on the optimization of the division's corporate office. Of the approximately 200 planned U.S. store closures in the program nine stores were closed in the quarter with approximately 70 to 80 additional stores planned to be closed by the end of the fiscal year. We've also reduced the IT cost structure in the USA to help enable significant store system investments over the coming years. In addition, during June we announced a reduction of approximately 700 non store-based roles in Retail Pharmacy International. During the quarter we incurred pretax charges of $160 million on the program. These comprised $102 million of asset impairments, $34 million of severance cost and real estate costs of $24 million.", "So moving on now to cash flow and the deployments of capital. GAAP operating cash flow was $1.8 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of the year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion in the first nine months of the year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion. Investing to drive future growth is our first priority for capital deployment, both in terms of capital expenditure and selective M&A. During the quarter we invested $247 million in capital expenditure, making a total of $890 million for the first nine months of the year. Key areas for capital investment continue to store investments as well as IT and digital capabilities, which are vital to building and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage and are increasing Omni channel work. ", "To some degree this quarter disproportionally benefitted from the imposition of stricter capital investment controls. And while we expect to maintain a rigid control on capital expenditure to assure appropriate returns on every dollar we spend we will clearly not deprive the business of the investment it needs to thrive. You should therefore expect to see future quarters return to a slightly higher level of capital expenditure than we are reporting today.", "We remain focused on generating cash through working capital efficiencies, particularly in Retail Pharmacy USA. A primary area of focus is inventory management, both in pharmacy and retail products. For the quarter we improved our inventory days of supply in the U.S. by approximately six days versus the prior year quarter. We continue to see further opportunity for working capital improvements over time. At the same time we are working hard to optimize our real estate assets, including carrying out sale and lease back transactions. In the third quarter we executed approximately $300 million of such transactions. ", "As we have said previously our philosophy is to run an efficient balance sheet. As such we completed approximately $237 million of share repurchases in the quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchases under this program to $331 million. The program is ongoing and we remain committed to completing the plan by the end of fiscal 2016.", "In addition we announced today that in order for us to manage our balance sheet we are intending to redeem legacy Walgreens bonds with relatively short periods until they expire for the total principal amount of approximately $1.75 billion. This redemption will be funded from existing cash resources. You will see that cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.4 billion at quarter end, so you have the capacity to do this and continue to exercise on our share repurchase program.", "So turning to the dividend, we announced today a 6.7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share. This raises the annual rate from $1.35 per share to $1.44 per share. We remain committed to a long-term dividend payout ratio target of 30% to 35%. ", "So now, let me talk about the full year outlook for fiscal 2015. In our second quarter earnings release we had issued an adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.45 to $3.65 for fiscal year 2015. Given our solid third quarter results and increased visibility as we look to the year-end we are pleased to both increase and narrow our adjusted EPS fiscal year guidance to a range of $3.70 to $3.80. This range assumes adjusted interest expense of approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 29%, a fiscal year diluted share count of approximately 1.05 billion shares and estimates for foreign exchange rate that reflect current market rates over the balance of the fiscal year. ", "I remind you that when we issued our fiscal year \u201815 guidance in April we viewed the second half of the fiscal year differently than the first half. Specifically we indicated that adjusted earnings per diluted share would be lower in the second half, with the third quarter being higher than the fourth quarter. As we update our guidance this still holds true. We expect quarter four adjusted earnings per diluted share to be sequentially lower for the following reasons. The primary component is seasonality, which impact sales and product mix. The summer months tend to be our weakest, particularly in our retail pharmacy USA segment. Within the U.S. we tend to see sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. Also as we continue to work through our cost plan in the U.S. the phasing and timing of certain expenses will impact the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter.", "So moving on to fiscal year 2016, we are reaffirming our previously stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. This range assumes that annual adjusted tax rate in high 20s, a full weighted average diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion and no significant changes to current currency exchange rates. ", "Please remember of course that since we established the goal a year ago we\u2019ve seen material appreciation of the dollar. As you know, we have currency translation exposure based primarily on movements in the Pound Sterling versus the dollar. And as a reminder we estimate that a 1% move in Pounds Sterling versus dollar from current levels would impact our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share. Given the current situation in Greece where we fortunately have no business interest we anticipate a certain level of volatility in the currency markets in forthcoming months. ", "So with that I will turn the call back to Stefano. ", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. So I hope that you will agree that these are a very solid set of results. This level of [ph] -- and we are far from being complacent about the challenges we face and the hard work it will take to deliver everything we want and that\u2019s our mission. But we are making good progress and traveling in the right direction. And I believe all of my colleagues recognize the challenges and work will be needed to overcome them. But are as convinced as ever about the immense potential of our company as a global pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise. ", "We are in markets that are changing, here in the U.S. where you are seeing this quite dramatically. But as I have said many times that we are at the beginning of a new chapter for our company and are actively reviewing every opportunity that the changing environment offers us, as we work to deliver the true potential of our company. I strongly believe that we have a significant role to play in shaping the future of our industry. ", "I thank you for your continued support and but also acknowledge that the best way to thank you is to deliver on our plans. And I can assure you we fully intend to continue to do so. ", "With that I think we will open it up for questions, Gerald?", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Stephanie you want to take over? ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays. Your line is open. ", "Meredith Adler", "Thank you very much and I'm asking questions for myself and Eric Percher, who is not available today. I think our main question would be talking about the big difference, the spread between the growth in pharmacy scripts and the growth in dollars. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what the drivers are, some of it is Hep C, but maybe you could talk a little bit about inflation in both branded and generic drugs. And then I will have one other question. ", "Alex Gourlay", "Good morning. Alex here. Thanks for the question. Yeah, the inflation we're managing the effect of that inflation pretty well in the business. We have very good plans and the team has done a good job to get that done. So one of the difference in the space we are seeing is generic inflation, but we are managing that effect really pretty satisfactorily. And that of course is built into our future guidance as well. ", "Meredith Adler", "Would you describe inflation in branded pharmaceuticals as a positive for the margin?", "George Fairweather", "I think it's marginal at the moment in terms of that. But again, for example, slight improvement because of generic -- as generics come in the market, both this year and next year. But again, the key thing here is that we forecasted this, we're planning it, and it\u2019s really consistent with our expectations. ", "Stefano Pessina", "If I can add something, you have also to take into account that we have different businesses in our company. And some of these businesses like the wholesale business or like WBAD are taking advantage of certain inflation. ", "Meredith Adler", "Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then I just have a follow-up question to talk about on the front end margin improved and I think you've talked about, not just the operating margin but the gross margin. Maybe you could talk a little bit about changes that you might have made in terms of promotional strategies or the way you are marketing that might have driven a better gross margin in the front end.", "Alex Gourlay", "Yeah, Meredith, it\u2019s Alex again. Yeah, we've been really on this strategy now for five quarters. So we're pleased with the progress we're making. The key things that we have done is that we stopped really promotions that were driving sales, particularly in some consumable categories, but not really helping the product at all. And we are focused much more on the mix, and making sure that we're much more focused on really the health and wellness in beauty care categories, and that's really proven beneficial and as George said in the script today, we have launched a new platform called Everyday Points and that is to make sure again that people who are coming to us more regularly and are picking up on the destination categories are getting a better platform and more reasons to come back to Walgreens. ", "No, it's still early days. We have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity ahead of us and it will be step by step process, but the basic things we're doing is reducing unprofitable promotions and making sure that we focus more investment in our best customers and more investments in our destination categories. ", "Meredith Adler", "Great, thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is open. ", "John Heinbockel", "So two questions, one on Walgreen USA costs, what would you guys peg the normal increase, annual increase in SG&A at? It would be 2% to 3% absent cost cutting and then of the $1.5 billion that you identified, did you see any of that in the third quarter, and how much, and what do you think you see in the fourth? And then just lastly it did look like pharmacy margin improved a decent amount sequentially, which was a little surprising, what were the couple of things that may have driven that?", "Stefano Pessina", "Alex, maybe you can. ", "Alex Gourlay", "Yeah, there are a number of questions there John. So good morning again. So starting over with the cost question, I think as George said really, clearly, we made solid progress against our $1.5 billion cost program, and of course we started a bit earlier in the U.S. in terms of what we announced. And I would say that we are seeing SG&A in the U.S. business down slightly year-on-year on a comparative basis, which is pleasing but also really what we had planned to do. And I think as George also said there is a bit of phasing here between quarter three and quarter four, and importantly from a continuation of business point of view, we are in quarter four this year. We're making sure that we'll continue to invest in the things that customers value the most from us to make sure we keep the growth going forward and investing more in our customers and more in the things that customers sees. ", "Again finally on the cost side, again as George has said, we started some of the restructuring, we closed, I think George said, nine stores in the previous quarter, and we are on track to close another 80 to 90 in the period ahead. Again, that's very much on plan and benefits still to come over a period of time.", "George Fairweather", "I think John, you also asked a question on pharmacy margin, and really just reinforcing what I said earlier, we did see in the U.S. the positive sales growth but that was substantially offset by the pharmacy gross margin pressure, but that was absolutely consistent with our expectation, so there is no change from what we were expecting when we last talked to you. ", "John Heinbockel", "Did it get better sequentially or no, right. ", "George Fairweather", "We're talking about here -- obviously we're reporting John on year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter, but it really was -- it was as we expected. I mean when the renewals come through and what we're seeing is what we were expecting.", "Stefano Pessina", "The market, it\u2019s Stefano here, of course the market it's evolving. What is important is to be able to anticipate what happens and to take this into account when you budget and I believe that this year we are doing exactly this. We are absolutely aligned with what we were expecting.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ", "Lisa Gill ", "Hi, thanks very much and good morning. Stefano, you talked about the challenges that the U.S. market and other markets are facing. We hear CMS talking about 50% of payments moving towards what they are calling fee for value. Can you talk about strategically, where do you think Walgreens needs to be positioned, we're seeing lots of consolidation, whether it's managed care or other players, is it that you need to be the biggest retail provider in the U.S. and therefore best positioned to partner with those, that are taking on risks, do you view yourself as more of a risk bearing entity overtime, how do you think about your relationship, whether it\u2019s with managed care or PBMs and strengthening those going forward?", "Stefano Pessina", "I have said many times, that I believe that the American markets will go through a substantial wave of consolidation horizontally and vertically. I have said very clearly that we want to be part of this, at the right time with the right partner. We are open to any kind of combination which could improve the value of our company and we are looking actively around us to understand which is the best option for us. But please don\u2019t forget that we are looking actively not just in the U.S. but even in other countries because we consider ourselves a global company.", "Lisa Gill ", "And would you say that the priorities are more U.S. driven or globally driven or does it depend on the specific opportunity that comes across your desk?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, the priority is that the deal that you can do, and it depends where you can fit.", "Lisa Gill ", "Okay great. And then just my follow-up question would just be around the synergies and you talked a lot about them coming from the procurement side of things. Can you maybe talk about where you think you are George, or Alex or Stefano as far as what inning are we in, and as far as on obtaining that the synergies that you expected from WBAD, are we close to getting the full benefit from them or is there still a good portion of the future synergies that will still come from the procurement side?", "Stefano Pessina", "We are absolutely inline with what we were forecasting and maybe George you can give more details, but we will do what we were expecting and what we announced.", "George Fairweather", "What I would just add to that is what I said is that we are very much on track to achieve the target this year and our -- the goal of $1 billion, from what I would describe as hard quantifiable synergies that we can measure. But what we are really seeing as the -- now that we are a merged organization, we are seeing lots of other areas of best practice and ideas that we are sharing, that we are implementing. But clearly as we become more and more integrated these are the simply the sites that you cannot quantify to the standard that you can put in a number and we are very much moving through this, into this phase. ", "And those types of synergies, as we know from previous transactions I remember from the merger of Alliance UniChem and Boots, these are very important synergies and we can see them time and time again we are moving people around more and these are really what will help us to become a much, much stronger organization.", "Stefano Pessina", "I would add George, that as you said we are thinking of the buying synergies -- certain synergies which are quite evident and we can easily forecast. But there would be for sure, as you are saying, George many synergies that will appear evident, become evident in future because when you put two companies together you find ways for years, I would say, for three, four years you find new ways to deliver synergies.", "Lisa Gill ", "Okay, great and congratulations Stefano on becoming CEO. I am glad that they named you so.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "George Hill", "Good morning or good afternoon guys, based upon on where you are and thanks for taking the questions. First one is for Alex. People have jumped in a bit on what margins have looked like. I guess we are further along in the year. Can you talk about what payer negotiations are looking like for kind of 1.1.16 [ph] contract restarts and I guess if things are proceeding according to expectation and how that squares with the fiscal \u201816 guidance that you guys have provided?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi George, yeah absolutely. So really as we expected and square on the guidance that we have given as well and I think the team have done a good job again in anticipating and making sure that we\u2019ve projected well and managed, as you said, in a very good way.", "George Hill", "Okay and then a follow-up I guess for George and for Stefano, which is, we're not too far away now from March of '16 when the first tranche of the ABC warrants become exercisable. I guess should we think about whether not there is any contribution from ABC equity earnings built into the fiscal '16 guidance and does Walgreens want to be a larger stock owner of Amerisource Bergen or should we think of the warrants as a value creation vehicle for Walgreens? Thank you.", "Stefano Pessina", "When we did the deal, we did the deal of course to improve our profit but also for strategic reasons because as you know we have always believed that a better coordination between wholesalers and retailers again create quite substantial synergy. So the reason for the deal are still there. So we will -- we have announced that what we intend to do and at the right time you will see the effect of these agreements.", "George Fairweather", "Really not a lot to add to that. I mean we will look at the right time, take the decision at the time. In terms of the accounting again, we will also look at that at the appropriate time. But from where we are today that when we direct the size of the warrant spend we anticipate being able to account for that as an equity method investment but clearly that will be -- it would have to be confirmed and discussed as to where we direct that.", "George Hill", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ricky Goldwasser ", "Hi, good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of questions here. First of all, just George you highlighted some of the differences between this quarter and upcoming quarter. Can you just share with us more details on the headwinds versus the tailwinds that we should be thinking of between the fourth and third quarter?", "George Fairweather", "I think really the first point to come through, as I sort of touched in the prepared comments was the primary component that we got to think about is the seasonality between the quarters which impact the sales and product mix. I'm thinking about the summer months very much tends to be our weakest months particularly in Alex\u2019s business at Retail Pharmacy USA segment, where we would see typically the sequential declines in the growth of both pharmacy volume and retail product sales. ", "The other factor is when the phasing and timing of certain expenses are, from in terms of the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and clearly when you go through the sort of programs that we are letting you try and [indiscernible] with you, but equally you need to keep everyone very focused on the business and driving through all the programs that Alex is working on. So there is always an element of timing on those where they eventually and how quickly we can deliver some of those. We are clearly going as fast as we feel we can in a straight line. ", "There\u2019s other areas I talked about, I mean clearly currency is a factor, as I touched on. But increasingly we have in terms of the internal factors we got pretty good visibility to our forecasting process and hence we're confident to both narrow and increase the guidance range for this year.", "Ricky Goldwasser ", "And when we -- you talked about, I think shutting -- closing down another 70 to 80 stores in the upcoming quarter. So should we see that through the gross margin line or the SG&A line?", "George Fairweather", "Yeah, you see that particularly through the SG&A line. Obviously we lose a few sales, but mostly sales we\u2019ve successfully transferred into adjacent stores. I think as you know we also closed a number of stores last year and we got up [indiscernible] more and we feel very confident of those. So the SG&A will come down and overall we will benefit and we will lose a few sales and a few bps of margin.", "Ricky Goldwasser ", "Okay, great and then one market related question. We are seeing a lot of kind of like your competitors making strategic moves around specialty. When you think about kind of like specialty as an opportunity for you, do you think that this is something that you can build internally by leveraging retail infrastructure in the U.S.? Or is this something that you think you need to go outside to add these capabilities. And also how you think about the specialty opportunity, U.S. versus ex-U.S. in Europe? ", "Stefano Pessina", "We don't exclude any opportunities. We are looking around, as I -- as we have said many times that we are analyzing all the opportunities for growth that we have. And at the right time and if the right opportunities come we'll be able to face them. ", "George Fairweather", "Yeah and if I can also add as well, Ricky that we are very focused on organic growth as well. We have got a very good model in the USA in community pharmacy and we're building relationships there with the doctors and with also you need access to get [indiscernible], also, and there\u2019s like HIV and cystic fibrosis we have opportunities that we can grow organically. So again we are not talking. This is an important business for us, and we are growing organically specifically in the USA.", "Ricky Goldwasser ", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Robert Jones", "Thanks for the questions and Stefano congratulations on the appointment. Obviously a number of moving pieces, but just really trying to get a better gauge of the underlying core U.S. business. And you guys talked about making good progress on the restructuring program, but is there any more details you can share with us on the savings that you've been able to generate to date? And then any break down of those savings, obviously across the segments would be really helpful in us being able to track the underlying business a little bit better. ", "Stefano Pessina", "We have an effort to be as clear as possible. ", "George Fairweather", "I really appreciate, I think here is what's [indiscernible] coming through and obviously what we said at the last time we were -- it was not practical for us to work through and try and restate everything on a comparable basis at the cost side and the margin side both. So that's why we tried to give you the adjusted figures. Clearly in terms of the cost savings program that is the big -- it is primarily in retail pharmacy USA, as we said the last time, but we are progressing in international but that is much, much more further on the program. But we're very much on track with where we expect to be, as I said earlier it won\u2019t necessarily [ph] go in a straight line and a disciplined structured way. ", "That's why we tried to give you little bit of a feel when you're actually looking at comparability I tried to touch on the retail pharmacy international margin, which I know some of you felt was perhaps a little bit lower than you were expecting in the second quarter but it only had two months in and that is a seasonable business. And the last quarter was the time when we seasonally we had lower sales, clearly we come out to the important Christmas time then we get the leverage of the fixed cost base, and that when the net margins will start -- will reflect that when you get seasonality. I do appreciate, how tricky it is to model which is why we gave the guidance going forward. ", "Robert Jones ", "No, I respect that too and I understand the comparability year-over-year is tough. I guess I was talking more specifically about just identifying what the cost cutting was in the actual quarter, this quarter itself. And maybe I missing something but I wouldn't think that would be that difficult to identify store closing, headcount reduction. ", "Alex Gourlay", "If I can maybe help a little bit, I mean we've done a good review of all of the projects that we are focusing in Q2. I think we've been really clear within the business, that we are focusing back in our core business of retail pharmacy frontend products, specialty. And therefore all of the other areas where we are building out, maybe potential future products we looked at to reduce the spend in some of these areas, to get more focused back on the core business. ", "So that really has been visiting our projects and we are really very confidence that the four [ph] and the $1.5 billion in savings that can be achieved.", "Robert Jones", "Yeah, fair enough. ", "George Fairweather", "To really reinforce what Alex just said, we've been putting a lot of internal work into the whole process of how we evaluate new initiatives, how we track initiatives. The graphs are not working and then you stop them, you don't let them drag on, if something really isn't working, you give it a good go and you stop it, new initiatives we've got a lot of, what I would describe as financial rigor that has been increasingly put in place really over the last 12 months. Alex you have put a lot in place when you took overall responsibility for the Walgreens business and we're continuing to do that. And I think it's that rigor that we're seeing then in terms of some of the SG&A coming through. ", "Robert Jones", "That makes sense. And I guess just one quick follow-up on Part D network specifically, there was a big initiative from your predecessors to get deeper into some of these preferred networks. I am curious how the economics of those networks have compared to your expectation. I know it\u2019s only about six months in. And then based on that feedback, any thoughts on your continued participation in these preferred networks going forward. Thanks. ", "Alex Gourlay", "Yeah, hi, it\u2019s Alex again. No, this is a really important customer, a really important market segment, it\u2019s a segment that\u2019s growing rapidly. So we remain very committed to this and in terms of, as I've said before we are in terms of next year\u2019s plans have almost completed all the contracts to their expectations in terms of margins that we planned for. So very committed to this business and we are [indiscernible], next year. Importantly for us of course we are only at the end of first stage. The second stage we just have, how do you make sure that you really look after the patients and the customers who come to your pharmacy and make sure you get the appropriate level of pull through in volume for your assets and that's the bit we are now turning attention to. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is open. ", "Alvin Concepcion", "Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on another great quarter and congratulations, Stefano. My question is just really around beauty, just curious how the tests are going in New York and Phoenix, are there any findings you could share from that? Particularly interested in if you think you're getting a sales lift in the aisle and if you're seeing much traction from No7.", "Stefano Pessina", "Of course you know the importance that we give to our brands and No7 is having a fantastic brand in the UK and internationally and it's one of our really hope for the future in daily wear [ph], but maybe Alex you can say what you are doing now for No7 and what you are expecting from it? ", "Alex Gourlay", "Yeah. We rolled No7 in to just over 400 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores in Phoenix and then in New York City. And the Phoenix is just over 12 months old and we will be able to measure the impact both on No7 sales, on Boots brand product sales and also on the beauty piece, and we're pleased with what we're seeing. So we are now trying to plan for the next stage of evolution of No7 and the Boots brand in Walgreens and the Duane Reade in the USA and we'll come out with these plans when they're ready, but we are pleased with the results. ", "Personally I am also pleased that we were able to acquire [indiscernible] I think in the previous quarter and also here this morning Liz Earle, going forward the more unique products that we're able to get into the Walgreens beauty and healthcare offer than more unique that will make our offer going forwards in what is a very competitive marketplace. ", "So again very pleased with the brand\u2019s performance, very pleased with the progress that Ken Murphy and the team has made and the brand organization is still very young and looking forward to getting these unique products in front of our customers in Walgreens in the future. ", "Alvin Concepcion", "And as a follow-up what were you thinking for the timing of the full rollout? ", "Alex Gourlay", "Yeah, we'll comeback with that. I mean we're really, I said before, we're just doing the work now, we\u2019ve got to get this right. This is a bigger space, it\u2019s fantastic brand as Stefano said in Europe and is growing really well in Europe. So we'll comeback when we're ready but we are not in position. ", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Your line is open. ", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Hi. I just wanted to inquire how comparable the US SG&A number is on a year-over-year basis, because it looked like there were some overhead allocations that changed versus a year ago. ", "George Fairweather", "I mean that they're not directly comparable, because clearly the -- with the corporate expense for example, as I said in my presentation, has to get allocated across the three divisions. Clearly we are also allocating the synergies which we talked about in terms of where the economic benefit is. So those results unfortunately are not directly comparable. And so that -- they come with a very big health warning. But I think what we have said is we are very pleased with the progress that we're making in reducing SG&A and we're very much on target to deliver the program that we announced in the last quarter. ", "Mark Wiltamuth", "So the numbers that are presented were down, but I guess on an apples-to-apples basis was the SG&A percentage down?", "George Fairweather", "I'd say on an apples -- there isn't apples-and-apples basis. That's the -- I guess that's the challenge that we got and simply and I think we said at the time we did the deal our priority was to get the deal done quickly. But one of the things that, that did enable us to do was to go back and rework everything on an apples-and-apples basis. But we're making good progress, that's the key message that I can see. But I know [indiscernible] it\u2019s not getting everything [indiscernible]. ", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay and I understand you're not announcing the international segments year-ago performance as well. But is there anything you can give us in terms of health indicators for margin and profitability on those international segments even though you don\u2019t have a GAAP presentation for us. ", "George Fairweather", "I think we can say that we're pleased with the performance at Retail Pharmacy International. Obviously Boots is the largest component that we're delivering solid performance in a market where there are quite a lot of challenges in that market that you see what's happening in some of the supermarkets sector for example. But I think this demonstrates that the strength of the offer, it's very important, of the differentiated retail offer particularly in beauty where Boots is renowned. We got out a very strong loyalty card program out. So obviously the great work that\u2019s been done here and taking Balance Rewards forward, the advanced card program equally important in the UK. ", "And then the piece what I touched on my presentation is really Omni channel where ordering online through Boots.com and picking up in store is important and of course with the geography that we got in the UK and the 2,500 points we can do that. And we can actually leverage our wholesale organization for delivery and we're able to do that in a profitable way that really meets the expectations of our customer. So that's the key point -- component in that. And wholesale, in any year like being in a number of markets you get markets that perform better and markets that are more challenging. It\u2019s just the way it always is but the division\u2019s delivered a solid performance and as its continued to do for many years. ", "Mark Wiltamuth", "And just on the International Retail Pharmacy, there was some commentary in the analyst meeting that the margin focus for growth was really shifting away to more of a sales growth story. Was there gross margin declines as you go through that transition to driving sales?", "George Fairweather", "We've not -- we've obviously not given the specifics on the comparability, because we don't have the numbers on that same U.S. GAAP, U.S. GAAP basis. But I continue to say that the business has performed solidly, and we are pleased with the performance in what's been a tough retail environment in the UK and that\u2019s fundamentally important. On the NHS side, on the -- the pharmacy side clearly the government seeks to continue to contain growth in healthcare expenditure. And so we haven't seen the details of the settlement yet, that\u2019s probably going to be towards the option, we\u2019ll have to wait and see on the timing on that. But we continue to see pressure in that area as we've seen for a number of years. So no real change but that pressure continues.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay, thank you for the color.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Stephanie I think we have time for just one more caller please, if we could.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken", "Hi good morning guys and congrats. So as you think about sort of the M&A landscape happening around you, obviously as far as you talked about lots of consolidation happening in managed care, we\u2019ve seen it in generics, we\u2019ve seen in the PDM space, where do you think, in terms of what is happening around you, it\u2019s most relevant to kind of your business or what are you watching most? And how do you think, particularly on the managed care side any of the changes there, how does that make you think about your longer term positioning from a healthcare perspective in this market?", "Stefano Pessina", "As I have said we can clearly see the need or the opportunity for horizontal and vertical consolidation in our industry and this is happening. In reality I believe that this is a good news for us because the consolidation, the horizontal consolidation will create a clear market and will give us more opportunities in future. What we will be able to do specifically is a little too early to say, but I repeat we want to be one of the players in this space and we see a lot of opportunities and the opportunities are really open along the chain, along the space of this healthcare industry.", "Ross Muken", "And I guess just quickly, just staying on the M&A theme, and I will keep this to my last question, but you and your team have been remarkably savvy deal makers over the course of your long career, and have created maximum amount of value. How much of the challenge is it today with where global equity markets are from a valuation standpoint, obviously understanding the financing markets are wide open, but valuations are pretty elevated and so how do you think about that in the context of your capital allocation goals, particularly on the deal side? Does it argue to smaller transactions or a certain geography? I am just trying to get a sense for how that plays into your thinking and the timing aspects of it.", "Stefano Pessina", "As you know we have been always [indiscernible] with potential acquisitions, so we will if we will have an opportunity we will analyze this opportunity very rationally and we will do it just if this will create additional value. It\u2019s true the market is now quite bullish but it\u2019s also true that the cost of the money is still quite low and there are other ways to create value, not just acquisitions, so we are analyzing all the opportunities. If we will see an opportunity which fit our strategy and which can create value we will take action.", "Ross Muken", "Great, thank you so much.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Okay, ladies and gentlemen that was our final question. Thank you all for joining us today. Feel free to contact myself or Ashish if you have any further questions. I know some of you do. And with that thank you very much indeed. We will conclude our call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

I'll turn things over to your host, Mr. Rick Hans. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, our President and CEO; and Wade Miquelon, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the quarter and update you on Express Scripts. Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Kermit Crawford, our President of Pharmacy, Health & Wellness Services; and Mark Wagner, President of Community Management.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our website at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliation.

Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "I'll now turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with our quarterly results. Second, I'll discuss the progress we're making on our strategies. And finally, I'll provide a brief update on Express Scripts, and then Wade will give you more details on our performance and the considerations for the year ahead. ", "Beginning with our results today. As you saw in our release this morning, we reported record first quarter sales of $18.2 billion, up 4.7% from $17.3 billion a year ago. First quarter net earnings were $554 million, and first quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.63. Compared to the prior year, the delay in cough/cold and flu season impacted net earnings per diluted share by $0.01, while the strategic decision to no longer be part of Express Scripts pharmacy network as of January 1, 2012, cost $0.01 per diluted share in comparable pharmacy sales and $0.01 per diluted share in related expenses. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $809 million, and free cash flow was $309 million. We returned $803 million to shareholders in the quarter, including the largest dividend payment in the company's history, and $601 million in stock repurchases, up nearly 18% over the first quarter last year. ", "Now I'd like to put this quarter's results into context. On our September call, we anticipated we would see challenging comparisons for gross profit dollar growth in the first quarter and we did. We were up against 2 strong prior year quarters. As we discussed, our first quarter is always impacted by volatility and the timing and the severity of the cough/cold and flu season, which this year is off to a slow start. We were also impacted by slower rate of generic introductions this quarter compared to the prior year quarter, and that impact will reverse and then accelerate through the fiscal year with the release of new generics, including generic Lipitor. Couple that with a step-down in pharmacy reimbursement, including July rate reductions from Express Scripts that were built into our current contract, and our year-over-year increase in gross profit dollars slowed to $159 million or 3.2%.", "Turning to SG&A dollar growth. We continued to invest in our strategies, focusing on our CCR store conversions, our health and daily living pilot stores and driving innovation in E-Commerce. While overall SG&A dollar growth came in at 5% excluding drugstore.com, our costs increased by 4.2%. The spread between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was negative $41 million. Recall, we really think about this spread over a longer period of time, not quarter-by-quarter. ", "As we look further into the results, we continue to see strength in our business fundamentals. We filled a first quarter record 208 million prescriptions, as our 90-day program continued to fuel growth. In fact, 90-day retail prescriptions grew by 37% year-over-year. Based on the most recent data from IMS, on a 30-day basis, our retail pharmacy market share was 19.9%, which is up 40 basis points from a year ago. We administered 5 million flu shots this flu season through November 30 compared to 5.6 million a year ago. We continue to deliver more flu shots than any other single entity outside of the U.S. government and to build a strong immunization program for adults and adolescents, which is an extension of our flu program. ", "In addition to our work in pharmacy, we maintained momentum in our front end despite weak cough/cold and flu. We completed the successful rollout of CCR, contributing to our front-end sales growth. We're striking the right balance between sales and margins as our front-end margins held steady compared to the first quarter last year. We're outperforming our nearest competitors on comps. And reinforcing the success of CCR, we continue to grow our market share in our targeted signature and power categories compared to food, drug and mass merchandise competitors, measured by the Nielsen company. For the 12-week period ended November 26, Walgreens gained share in key health and wellness, beauty and personal care product categories.", "Today, I'm going to focus my attention on 2 of our 5 key strategies: our efforts to transform our drugstores and to advance community pharmacy. In our new health and daily living pilot stores, we've stepped out of the traditional drugstore format and created something completely new. This new format brings together cutting-edge design with an improved product assortment, such as expanded fresh food and enhanced beauty experience and our growing private brand offering. Our goal is to create an experience unmatched in the industry. We're piloting these stores in Chicago and Indianapolis and with our flagship Duane Reade store at 40 Wall Street in New York and the soon-to-open Walgreens in Chicago's Loop. Customer response has exceeded our expectations. ", "In addition, we're excited about our initiative to convert stores located in food desert communities to food oasis locations with a much expanded fresh food offering. In fact, First Lady Michelle Obama recently spent some time with us in one of our Chicago stores on the south side and applauded our commitment to meet the nutritional needs of these communities. We plan to open or convert at least 1,000 food oasis doors in the next 5 years.", "With our new health and daily living stores, we're also advancing community pharmacy. We've made significant design changes in this area as well to enhance the patient experience. We've made our pharmacists even more accessible by bringing them out from behind the counter to fill the gap in access to healthcare services that exists in this country. We've more tightly integrated our retail clinics and pharmacies to create a real community health corner, and we now provide health guides to help patients better utilize the resources within our stores and navigate the broader healthcare community. We recently hosted Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius in one of our new health and daily living stores. In addition to receiving her flu shot from our pharmacists, the Secretary was very enthused with the role community pharmacy can play in the future of healthcare in this country. ", "Because of the work we're doing to transform our drugstores and advance community pharmacy, we are creating value for patients, health plans, employers and partners, and that's exactly what we've been hearing from our partners since we announced that we do not plan to be part of the Express Scripts network as of the 1st of the year. For today's update on Express Scripts, I'll focus on 3 topics: prescription retention, our cost-saving efforts and the path forward.", "Let's start with retention. As you recall, based on current estimates and the current assumption that we will not be in Express Scripts pharmacy networks beginning in January, including for clients such as TRICARE and WellPoint, we expect to achieve 97% to 99% of our fiscal 2011 prescription volume in fiscal 2012. We are reaffirming that today. To date, well over 100 health plans and employers and other Express Script clients have informed Walgreens that they have either changed Pharmacy Benefit Managers or taken steps consistent with their contracts to maintain access to Walgreen pharmacies in 2012. ", "In addition, we're in active negotiations with many health plans and employers to provide access to Walgreens in their networks as soon as their contracts allow. As part of those conversations, we're hearing from partners that this December has been the busiest in recent years for negotiations, as companies are putting their pharmacy benefit plans out for bid in unusual numbers. ", "Next, regarding our cost-saving efforts, we reiterate our commitment to reduce our total SG&A and cost of goods. This month, we've already implemented a number of actions at our corporate office, and we'll make any store-specific adjustments as needed after January, as we manage the transition from Express Scripts. ", "We're heading into the upcoming pharmacy benefit selling season with confidence in the value that Walgreens provides to patients and payers. We have a strong strategic foundation that gives us momentum, and our base costs are competitive. Building on our base, our industry-leading generic utilization and efficiency on new generics drive costs down with an estimated savings of $2 per script. ", "In addition, we help partners control costs through our leading 90-Day at Retail program, which generates approximately 7% savings compared to 3 30-day scripts. And with the growth we're seeing in that program, 37% this past year, it is clear that having Walgreens in the network can drive significant cost savings. We know through our discussions with employers, health plans and payers that there's great appreciation for the value we provide and a strong desire to protect their access to Walgreens.", "This was reaffirmed in a recent employer survey commissioned by Walgreens and administered by a third party that interviewed more than 800 respondents. The survey showed most employers would demand significant discounts from their PBM in return for excluding Walgreens from their pharmacy network. More than 80% of employers said they would not exclude Walgreens from their network for less than 5% savings on their total pharmacy spend. 60% of employers said they would not exclude Walgreens for less than 10% savings, and 21% would not exclude Walgreens from their network regardless of the savings. ", "To put these numbers in perspective, unlike other sectors of the healthcare industry where complex medical procedures can vary significantly in costs, the overall level of retail pharmacy reimbursements, on average, tends to vary modestly. The vast majority of pharmacy reimbursement falls within a narrow band, typically less than 5% of one another. Walgreens' unit prices fall within that narrow band and are especially competitive when compared with pharmacies that provide comparable levels of convenience and service, including drive-through pharmacies and 24-hour locations. ", "Also, as pointed out in a recent white paper by Catalyst, a case study client paid $6 less per prescription at Walgreens than the average of all the pharmacies combined. Our research is supported by a number of other studies in the marketplace that indicate customers value Walgreens in their network and would require savings to even consider switching. So for more information on the research, you can read this white paper we released yesterday. It's available on the IR section of our website. ", "To wrap up, it remains just as true today as it was in June when we announced our decision regarding Express Scripts. Patients and partners want Walgreens in their network, maintaining their personal relationship with the pharmacies they have come to trust and their access to our community pharmacies. We'll continue to drive home the value we bring to the marketplace, the choice, cost effectiveness, convenience and service we provide. We fully intend to work closely with our partners and customers to differentiate them with their clients because they have Walgreens in their networks. ", "Based on everything we're hearing from our partners, our customers and these survey results, we are more confident today than ever that we have made the right decisions. We believe very strongly in our ability to execute and in the unique value we offer to our patients, customers and partners. As a result, we are accelerating our strategies and focused on taking our company where the marketplace wants us to go. Our direction is clear, continue the transformation of work we have underway to improve access to quality care while lowering pharmacy cost and overall healthcare cost for our patients, partners and payers. ", "Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review the first quarter of fiscal 2012 in detail. I'll highlight the key considerations for upcoming quarters, and finally, update you on the financial impacts of our situation Express Scripts for the fiscal and calendar year. ", "So let me begin by saying that this quarter's comparable store sales were impacted by several important factors, including the slow start of this year's flu season and the unusual timing and severity of the 2010 flu season. To better understand the underlying trends, we are showing the 2010 comparable sales numbers for reference. As you can see in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, prescription sales increased by 2.6%, front-end sales increased by 2.4%, total sales increased by 2.5% and prescription scripts increased by 1.8%, all versus a year ago. As our trends over the past 13 quarters highlight, the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was unusually strong, driven by the H1N1 flu pandemic and the launch of our flu shot program, and this quarter's prescription comp is still impacted by that echo effect. Remember that last year's 2% script comp was on top of a prior year comp of 9.2%. ", "In addition to cycling strong 2-year trends, this quarter's 1.8% comparable script growth, shown in the green bars, was impacted by: the transfers of Walgreens' patients who had Express Scripts pharmacy benefit coverage, which had a negative 0.6% impact; the slow start to this year's flu season, which had a negative 0.6% impact; and flu shots, which had a negative 0.3% impact. ", "Overall, the prescription industry continues to experience lower utilization. And our 1.8% comparable prescription growth outperformed the industry, excluding Walgreens, by 2.3 percentage points, despite the headwinds we faced. Looking at our longer-term trends, the 2-year stack represented by the blue line also illustrates the impact of the unusual 2010 flu season, and we believe that smoothing out the 2010 flu season impact with a 3-year stack, shown by the red line, better represents the underlying health of our prescription business. ", "Front-end comparable store sales shown in the green bars increased by 2.4% in the first quarter, with our basket up by 2.6% and traffic declining by 0.2%. And we're very pleased with the solid comps in our signature, power and our staple product classes, led by categories including personal care, beauty, allergy and vitamins, all strategic health and wellness categories that we have refined through our CCR initiative. And we believe that front-end strategies that we have in place position us for continued profitable growth. ", "Finally, our customer remains value conscious, and we have responded with smart promotions and maintaining our share while increasing profitability in the front end. As this graph illustrates, when we restate our front-end comps to each of our 3 major retail pharmacy competitors on their calendars, we outperformed all of them, as we have done in each of the last 4 quarters. And we believe that our CCR resets and our other front-end initiatives that drive relevancy and have improved the customer experience are the primary driver of our performance. ", "Gross profit margin for the quarter was 28.1% versus 28.5% a year ago. The pharmacy gross margins were negatively impacted by reimbursement rates, including a step-down in Express Scripts rates versus a year ago and our growing 90-Day at Retail program, and this more than offset the positive impact of new generics. Front-end margins were neutral as we struck a good balance between sales and margins across our categories, especially given the tough comparison with prior year. ", "Looking at gross profit margin trends by segment, you can see the progression of our quarterly margin over the past 5 quarters. As this slide illustrates, this quarter, we were cycling an 80-basis-point improvement in gross margin versus a year ago and gross margin benefited from improvements in both the front end and the pharmacy. As the year progresses and especially in the second half, we expect our pharmacy gross profit margin to benefit as a result of the increased rate of introduction of new generics. ", "The first quarter of 2012 SG&A dollar growth of 5% reflects investments in key strategic initiatives. And the drivers were: new store openings, non-comparable drugstore.com expenses, investments to strategic initiatives and capabilities and costs associated with our plan to no longer be a part of the Express Scripts pharmacy network. On a 2-year stacked basis, our SG&A trends continue to be favorable, even as we invest in our core business. On a GAAP basis, first quarter 2012 2-year stacked growth was 12%, down from 14.4% a year ago and from 16.5% in 2010. ", "Adjusting for the onetime impact of our costs associated with our drugstore.com acquisition, our 2-year stack was 7.1%, down from 10.3% last year and down from 16% in 2010. This quarter's SG&A had 80 basis points of non-comparable impact from our drugstore.com acquisition, which closed in June. And so on an adjusted basis, our SG&A was 4.2%. ", "Taking a look at gross profit dollar growth over the past 2 years, you can see that we are cycling 2 strong prior year quarters. First quarter 2010 gross profit dollar growth of 9.3%, shown in the blue line, was driven by H1N1 and the 2010 flu season. And our 2011 gross profit dollar growth of 9%, shown in a green line, was driven by our Duane Reade acquisition. Both of the 2 prior year first quarters had a higher level of new store openings. ", "In addition to cycling strong prior year quarters, this quarter's gross profit dollar growth reflects some step-downs in reimbursement, a slow start to this year's flu season and a dearth of new generics. Beginning with the November 30 launch of atorvastatin, the new generic version of the brand Lipitor, we expect to benefit from acceleration in the rate of introduction of new generics, which should positively impact our gross profit dollar growth in the second half of the fiscal year. ", "Looking at our SG&A dollar growth in the same framework, we're cycling a 7% SG&A dollar growth in 2011, shown in the green line, following a 7.4% SG&A dollar growth in 2010, shown in the blue line. As you can see from our trends in both gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth, as we have highlighted in the past, we experienced quarter volatility primarily as a result of the timing of new generics, the timing of the flu season, the timing of our own initiatives. And this year will be no different. ", "Turning to additional income statement details. This quarter included a LIFO provision of $45 million versus $42 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate of 2% was the same as it was a year ago. Our net interest expense was $17 million versus $20 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 37.2% versus 37% a year ago, and our average diluted shares outstanding were 885 million, down from 934 million a year ago due primarily to our share repurchase program. ", "And moving to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion at November 30 versus $2.1 billion a year ago. Accounts receivable were $2.6 billion versus $2.5 billion a year ago. LIFO inventories were $8.2 billion versus $7.9 billion a year ago, and inventories were up due to new stores and the acquisition of drugstore.com. Also contributing to the increase were higher inventories in our pain, sleep and cough and cold categories compared to a year ago, given the slow start of the flu season. Accounts payable were $4.8 billion versus $5 billion a year ago, impacted by the sale of WHI, our PBM, and just the timing of payables. ", "Total working capital in the quarter was $6 billion versus $5.4 billion in last year's first quarter. And as a percent of sales, working capital was 33.3% this year versus 31.3% a year ago. I'd just like to say that, overall, we feel good about our working capital position, and we remain committed to making systemic improvement, such as reducing inventory, over time while maintaining and improving our in-stock and customer satisfaction levels. ", "Total FIFO inventory was up 5.7% in the quarter versus 6.6% a year ago and versus 10% in the fourth quarter of 2011. On a per-store basis, inventory was up 3.6% versus negative 0.4% a year ago and versus 7.2% in the most recent quarter. The increase in inventory per store is attributable to drugstore.com acquisition and the increases in certain front-end categories I mentioned, such as pain and sleep, cough/cold, et cetera, given the softer start to the flu season. And that will ultimately make its way through the system. ", "In the quarter, we invested $419 million in capital expenditures versus $273 million in the first quarter of 2011. As we've previously stated, for the year, we plan to invest $1.6 billion in capital expenditures versus $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011. The biggest driver of this year's projected capital expenditure increase versus 2011 level is related to information technology, with an investment in an upgraded point-of-sale system, including mobile point-of-sale and other wireless capabilities, to enhance the customer experience and employee efficiency. ", "First quarter 2012 cash flow from operations was $809 million versus $1.165 billion a year ago, and the difference is primarily driven by the change in working capital. Free cash flow was $390 million versus $892 million a year ago, reflecting, again, the year-over-year uptick in capital spending. So we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive strong free cash flow through the balance of this fiscal year. ", "We continue to emphasize our commitment to creating value for shareholders, returning record levels of cash to shareholders in fiscal 2010 and 2011. In the first quarter, we returned $803 million to shareholders, through a combination of $601 million in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. Recall, that we announced a 28.6% increase in our dividend per share at our July board meeting, the highest in the history of our company. Over the past 6 quarters, we have repurchased $3.4 billion of our stock, and we currently have $975 million remaining against our $2 billion share repurchase authorization that was approved in July 2011. ", "Now turning to an update of the financial implications of our decision regarding Express Scripts. I'm going to start with some comments on the value of including Walgreens in a pharmacy network, beginning with our cost effectiveness. Now Walgreens has a deep understanding of the pharmacy reimbursement landscape, given our experience of bringing other pharmacies into our store base through acquisitions, working with other PBMs and, until recently, owning our own PBM. ", "From our data and experience, we believe that the vast majority of pharmacy reimbursement, unlike other healthcare reimbursement, falls within a very narrow band, typically within 5%, as illustrated in the bell curve where reimbursement falls within the 5% range of a $60 average. While all of our data points suggest and Walgreens firmly believes that our baseline pharmacy reimbursement rates are absolutely competitive with the average of other retail pharmacies, even if we were to ponder Express Scripts allegations that we're at the high end of their range, there would be little or no net savings as a result of excluding Walgreens from a pharmacy network. ", "As shown in this example, even if you make the assumption that Walgreens was at the right end of a typical pharmacy range and couple that with our 20% market share, excluding Walgreens from a pharmacy network could save payers, on average, $0.30 on a $60 prescription or 0.5% of their total pharmacy spend. There has never been any evidence that we have seen to suggest that this level of savings is compelling to payers, and that is one of the reasons why narrow networks in pharmacy have never had meaningful traction. ", "Beyond competitive unit pricing and the value of our convenience, with the most drive-throughs and 24-hour stores in the industry, we believe that Walgreens provides additional measurable savings to payers through our industry-leading generic penetration and conversion rates, which we believes pay -- save payers approximately $2 on our scripts or $0.40 per script when using the 20% market share estimate. And our 90-Day at Retail solution, which we believe saves payers an additional 7% versus 3 30-day fills up to the level that they decide to convert to. ", "Our survey, which is supported by other data in the marketplace, revealed that over 80% of payers would require at least 5% of savings, which is 10x the level of savings in my example, even before factoring in generics and 90-day, and 60% of payers would require at least 10% of savings to accept the network that excludes Walgreens. Clearly, these level of savings, we believe, are unlikely to be achieved based on market information. ", "As we continue to execute against our health and wellness strategies, we believe the broader value of Walgreens is our opportunity to help lower total healthcare costs through expanding our clinical services, enhancing the role a pharmacist plays in the healthcare system, especially with respect to adherence and chronic disease management. To scale the opportunity, consider that if through optimal use of the pharmacy and pharmacy benefit payers could lower their overall spend on healthcare by 2%, the resulting savings would be the equivalent of saving 15% to 20% of total pharmacy cost. ", "Moving to the retention of Express Scripts prescriptions. I want to discuss a framework for how we develop the 25%, 50% and 75% hypothetical retention scenarios for calendar year 2012. Reiterating Greg's comment, the 100-plus payers that have already informed us that Walgreens remain in their pharmacy networks in 2012 represents approximately 10 million prescriptions or 11.4% of the total, as shown in the slide in the dark blue. These 10 million prescriptions are a combination of PBM switches and direct contracts, and it continues to grow. ", "With respect to the other building blocks, the feedback we have received from the market, including our ongoing discussions with employers, managed-care companies and PBMs, and supported by our survey, gives us confidence that we are well positioned to retain a significant level of available Medicare Part D, small plan and other payer scripts. Recall that CMS publish Medicare Part D enrollment data and that will be -- information be available in mid-July -- mid-January. ", "Looking at this slide, the hypothetical scenario in which we retained 50% of available Part D scripts and approximately 25% of all other available plan prescriptions gets us to 22 million scripts or 25% of the 88 million prescriptions that we fill on behalf of Express Scripts clients in 2011. While uncertain, we still believe that it's possible to retain or recapture the nearly 25 million prescriptions represented by WellPoint members, which if we were successful there, would get us to 50% of a going retention run rate. ", "And finally, we continue to offer our ironclad price guarantee to the DOD. We remain committed to serving our military personnel, and we are still working to retain this prescription volume as well, which, if combined with the others described above, would enable us to achieve a 70% retention run rate with respect to Express Scripts prescriptions we filled last year. Apart from our ironclad guarantee, recall that well over 250,000 military personnel had signed a petition urging Express Scripts to allow them to access Walgreens. Clearly, this is a very significant number for a petition by any standard. The percentages in these retention scenarios for the calendar year would be affected in the event that the business is recaptured for only part of the year, with the full percentage effect realized as we cycle the relevant retention date. ", "Finally, we're converting these numbers to a fiscal year impact. We estimate that prior to January 1, we have already filled approximately 29.5 million of the 88 million Express Scripts prescriptions. If we apply what we already believe we have retained and factor in an underlying growth of the business, we believe we can achieve 97% to 99% of our fiscal 2011 prescription volume in fiscal 2012. Recall that our 97% to 99% retention estimate excludes any prescription retention from WellPoint and the DOD and makes no assumption regarding the proposed Medco merger. ", "In our September 27 earnings call, we provided 3 hypothetical scenarios for the potential fiscal 2012 earnings impact of moving forward without participating in Express Scripts pharmacy network beginning January 1. Recall our 3 scenarios, we're retaining 25%, 50% and 75% of the annualized prescriptions and associated revenue retention. At each of these scenarios, we believe that we can offset the gross profit dollar impact of lost Express Scripts prescription volume by 50% through a combination of planned cost of goods and SG&A interventions already in place, and which Greg has mentioned before, we have already begun implementing at corporate. ", "Because we will continue to serve our patients through the transition, substantial portion of our cost savings will be realized in the second half of the fiscal. Using this framework, as we have previously stated, under the 25% retention scenario for January 1 to August 31, 2012 period, we estimate the impact of fiscal 2012 earnings will be approximately negative $0.21 per diluted share, and we continue to stand by these estimates. ", "Well, I want to close today by emphasizing that we understand the near-term challenges we face as a result of not being in the Express Scripts pharmacy network, and the angst that this has created for the investment community, given that no one likes uncertainty. However, I want to assure you that our beacon has been and always will be doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. And what we are hearing from payers and the marketplace at large, supported by our recent survey, reinforces our belief that payers, large and small, are not interested in a network that does not include Walgreens.", "We understand the near-term impact on our gross profit dollars, but again believe it's absolutely the right long-term decision for our company, our employees and our shareholders. We are not standing still. We have committed to and have begun implementing cost-savings plans to offset 50% of the gross profit impact for the scenarios I've outlined. And as previously framed, we have progressive plans to help other partners win back this business as time progresses. ", "Respect to our underlying business, I have never been more confident in our strategies and our opportunities. On top of that, we have a unique and powerful set of assets, a dual tailwinds of an aging population and the generic wave, the tremendous opportunity to leverage our assets to play a much broader and major role in our nation's healthcare system by offering quality, affordable and convenient access to health and daily living needs. As the puck is shifting, we are skating to it. We'll continue to make business investment and capital decisions to drive our strategy, and we are focused on creating long-term shareholder value, including delivering on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. ", "I want to thank you for your support, and now turn the call back over to Rick for Q&A.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "In the white paper, you highlight that half of the employers have options to contract separately with Walgreens, and I think you talked about a number of those employers think there would be a resolution. But is that the main reason why you think that you've not gotten more of them to contract directly with you thus far? And for those that haven't yet, how many do you think may be able to do so in 2012?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Mark. I think that many, as we've said, were waiting toward the end to see if, indeed, we'd settle. And I think what's encouraging is the fact that they do have a clause to exit their PBM contract. And I think what we're hearing is that many are actually thinking about it and talking about doing that next year and going out to RFP.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. Also remember that 2 clients for Express Scripts represent 50% of their business, right. But as we said, we've seen a very good traction. It's literally evolving by the day. So I think it's playing out in a very positive way.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "The impact that you see if you can offset half of the gross profit loss, would that be proportional across the quarters or would that impact the -- more front weighted? How should we think about that flowing through the year?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "You expect to have a little more impact in Q2, because as we said, we're making sure that we provide stellar level of service through January to help all of these patients, make sure they're taken care of and navigated properly.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I'd agree with that. We've spent a little extra money on purpose in this quarter, to make sure that we were allowing our pharmacist to have quality time with their patients, especially during the Med D enrollment period. And I think to Wade's point, we want to make sure we're taking care of patients in January. So it's most likely be back half weighted.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Then on my last question, can you give us some sense of what tolerance you have on debt to capital, given this more intense impact upfront and given your long-term beliefs? How aggressive can you be on share repurchases that are potentially you could do more during this period?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I guess, Mark, I'm only at liberty to talk about the fact that we're executing the plan we've got aligned. So as you know, we're halfway through the $2 billion plan. We continue to be aggressive and ahead of schedule on that, but that's really all I can say at this time.", "Operator", "Next up, we have Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask you a question about sort of looking down the road. And Medco has obviously been a part of the discussion here, that is the Medco merger with Express, from about a month after you made the decision to dissociate from Express. And it would seem as if the impact to sales would be similar and the impact to earnings would be greater from -- than initially walking away from Express. What would that do to your ability to return capital to shareholders? And how are you thinking about your capital plan, given the need to think about that contingency?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Matt, Greg. I'll take the first half, maybe let Wade comment on the capital plan. I think -- obviously, we think that if we -- that we deserve a fair and acceptable reimbursement compensation for the services we provide, and that's what this issue is about with Express Scripts so we wouldn't accept anything different from any PBM, including Medco. Can't comment on the proposed merger, but in addition, keep in mind that Medco's book of businesses is much less than it was a year ago. And we think with the uncertainty in the marketplace next year, that they're going to be -- they're going to have a challenged selling season as well. We're working with all of our partners out there right now to help them find a solution that would have Walgreens in it, so.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. I mean, I would just say this, too, we hear the same thing from the Medco clients as we do from Express clients, which is they want Walgreens in the network, and they're going to want to have it. And the advantage they're going to have is they're going to have more window here of visibility to explore their options and probably more change of control provisions and other ways to direct their contracts. So we're very convinced that these clients are going to want Walgreens, and they'll have the luxury of time, hopefully, to find alternatives to do so.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then one other question, actually, on the near term. The payables ratio came down a chunk year-over-year. How should we think about the driver of that? And what direction do you expect it to move in?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. Little bit of an anomaly of just the WHI sale, but a lot of it is just payables can just really flow month-to-month on the month end. And so this will work its way out. So it\u2019s just really just an anomaly.", "Operator", "Next up with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we have Ed Kelly.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Could you guys give us maybe your best update on how negotiations have progressed over the last 6 months with Express? And I guess what I mean by that is, has there been any movement whatsoever? And I've heard you kind of talking about a difference of maybe $4 to $5 per script, is that the delta that we're still looking at?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. Ed, I'll start off with this. As I like to say all the time, we're in the business to fill scripts. And certainly, we need fair reimbursement, but we're always open. I will say that we made another serious attempt last week to get an agreement before January 1 to minimize patient disruption. Unfortunately, the response we got back was not very meaningful, and more importantly, the response was suggested to kick the can down the road past January 1, which, frankly, doesn't do anything to minimize the disruption for our patients, WellPoint's patients and Express Scripts' patients. So we're moving on, but we're always open. As I said, we're in the business to fill scripts at fair reimbursement, but -- that's the latest update I can give you.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Greg, what do you mean by kick the can down the road as a response?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Past January 1. Our focus is to minimize the patient disruption, and there's going to be a lot of disruption in the marketplace beginning January 1. And we look to make one last attempt to try to prevent that, and the timeliness of that does not make sense for us.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So we should consider that kind of like your last and best offer?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "As I said, I'm always open. We're in the business to fill scripts, but that was our best attempt to try to prevent the disruptions. It's going to -- it's really going to happen in the marketplace January 1, and I hope the folks don't underestimate the disruption that this is going to cause.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "All right. So getting back to Medco, I mean, how should we begin to think about the Medco contract assuming obviously that Express does close on this deal? How has that weighed on your decision to not accept Express's offer?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I would say it hasn't changed our opinion one bit. Getting a bad deal with one party doesn't make you feel any better about getting a bad deal with 2. The reality is the people at Medco's network they value Walgreens network. They feel they're getting fair services for what we provide. And as long as we can keep compensated fairly for what we do, that's probably fine. But all the data suggests, those clients are going to want Walgreens in the network, and like I said, they'll have to look at all their options. And if it does happen with the luxury of time, we're very confident that we'll have that business one way or another as well. Ed, I think it's important to point out that, frankly, we're feeling more and more confident about this decision every day. We have plans, health plans, PBMs coming to us daily looking for the opportunity to differentiate themselves next year by having us in their network versus those that don't. And when you think about the fact that we absolutely are convinced that there is no significant cost savings, and in fact, by removing us, there may be increase in cost and the fact that you've got Walgreens in the network versus no without, we're encouraged by partnering with the folks that are out there looking to differentiate themselves and win in the marketplace next year.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Then I guess what I don't understand is that you clearly make the case that it's not that much cost savings and a lot of disruption. And it doesn't really seem on the surface, if I just listen to this call, to make any sense that you're in this situation today, and yet you look at Express Scripts, right, and Express Scripts has shareholders to answer to as well. So I just -- I don't understand basically why we're seeing this today if all that is fair.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, clearly, their spread model obviously doesn't work if we don't pay them the rates that they want from us. But obviously, we just expected 2 principles of being compensated fairly for what we do and also not advantaging any one payer substantially versus others, unless there's a reason to warrant it. And as long as we stand by that principle, we're going to be just fine with or without them. And we would agree. We don't understand the fact. But frankly, Express Scripts\u2019 desire to force narrow networks based on cost is only accelerating our ability to create deeper preferred partnerships with our partners based on both value and cost, and that's where we're headed.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So just back to this Medco contract for a second. If you were to accept Express Scripts offer on that Medco contract, how big of a hit would that end up being? Because I -- I mean, I've heard from your peers that the Medco's reimbursements are actually better than Express Scripts' reimbursements. Is that right?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, we're not going to talk about any client obviously, but the fact that we have an issue right now with Express Scripts and not Medco tells you something. But we feel we get fair with all payers, including Medco, but we're not getting fair compensation with Express. And that's why we've done what we've done.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "All right. One last question for you. Just let\u2019s take a step back for a minute and think about sort of longer-term strategy, right. Because it's kind of clear that drug retail seems to becoming a more challenging business. I mean, we hear your peers talking about reimbursement pressure. You've obviously got this dispute with what's potentially soon to be the biggest PBM out there. How has it changed the way you're thinking about corporate strategy? And what I mean by that is, do you view your business as maybe you need more scale and maybe M&A is a way to take care of that? Or do you look at the PBM retail model differently than maybe you have in the past?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. Ed, good question. Frankly, I think what it does is get us more excited about our strategy and the need to even accelerate it and the opportunity to accelerate it. Frankly, as I said, this skirmish is moving the marketplace more toward us. The other hundreds of payers out there are looking to work more closely with us, and that's actually helping us. So we're excited about the strategic direction we're headed in. We're excited about the value the community pharmacy can and will play in the future, and frankly, we're accelerating.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I think Greg's completely right. I mean, in the bigger picture, we've got many, many tailwinds. We've got the generic wave coming on. We've got the aging population. But I think even more importantly, people are saying how can a valued community pharmacy and this 12% of spend help me and enable me to save on the other 88% of spend. And that's a huge opportunities for us to play, not only in pharmacy, but beyond that, into the health and daily living space that we're evolving to. So I'm optimistic on the space. I think we've got a great future ahead. We just have to play our game.", "Operator", "We'll move next to John Heinbockel, excuse me, with Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Guys, couple of things. Have you heard anything at all from WellPoint or there's been radio silence there as it relates to you?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "We've been in discussions with WellPoint as we are with all our payers over the last several months, but we can't comment specifically on what's going on with WellPoint.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Secondly, you would think if Medco-Express goes through, there would be -- to some degree, there would be a value in you having a closer, an even closer relationship with Caremark. And obviously, if CVS didn't own it, that might be easier. Does that -- does the fact that CVS is a competitor on the retail side complicate that ability to have a closer relationship with them strategically, on the PBM front?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "John, I would say no. As I said earlier, we're in the business to fill scripts. We're looking to partner with anybody who wants to leverage having us in their network. And frankly, I think the opportunity to have a wider, broader network, including Walgreens in Caremark's network, is an opportunity and advantage for Caremark. So we're absolutely interested and willing to work with Caremark.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. I think common ground we both have, is we both have and both value community pharmacy. It's part of who we are, and I think that's a common ground we can work from.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If January 1 comes and goes -- I mean, people often ask, could you January 5 or 10 or whatever come to an agreement, obviously, you can come to an agreement at any point, but just practically, it almost doesn't make sense if we go past the 1st to do it until something is proven out right in theory. The white paper you guys have laid out, that has to get proven out. So it almost seems like if January 1 comes and goes, it's going to take a while for the 2 sides to get back together and work together again. It's not an overnight thing. Is that fair?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think that's right.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. John, as I said, we made our last attempt last week. So that we'd minimize the disruption January 1. I think once it crosses January 1, there's going to be a lot of disruption in the marketplace. And frankly, that's why we're locked and loaded, and we're moving on.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Plus, as we partner with others who are very eager to win new business, we need to picture that tactic if we cross that January 1 line and make sure that we work with them and help them continue these partnerships.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Do you -- have you done any work to see if you lose a script to somebody and it's gone for -- let's say, the PBM contract changes hands next year, but it's gone for 6 months or it's gone for a year, what's the -- maybe this has -- it has never happened before, but what's the percentage likelihood of getting that script back? Is it 50-50 after 3 months? Is it 25-75 after 6? Have you done any work on that?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. John, let's put it this way, when we have -- had been forced out of plans in the past, what we have seen is that patients return much more sooner than they do if they choose on their own to go elsewhere. So there -- if the patient is forced to go somewhere and then we are back in that plan, they return to us much sooner than they do if they just chose that -- they made that decision on their own.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes. But what did you find in terms of timing though? How quickly -- what was the time lapse there for them -- for you to be back in that plan?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "It varies by plan, by market and by market share.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Then one final, just housekeeping thing. If you look at -- your pharmacy gross looks like down about as much as it's been in 2 years. How much of that was the Express reset? Was that half of it, or was that not that big?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I\u2019ll just say it was material, but I won\u2019t say more than that.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So there's reimbursement broadly?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "It was a meaningful step-down in the number.", "Operator", "Next up with Cleveland Research, we have Eric Bosshard.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I'm just curious if you can provide a little bit of color on the retention number, the retention expectation in these next couple of months, specifically -- I know you've outlined where retention might be. But in January, February, March, what would you expect the retention number to be?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Eric, let me start, and then Wade can fill in a little more. What's encouraging is, as I said, I think, in my prepared remarks, the activity that we've seen in December with our partners is excessive compared to what a normal season is. That's encouraging. People that are now beginning to realize this could be major disruption for their employees are moving. We think that, that will continue on through January, February and March, as people begin to really realize what this will do. So we -- it's hard to put a number on it, but we think the -- typically, when there is almost no activity in January, February and March, there will be activity this January, February and March.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. I would just say, you can see that we've got the 11.4% basically. They're kind of in the bank. Again, we feel pretty good about winning back a meaningful part of Med D. What is it exactly? We won't know. But it will be meaningful, we believe. This all other -- there's just a lot of plans. We don't even know what they are. And every day, we're getting notification of one more that we didn't know, so we don't know in that bucket what we don't know until we get there. And then of course, these other big blocks, what remains to be seen with DOD or WellPoint is -- I know but -- I think we feel pretty good about the progress we're making, and we'll keep making it.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Within sort of -- and I appreciate that the Part D you don't know until you get, I guess, into January and some of these other plans you don't know. But is it reasonable or logical, just trying to get a sense, that the January number is going to be at the lower end of whatever it's going to be? I mean, how -- I guess I'm just trying to figure out how it might step up from month-to-month, and if January could be this 11% number and then it would work its way higher from then. That's what I'm trying to better understand, but...", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, I think it will continue. I mean, I've always said that whatever happens on January 1, in that period, we've always viewed that as that's going to be our toughest period, because we know, we\u2019ll disproportionally get business back with other parties that value having us in their network. So whatever that is, it will continue to grow. The rate at which it grows, I think, remains to be seen, but all the market indications, everything we're seeing and hearing, everything our survey validates basically says that it's really a matter of time before people find an option to get what they want.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then secondly, with these plans that you're negotiating directly with to get back into the plan, are you making any concessions to them? Is there any pricing change or reimbursement change that you're offering as an inducement for them, or is that part of the deal?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "No, Eric. In most cases, once they realize what the rates are that we're offering, they realize those are pretty darn good rates.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. I think exactly that's right, and I think it also affect those principle, too, of being fair with all the people that we deal with.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "And, Eric, I'd just like to add the fact that in addition to our belief and the research we've done, that our baseline costs are extremely competitive. The opportunity for a client to take advantage of not only our generic utilization, but also our 90-Day at Retail offering, there are significant savings opportunity out there for clients. That if they were indeed given the opportunity to add a 90-Day Retail benefit on top of an existing mail benefit, there is -- there are ample savings for clients, and that's what we're pushing.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Eric, I'll say one more thing, too. I think what this thing has done is -- recall in the past, we haven't been able to talk or work with a lot of these clients directly. So they've never -- many of them have never known what our actual rates are. Now as many are coming and able to look at our direct rate, I would say the general feeling is a bit of surprise that our rates were much more competitive than they thought. And I think the thing is that now they're starting to understand the spread in the middle versus the actual rates, and I think that that's a good development. And I think we want people to know that we're very competitive with other pharmacies.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Unfortunately, a 1,000-employer shop -- Joe's garage shop has no idea what rate that Walgreens is giving to their PBM.", "Operator", "Next up, we'll take a question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Brian Wang - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is actually Brian Wang on for Meredith. Just to change things up a little bit. Our question is actually around the front end. How long do you expect the benefits of the CCR initiative to last? And are you seeing above-average comps in year 2 of the CCR stores that were first converted?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. Brian, we feel confident with CCR. You keep in mind, CCR wasn't just a static initiative. We're continuing to improve and add content, enhance product assortment, so forth. So we call it -- internally, we call it CCR 1.0, 2.0 and whatever, but -- so CCR was just a much-needed refresh, few reduction and some improvement of systems to help us manage our business better.

I\u2019m Rick Hans, Walgreen's Director of Finance, and I invite you to use this information in conjunction with the press release and other financial information posted on our Web site.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to go over the safe harbor language. Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K as amended for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Today we announced third quarter earnings were up 19.6% to $561 million, or $0.56 cents per share diluted. That came on a sales increase of 12.5% to $13.7 billion. This year\u2019s quarter includes a $13.5 million credit from the resolution of a multi-year state tax matter, compared to a $13.6 million tax credit in the year-ago quarter from the settlement of prior years\u2019 federal tax matters.", "We also decreased our LIFO inflation index in the third quarter, resulting in a LIFO credit of $3.5 million this quarter versus a provision of $24.2 million in the year-ago period. The lower index reflects less inflation than anticipated among pharmacy inventories.", "For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, sales increased 14.5% to $40.3 billion. Net earnings rose 22.9% to $1.64 billion or $1.63 per share diluted. This year\u2019s nine-month earnings also benefited from the lower LIFO rate, while both this year\u2019s and last year\u2019s nine-month earnings include the previously mentioned tax benefits.", "Front-end or non-pharmacy sales continued a strong showing in the quarter. During the most recently reported 52-week period, we gained market share in 56 of our top 60 core product categories versus our drugstore, grocery and mass merchant competitors compared to a year ago.", "This year\u2019s store growth continues on target. We opened 129 new stores in the third quarter, including 35 acquisitions. For the first nine months of the fiscal year we opened 352 stores, including 43 acquired stores. That puts us on schedule to open about 500 new stores in fiscal 2007, including more than 400 net new locations. Our store count as of May 31st is 5,751, a net increase of exactly 500 from a year ago. We\u2019re on track to exceed 7,000 stores in 2010.", "Taking a closer look at sales, total comparable drugstore sales for stores open more than a year were up 7.8% in the quarter, while front-end comparable drugstore sales rose 5.6%. Pharmacy sales climbed 13.8% overall and 9% on a comparable drugstore basis in the quarter. The number of prescriptions filled in comparable drugstores rose 5.4%.", "Gross profit margins increased 84 basis points versus the year-ago quarter to 28.3 as a percent of sales. Both pharmacy and front-end margins showed improvement. While pharmacy margins increased with the growth in generic drug sales, some of that benefit was offset by an overall sales shift toward the pharmacy business, which carries lower margins than front-end merchandise. Margins on the front-end increased as a result of a shift in mix toward higher margin items. The lower LIFO inflation index in the quarter also helped gross profit margins.", "Meanwhile, selling, occupancy and administration expenses increased 41 basis points to 22.06 as a percent of sales, mostly due to increases in store level salaries and expenses. The impact of new, lower-cost generic drugs, which slowed pharmacy sales growth by 5.1 percentage points and total sales growth by 3.4 percentage points in the quarter, continued to affect expense ratios.", "Operating income for the third quarter increased 43 basis points over the previous year to 6.24 as a percent of sales.", "The effective tax rate for the third quarter this year was 35.2%, compared to 35.12% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The effective tax rate for the first nine months of this year was 36.23%, compared to 36.35% in the year-ago period. We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be 36.75%.", "The consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows can be found within our press release. Cash and short-term investments decreased from $1.8 billion at the end of last year\u2019s third quarter to $758 million at the end of this year\u2019s third quarter.", "Accounts receivable decreased 1.9% and accounts payable decreased 0.6%. The declines are a result of less Medicare Part D business in our pharmacy benefit management unit. You\u2019ll recall our PBM\u2019s contract with United Health Group\u2019s Ovations unit ended last Dec. 31.", "LIFO inventories were $6.46 billion, a 16.5% increase from the year ago quarter. Pharmacy inventories in the stores were impacted by recent generic introductions, which left us with some excess supply of brand medicines. In addition, warehouse inventories were impacted by the new distribution center opening in Anderson, South Carolina.", "Meanwhile, for the first nine months depreciation and amortization increased 21.3% from $409 million to $496 million. This is due in part to the amortization of intangibles from prescription file buys and the acquisitions of the Happy Harry\u2019s pharmacy chain and Medmark Specialty Pharmacy Solutions.", "Capital expenditures for the nine months were $1.25 billion versus $907 million last year.", "Since announcing a new $1 billion share repurchase plan in January, we\u2019ve repurchased 5.6 million shares of stock for $257 million.", "During the past quarter, our main focus and biggest opportunity continued to be drugstore expansion. This will drive our company\u2019s growth well into the future as we remain on track to operate more than 7,000 stores in 2010.", "And as more industry consolidation takes place, we\u2019ll consider select acquisitions such as the one that resulted in this quarter\u2019s opening of 30 former Familymeds Group pharmacies.", "We\u2019re also looking for other pharmacy-related healthcare opportunities, which is why we acquired convenient care clinic operator Take Care Health Systems in May. Our initial rollout of more than 400 clinics by the end of calendar 2008 won\u2019t have the same impact as opening 400 drugstores but they will be central to our future expansion of other patient-focused health care services.", "Another milestone reached during the quarter was the opening of our 12th distribution center in Anderson, South Carolina. This new facility is special because of the inclusive work environment that our distribution and logistics division created. More than 42% of the facility\u2019s current workforce of 275 has a physical or cognitive disability, making it the first facility of its kind to employ a significant number of people with disabilities.", "Randy Lewis, our senior vice president of distribution and logistics who led the way to create this work environment, always points out that this isn\u2019t charity work. Instead, employees with disabilities work side-by-side with all other facility employees, earning the same pay and benefits, doing the same work and meeting the same productivity goals.", "On top of all of that, the distribution center will be 20% more efficient than our previous generation of DCs.", "As Walgreen shareholders, you can take as much or more pride in this initiative as anything else the company is doing. We\u2019ll have the same hiring approach with our next distribution center scheduled to open in 2009 in Connecticut, where we again hope to surpass our goal of hiring a workforce where at least 30% of the facility\u2019s employees have a disability. You can learn more about this effort on the Internet at www.walgreensoutreach.com.", "Thank you for listening. Our next earnings announcement for the fourth quarter and fiscal year-end of 2007 is scheduled for October 1st. Once again, thanks for being a loyal Walgreen shareholder, and remember -- you\u2019re always welcome at Walgreens.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

I\u2019m Rick Hans, Walgreens\u2019 Director of Finance, and I\u2019d like to thank you for tuning in. We invite you to use this information in conjunction with the press release and other financial information posted on our web site.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to go over the safe harbor language. Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Before we review our earnings, I\u2019d like to address Wal-Mart\u2019s announcement last week regarding the selected generic medications that they\u2019ll offer for $4. Our initial review of the program leads us to believe it won\u2019t significantly impact our business. Nearly 95% of our pharmacy patients have prescription insurance coverage, meaning they\u2019re responsible only for a small co-pay. For the 291 drugs that Wal-Mart will sell for $4, the average co-pay at Walgreens is $5.30 and for Medicare Part D patients, it\u2019s only $3.18.", "I should also point out that Wal-Mart\u2019s program covers less than 300 generic medications, while our pharmacies stock about 1,800 different generics. Over the years, our convenience, locations and services have proven to be bigger factors for our patients than a few dollars in price difference.", "Getting back to our earnings results, today we announced our 32nd consecutive year of record sales and profits, while we recorded our biggest store expansion year in company history. Including acquisitions and stores affected by Hurricane Katrina, we had a net increase of 476 new stores in fiscal 2006. We plan even more organic growth in fiscal 2007 with the anticipated opening of 500 new drugstores, for a net increase after relocations and closings of more than 400 stores.", "This past fiscal year saw other significant developments at Walgreens:", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter income statement. You\u2019ll see our sales ended Aug. 31st were up 16.0% to a record $12.2 billion. Net earnings for the quarter were up 25.3% to $412 million or $0.41 per share, diluted. Fiscal 2006 sales were up 12.3% to $47.4 billion, while fiscal year net earnings rose 12.3% to $1.75 billion or $1.72 per share, diluted.", "Last year\u2019s quarter includes $54.7 million of pre-tax expenses related to Hurricane Katrina. This year\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were reduced by $18.8 million pre-tax for employee stock option program expenses, as required by accounting regulations. Last year, these options weren\u2019t expensed. The quarter also includes $7.3 million in pre-tax litigation gains.", "While this year\u2019s earnings were reduced by $102.5 million pre-tax for employee stock option program expenses, they benefited from the reversal of $12.3 million of last year\u2019s $54.7 million in estimated Hurricane Katrina pre-tax expenses. Fiscal 2005 also includes $26.3 million in pre-tax litigation gains versus the previously mentioned $7.3 million in fiscal 2006.", "Walgreens prescription sales increased 18.0% in the fourth quarter and 13.3% for the year, even with the drag of a mild flu season last winter. Prescription sales in comparable drugstores \u2013 that\u2019s stores open more than a year \u2013 rose 12.3% in the quarter and 9.2% for the year.", "As many of you are well aware, we\u2019re dispensing more generic drugs, which have higher profit margins than name-brand drugs but also slow our pharmacy sales increases because of their lower price. That\u2019s why we believe a better indicator of pharmacy performance is the number of prescriptions filled. And in fiscal 2006, that number increased 8.1% to 529 million. On a comparable store basis, the number of prescriptions filled in fiscal 2006 increased 4.5% .", "Total comparable drugstore sales were up 9.7% for the quarter and 7.7% for the year. Front-end comparable drugstore sales rose 5.2% for the quarter and 5.3% for the year.", "Our gross profit margins for the fourth quarter decreased 31 basis points versus the year-ago quarter to 27.64 as a percent to sales. This quarter includes a LIFO charge of $26.1 million versus a credit of $2 million a year ago. The total LIFO charge in fiscal 2006 was $95.3 million versus $67.8 million the previous year.", "Also contributing to the margin decrease were lower pharmacy margins from additional Medicare Part D business along with the continued shift in our overall sales mix toward prescriptions, which carry lower margins than front-end merchandise. Partially offsetting those factors was the introduction of new, higher margin generic medications. Front end margins increased slightly as a result of a shift in sales mix to higher margin items.", "We recorded a 75-basis point decrease in selling, occupancy and administration expenses to 22.45 when measured as a percent to sales. Benefiting the SO&A ratio were the impact of hurricane expenses on last year\u2019s quarter, and lower store salary and rent expenses as a percent of sales. Those factors were partially offset by expenses for employee stock option programs.", "The effective tax rate for this year\u2019s fourth quarter was 36.7% versus 35.1% for the same period a year ago. Last year\u2019s lower tax rate primarily resulted from foreign tax credit adjustments.", "The consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows can be found with our press release. For the year, cash and short-term investments increased from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion as of Aug. 31.", "Accounts receivable increased 47.7%, while accounts payable increased 38.4% . Both were driven by growth in our pharmacy benefit management business under the new Medicare Part D prescription plan.", "LIFO inventories increased 8.2% versus a year ago on a fourth quarter sales gain of 16.0% . The improvement came mainly from lower days of supply at store level, both in the pharmacy and the front-end.", "Finally on the statement of cash flows, capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 were $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2005. The company expects to invest approximately $1.7 billion in fiscal 2007 on capital investments, reflecting an expected increase in new stores, technology and a new distribution center in South Carolina scheduled to open by summer 2007.", "For the fiscal year 2006, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of stock for $290 million under our four-year, $1 billion share repurchase plan announced in July 2004. To date, we have repurchased 15.2 million shares for $657 million.", "With our 32nd consecutive year of record sales and earnings wrapped up, we\u2019re looking forward to the opportunities that 2007 will present. One of those opportunities continues to be the Medicare Part D prescription plan, under which we\u2019re seeing more seniors fill their prescriptions at our pharmacies.", "As I mentioned earlier, 2007 will be another big year for our expansion program. We\u2019ll open about 500 new stores with a net gain after closings and relocations of more than 400 stores. We already have enough sites targeted in the U.S. to reach our goal of operating 7,000 stores in 2010. Work also continues on our new distribution center in South Carolina that\u2019s scheduled to open by summer 2007 and we\u2019re following that with another new facility in Connecticut in 2008.", "We\u2019ll continue seeking out innovative new products and services to make our stores even more compelling for our customers. A recent example of that is our inkjet printer cartridge refill service, which is available in about 1,500 stores nationwide. The convenience of refilling printer cartridges at our stores for half the price of a new cartridge gives customers another reason to visit us.", "Finally, we plan to continue growing Walgreens Health Services, our managed care division, through a combination of the right acquisition opportunities and organic growth.", "Thank you for listening.

Welcome to Walgreens' audio webcast for the first quarter ending November 30, 2006. I am Rick Hans, Walgreens' Director of Finance, and I would like to thank you for tuning in. We invite you to use this information in conjunction with the press release and other financial information posted on our website.", "Before we begin, I would like to go over the Safe Harbor language. Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive, and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006 for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Today we announced first quarter earnings were up 24.9% to $432 million or $0.43 per share diluted. That came on a sales increase of 16.6% to $12.7 billion. At the same time, we opened an unprecedented 143 new stores in the first quarter. This puts us well on our way toward opening 500 new stores in fiscal 2007, with a net increase of more than 400 stores. It also keeps us on track to reach our goal of operating more than 7,000 stores in 2010.", "Taking a closer look at our sales, total comparable store sales for stores open more than a year were up 9.7% in the quarter, while front-end comparable store sales rose 5.8%. Comparable pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 11.9%, while total pharmacy sales climbed 18.7%. The number of prescriptions filled in comparable stores rose 7.4%.", "Gross profit margins increased 60 basis points versus the year-ago quarter to 28.14 as a percent of sales. The combined growth in generic drug sales and higher front-end margins led the increase, but that was partly offset by lower margins under the Medicare Part D program and by an overall sales shift toward the pharmacy business, which has lower margins than our front-end business. Make no mistake, though; Medicare Part D has been very good for us. Even though low reimbursements under the program mean we earn less money on each Part D prescription, we have attracted more seniors to our pharmacies to make up for the lower payments. This is just what we anticipated happening since the start of the program.", "Meanwhile, selling, occupancy and administration expenses as a percent of sales increased 28 basis points to 22.85. Among the factors for the increase were costs associated with acquisitions, including the 76 acquired Happy Harry stores and Walgreens Health Services acquisitions, and provisions for legal matters. Partially offsetting those factors were lower store salary and occupancy costs as a percent of sales. The growth in lower-priced generic drugs also impacted SO&A as a percent of sales by slowing our revenue line. But we don't mind that, because of the help we get from generics with gross profit dollars.", "The effective annual tax rate for the first quarter this year was 36.75% compared to 37% in last year's first quarter. The reduction mostly results from our participation in a Florida corporate tax credit scholarship program for children from low-income families.", "The consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows can be found with our press release. Cash and short-term investments decreased from $896 million at the end of last year's first quarter to $769 million at the end of this year's first quarter. Accounts receivable were up 56.5%, while accounts payable increased 37.8%. Both were driven by growth in our pharmacy benefit management business under the new Medicare Part D prescription plan.", "LIFO inventories increased 12.2% from the year-ago quarter on a first quarter sales gain of 16.6%. Meanwhile, depreciation and amortization increased 20.5% from $133 million to $160 million.", "In the first quarter, we repurchased 7.9 million shares of stock for $343 million under our four-year $1 billion share repurchase plan announced in July 2004. This completes our entire share repurchase plan one-and-a-half years ahead of schedule. While the last several months have brought plenty of speculation about the effects of $4 generic drugs and industry acquisitions, we have shown with these results just what our core drugstore business is capable of doing. We'll never lack strong competitors, new retail concepts and more regulation; but we have thrived despite those issues, and we feel more confident about our future than ever before.", "The reasons for that confidence are familiar to anyone who has followed us over the years. The baby boomers are aging and using pharmacies more than ever. More medications are being used to treat more health conditions. When used properly, prescriptions have been shown to lower overall healthcare costs. Medicare's level playing field means our convenient pharmacies are attracting thousands of new seniors to our stores, and our store expansion program is taking advantage of the larger prescription market while growth in the drugstore industry overall is rather stagnant.", "It may surprise some people to learn that in the past five years, prescriptions filled in the U.S. grew 18% while the number of pharmacies rose only 2%. Meanwhile, the number of Walgreens stores has grown by 55%. We are unique in the industry in our ability to take advantage of higher prescription demand through organic store growth.", "While our results are dominated by our drugstores, our managed care business under Walgreens Health Services is also growing, as we integrate the specialty pharmacy and homecare acquisitions made over the past year. Our pharmacy benefit manager, Walgreens Health Initiatives, is setting the pace for use of cost-saving generic drugs. In this year's calendar third quarter, WHI's network generic utilization rate of 59.5% was higher than the rate reported by other major PBMs for the same time period.", "Thank you for listening. Our December sales results will be announced on Wednesday, January 3rd, and our next earnings announcement for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 is scheduled for March 26. Once again, thanks for being a Walgreens' shareholder and remember, you are always welcome at Walgreens.", "One more thing -- I would like to wish a Happy Birthday to my daughter Katherine.

", "Today we announced second quarter earnings were up 24.5% to $652 million, or $0.65 per share diluted. That came on a sales increase of 14.6% to $13.9 billion. For the first six months of fiscal 2007, sales increased 15.5% to $26.6 billion. Net earnings rose 24.7% to $1.08 billion or $1.07 per share, diluted. ", "A strong Christmas season led our front-end sales in the quarter. In fact, we gained market share in 58 of our top 60 core product categories versus our drugstore, grocery and mass merchant competitors compared to a year ago. ", "This year\u2019s store growth remains ahead of last year\u2019s pace, as we plan for 500 new drugstores to open during fiscal 2007. We opened or acquired 223 new stores in the first half of this fiscal year, compared to 222 in the year-ago period. That brought our store count to 5,641 as of Feb. 28, a net increase of 485 from a year ago. We remain on track to operate more than 7,000 stores in 2010. ", "Taking a closer look at sales, total comparable store sales for stores open more than a year were up 8.9% in the quarter, while front-end comparable store sales rose 5.7%. Please note that these numbers correct the originally reported December and January comparable store sales figures. Two types of non-Walgreen gift cards were inadvertently included in the sales figures at their gross value instead of their net value. As a result, December front-end comparable store sales were lowered by 0.8 percentage points and January front-end comparable store sales were lowered by 0.2 percentage points. ", "Pharmacy sales climbed 16.4% overall and 10.9% on a comparable store basis in the quarter. The number of prescriptions filled in comparable stores rose 6.3%. That\u2019s a very strong number when you realize that the flu season didn\u2019t generate as many doctor visits as normal and, as a result, we saw fewer flu-related prescriptions than normal. This was the same scenario we faced a year ago. The comparable prescription numbers also were hurt by the partial cycling of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which began in January 2006. Pharmacy accounted for 62.4% of our second quarter sales, a slightly lower percent than the first quarter because this quarter includes the busy holiday shopping season. ", "Gross profit margins rose 52 basis points versus the year-ago quarter to 28.96 as a percent to sales. On the pharmacy side, margins increased with the growth in generic drug sales. In the quarter, 62.9% of all retail prescriptions we dispensed were for generics. But some of the gross profit margin benefit from generics was offset by an overall sales shift toward the pharmacy business, which has lower margins than front-end merchandise. Speaking of which, front-end margins increased because of a shift in sales mix to higher margin items. ", "In this year\u2019s second quarter, we lowered our LIFO index, resulting in a LIFO provision of $13.4 million this quarter versus a provision of $23.8 million in the year-ago period. The lower index reflects less inflation than anticipated among pharmacy inventories. ", "Meanwhile, selling, occupancy and administration expenses including depreciation and amortization decreased 5 basis points to 21.64 as a percent to sales. Among the factors for the decrease were lower occupancy costs, including store closing costs, as a percent to sales. Partially offsetting those factors were provisions for legal matters. ", "The effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of this year was 36.75%, compared to 37% in last year\u2019s second quarter and first half. ", "The consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows can be found with our press release. Cash and short-term investments decreased from $1.22 billion at the end of last year\u2019s second quarter to $958 million at the end of this year\u2019s second quarter. ", " Accounts receivable increased 7.1%, while accounts payable increased 18.8%. LIFO inventories were $6.53 billion, a 16.3% increase from the year ago quarter versus a sales gain of 14.6%. ", "Meanwhile, for the first six months depreciation and amortization increased 17.3% from $272 million to $319 million. This is due in part to the amortization of intangibles from prescription file buys and the acquisitions of the Happy Harry\u2019s pharmacy chain and Medmark Specialty Pharmacy Solutions. Capital expenditures for the six months were $818 million versus $601 million last year. ", "In the second quarter, we announced a new stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion, which we plan to execute over the next four years. You\u2019ll recall that last November, we completed the $1 billion repurchase program that was announced in July 2004. ", "With the benefit of more generic drugs hitting the market, and a strong focus on our drugstore business and organic growth, we were able to improve gross profit margins while reducing our expense ratio this quarter; a best of both worlds scenario. This is a testament to the efforts of all our store, distribution and support employees. Meanwhile, our store growth plans continue unabated as we move down a clear, methodical, organic growth path toward having 7,000 stores in 2010. ", "As we weigh the pros and cons of the CVS-Caremark merger, we believe our clear focus on being a healthcare provider will crystallize our position in the minds of payers and that will place us in a preferred position with them and other PBMs. ", "Looking ahead, I want to point out that Easter was on April 16 last year, but falls on April 8 this year. With a portion of holiday sales pushed into March, this will affect our comparable store sales results for March and April. To show an apples-to-apples comparison to 2006, we\u2019ll report combined March/April results with our usual April sales announcement. ", "Thank you for listening. Our next earnings announcement for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 is scheduled for June 25. Once again, thanks for being a loyal Walgreen shareholder and remember, \u201cYou\u2019re Always Welcome at Walgreens!\u201d ", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

I\u2019m Rick Hans, Walgreen\u2019s Director of Finance, and I\u2019d like to thank you for tuning in. We invite you to use this information in conjunction with the press release and other financial information posted on our web site.", "Before we begin, I\u2019d like to go over the safe harbor language. Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K, as amended, for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2006, for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Today we announced our 33rd consecutive year of record sales and profits, although earnings in the fourth quarter decreased.", "Fiscal 2007 sales were up 13.4%  to a record $53.8 billion, while fiscal year net earnings rose 16.6%  to $2.04 billion or $2.03 per share, diluted \u2013 also a record. For the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, sales were up 10.3%  to a record $13.4 billion. Net earnings for the fourth quarter declined 3.8%  to $397 million or 40 cents per share, diluted.", "As we mentioned in our press release, this quarter experienced several factors that drove down our profits. They included: lower reimbursements on some generic drugs introduced in summer 2006, including simvastatin, the generic version of Zocor; higher salary and store expenses, to go along with increased advertising costs; and an increase in our LIFO inflation index that resulted in a $32 million charge this quarter versus a $26.1 million charge a year ago.", "Despite the fourth quarter, we recorded a strong fiscal year performance with earnings up 16.6%  and earnings per diluted share up 18.0% .", "I should point out that store sales continued their strong results in the fourth quarter. Front-end comparable drugstore sales \u2013 for stores open more than a year \u2013 rose 6.1% , while the number of prescriptions filled at comparable stores rose 4.0% . That\u2019s a solid number, especially when you take into consideration last year\u2019s lift from Medicare Part D by looking at the two-year stacked comparable prescriptions filled increases. Those figures show an 11%  increase in the fourth quarter.", "The fourth quarter saw our expansion program continue unabated, with the opening of 269 new or acquired stores that lifted us to a record 621 new stores for the year. That includes 120 acquired stores, 58 of which came from our Option Care, Inc. acquisition. After relocations and closings, we had a record net gain of 536 stores this year. For fiscal 2008, we plan to open about 550 new drugstores, including our first store in Hawaii in November.", "Taking a closer look at our sales, total comparable drugstore sales continue to be strong, increasing 6.3%  for the quarter and 8.1%  for the year. Pharmacy sales climbed 10.5%  in the fourth quarter and 14.7%  for the year. Pharmacy sales in comparable drugstores rose 6.5%  in the quarter and 9.5%  for the year.", "As we dispense more generic drugs, they slow our pharmacy sales increases because of their lower price. That\u2019s why we believe a better indicator of pharmacy performance is the number of prescriptions filled. In fiscal 2007, that number increased 10.0%  to 583 million, or nearly 17%  of all retail prescriptions in the country. On a comparable store basis, the number of prescriptions filled in fiscal 2007 increased 5.7% .", "Our gross profit margins for the fourth quarter increased 34 basis points versus the year-ago quarter to 27.98 as a percent to sales. This quarter includes a LIFO charge of $32.0 million versus a charge of $26.1 million a year ago. The total LIFO charge in fiscal 2007 was $69.3 million versus $95.3 million the previous year.", "Pharmacy margins increased, but some of that benefit was offset by an overall shift toward the pharmacy business, which carries lower margins than front-end merchandise. This quarter also vividly demonstrated that pharmacy gross profit margins on some drugs can increase on a percentage basis even while the gross profit dollars they produce fall. Front end margins increased as a result of a shift in sales mix to higher margin items.", "Fourth quarter selling, occupancy and administration expenses increased 15.3%  or 103 basis points from the previous year, from 22.45 to 23.48 as a percent to sales. SO&A margins were impacted by new, lower-cost generic drugs, which slowed pharmacy sales growth by 5.0 percentage points and total sales growth by 3.1 percentage points in the quarter. The amount spent on SO&A grew because of higher salary and store expenses and increased advertising costs. We have begun a rigorous review of all expense items and will quickly take the necessary steps to better control them.", "We benefited from a lower tax rate in this year\u2019s fourth quarter of 35.0%  compared to 36.7%  in the year-ago quarter, primarily the result of a lower effective state tax rate.", "The consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows can be found with our press release. For the year, cash and short-term investments decreased from $1.34 billion at the end of last year\u2019s fourth quarter to a net commercial paper issuance of $624 million at the end of this year\u2019s fourth quarter. You\u2019ll recall that we closed on the $850 million acquisition of Option Care, Inc., in this year\u2019s fourth quarter. Other factors also contributed to the change in our cash position.", "Accounts receivable increased 8.4% , while accounts payable decreased 7.6% . LIFO inventories increased 12.2%  versus a year ago on a fourth quarter sales gain of 10.3% .", "Finally on the statement of cash flows, capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 were $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2006. The company expects to invest more than $2 billion in fiscal 2008 on capital investments, including new stores, technology and a new distribution center in Connecticut scheduled to open in fiscal 2009.", "For the fiscal year 2007, we repurchased 15.5 million shares of stock for $688 million. Approximately half of those shares were repurchased under our 2004 share repurchase program, and the other half were purchased under our four-year, $1 billion share repurchase plan announced in January 2007.", "While we wrapped up our 33rd consecutive year of record sales and earnings, we know our fourth quarter performance isn\u2019t what shareholders expect. Many of the challenges we faced in this quarter will continue, including comparisons to last year\u2019s blockbuster generics and growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions. But we\u2019re confident of our ability to manage these challenges in a the way our investors expect us to. This is our top priority, and we\u2019re confident we will better manage expense control and lower reimbursements going forward.", "We feel that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Growth in pharmacy sales will continue as the population ages; our store managers and corporate merchandisers will keep up the innovation that\u2019s driving great front-end comparable sales increases; and new product and service introductions will give customers more reasons to shop our stores.", "Expansion will continue on all fronts. We plan to open 550 new stores in fiscal 2008 for a net gain of 475 stores after relocations and closings. In addition, we\u2019ll look at acquisitions when the right opportunity arises. And Take Care Health Systems, our subsidiary that manages convenient care clinics inside our drugstores, will grow dramatically over the next year with plans to have more than 400 clinics open by the end of calendar 2008. These investments are important drivers for the company\u2019s future performance.", "Thank you for listening.

During this call we\u2019ll provide abrief overview of thefirst quarter and areview of the costcontrol measures we\u2019ve implemented and thesuccess we\u2019ve seen from them. We\u2019ll also highlight our efforts to leverage ourstores to drive higher sales volume and our investments innew and expanding health care services.

Please limit yourself to one question and afollow-up so that wecan give anopportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time. ", "Before we get started I\u2019d like to read our Safe Harbor language. Certain statementsand projections of future results made in this presentation constituteforward-looking information that is based on current markets, competitive andregulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31st, 2007 for a discussion of factors as they relate toforward-looking statements. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our Chairman and CEO,Jeff Reins.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Thank you Rick, good morning and thank you for joining us. We appreciateyour time particularly on the Friday before Christmas. Many of you may be awarethat Walgreens has recently made a significant effort to broaden investoraccess to senior management. Today\u2019s call is just one more example of thiseffort and consistent with our commitment to greater transparency, access tosenior management and improved information flow to shareholders. Let\u2019s beginwith our quarter.", "As you saw from our release we reported record sales and earnings despitefacing a tougher comparison for 25% earnings increase in the year-ago quarterexpense control is the top priority and our folks came through particularly inpayroll. We also maximized our advertising dollars through greater efficiencywhile keeping up our promotions during the critical pre-holiday season. We arevery pleased that we\u2019re starting 2008 with a strong footing. Due to a number offactors, our sales growth in the period was slower than expected. Among thesewere late quarter weakness in seasonal categories, discounts on digital photoprocessing, a milder than normal flu season and the recall and cautions onchildren\u2019s cough and cold products. We continue to execute on our organicgrowth strategy in the quarter opening a record number of new stores andcontinuing to invest in our future. ", "As of November 30th we had 6,139 stores nationwide. In additionwe have about 1,800 new store leases in our active pipeline, of those 600 havealready been signed. Taking a closer look at cost controls this quarter, wetook a number of significant actions in response to the unacceptable growth andexpenses in the fourth quarter. In particular, store and district managersredoubled efforts to more closely align store expenses with budgets and sales performance.We also were very careful to manage service levels and discretionary costs witha keen eye to avoid disrupting customer service or slowing sales momentum. Atthe corporate level we put certain non-critical projects on hold. I want toacknowledge and thank our teams in the stores and at corporate office for theirhard work. You\u2019ve done an extraordinary job. While I\u2019m happy with our greatproducts on the cost front, have no doubt we\u2019ll continue to be vigilant. ", "Looking forward, we expect the first half of fiscal 2008 to remainchallenging from a bottom line perspective as we cycle a very robust period forgeneric drug introduction last year. However, our long term outlook for marginsand sales remain strong and should improve in the second half of fiscal 2008and beyond. I would also like to point out the comparisons in the secondquarter will be difficult versus last year when we recorded gross margin of28.96%. Last year we benefited from new generic introductions, significantSG&A leverage and operating margin expansion. Now I\u2019ll turn the call overto Bill Rudolphsen, our CFO, for more details on the numbers. ", "William M. Rudolphsen ", "Thanks Jeff and good morning to all of you. Let\u2019s briefly discuss our firstquarter financial performance. We reported revenue of $14 billion, a 10.4%increase. Comparable store sales were up 5.4%. Net income and earnings pershare grew 5.5% and 7% respectively. Prescription sales rose 11.1% for thequarter and 5.9% on a same-store basis impacted by more sales of lower costgeneric drugs and a milder flu season. The number of prescriptions filled inthe first quarter increased 3.7% on a comparable store basis. Front-end storesales increased 4.6% on a comparable store basis. In terms of the currentenvironment as we\u2019ve indicated, our gross margin dollars and overall profitsare being impacted near term by self-comparisons to what was a stellar year-agoperiod. In addition we saw a positive impact on volumes a year ago from theintroduction of the Medicare Part D benefit. Total gross profit in the quarterwas $3.9 billion, a $331 million year over year increase. Our LIFO rate thisquarter was 1.5% compared to 1.75% in the year-ago quarter. That let to a LIFOprovision of $26.9 million in the quarter, just $.50 million less than lastyear\u2019s first quarter. ", "As Jeff indicated we made significant progress at slowing the rate of growthof advertising, payroll and direct store expense. SG&A expenses increased9.5% in this year\u2019s first quarter versus 18% in the year-ago quarter primarilydue to lower growth in store salaries, legal expenses, insurance and storeclosing costs. Advertising expenditures grew more slowly than sales in thefirst quarter. Our advertising spend was up 8% in dollars year over year todrive traffic through circulars and other media. Even though payroll and directstore expense dollars grew faster than sales, we made good progress slowing therate of growth compared to the fourth quarter. We believe we can hold the lineon the cost control improvements we\u2019ve already made while making additionalprogress in other areas.", "Looking at slide number six, you\u2019ll see that normally changes in SG&Aexpenses closely track changes in gross profit dollars. That didn\u2019t happen inthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2007; we quickly got back on track in this firstquarter with the growth rates of SG&A expenses and gross profit dollarsmoving in [lock step]. Our effective tax-rate was 37.5% compared to a rate of36.8% in the year-ago period. We anticipate a tax-rate of about 37.2% for thefiscal year. ", "Looking through our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operationstotaled $390 million in the quarter. Our total short-term debt stood at $1.2billion at the end of the first quarter. We will continue managing our balancesheet for maximum financial flexibility and to support our core growthstrategy. I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our store expansionprogram.", "Some in the financial community speculate that our new stores are lessproductive than in years past due to high real estate and labor costs. Let meput that myth to rest. Our productivity improvements at the store levelcontinue to be very positive. If you\u2019ll refer to slide seven, you\u2019ll see wepublished for the first time our front-end sales per store for stores we openedeach class year from 2002 through 2006. As an example, the front-end salesafter year one for the 2006 class of stores is just over $2 million whichexceeds the front-end sales for each prior class store shown. On slide eight weshow prescriptions per store per day at the end of each year. Again, for storeswe opened each class year from 2002 through 2006. Both sets of data demonstratethat our 2006 class of stores performed as well in the front-end and thepharmacy as the store classes each year between 2002 and 2005. ", "On slide nine, we also show our return on average invested capital for thelast five years. Those returns have increased from 9.6% in 2003 to 10.5% in2007. You can find the details of this calculation on our Investor Relations\u2019website. You can use these three pieces of data to come to the same conclusionthat we have, namely that the productivity of new stores has not diminishedover the last five years. Also keep in mind that Walgreens ROIC is greatlyimpacted by the 20% of our stores that are less than three years old. It takesabout three years for an organically developed store to break even. We estimatethat when you adjust for the net operating profit after tax and the investedcapital for these new stores, the after-tax ROIC for our stores opened morethan three years is in the mid teens. This results in a significant spread overour weighted average cost of capital which we calculate at about 8% using themarket value of equity method. ", "Given these returns we\u2019ll continue the growth of these highly productivestores. Finally from an investment standpoint, it\u2019s important to know that wehave a goal for our capital investments to reach an average ROIC of more than15%. This goal includes strategic growth initiatives such as organic andacquired store growth, new alliances and other ventures and acquisitions wemight consider. Let me know turn the call over to our President, Greg Wasson,who will update you on growth initiatives. ", "Gregory D. Wasson ", "Thank you Bill and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to briefly touch onrecent progress in our overall strategy to leverage our store box to drivehigher sales while investing in new and expanding health care services to growearnings. Our pharmacy business is strong from every competitive vantage point.Just to remind you, we filled more than 580 million prescriptions in fiscal2007. Today our share of the U.S.retail prescription market is more than 17%. Our drugstore sales on a squarefootage basis are $797 among the highest in the industry. As you know, fiscal2008 will not be a year of major new generic drug launches. This is simply partof the ebb and flow of generic introductions. However, we expect to see a newwave of generics in 2009 through 2011 which will bolster and accelerate ourprofit in those years. For example, looking ahead to the next several years,drugs coming off brand include [Lipitor and Nectim] but keep in mind it isdifficult to forecast with certainty the timing of generic launches. ", "As important as mainstream prescription drugs are to our business, we\u2019realso positioned to take advantage of the fastest growing area of pharmacy,specialty pharmacy, which is rising at a rate of 20% a year. You will recallthat our acquisition of Option Care last summer is a key part of our growth inspecialty pharmacy. I am pleased to report that the integration of Option Careis progressing on plan. This success demonstrates our ability to affectivelyintegrate sensible acquisitions into our broader platform. Consistent with ourstrategy of strengthening our healthcare relationships with consumers, wecontinue to roll out our Take Care Health Clinics during the quarter. Today wehave about 120 clinics operating in 15 cities across 11 states. Again, theconvenience of ordering combined with the cost affective access to basichealthcare services that Take Care Health Clinics offer represent a distinctadvantage. ", "Take Care Health Clinics offer high quality primary health care services andour staff by nurse practitioners position assistance. We work in collaborationwith primary care physicians. We have an excellent model to retrofit ourexisting stores and we anticipate having more than 400 clinics operational bythe end of calendar 2008. Our early studies indicate that approximately 20% ofTake Care Health patients choose to fill their prescriptions at Walgreens arenot existing Walgreens pharmacy patients. Our financial assumptions for theseclinics are based solely on healthcare reimbursement and cash fees for commonmedical procedures such as vaccinations, basic diagnostic testing and similaractivities. Incremental pharmacy volumes and front-end sales are not consideredin our financial [inaudible]. ", "We continue to look at opportunities to expand access to Walgreens as atrusted source for basic healthcare services. An example of this is our move tooperate pharmacies at non-traditional venues such as Children\u2019s Hospital in L.A.and Northwestern Memorial Hospital here in Chicago.We also have pharmacies onsite at corporate campuses of large employers such asToyota Motor Manufacturing. You may have seen that during the quarter we madethe decision to withdraw as a pharmacy provider for four prescription plansmanaged by [CVS Caremark] due to their unacceptably low below market reimbursementrates. While we continue to seek a negotiated solution, this won\u2019t have amaterial financial impact on our results. ", "Thank you for your attention let me turn the call back to Jeff to discussour strategy.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Thanks Greg. I want to spend the last few minutes of our prepared remarks onour corporate strategy and outline how our superior competitive will lead us tofuture growth and deliver long-term [inaudible] value.", "We are focused on going on market leadership for strength in our competitiveposition. We intend to actively and aggressively manage organic store expansionto capture the best retail corners nationwide. We continue to make sales focusand customer focus investments in our stores, supply chain marketing andinfrastructure. We\u2019re expanding into adjacent sectors of pharmacy andhealthcare services through our acquisitions of Option Care, Medmark,[inaudible] and Senior Med. [inaudible] will allow our patients to continueusing Walgreens\u2019 services as they develop needs for infusion therapy orspecialty pharmacy products, or moving into an assisted living setting. We willprudently evaluate acquisitions that enhance our core service offerings, expandour convenience and meet our [inaudible] goals. ", "So, how are we uniquely positioned to capitalize on this strategy anddeliver that shareholder value? First and foremost with more than 6,000locations, significant buying power and high service levels, we have anexceptional retail platform that can be leveraged across both the front and theback of the store. As a pharmacy provider we believe our independencedifferentiates us and enables us to successful compete for business as aprovider of choice. We believe any efforts to restrict us [inaudible] provideour networks will prove counterproductive [inaudible] will underscore theinherent conflict of interest to vertically innovative business model. Organicstore growth remains a key part of our strategy. This year we plan to open 550stores for a net increase of 475 stores after relocations and closings. Inaddition, we are targeting total square footage growth of approximately 8% peryear. Geographically we\u2019re aggressively expanding in the northeast and California.These areas have higher real estate costs and in some cases, smaller propertieswith which to work. So we\u2019re using a flexible and adaptable store model tocustomize product selection similar to our successful stores in denselypopulated urban markets, such as San Francisco.", "While the break even period is longer for these stores due to higher realestate and development costs, experience has shown that their sales growthtends to be sustained over a longer period than stores in less dense markets. Inother words, these stores continue to improve the performance for many moreyears after they break even. Over the long term, we expect our [inaudible] andsales per square foot to increase as we bring the higher mix of these storesinto our system. In short, we are no where near the saturation point; there isplenty of room to grow. We have the right strategy to get there. We\u2019re also growingmarket share through buy-outs of independent pharmacies which playsparticularly tough economic times, pharmacy reimbursements fall in both thepublic and private sectors. We completed a record number of 200 independentpharmacy buy-outs in fiscal 2007 and we expect this trend to continue.", "Our strong balance sheet provides us with the ability to be opportunisticand flexible in pursuit of growth. Our 50% debt to total cap ratio positionedus ideally in this regard. When you look at the different levers we have as an organization,we believe we are well positioned to deliver consistent growth. ", "That concludes our formal remarks and now we will turn to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question will come from Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi good morning. Could you quantify the benefit from the lower legalinsurance and store closing costs in the quarter. Was that all of the 19 basispoint decline in the SG&A? Is that how we should think about that?", "William M. Rudolphsen ", "No Ed, that\u2019s not, I\u2019d say the major reason for the increase or the changein the growth rate was store salaries. We grew at 18% in the first quarter oflast year, only 9.5% this year. I\u2019d say about a third of that improvement isrelated to store salaries. ", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay but the year over year lower SG&A rate of 19 basis points, that\u2019smostly the legal, the insurance and the store closing costs right?", "William M. Rudolphsen ", " [inaudible] sales basis, that iscorrect.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay.  And then Jeff I was hoping youcould discuss comp trends a little bit. Your comps have obviously deceleratedsomewhat and I understand that generics is playing a role in that, butobviously from the information you provided, your new store comps are stillrobust so can you help us dissect what your older stores are comping at thisstandpoint if we call it stores older than five years? And then what should weexpect now going forward the rest of this year, particularly on the front-endas it seems like things might be slowing down a little bit?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "They still are going very well. We did see a traffic slowdown in mid Octoberand that\u2019s what we talked about in November. So that traffic slowdown, you sawthe customer buying down a little bit and the customer count once again wentdown a bit. The comp stores are still doing very well in those stores open morethan three years. Is that what you\u2019re referring to?", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah, I\u2019m talking about your more mature stores. ", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Right, they\u2019re still doing very well in terms of comp sales, but once againoverall we did see a decrease in customer count starting in about mid October whenthe sub prime and crisis became big news. We saw people trading down a littlebit and that slowed down the comp store sales a bit. With regard to the rest ofthe year, it is a top economic environment right now, but of course we\u2019re notcommenting particularly on sales for this month and also how it\u2019s going to befor the rest of the year. ", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I want you to think about what your promotional strategy is going to begoing forward on the front-end, do we think about it as getting more aggressivebecause of this?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "We will do what we need to do to either meet or beat competition. If we needto get more aggressive, we certainly can. We do a good job day in, day out. Ihave no problems with that. We\u2019ve always been promotionally oriented not onlyin our ads but in the way we merchandize our stores. As you know, most of theproducts that we sell in our stores are low end products and they lendthemselves to promotional building. People come into our stores based onconvenience looking for 1.6 items, they leave with 3.3 items. That has beenvery, very consistent whether the economy is great or the economy is poor. So Ithink we\u2019ll do just fine, just fine in the months ahead. ", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Patricia Baker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Patricia Baker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Good morning everyone, I don\u2019t want to dwell very much on the fourth quarterbut since we didn\u2019t have the benefit of this exact access with that quarter,can you just go back and explain to us why you think the fourth quarter did endup with much higher SG&A than was anticipated? Just so that we have abetter understanding going forward.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Yes Patricia, in the fourth quarter of 2007 we did a very poor job ofmanaging and focusing on expenses. We are a $0.03 company and that\u2019s our mantraright now, a $0.03 company. We have got to remain focused. During that timeperiod, our payroll was out of sight. We also had [inaudible] expenses andadvertising that we had in the fourth quarter of last year that we did not havein the previous year. So once again, I would say it was a lack of focus. As youcan tell by this quarter, there\u2019s more focus on controlling discretionarycosts; we are making sure that when we have the budgets and the sales those arebeing matched up. We\u2019re taking [outliners] back to budget. Obviously if theyget and do more sales then the budget is saying, then they get more hours. Butif they do not, then we take hours out. The biggest leverage that the storemanager can control in terms of expenses is that payroll salary line. Onceagain, by matching up the budgeted hours with the budget sales, we will dobetter.", "Patricia Baker \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Okay thank you, that helps us understand it better. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "I\u2019d like to talk a little bit more about first quarter expenses, the 18%SG&A growth you had in the first quarter last year, I believe some of thatwas related to Happy Harry. I don\u2019t know how much of that was payroll but is itfair to say that some of the improvement in the payroll this year is of afunction of fully integrating Happy Harry and that those were sort of one-timecosts? ", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "I wouldn\u2019t say that completely Meredith. The reason being it\u2019s an ongoingprocess with Harry\u2019s. We\u2019ve obviously put some payroll in but the stores werenot necessarily all set completely. We\u2019re still going through that right nowwith them, to make sure the [inaudible] are set to Walgreens\u2019 system. So Iwould not classify that at all as the main reason. The main reason once againthat we controlled expenses is that we had diligent efforts and we\u2019re trackingit on a daily and weekly basis much better than we did in the past. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay and then I\u2019d like to just ask some questions about the slides you werekind enough to provide us about pharmacy productivity both front-end and onething I noted is a footnote that you\u2019ve excluded the 24-hour stores. Can youtell us how many of the stores you\u2019ve been opening are 24-hours and then I havejust a follow-up question related to that.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "To answer the 24-hour question, when you say opening, do you mean openingper year? Right now we have approximately 27% of our company 24-hours, about1,600 stores that are 24-hours. It\u2019s hard to determine exactly to say how manywe\u2019re going to open per year because obviously it\u2019s based on script numbers,the competition and so on, so that ebbs and flows. But right now, we\u2019ve beenaround 27%, 28%; we\u2019ll probably stay about that range for quite awhile. Youhave other questions regarding the charts?", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Yeah, well I mean you had excluded those 27% of the stores more or less fromthese charts, I just wanted to understand that, but also can you talk aboutover the same five year time frame where you\u2019ve had very stable sales andscript count, what\u2019s happened to labor and real estate costs? Have they alsobeen equally stable?", "William M. Rudolphsen ", "Yes, they\u2019ve been fairly stable. Certainly as we do expand into thenortheast and California as Jeffmentioned, we would see slightly higher occupancy costs in those areas. Butoverall our costs have been fairly stable. ", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "And finally just the chart you do where you look at return on averageinvested capital, are you capitalizing leases in that calculation?", "William M. Rudolphsen ", "Yes we are.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Okay great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T CapitalMarkets", "Good morning, I just wanted to ask you about the \u2013 from your commentary onthe \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re making good progress on the payroll side of the businessbut actually there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s got to be carefully done, but it sounds likethere\u2019s more to come. Am I understanding that right and if so, what sort of,could you somehow give some quantification of how much more labor rates can bemanaged down?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Thanks for the question. I don\u2019t want to give an exact figure on how muchmore can be managed down. It is a lot more focused than ever before. Onceagain, during the last summer we just did not do a good job of focusing on it,week to week to week. We are definitely doing it now. Focusing on [inaudible]from a corporate point of view and also engaged store level to make sure welook at that payroll. It\u2019s more judicious use of payroll and once again we lookat the out-liers. We have templates that the manager and district manager andstore ops Vice President agree upon, that how many hours are allotted to everystore including pharmacy and front-end. If the sales are there then we\u2019re okay.If the sales get much better than anticipated, obviously we can put hours on.If they get much worse than anticipated we can take hours out. One thing weobviously don\u2019t want to do is hurt service levels and as I\u2019ve mentioned in thepast, we\u2019ve had a pretty track record now of having decreased servicecomplaints in our stores. It\u2019s a focused effort on taking care of the customer,taking care of the patient and once again we\u2019re not going to be so silly as tocut payroll to the bone where we hurt ourselves. We don\u2019t want to do that. Wewant to take care of our people and we want to take care of our customers andpatients all the time. ", "Gregory D. Wasson ", "The other thing that we did do intelligently, back to the 24-hour, we didtake a look at some of the 24-hour stores that we had and rolled back a fewthat maybe didn\u2019t make sense and we may have been a little aggressive over theyears in adding some of those 24-hour locations. We rolled a few back thathelps us a little bit in that area. Again, as Jeff said, just an intelligentfocus on labor costs. Our managers and our district managers in the field havedone a great job responding.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "That\u2019s a good point by Greg. We\u2019re reviewing the districts; we actually hadsome districts that were 50% 24-hour stores. We just didn\u2019t need that for thecoverage. ", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T CapitalMarkets", "Okay so it sounds like you can at least maintain the current discipline andperhaps do some fine tuning to come.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "I think that\u2019s a good way to say it; a fine tuning is the best way to [steady]you\u2019re right.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T CapitalMarkets", "Okay and my follow-up if I might is just on the pharmacy side of thebusiness, both at Walgreens and other public chains and the industry at large,this year has been a little slower than last year in the prescription businessand as you all dissect it, there\u2019s different reasons. One is obviously you\u2019relapping in the Part D infusion last year, Wal-Mart and others have made acompetitive bid for business, the economy, add flu, how would you when you lookat this year being a little slower than last year, how do you ascribe theslowing, slight slow down in the scripts?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "I would agree with those reasons you listed and Medicare Part D, the fluobviously is playing a part of it. The economy as you mentioned. I think anotherthing coming into play is employers putting more cost on employees. As you seeco-pays rising people unfortunately do not fill their medications as much aspossible. But I think what you\u2019re seeing is more and more people are gettingaccess to care. I\u2019m quite confident the numbers will go up as people get accessto care. For example, through our Take Care Clinics and other clinics that areout there. I think people want to stay well, as insurance companies pay forvisits to the Take Care Clinics for example. That encourages people to comeinto the system. Before, they might be putting it off, for example they didn\u2019twant to go to a doctor, they know it\u2019s very expensive. They just wait it out.There\u2019s also been not a lot of negative publicity as you know regarding variouscough syrups and other medications and people might be taking a little bit of ajaundiced view of it. Well let me just wait it out and see what happens. It\u2019sour job though as a pharmacist and pharmacy profession, to encourage people totake their medication on a regular basis. I think that\u2019s one of our biggestopportunities for us to grow numbers, is to get people to be compliant and adhereon their medications. You know if you miss your medication for a day on [Astatine]for example, or something for high blood pressure, you\u2019re not going to feel anydifferent. But if we can show people that you know what, you\u2019re going to feelbetter, you\u2019re going to be around to see your grandchildren in the years tocome, then it will make a big difference and there\u2019s our opportunity in thisindustry is to drive compliance and adherence.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T CapitalMarkets", "Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair & Company LLC", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair & CompanyLLC", "Good morning, first one to say thank you for posting this forum. I thinkit\u2019s going to be helpful for the dialogue going forward. I want to follow-up onan earlier question about the rate of expense control we\u2019ve seen so far andBill you talked about you can improve additional things going forward. I hopeyou can elaborate on that and then Jeff you mentioned the non-critical projectson hold. How long can those stay on hold if the economy does tighten up, howmuch ability do you have to bring down the expense growth rate further?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "We have a lot of ability to bring that down as needed without being silly orstupid about it. Obviously what ever we want to do is, in terms of payroll, isto make sure we don\u2019t impact sales. On the expense and [inaudible] we want tomake sure that we don\u2019t impact shareholder value for the long term. As you knowthere\u2019s always been this unique needs and want-to-do. Some of those want-to-dosare not necessary right now. There are some needs to obviously that we aremoving ahead with, but once again, the wants-to-do we just can\u2019t do that. Andany list of projects we obviously have to prioritize what we want to do andwhat we need to make happen and position ourselves well for the future. Interms of the expenses, once again, about one-third of our savings this quarterwas due to payroll, the other two-thirds was due to these higher legal,insurance and store closing costs. Those ebb and flow as you know. And so wecan\u2019t be exact about those, but the biggest SG&A expense line that we cancontrol is payroll. Payroll represents about 50% of our SG&A and that\u2019swhere, if we have a concentrated effort to make a difference, we can do it. ", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair &Company LLC", "In the stores where you\u2019ve put in the discipline you talked about, have youseen a bigger change in their sales so as comped flowed in November, was thatmore so at those stores that had that greater expense discipline?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "No Mark, absolutely not, no, no, no. As a matter of fact it\u2019s kind ofinteresting. If you look at the stores on an individual basis, typically thosefolks that run the most disciplined payroll have the best stores in terms ofbeing in stock, taking care of the employees, taking care of the customers;everything is great. It\u2019s just like inventory for example. You go into somestores and if they\u2019re a lot over in inventory, some folks think well thereshould be no out-of-stocks, but actually those are the worst stores in terms ofbeing in stock.", "Gregory D. Wasson ", "You know our operations folks have done a great job delivering this message tohelp us make this happen. They\u2019ve been in the stores, working with the storesthat might have some challenges making sure it\u2019s done the right way andintelligently. And they\u2019ve been extremely careful and cautious about doinganything that might hurt service levels. I just think it\u2019s been one heck of anexecution from our store ops folks. ", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair &Company LLC", "Thanks, my other question on the slides, looking at the pharmacyproductivity, it moved up in this past year, but it is down from where you\u2019vebeen a couple years prior despite overall growth in scripts in the market. Iguess I was hoping you could address that and also explain whether that\u2019scoming from more stores in these new markets so you talk about higherinvestment costs in the new markets on the coast, but do you also start withlower sales productivity and then as more of these stores are coming on isthere some risk that return on capital would actually be weighed down for someperiod of time until enough of them are in the maturity phase of the curve?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Let me answer the first part of that. In terms of the slower growth, as weexpand more into areas where we\u2019re not as well known, the prescription growthis slower to begin with. But what we\u2019ve found many, many times particularly inthe northeast and California andso on, that after that four and a half to five year break point, our salesactually go up faster than the other stores in more mature markets. So I thinkwe\u2019ll be okay. Once again long term it shouldn\u2019t be a problem in terms ofgrowing the scripts. Bill, do you have anything to add?", "William M. Rudolphsen ", "Yeah Mark, as I look at the numbers I really don\u2019t see a material differenceamongst the numbers throughout the years, that\u2019s why we posted the chart and Iwould agree with Jeff\u2019s comments that we do start out slower in the northeastbut we ramp up over time as the public becomes more and more aware of Walgreensin the market.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Mark a good thing to always keep in mind is that the market share ofpenetration actually drives the ROIC. So once again, in more mature markets thestores come up to that break even point, break even and above, much quickerthan they do in some of the areas where we have less than a two coverage.That\u2019s stores per 100,000. ", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair &Company LLC", "And on the ROIC part of the question, it\u2019s intuitive to me that it wouldweigh in returns, is there some reason why that wouldn\u2019t manifest itself in theresults?", "William M. Rudolphsen ", "Yeah Mark early on I would say as we start slower certainly that would weighon the returns but long term we would get where we need to be which is a 15%return on invested capital which is our target.

Is itjust less of a positive in this kind of a year or is it actually a negative andthat you\u2019ve got less to offset older generics that are being axed out, etcetera?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "As you know David, the generic, the plan going to generic is actually a lowpoint in 2008 then it picks up in 2009, 2010 significantly. I do believe thatour generic penetration will continue to move up, maybe not quite as quickly ofcourse on a percentage basis because you don\u2019t have all the brands going togenerics. But more and more people are familiar with generics, doctors believein generics and the customers and patients know a generic now and are askingfor it. Also it\u2019s part of the design of the co-pays. Most folks, most employersobviously are keeping those generic co-pays down. As a matter of fact, somecompanies now are starting to waive co-pays on certain generics just so peoplewill take their medication, and that\u2019s where I come back to this compliance andadherence. I think there\u2019s realization in the health industry in general, thatif we can get people to take their meds then our total health care costs willgo down over time.

Are we headed in that direction anddo you see opting out of other plans or no?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "You know John, it\u2019s always been a discussion with the PBMs over the years interms of the reimbursement rate which we feel is needed and fair to us, and atthe same time fair to them.

I\u2019m hoping that we do come to a resolution but we just have notyet. But in terms of the major PBMs and the conflicts, no I don\u2019t see itintensifying at all. I really don\u2019t. I think we\u2019ll be just fine in the years tocome. They have their point of view, we have our point of view, but once againwith our coverage and the locations and market share we have, I don\u2019t see itchanging from what it was in the past.

Most ofthese don\u2019t get to be public knowledge. You would never hear about it. Thesefour plans unfortunately couldn\u2019t come to an agreement which was fair to bothsides. Again, we\u2019re still talking with them. We hope to have a resolution, butno I wouldn\u2019t say things are going to get worse at all.

Rein ", "John in my opinion, we are recession resistant, but we\u2019re not recessionproof. Once again, it depends on your level of income. What might be someone\u2019sdiscretionary spend is someone\u2019s needed spend somewhere else. But withpromotional activity that ebbs and flows as you know, once again, most of oursales happen because folks are in the store. That\u2019s why we want these primelocations on the best corners in America.Once they get them into the store, we are just fine in terms of selling andwhat we need. Now maybe we need to do some price points, lets say instead of$3.19 maybe it\u2019s $2.99 or two for $5 or something of that nature, but our jobin terms of the [rodo\u2019s] and the circulars is to get people in the door.

Usually you guys are the last to slow andsupermarkets haven\u2019t really slowed much at all, so maybe a comment on why youthink all of a sudden with employment still very robust you\u2019re actually seeinga pull-back, of why you think it\u2019s not related to some of the actions you\u2019retaking.", "William M.

Rein ", "When you look at the sales once again going back to November where itstarted to tail-off, don\u2019t forget that cough cold is a big, big part of ourbusiness and before the FDA said anything about children\u2019s cough medications,we were up about 15%. The day after that immediately started to drop. Weactually ended up zero for the time period. Just zero. We have never seen, I\u2019dmentioned to several folks, I had never seen us up zero in cough cold.Seasonal-type products we saw starting to decline a bit in November. Onceagain, Halloween was pretty good but not quite as good as we would have likedand we have high expectations of course. Items like vaporizers in November justdidn\u2019t sell. They just aren\u2019t going. People aren\u2019t buying, they don\u2019t needthem, it\u2019s too warm. Products like mittens and hats and clothing are down 20%.Those products we\u2019re not selling. So once again in an environment it\u2019s slowing,people do look at what they\u2019re spending and what\u2019s discretionary. They may ormay not be buying some of the promotional items that we offer. I think a lot ofit is dependent on not only what do they think of the future of course in termsof their mortgage, their job and so on, but also the weather does impact us.Particularly on the cough, cold and the flu index side. ", "John Spina", "I just want to add that you know in a tough economic time, there\u2019s so manymoving parts to our sales, it\u2019s tough to pin it on one thing. So we\u2019re justgoing to make sure we take care of the customer, we have the right advertising,get them in the door, put that extra item in the basket and go forward. But topredict the future, we just never could do that. There\u2019s too many moving parts.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Do you at least anticipate all equal in the economy it just kind of keepschugging along the way it is, which is just so-so, that this gross marginpressure will continue through the year?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "We\u2019ll see how it goes. We don\u2019t comment on which way it\u2019s going one way orthe other. It\u2019s a tough economic environment as we said before, we all read thesame papers and see the headlines and so on, but we will have to see how thatgoes. ", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Banc of America Securities", "Thanks guys and thanks again for doing this, I know someone else said thatbut it\u2019s really appreciated. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Thank you and good morning. Jeff I think you talked a little bit aboutexpansion of your healthcare strategy and I\u2019m just wondering if you can maybetalk about areas that you\u2019re looking at. I also think that someone made thecomment that especially pharmacy is fully integrated or unplanned, can you talkabout how your integrating specialty pharmacy into your front-end pharmacy andagain just coming back to how you view the overall strategy for healthcareoffering.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Lisa, just to let you know, we don\u2019t comment on any acquisitions that may ormay not be happening. We\u2019ve never done that in the past and obviously we\u2019re notgoing to comment right now. What we are trying to do with our strategy is makesure that we can take care of folk\u2019s pharmaceutical needs. In the past we\u2019vebeen able to serve folks, in many cases, from the time they were born untilmaybe 65 to 70 and then we\u2019re out of the picture. It just doesn\u2019t make a lot ofsense to us so we with the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s OptionCare, Med Mark, [inaudible] and Senior Meds, it allows us to take care of thatpatient from cradle to grave. And everything we\u2019re doing and seeing is thatmore and more of the pharmaceutical needs of people can be met by the infusionor specialty side. And by the way, these folks who obviously have to be infusedor take specialty meds also take other medications. So if we get the specialtyperson, you also get whatever else they\u2019re taking that they can take orally.Greg I think you had some comments also on this specialty.", "Gregory D. Wasson ", "Yes, I believe obviously a big area of focus for us is the specialty andfusion area. Obviously with it growing at 15%, 20%, $60 billion today, thatcould double in the next five years, maybe even triple. So it\u2019s a huge area offocus for us. As we know, pharmacy, the science of pharmacy is moving more andmore toward biologicals; we want to be there. So we invested a year ago in [MetMart] and bought a lot of expertise and manufacturer relations. With OptionCare we bought what we feel is one of the best national platforms and homeinfusion. We\u2019re working at integrating the specialty side of that with thefusion side as we speak. That\u2019s going well. As far as the retail opportunities,we do think that there\u2019s going to be opportunity to leverage the retailpharmacy as well as to take care of healthcare clinics.", "Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And on the retail pharmacy side, are you using your pharmacist in aconsultative way to talk about specialty pharmacy so if someone walks in topick up a specialty prescription they don\u2019t have a specialty pharmacy companytoday, are you using that opportunity to try to cross-sell some of the newservices that Walgreens has?", "Gregory D. Wasson ", "We\u2019re heading towards that. We\u2019re not as far along as we expect to be in thenear future. We absolutely want to determine what it is that a store levelpharmacist should and could add to that specialty patient to provide value. Certainlythe combination between the centralized model, the pharmacist and nurses thatwe have to assist to pharmacist at the store level combined with the actionthat can be delivered at the point of care, is going to be, we believe extremelydifferentiating for us.", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Just to remind you that infusion doesn\u2019t necessarily have to bedone in afacility although we dooffer that. It can bedone in thehome. It can bedone in our stores.One of the things thatmanufacturers and insurers getvery worried about of course is, is their medication being used and is itbeing used properly. When they areable to get to someonelike Walgreens that\u2019s easily accessible, we can make sure that they take theirmedication. The payoris assured that themedication was used. Themanufacturer doesn\u2019t have to worry about returns. Soit\u2019s very important that we service these people correctly and that\u2019s whyinfusion is sodifficult, but we think we\u2019re positioned quite correctly because itdoes take a lot oftime, a lot of effort.Also when you Take Care Clinics, you\u2019re probably familiar with this but that\u2019sanother way to getpeople into theWalgreens\u2019 system and getthose folks healthcare and that\u2019s why theinsurance companies arenow paying for that healthcare. Because if they can getfolks into the systemearlier, they can gettaken care of at theneed medication, they getthat. It avoids thehospital visit or anemergency room visit and helps to keep thetotal healthcare costs down. ", "Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Jeff are you working with the plan sponsors, to advertise for example TakeCare Clinics to a certain health plans members so they know and understand thatthe service offering you have?", "Gregory D. Wasson ", "Certainly we\u2019re working with the [inaudible] plans as we sign up and enterinto contracts with them and certainly encourage them to help us promote ourclinics. It certainly makes sense for them as well to lower their overallhealthcare costs.", "Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And then just one last follow-up, obviously AMP has been brushed off by thecurrent court ruling, we\u2019ll probably find out at some point in January as towhere it will move, aside from Medicaid, can you talk at all about any of yourother business that will be impacted by changes in reimbursement around theFederal upper limit or around AMP?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "Lisa, it\u2019s very hard to comment on that right now. We don\u2019t know thedetails. We have no idea of the metrics they\u2019re using and how they\u2019re going tofigure AMP. We just don\u2019t know so it\u2019s very tough to comment on that now. Whenwe have more information, obviously we\u2019ll be glad to talk about it. We justdon\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end up.", "Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley ", "Hi, congratulations on your cost control. Looking at your chart there forthe last five years you\u2019re SG&A growth has ranged between 11% and 18%, Ihear you did a 9.5% growth number, do you think you can stay down at that 10%range for the balance of the year?", "Jeffrey A. Rein ", "That\u2019s a good question. That\u2019s going to be difficult to do. What we\u2019rereally shooting for obviously, just as I said before, is around 11% to 12%overall. In trying to get down to that 9% year after year, I think that wouldbe tough particularly to opening new stores. If we weren\u2019t opening all of thesenew stores, 550 of them next year, then I believe we could control expenseseven better. But when you\u2019re opening all of these new stores, you have to hirefolks ahead of time. We\u2019re going into smaller towns so it requires a little bitmore help to get those stores open because you don\u2019t have folks to draw from ina mature market. So once again I don\u2019t want to commit to a 9% or 10% with openingall these new stores.", "William Rudolphsen", "", "We have done avery good job in thepast of matching our SG&A growth to our gross profits.  That\u2019s our intent for thefuture.  We fell off thewagon a little bit inthe fourthquarter.  We\u2019re coming back and that\u2019s theplan going forward.", "Mark Wiltamuth - MorganStanley ", "Can you give us anindication, I know labor reductions areone of the major goalshere. How have you done on scaling back some of those 24-hour stores and whatdoes that look like to thecustomer as you\u2019ve been doing that?", "Jeff Rein", "", "We\u2019ve taken approximately 60 down year over year. But onceagain, it\u2019s all basedon what the needs areof that particular store.  Atleast some folks got alittle too aggressive and opened a24-hour store just to try and capture more volume.  That\u2019s not asmart way to run thebusiness, to have allof that open, for thestore to be open whenyou don\u2019t need to cover those expenses like that.  ", "I just want to remind you though that year over year westill have more 24-hour stores than we did last year atthis time.  Once again, we\u2019re trying torationalize the use ofthese 24-hour stores and make sure we aresmart business people and match up thesales with what\u2019s actually needed.", "Mark Wiltamuth - MorganStanley ", "Inyour November press release you talked alittle bit about discounting inthe market place.  Was that more on thefront end or was itdiscounting to capture prescriptions?  Ifyou could just characterize what\u2019s going on out there.", "Jeff Rein", "", "That was inreference to the frontend.  Itwas more in thefront end.", "Mark Wiltamuth - MorganStanley ", "On theTake Care clinics, how much of anearnings drag are yousuffering right now as those stores getstarted?  What year doyou think you\u2019ll shift to profitability?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Bill, could you answer that please?", "William Rudolphsen", "", "Yes Mark, theearnings drag is going to beabout $75 million for theyear; $0.05 earnings pershare.  Thebreakeven point, itprobably is going to take about ayear to two years for units to gain share and become profitable.  Soit\u2019s all going tohinge on how fast we rollthem out.

We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with Jeff Rein, our Chairman and CEO discussing the quarter\u2019s results.

Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty.  Please see our form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007 for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.  Now here\u2019s Jeff Rein. ", "", "Jeff Rein", "", "Thank you Rick and good morning everyone.  Today we reported a solid third quarter performance.  In a challenging economy, we continue to successfully execute our strategies for growth while effectively managing costs.", "We reported record quarterly sales of $15 billion, an increase of 9.6% despite the impact of tight consumer spending.  We had a touch comparison to a net earnings increase of nearly 20% in last year\u2019s third quarter which was aided by blockbuster generic drug introductions.", "This year\u2019s net earnings grew 2% to $572 million.  That amounts to $0.58 per share, up 3.6% from last year\u2019s $0.56 per share.  One of the sales components that stood out in the quarter was our strong front end comparable store sales which increased 4.6%.  Competitors simply can\u2019t match our convenient locations.  They\u2019re the best in the business with 144 million Americans living within 2 miles of a Walgreens.", "Combined convenience with more promotional activity and we are positioned very well to win in today\u2019s environment.  Both the number of customers in our stores and the average dollars per transaction increased this quarter.  On the pharmacy side, the number of prescriptions we filled in comparable stores in the quarter increased 1.1% over a year ago, compared to an industry-wide decrease, excluding Walgreens of 0.9%.", "Industry-wide prescriptions continued to be impacted by a number of factors according to IMS Health, including the switch of Zyrtec from prescription to over-the-counter status, fewer new drug introductions, safety concerns over newer medications and the weaker economy.", "Despite these near term challenges, nothing will slow the impact of nearly 80 million Baby Boomers moving into their peak prescription use years.  This is a very good business to be in for the long term.  That\u2019s why our growth will increase approximately 9% this year.", "And to attract more patients to our pharmacy services, we\u2019re offering our prescription savings club to the public.  The club goes well beyond generic discount programs by offering savings on more than 5,000 brand name and generic medications.  Greg Wasson will talk about this a little bit later.  ", "We opened 138 new drugstores in the third quarter, 17 more than the year ago period.  So far in fiscal 2008, we\u2019ve opened a record 420 drug stores compared to 339 a year ago.  That resulted in a net gain of 370 drugstores after relocations and closings.  Even with all those openings in the third quarter and investments in our Take Care health clinics, SG&A expense dollars increased only 10% over the year ago quarter.", "To put that in perspective, it is only the second time since the fourth quarter of 1995 that SG&A expense dollars have been held to an increase of 10% or less.  We decreased the rate of store selling and expense growth and lowered advertising expenses.  At the same time, our pharmacy service remained high as store level pharmacy satisfaction levels improved each month during the quarter.", "As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses at 22.1% were essentially the same as last year.  Throughout this fiscal year, we\u2019ve proven our ability to hold the line on expenses.  SG&A expense dollars are up only 10.3% through the first nine months of fiscal 2008.  ", "With that overview, I\u2019d now like to welcome Wade Miquelon as our new CFO.  Wade officially joined us a week ago and is quickly getting up to speed with our people and the business.  Wade comes to us from Tyson Foods where he was Executive Vice President and CFO.  His excellent financial, strategic and operational experience at companies like Procter & Gamble will be a great benefit to us.  ", "As the financial community gets to know him, I\u2019ll sure you\u2019ll see why we\u2019re so impressed with his strategic thinking and communication skills.  In our press release announcing Wade\u2019s hiring, you saw that Bill Rudolphsen is moving from CFO to lead our risk management area as our Chief Risk Officer.  This new role is critical to Walgreens given our size, the growing complexity of our business and the highly regulated industry in which we operate.  ", "Earlier this month we also announced the appointment of Sona Chawla to the new position of Senior Vice President of Ecommerce.  Sona will join us on July 1 from Dell where she was Vice President of Global Online Business.  Her hiring represents a significant commitment we\u2019re making to take our online marketing and sales to a higher level.  ", "Even with the hiring of Wade and Sona, we continue to be primarily a promote from within company.  But as the industry and environment in which we compete change, we will look outside for unique abilities that compliment the expertise we develop in house.  And now Wade would you like to say a few words please?", "Wade Miquelon", "", "Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone, it\u2019s a pleasure to be able to join in on my first Walgreens call today.  While I\u2019ll only been on the job a few days and have an immense amount to learn, I can honestly say I\u2019m very impressed with everyone I\u2019ve met and I\u2019m extremely excited about all the opportunities that lay ahead of our company.", "Bill and his team are doing an excellent job of helping me to onboard and I look forward to meeting and spending time with our shareholders and the financial community in the future.  [Now for the forward] to partnering with Bill and his team as he takes on the new and critically important role or Chief Risk Officer.  And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill to review the financials in more detail.", "Bill Rudolphsen", "", "Thank you Wade.  Looking closer at our sales, total sales in comparable stores were up 3.4% in the quarter.  Prescription sales which represented 65.5% of total sales rose 8.9% for the quarter and 2.7% on a comparable store basis.  Total gross profit in the quarter was $4.2 billion, a 9.3% increase compared to a 16% increase the prior year.", "Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased one-tenth of one percentage point to 28.2%.  The growth rates this quarter for gross margin dollars and overall profits were impacted by touch comparisons to an unusually strong period a year ago.  That\u2019s when we were aided by the introductions of blockbuster generic versions of name brand drugs Zocor and Zoloft.  ", "Front end margins decreased because of more promotional activities, many in the digital photo category.  We also saw the sales mix shift to lower margin items.  We also lowered our LIFO rate this quarter by 25 basis points compared to a 50 basis point reduction in the year ago quarter.  That resulted in a LIFO provision of $16.1 million in this year\u2019s quarter versus a LIFO credit of $3.5 million last year.  ", "In the pharmacy, margins increased with the growth in generic drug sales.  The effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to a rate of 35.2% in the year ago period.  Last year\u2019s quarter included a $13.5 million credit from the resolution of a multi-year state tax matter.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.1% for the fiscal year.  ", "Accounts receivable were up 19.5% in the quarter, driven primarily by the Option Care specialty pharmacy and home infusion business we acquired last August.  The remainder of the increase resulted from the normal increase in third-party sales.", "Inventories in the third quarter climbed 9.4%, less than our 9.6% sales gain.  Total short term debt stood at $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter.  We will continue managing our balance sheet for maximum financial flexibility and to support our core growth strategy.  Cash flow from operations totaled $2.5 billion for the year to date.  And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President, Greg Wasson for an update on growth initiatives.", "Greg Wasson", "", "Thank you Bill and good morning everyone.  First I\u2019d like to congratulate our employees across the company for their sales efforts and expense management this quarter.  We received suggestions from nearly every department in every location and we found opportunities to reduce costs throughout the company.  In particular, our store operations folks proved why they are the best.  They controlled costs and they took care of our customers.  Thank you.", "Over the last several months the competitive environment has clearly changed as the economy has slowed as the $4.00 gas impacts customers.  At the same time, discount retailers and grocery chains are picking up their pace of promotional pricing, especially in the pharmacy, which they\u2019re using to build traffic.", "Our advantages are that in addition to being price competitive, we\u2019re better positioned with more convenient locations and enjoy a powerful brand reputation.  I like to put it this, while many of our competitors have a pharmacy department, Walgreen is a pharmacy.", "Patients, employers and managed care groups look to us to be their low cost pharmacy provider.  And we\u2019re at the leading edge of healthcare cost management in retail pharmacy and beyond.  Our specialty pharmacy and home care business, independent of a major PBM is attracting more and more interest throughout the industry.", "We now have about 550 combined worksite health centers and retail clinics to provide accessible low cost healthcare.  In this time of soaring medical costs, we\u2019re helping Americans meet basic healthcare needs.  We\u2019re seeing strong momentum in the push toward electronic prescribing, which improves patient compliance and enhances safety.", "We\u2019ve been a strong advocate of this technology for more than 16 years and during this calendar year, we expect to fill 15 million electronic prescriptions, more than double 2007.", "As Jeff mentioned earlier, we\u2019re also expending our prescription savings club, a cost savings solution for many people who need help paying for prescriptions.  The club provides discounts on not just a select list of generics but also an additional 5,000 brand and generic medications.", "Plus members can get a 90 day supply of more than 400 generics for $12.99.  And, they also get a 10% rebate on the purchase of Walgreen brand products.  One of the most important aspects of our prescription savings club is that is encourages patients to have all of their prescriptions filled at Walgreens.  Now only is that good for us but it allows our pharmacists to screen completely for dangerous drug interactions.", "Many patients don\u2019t realize that pharmacies can\u2019t access their prescription records at a different retailer.  They don\u2019t know the danger in filling a generic at one retail pharmacy, an antibiotic at another and a brand name drug at a third.  Our savings club is a great new product that\u2019s being well received by many patients, saving them money and we\u2019re very encouraged by patient reaction to it.", "Meanwhile, our focus on expanding pharmacy services that are complementary to our retail pharmacies continues.  This suite of services allows us to work with payers on a broad solution to lower costs.  Our specialty pharmacy business, which is greatly expanded with last year\u2019s acquisitions of Option Care is well positioned to deliver the growing number of specialty medications approved by the FDA and used by patients today.", "And of the new products awaiting FDA approval in 2008, 80% are specialty drugs according to IMS Health.  As you can see by this slide, the Prime Therapeutics contract for specialty drugs announced earlier this year has basically doubled our access to Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans nationwide.", "We strongly believe that our independence from the major PBMs was a significant factor in winning this business.  And our independence will help us to consistently win contracts over the long term.  Clients are telling us they prefer to be aligned with a company that isn\u2019t involved in services with which they may be competing in the future.", "Many specialty drugs are infused or injected rather than taken orally.  That means more demand for home infusion services.  We took another step toward growing that business this month when we announced our acquisition of CuraScript Infusion Pharmacy from Express Scripts.  This transaction will further expand our national coverage in home infusion services and get us close to 100 home infusion locations in more than 30 states.", "This quarter we also formed our Walgreens Health and Wellness Division to incorporate the acquisitions of I-Trax and Whole Health Management, operators of worksite health centers.  We\u2019re on track with a solid plan to aggressively integrate these businesses.  I-Trax and Whole Health were the top providers in their industry and we\u2019ve combined their best people to create a powerful management team.", "Together with our Take Care health clinics, we can offer large company employees health plan members and their dependents access to health centers and pharmacies at their worksite and at our drug stores.  We\u2019re already hearing a great deal of interest from clients for these services.", "We currently have about 550 retail clinics and worksite centers under our Health and Wellness Division, we\u2019re ramping up that growth.  We also have continued our expansion of pharmacies in hospitals and other medical centers to serve outpatient prescription needs.  By extending our definition of Main and Main locations to prestigious health systems, we\u2019re creating great value for the hospitals, patients and Walgreens.", "In closing, in the past 18 months, we have acquired and assembled a terrific set of assets, including specialty pharmacies, home infusion and home care facilities, worksite health centers, retail health clinics and pharmacies on location at major medical campuses.

Not only are the adjacent pharmacy and healthcare services Greg just outlined an important part of our future growth, it will also center around our retail drugstore business, which is proving its worth to American consumers during this tough economic period.  ", "Above all, we\u2019re a drugstore and we\u2019re proud of the success we\u2019re showing, especially in our front end business as consumers turn to us for value and shopping that\u2019s close to home.  Very few retailers can match our strong front end comparable store sales.  At the same time, our comparable store prescriptions filled are outpacing the industry.  ", "The opportunity for growing our business is as strong as ever, especially with the impact of the Baby Boom generation looming on the healthcare industry.  Our growth strategy entails: first, broadening our customer access to an expanding store base; second, leveraging the best retail corners in America to improve their productivity; and third, expanding our platform of adjacent healthcare services to be the provider of choice.

We\u2019ll keep you up to date on the event as the details are arranged.  I look forward to many of you joining us for the day when you\u2019ll have a chance to get better acquainted with our senior management team.  Thank you.", "Rick Hans", "", "Folks that concludes our prepared remarks, we\u2019re now ready for your questions.  Mickey, may I have our first question?", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions)  Your first question comes from Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "I\u2019d like to start by asking a question about the infusion business you\u2019ve got.  You obviously have the capability to do infusion either at locations or people\u2019s homes.  Does your infusion business also give you exclusive rights to distribute or infuse those particular drugs or will you work with the drugs that are controlled by anybody?", "Greg Wasson", "", "A little of both.  Our goal is to be able to offer services that will work with, to support any pharma company\u2019s drug, infused drug.  So we\u2019re looking, we have access to just about all infusion product.  Looking to gain access to those that we don\u2019t.  But it\u2019s not a restricted drug program if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "Just in terms of the exclusive control.  My second question is about kind of the connection between the Take Care facility and I-Trax slash Whole Health, the worksite health facilities.  Do you anticipate that you will be able to provide the same kinds of services and range of services at the Take Care facilities that you offer on the worksite facilities or will there be a difference in the offering?", "Greg Wasson", "", "Yes I think there will be a different portfolio of services.  I think the worksite centers can provide everything from a range of physical therapy to acute care to primary care, worker\u2019s comp programs and so forth.  I think the real value is connecting the dots for the employer for the members and employees that are able to use those services at the worksite with our retail health clinics and retail pharmacies in the community which gives them a more complete network of care.  ", "So the Take Care health care clinics within the retail stores will probably be more acute, more HR type wellness programs.  We just recently launched [soft backs] through all of our Take Care clinics nationwide.  So I think there will be probably a more intense and more disease management focus in the centers and then combined with acute care and wellness programs in the retail stores.", "Jeff Rein", "", "One more thing to keep in mind also between the onsite clinics and the Take Care clinics is that we\u2019ll also be able to take care of retirees and dependents because when you\u2019re dealing with the employer onsite, you only have the employee.  This gets them very familiar with the Walgreen name, it gets them into our system and we\u2019ll be able to serve their whole family, once again the dependents and the retirees.  ", "We think the two will tie together very, very well.  So wherever they need care, whether it\u2019s at home or work, we will be there and that\u2019s the main intent of trying to integrate all of these together.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "", "One follow up question with that is about technology.  To really make this effective, do you think you need to make significant investments in technology?  It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s probably a demand for on the part of employers to have a repository of all kinds of healthcare information about their employees, is that something that you anticipate being involved in?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Absolutely, we\u2019re involved in that right now.  We\u2019re integrating all of them.  As you know we\u2019re working with outside companies, it could be Google for example, could be Microsoft.  So there is a demand, it\u2019s still an evolving business.  There will be some money and resources that we will put into technology to make it happen.  ", "But one of the most important points that we can do is to make sure that there is one face for Walgreens and that the patient is able to integrate it across all the different companies.  So basically what they see is one company and we take care of them no matter where they are.", "Greg Wasson", "", "If I might add, that\u2019s one of the reasons all three of these companies, Whole Health, I-Trax and Take Care really appealed to us as all three of them have state of the art systems, Take Care has a great EMR, Whole Health and I-Trax have great operating systems which will help us leverage that technology.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "The progress on SG&A at the store level, it looks like SG&A per store is actually now running flat year over year and you commented the sort of historic low level of SG&A growth.  Can you just talk a little more about specifically what\u2019s going on there that\u2019s different than what we\u2019ve seen in prior years when that number was growing more like 15%?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Sure, about 60% of the relative savings this time was from the payroll at store level.  There was some mixture in there of expenses and advertising control.  What we\u2019re really doing is making sure that we targeted our sales and targeted our budget on a weekly basis.  ", "I think what happened before is that the payroll got away with us because we did not really follow our budgets.  If you get budgeted sales and of course you get budgeted hours, if you\u2019re above sales you get more hours and conversely if you\u2019re down in sales then you get less hours.  ", "So we\u2019ve taken a more proactive approach.  We\u2019ve gotten more Operations Vice Presidents, District Manager and Store Mangers to pay attention to what is going on in their stores on a weekly basis.  So once again it all comes down to discipline and focus.  That\u2019s a big difference from before.  ", "Also as Greg mentioned, we\u2019re getting more suggestions about how to really watch out for what we call duplication in terms of expenses.  Are we doing things that we really need to do or just things that we want to do?  ", "Big difference there, so we\u2019re really focusing on what we need to do, we\u2019re focusing on investing the business where it makes sense for the long term and being very, very careful on spending these expense dollars, keeping in mind we\u2019re only a $0.03 company, $0.03 net to sales.  We have to be very careful and very aware of that.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "On a go-forward basis, I think you previously talked about SG&A growing 11-12%, is that what you think is the number?  Is it now 10%?  So I guess what\u2019s the number and how long is that sustainable?", "Jeff Rein", "", "We\u2019ve put out there the 11-12%.  Of course part of it is related to net store growth of course.  This year we\u2019re going to be up a little over 9%.  And so holding down those expense dollars artificially, it would not be wise to do because we don\u2019t want to hurt service levels.  ", "We certainly don\u2019t want to hurt going after new businesses.  You know about all the acquisitions we\u2019ve done, not only in the business itself but obviously expertise and different people.  So our goal right now is still out there at 11-12%.  We want to be smart about it but we are absolutely focused on making sure we manage it properly.  And if we need to be under that level, 12%, we certainly will. ", "A lot of it is tied into the gross profit dollar increase.  And you\u2019ve seen that chart over time where it\u2019s pretty well matched up.  Where the gross profit dollars are decreasing, we will absolutely decrease those gross profit expenses.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "And I guess within this, do you feel like you\u2019ve got visibility into the service levels at the store to know that you\u2019re not cutting too much?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Absolutely, boy that is something we\u2019re really focused on.  We have what we call KPIs, key performance indicators.  We have the mystery shop where we have an outside company shopping our company to give us feedback, they talk to the employees or they don\u2019t even identify themselves and make notes of what\u2019s going on.  ", "Plus we use a receipt survey where after a customer purchases something, there is an inducement, if you\u2019ve seen our receipt to actually have them call in or use the internet to give us feedback on how we\u2019re doing.  And we know exactly what store that that is being measured against.  ", "So yes, we are extremely aware of what\u2019s going on.  Plus the other thing that we\u2019ve done, really stepped up is in terms of night checks and making sure supervision is in the field.  We absolutely have to do that.", "", "Greg Wasson", "", "Every morning at 6:00 am I can come in at my fingertips and read sales, ready payroll and read customer satisfaction.  So we have visibility.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "And then secondly, the comment that was made about the front end promotional environment, could you just characterize it?  I know the front end is always competitive but you mentioned grocery and mass, can you just talk a little more about how competitive that front end promotional environment is and is getting and sort of is this is as bad as it gets or does it get worse from here?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Well what we\u2019re seeing is that people are absolutely shopping for a value.  And with Walgreens convenience and our promotional pricing, they do get that value.  We are seeing a trending up of ad sales.  So items that we run on promotion or what we call mega-savers, that in store promotions, we are seeing an uptick in those particular sales.  People are a little bit more price conscious, they definitely are trading down.  ", "However, that does help us when they trade down for the private label products.  As you know our private label products are just as good, if not better than the brand products.  So we give people a value, they shop us, it\u2019s working out very well.  I can\u2019t say if this absolutely the worst, I don\u2019t know that, hard to predict.  But I can tell you based on our convenience, being close to home, close to work and people only thinking of 1.6 items coming into Walgreens, they absolutely are using us more and more.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Can you talk about what has changed in the environment that has the company exceeding its goal for store openings this year?  There\u2019s some thought that slowing down perhaps you could get your real estate terms and how are you thinking about balancing this pursuit of long term growth with nearer term performance?  And then final part of this question is how do you think about ROI on new stores versus buying back your own stock as an investment?", "Jeff Rein", "", "On the first part of your question, as you know Mark, many of these sites were approved 24-36 months ago.  It typically takes anywhere from the time its approved in real estate to the time it opens is about 24-30 months, there are some outliers of course that can take longer.", "So in terms of what\u2019s going to open next year, the 9%, sometimes the authorities work with you, sometimes they work against you.  In this particular case, many of the sites that we\u2019re opening, we actually went through the entitlement process a little bit quicker than we anticipated.", "Going forward, it\u2019s interesting that we are seeing, we do see some weakening in terms of occupancy costs.  So where there\u2019s been a lot of emphasis on the home market, we are seeing some emphasis now on the commercial market where those prices are decreasing which is a really welcome sign. ", "In terms of construction, that has been going up for concrete and steel and so on, but we also have come up with different designs with our stores to take out costs out of the store which actually works real well.  ", "The percentage increase this year will be over 9%, but that was really not by design once again.  In future years you will see that percentage going down.  We\u2019ve always said organic growth would be around 8%.  Sometimes it\u2019s higher, sometimes it\u2019s lower and you can track that over the years of course. ", "Going forward, I do see that percentage edging down though because this is about as many stores as we\u2019re going to open this year and next, it will be about our maximum absolute number of stores in any one year. ", "In terms of the ROI and looking at the stores, our mature stores do make over 15% and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.  It is true in the first few years that ROI is less, obviously because they\u2019re new stores and they lose money.  Over time, a mature store, we absolutely look for over 15%.  Bill do you want to have a little comment please on buying back stock?", "Bill Rudolphsen", "", "I do want to comment on that, we have been able to generate a consistent return on investment over time, even growing our store base at 8% so it has definitely worked out for us.  And just to echo Jeff\u2019s comments, a mature store over three years old will generate a 15% return on investment.", "So our best investment is continuing growing our company at an 8% clip in store growth.  We are looking to maintain a debt to cap ratio in the 50% range and we want to maintain our credit rating.  We\u2019re still growing our store base rapidly.  We are able to get 75 year flat term rents based on our credit rating and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continued.", "Jeff Rein", "", "Mark also in terms of new store growth, keep in mind that we\u2019re in an industry that the pie is expanding, many industries are cutting back or shrinking, we are expanding, particularly with the Baby Boomers getting older.  I think you\u2019re going to see a great explosion of folks taking drugs, whether it\u2019s Obama or McCain coming in, both of them have talked about increasing utilization of drugs, they want more access to drugs by people to help control total healthcare costs.  ", "So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us, most people choose a pharmacy based on location, whether it\u2019s closest to home or closest to their office.  So we want to make sure that we\u2019re positioned very well in the future.", "", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "On the SG&A growth, could you help us disaggregate what is the change in the growth rate of comp store expenses you talk about lower rate, [inaudible] store salary and expense growth, how much would be coming from new stores?  I recognize it\u2019s not one for one, in other words these stores have a lower expense rate to begin with.  And then how much would be if you could tell us the year on year change for the Take Care clinics.", "Bill Rudolphsen", "", "On a comp store basis, we\u2019re looking at SG&A growth in the range of 4%.", "Jeff Rein", "", "And also Mark on the Take Care clinics, we have put out there $75 million as a drag on earnings.  We\u2019re still intending to hold it out right now.  Obviously we\u2019ll be able to measure more properly as we go along.

First off, in terms of your healthcare offering and how you\u2019re marketing the various pieces that you\u2019ve assembled to the payer community, I was trying to understand whether you have separate sales teams that are in place for each of those various components or whether you\u2019ve united them all under one common banner?", "Rick Hans", "", "We have what we call our managed care sales team which is more of a generalist organization where they\u2019ve had the relationships over the years with the managed care and PBM payers, with the pharmacy directors and so forth.  That group is leveraging those relationships to bring in the specialists that lie within the individual business groups.  ", "For example, Mike Nameth who used to be with Wellpoint is running our PBM and specialty.  You know he\u2019s got a group of experts that\u2019s helping sell our specialty business.  Paul Mastrapa who now leads Option Care and our Home Care division has a great group of sales folks that understands that business.  Take Care, Hal Rosenbluth and so forth.  So we\u2019ve kind of got a generalist team where we bring in the specialists as we get the opportunities.", "Analyst for Lisa Gill \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Now that healthcare does make up a larger portion of your business following some of the recent acquisitions, do you have any plans or are there any requirements to increase the disclosure around that segment in particular?", "Jeff Rein", "", "We will do that as soon as it hits our 5% mark.  Right now it\u2019s all under our Walgreen Health Services.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On your digital photo promotional strategy.  Can you maybe talk about how much of the overall front end gross margin pressure is from lower digital photo prices?  And then are you pleased with the return you\u2019re getting on this investment and how do you measure that?", "Jeff Rein", "", "On the photo we have lowered the prices as you remember we did that last October.  It is definitely a drag right now because we wanted to make sure that we are competitive.  We do see the photo volume moving up but once again on the margin itself as you know it\u2019s extremely high margin business.  ", "But it does hurt the margins.  However, I can tell you that once again it does bring people in.  Competition has lowered their prices so we obviously matched that.  But we have one of the top rated photo websites around.  Keep in mind that what really helps us in terms of convenience, once again, you can upload your scripts form anywhere in the company and pick it up at any other location in the company.  ", "So if your daughter wants to upload scripts to you and pay for it which would be nice of her to do, you can actually pick it up at a pharmacy near you or a location near you.  It\u2019s still a very, very viable business.  We obviously measure the ROI on each of the components.  One of the things that in that department that we\u2019re doing is expanding other services.  ", "So if you look at the DHL services, if you look at printer cartage refills, those are all high volume high margin businesses.  And Greg I know you\u2019ve got some really good training programs going on to make sure we really increase those sales, do you want to mention that?", "", "Greg Wasson", "", "Yes I think I\u2019d go back to the, when we talk about our strategy in the second bucket as leveraging the box, that\u2019s exactly what this is doing.  With our photo customers that we\u2019re bringing in are attracted to a lot of the many additional services we\u2019re looking to expand, the DHL and the inkjet and so forth.  ", "We\u2019re going to have a little over half of our employees trained this coming month on DHL as we roll DHL out to all stores by the end of the year.  We\u2019ve got some very good training programs now that drive incentives and opportunities for our photo folks to grow sales and earn commissions.  So we\u2019re really excited about this area.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "At some point here and I guess it\u2019s probably October, November, you\u2019ll start to cycle this.  So what I\u2019m trying to figure out though is just how much pressure it\u2019s creating on the gross margin now.  I mean it sounds like it could be more than half of the decline in the gross margin.  Is that fair?", "Bill Rudolphsen", "", "It\u2019s less than that but there is an impact on the margin and it\u2019s true that we would be cycling this in October.  And we are definitely seeing some softness due to less travel out there and more promotional activity.  But it is less than half of the impact on the front end margin I can say that.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then one last question, I want to understand the questions and your answers earlier on the expense control.  If we continue to see sales kind of at current levels and let\u2019s fast forward to next year.  It sounds like you have the ability to grow SG&A less than the 11-12% in that type of situation.  Is that what you were trying to imply earlier?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Yes, that is very true, yes it\u2019s not just implication but it is something that we are focused on doing, absolutely.  We really watched the gross profit, we are really focused on do we need the expense, do we have to have the expense, is it best to spend that money for the benefit of the company?  So yes, the bottom line question and answer is yes.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And just with the inflationary environment we have today, just fuel obviously but you\u2019ve got the issue of price inflation as well on your cost of goods, does it make it more difficult to do what you were just talking about?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Only in the sense that you\u2019re looking at probably payroll, electricity and things of that nature.  But in terms of cost of goods, as you know, we would pass that along just like other retailers are doing, we\u2019re very, very competitive, we make sure we shop the competition.  But if there\u2019s price increases and inflation coming down the pike which I believe there will be, then we will pass those on to consumers.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Debora Weinswig \u2013 Citi.", "Debora Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "In terms of the Take Care clinics, obviously there\u2019s a lot of competition out there right now, can you remind us what the competitive edge really is for Walgreens and how you see that developing going forward as well?", "Jeff Rein", "", "The competitive advantage for Walgreens is we\u2019re very focused on having a quality experience in our Take Care clinic.  If you look at our clinics versus the others, we\u2019ve been rated one of the top ranked ones around.  That\u2019s because we have two exam rooms, we have a table, we have hot water.  We also have strict protocols for the nurse practitioner and they\u2019re based back near the pharmacy.  ", "So if you look at the environment and the feedback that we\u2019ve had from physicians, customers, patients and nurse practitioners, we have one of the highest quality experiences in all of retail.  Once again, based on our convenience and our attracting of quality people and being accessible to people, whether it\u2019s at night, weekends, I believe it differentiates us from the competition.  ", "If you look at the some of the competition, they\u2019re actually going back and redesigning, reformatting their clinics to bring them up to the standards that we have.  We also have certain clinics within the industry that are owned by other folks, not Take Care, but that are actually going out of business, they\u2019re pulling up shop because they cannot match the expertise and the quality that we are offering our patients.", "Debora Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "And then can you also elaborate a little bit on the Walgreens prescription savings club.  How are you making sure that your customers in store are aware of the club and also how are you reaching out to those customers who maybe aren\u2019t yet in your stores?", "Greg Wasson", "", "I think as far as in store, that\u2019s where we\u2019re really excelling right now.  We obviously have in store signage, our folks who know how to execute are talking to folks and explaining the value of the card.  So I think we\u2019ve done very well on the in store, with the in store segment.  As far as the external, we\u2019re launching a major campaign as we speak.  ", "We absolutely do think we have a great product, we want to get it out there.  We want the doctors to know about the card, we think there\u2019s great value for them to be able to talk to patients who are struggling with prescription costs to let them know about it.  So we\u2019re really looking forward to ramping up our marketing effort externally.", "Jeff Rein", "", "On interesting fact is that only 7.5% of the people that come into Walgreens actually go back and get a prescription.  So there\u2019s a great opportunity to make sure people know about the prescription savings club card on the front end.  People who never make it back to the pharmacy that didn\u2019t even realize the savings that are involved.  ", "And I\u2019m telling you this 400 generics for $12.99 for a 90 day supply is a great value.  It\u2019s a little over $4.00 a month of course, and you talk about convenience, that really plays into convenience and access and savings very, very well.", "Greg Wasson", "", "And the potential as you know is huge, there\u2019s 47 million uninsured out there, there\u2019s many more millions that are under insured.  We think we\u2019ve got a great product to help them control their prescription costs.", "Debora Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "And it also seems just from looking on the website that there\u2019s also coupons that you\u2019ll be giving to customers just for them inquiring about the club.  So there is a definite kind of aggressive marketing strategy behind this?", "Jeff Rein", "", "There is, we\u2019re using the internet more and more.  We did find out for example during Medicare part D that that was very, very effective for us to give people coupons just for coming back to the pharmacy and talking to our pharmacists and staff about the savings they can do and the services that we do have.  So you\u2019re right, the onsite works very, very well.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You mentioned the competitive environment but you would think in light of pharmacy sales and this lull in generic activity that there would be more competitive fallout, independents and smaller regional chains, maybe then some supermarkets that we\u2019ve seen.  Are we seeing that, are we going to see that, where\u2019s the market share opportunity for you there?", "Jeff Rein", "", "You\u2019re darn right on that, we\u2019re seeing fallout left and right.  It\u2019s interesting when Medicare part D first started, a lot of the independents were on the fence so to speak, should they get out of the business or not.  Now they are definitely getting out of the business.  ", "I also see smaller regional chains for example that can\u2019t have the resources or don\u2019t have the resources to put into technology, updating their format, things of that nature.  So there\u2019s a great opportunity and that comes back a little bit to our store growth.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s very, very dynamic here.  ", "And as people fall down and fall apart and are no longer with us and I can assure you they will be, that\u2019s where we will be to have a site in the trade area that will take care of people.  So you\u2019re exactly right, the opportunities for us in the next three to five years because of the fallout of people going out of business is just tremendous for Walgreens and we\u2019re going to take advantage of it.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is there enough market share opportunity to get you back to your long term profit growth rate in the interim here or does that require a better economy and a better group of generic drugs coming on the market?", "Jeff Rein", "", "I think this is a lull right now in prescriptions in general.  As you know, prescription usage is down for various reasons, part of it is the economy of course.  Part of it in our numbers is Zyrtec by the way.  That was a 70 basis point drag on the quarter.  Part of it is the scare of what pharmaceuticals do, for example the Heparin, Vytorin, some safety issues, people are a little bit more scared. ", "But I do believe that IMS is saying that there\u2019s going to be a 4-6% increase over the next three to five years.  And I think you will see, once again our growth being spurred on by whichever administration is in power.  Both Obama and McCain have come out very strongly in saying drugs do help control healthcare costs and we want better access for the American public to these prescriptions.  ", "That is going to happen, it\u2019s absolutely going to happen.  So once again this is a lull, I do see us getting back to our normal growth rates and we\u2019re going to be well positioned to take advantage of it.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "What\u2019s going on with discussions with other PBMS with regard to, I don\u2019t know if it would be a joint venture, working together to bring new programs to the market.  Is that fertile at this point or not really going anywhere?", "Jeff Rein", "", "We are definitely talking to the other PBMs.  As you know CVS Caremark manages about 15% of the prescriptions at Walgreens, that leaves 85% of the prescriptions that are managed by somebody else and we are definitely talking with those folks. ", "Greg Wasson", "", "I\u2019d echo just that, I think that we have several of the payers, the PBMs out there that do not own mail or specialty that we work with very closely.  We\u2019re expanding those relationships.  We\u2019re also working with the managed care plans that are out there as Jeff said.  Prime for example is a great example of the [inaudible] in our specialty relationship, we\u2019re looking to work even closer with them.  ", "Certainly the remaining large PBMs have been more interested in talking to us as we\u2019ve talked about in the past since the merger.  So we\u2019re really working closely.  We\u2019re really targeted on the Blues as you know.  ", "And as Jeff said, the premise to our strategy is that we absolutely believe that our large vertical integration between a PBM and a retailer creates competitive conflict between the rest of the payer community.  And there are 85% of the lives out there being managed by many payers that we want to work with more closely.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Neil Currie \u2013 UBS.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "", "I just wanted to dig down a little bit more on new store productivity.  You talked about the 15% ROI on maturity but at any one time you have a lot of your stores which are less than three years old.  And just looking at your pharmacy volumes in same stores, a lot of the stores that contribute to same store volumes are the ones between two, three, four years old.  ", "And it does seem that the gap between yourselves and the rest of the market seems to have narrowed.  I mean you\u2019re opening 8-9% square foot a year, your pharmacy volumes are just about positive, obviously the rest of the industry is slightly negative, but the gap, historically has been somewhat higher.  ", "So I\u2019m wondering whether a couple of things are happening here, whether Wal-Mart is having more of an impact than we think on overall volumes hence the introduction of the savings club or whether recent new stores that are in that sort of two, three year age, whether they are continuing to drive the sort of comp growth that they have traditionally.  Can you just comment on that?", "Jeff Rein", "", "The first five years, under five years, the new stores are definitely a drag on earnings.  On average it takes stores three years to become, to hit that breakeven point and then they start growing from there.  I think one interesting thing that you might want to consider in terms of narrowing of the spread and it has narrowed a little tiny bit is our competitors number one are consolidating.  ", "So they\u2019re doing two for one locations, they\u2019re putting two stores into one store.  And also we\u2019re going into markets that are more difficult for us, they take a little bit longer to grow and we\u2019ve talked about that in the past, that\u2019s California, particularly Southern California and the Northeast.  Those stores once again take a little bit longer to hit their breakeven point.  ", "And since we\u2019re not as well known, it takes longer to build up the pharmacy business.  It is interesting though that in looking at numbers from IMS is that we are still having a significant spread between us and the competition and of course you can look at those numbers and see that our spread is still very significant on a month to month basis. ", "So there has been a little bit of narrowing over the last I would say three to four years.  Part of that is the competition is stronger and getting stronger.  But once again our spread is still very significant compared to the industry.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "", "And just on the Wal-Mart $4.00 generics and $10.00 90 days, it\u2019s not just Wal-Mart anymore, it\u2019s a whole host of discounters and it seems that supermarkets are gradually starting to move towards that pricing.  Is this becoming more of an impact on the cash business hence as I say the introduction of your savings club card?", "Jeff Rein", "", "That\u2019s one of the reasons that we came out with the prescription savings club card.  Keep in mind that the cash business at Walgreens, depending on the month is in that 5-6% range.  So even though it\u2019s not part of our total business in terms of how big the impact is, it is still part of our business.  ", "But this prescription savings club card as Greg mentioned has been very, very well received by our patients and customers.  And we\u2019ll make more inroads in the future.  We\u2019re having approximately thousands and thousands of signups a week that are absolutely taking advantage of this and will be good for us in the future.  ", "So once again, people are getting more aware of the cost of medications.  But when you come back to our convenience and the stores that we have opened and the hours that we have open, we will definitely win out.", "Greg Wasson", "", "Keep in mind that the majority of our business is indeed contracted with third-party payers where members have co-pays and many generics at $5.00 or less in some cases.  So as far as the third-party business, we absolutely believe our convenience is a major factor.  And we think that the PSC will help us gain share in that cash customer.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to hone in a little more on your comments that some of this IMS data may be weak because of the economy.  Are you seeing different compliance trends in different parts of the market and have we seen any drop off in prescriptions more in the California or Florida region or anything along those lines?", "Jeff Rein", "", "Yes, a couple things that are happening that we\u2019ve heard and seen.  Number one, people are actually splitting their medications to make sure they go further.  They are skipping doses, in other words they\u2019re taking their dose every other day.  And certain medications you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the different short term, for example on high blood pressure medication, if you skip a dose or skip a day, you probably won\u2019t feel a difference.  Same thing with statins.    ", "California and Florida have been difficult.  As you know they\u2019ve been hurt terribly by the economy.  And we are seeing impact there.  But overall we are continuing to pick up market share across the nation.  Even with the introduction of the Wal-Mart $4.00 program, we have increased our market share since that time.  So even though there\u2019s a lull in prescriptions right now, I do believe it will come back and many of these factors in my mind are temporary.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how generics were for you in the quarter.  Was it helpful or how did it compare versus last year\u2019s?", "Jeff Rein", "", "The big difference this quarter in terms of the profitability is we lost Oxycontin.  If you remember Oxycontin was a pain medication that went from generic to brand.  That was a significant hit in terms of earnings.  Otherwise everything else was pretty much normal.", "Greg Wasson", "", "We were also cycling the effect of Zocor and Zoloft going generic last year.  So just to repeat, we had phenomenal increases in gross margins last year and they were a little bit soft compared to last year\u2019s introduction of those two blockbuster drugs.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Just a general comment, I just get the impression that of all your adjacency acquisitions, you\u2019re not really getting much credit form the investor community on those and a lot of them have been smaller individual deals.  But in total there are several of them and I\u2019m just curious if you could characterize what kind of accretion the group would have in terms of EPS impact over maybe a three to five year period.", "Jeff Rein", "", "Thanks very much for recognizing that, we appreciate that comment because that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.  Even though they look small, in total they are big.  And keep in mind the expertise that we\u2019re getting with this.  Healthcare in America is changing and it\u2019s evolving.  ", "People are looking for a reason and a value to pay for services and they want to make sure that we can influence outcomes.  We are absolutely doing that.  Greg has been absolutely intimately involved working with WHS in really leading up these efforts in terms of the integration of our health and wellness area.", "Greg Wasson", "", "Thanks for the suggestion, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re getting the credit and recognition we should.  I think over the past 12-18 months we\u2019ve assembled a national infusion platform that\u2019s second to none I believe out there with a big pipeline of infusion specialty drugs coming at us.  The MedMark acquisition with the expertise we got there from Stan Blaylock and his group has really provided us a scalable platform that we\u2019re linking to the infusion platform as we speak.  ", "I think we picked up the best in store retail clinic provider in Take Care that was out there.  I think Hal Rosenbluth and his group is bringing us a ton of experience.  A couple of the top providers in the wellness space, I-Trax and Whole Health and that has come together, we\u2019ve assembled a strong management team there and we\u2019ve got a heck of a platform.  ", "The real value now comes between connecting the dots between the two as I talked about.  I think all of these what they\u2019ll do is the way we look at these is not only do we see these businesses and these adjacencies providing huge growth opportunity as we go forward but they also accelerate the drug store business for us as well.  So we\u2019re really bullish on this and thank you for the question.", "Jeff Rein", "", "One more thing to reiterate, all the time that we\u2019ve been doing this, particularly over the last three quarters, we have managed to keep our expenses in check.  We\u2019re very, very focused on growing businesses that make sense and obviously cutting back on items that do not make sense.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Do you have any way of quantifying the total accretion we could be thinking about a couple years out?", "Bill Rudolphsen", "", "We haven\u2019t laid out a lot of details there but we have talked about some of the larger acquisitions and we would place accretion anywhere from $0.05 to $0.10 per share over the next three years.", "Operator", "", "Your final question comes from David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "You mentioned the fact that new stores in the aggregate will be plateauing here over the next couple of years.  Is there any difference in terms of just the profile of new versus existing markets that you\u2019re going into and owning versus leasing?  ", "And then the second part is that thinking longer term, many years down the road and knowing maybe that you guys would go international, are there any international markets that to you seem most similar to the US in terms of how it\u2019s constructed that would look most interesting to you?", "Jeff Rein", "", "On your first question in terms of profiling, what the stores look like, we look at a trade area.  We look at the demographics and other things in that trade area, we have many different metrics we look at.  But in terms of profile of the store, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything necessarily different about them except the selection of merchandise inside.  ", "Sometimes there\u2019s a little difference in the way the stores look, but that\u2019s based on community approvals.  But we do have many projects going on and one of them is facing department management, one is optimization of the SKUs in that store.  So you always want to have that local flavor that matches the demographics and matches the wants and needs of that particular clientele.  ", "But once again there\u2019s opportunities across America in all the different trade areas.  It could be in markets that we\u2019re not heavily in right now or it could be in markets like Chicago, Memphis, St. Louis and so on to some that we\u2019re already in that we\u2019re doing very well that we want to dense up even more.", "Bill Rudolphsen", "", "Right now our target roughly is 20% owned, 80% leased.  And that will probably continue on for a while but we\u2019ll have to evaluate that if we do plateau or growth in the future.  We\u2019ll have to continually evaluate our capital structure.  But that\u2019s where we\u2019re settling in right now to protect our credit rating.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "And on the market, so you would expect the ratio between new and existing markets to be about the same as it is?", "Jeff Rein", "", "No, we\u2019ve actually hit almost all of the new markets that are, as you know we\u2019re going into Washington DC, we\u2019ve got over 200 approvals in the Northeast right now.  We\u2019re all over the country, in fact we recently announced Alaska right so that will give us 50 states.  So we\u2019re okay there.  But where we have an opportunity is to dense up in many markets.  When you dense up you take advantage of costs, supervision costs, advertising costs, distribution costs, you can spread those costs out of a wider base.  ", "And in any one market there\u2019s always a tipping point where you build you build you build and you hit that tipping point and then your profitability explodes.  And there\u2019s many markets that are in that camp.  So once again in terms of beach heads, we really are across all of the United States.  ", "Getting back to your question also in terms of international, as Greg was talking about earlier on healthcare services, there are so many opportunities here for us in the US that between the US and Puerto Rico, there really isn\u2019t any need to go international at this point.  People are looking for value, they\u2019re looking for health and how do they control their healthcare costs and how do they stay healthier.  ", "And Walgreens with Take Care clinics, with Option Care, Schrafts, our infusion business, our pharmacies, 6,300 distribution points across America, we are extremely well positioned for the future.  So once again, international we\u2019ve look at it but our opportunities in the US here are just fantastic.", "Rick Hans", "", "Folks that was our final question.  Thank you for joining us today.  We\u2019ll announced June sales on July 2.  Our next quarterly financial announcement will be September 29 when we announce fourth quarter fiscal 2008 yearend results.

(Operator Instructions) Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rick Hans, Divisional Vice President of Inventor Relations and Finance.", "Rick Hans", "We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with Jeff Rein our Chairman and CEO discussing the quarter\u2019s highlights. Wade Miquelon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide details on the fourth quarter financial results. Greg Wasson our President will give an overview of progress on implementing our growth strategy. Following that Jeff will give a brief summary and then we\u2019ll be ready to take your questions.", "For the Q&A we\u2019ll also be joined by John Spina our Vice President and Treasurer. Please limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can give an opportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time. I\u2019d like to point out that today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our Investor Relations website located at investor.walgreens.com. After the call this presentation will be archived on our website for 12 months.", "Before we get started I\u2019ll read our safe harbor language. Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2007 for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward looking statements. Now here\u2019s Jeff Rein.", "Jeff Rein", "Today we announced the fourth quarter in which we once again grew sales and earnings, controlled costs, gained market share and strengthened our management team. We also turned in our 34th consecutive year of record sales and earnings. That\u2019s a track record matched by only one other Fortune 500 company. For the fiscal year sales increased 9.8% to a record $59 billion. Net earnings grew 5.7% to a record $2.2 billion or $2.17 per share diluted.", "Fourth quarter sales were a record $14.6 billion that\u2019s an increase of 8.8%. Net earnings rose 11.7% to $443 million, that\u2019s $0.45 per share diluted up 12.5% from last year\u2019s $0.40. The quarter included several unusual items both positive and negative that Wade will discuss in detail. Fourth quarter front end comp store sales grew 3.7% while total comps grew 2.6%. It\u2019s obvious that customers are finding value in our products, services and convenient close to home locations especially as gas prices skyrocket.", "On the Pharmacy side comparable prescription sales rose 2.8% in the quarter after adjustment for calendar shifts. The number of prescriptions filled in comp stores was 0.6% over a year ago. That compares favorably to an industry wide decrease of 1.9% excluding Walgreen\u2019s. As you see we\u2019re consistently beating the industry. As many of you know we\u2019re facing a continuation of the slowest growing prescription drug market in 47 years according to IMS Health. Several things are driving this.", "First is the switch of the allergy drug Zyrtec from prescription to over the counter status earlier this year. We\u2019ve also seen fewer new drug interactions as well as some safety concerns over new medications. We believe the biggest impact has been the very tough economy. According to a July survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners 22% of Americans are reducing their doctor visits and 11% are scaling back on medication use. The good news is that we continue to gain prescription market share and now fill 17.6% of all retail prescriptions in the country. That\u2019s up from 16.8% last fiscal year.", "Before turning the call over to Wade for more details on our financials I\u2019d like to give a quick recap of our competitive position. In fiscal 2008 we implemented our growth strategy through a number of short term and long term initiatives designed to deliver significant value to shareholders. First, we\u2019re moderating Walgreen\u2019s organic growth rate. This decision will give us greater operational and financial flexibility and it will also drive earnings growth in coming years.", "Wade will offer more color in a few minutes but it\u2019s important to note that even while organic expansion slows Walgreen\u2019s will remain one of the fastest growing retailers in the country. Second, our worksite healthcare acquisitions in our Health and Wellness Division are integrating well. With them we\u2019ve established the foundation to provide compelling future growth across all platforms. Third, we have a relentless focus on reducing costs through disciplined control today and over the long term. You can see the evidence of that throughout the past fiscal year and especially in the fourth quarter.", "Fourth, we\u2019ve expanded our leadership team to drive bold, creative and innovative responses to a rapidly changing retail and healthcare environment. This past summer we added Wade Miquelon as our CFO and Sona Chawla as our Senior VP of E-Commerce. Our latest addition is Kim Feil, the new Chief Marketing Officer we announced last week. Kim, previously CMO at Sara Lee will lead a new marketing organization to more effectively meet the needs of Walgreen\u2019s customers and Pharmacy patients particularly for health and wellness.", "Before moving on I\u2019d like to note that we will not be discussing our previously announced proposal to acquire Longs Drug Stores. We remain committed to our proposal which we believe is a superior one but we won\u2019t take any questions regarding it during the Q&A. With that overview I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO.", "Wade Miquelon", "First I\u2019d like to reiterate and thank our people for the strong sales and cost discipline that continued throughout our company in the fourth quarter. We continue to position ourselves as the leading retailer in a very tough economy. Recapping sales we were up 9.8% for the fiscal year and 8.8% for the fourth quarter. We posted a total comparable store sales increase of 2.6% for the fourth quarter and a front end comp store sales increase of 3.7%. ", "Prescription sales which represented 56% of total sales rose 7.9% for the quarter and 2% on a comparable store basis. Net earnings per diluted share grew 6.9% in fiscal 2008 to $2.17. For the fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.5% to $0.45. In the fourth quarter we had a $79 million positive adjustment for employee vacation accrual. ", "During our year end controls processes we discovered we had been historically over accruing for vacation versus our long standing policies. As this was not material to the year nor to any one historical period prior it was appropriate for us to true it up this quarter. To the negative we had heavier promotional spending than originally planned, several smaller adjustments, a higher than year ago tax rate and a fairly significant LIFO provision.", "The fourth quarter had a LIFO provision of $24.9 million which compares to a provision of $32 million a year ago. The total LIFO provision in fiscal 2008 was roughly $98.5 million versus a provision of $69.3 million in the previous year. We expect the LIFO provision to become a much larger item in fiscal 2009 as inflation continues. We\u2019ll work to offset that to the extent possible through our pricing strategy but we believe that LIFO could be as much as twice our current rate in the upcoming year.", "One thing that we\u2019re very proud of this quarter was our ability to control costs. SG&A expense dollars increased 5.5% benefiting from the vacation accrual credit. Net of this adjustment SG&A expense dollars increased only 8% which is less than our 8.8% sales gain in the quarter. SG&A benefited from excellent payroll control. Our store operations people from coast to coast did a terrific job of controlling expenses. ", "Looking at costs on a two year stack basis you will see that the fourth quarter SG&A dollar costs were 23.3% of sales or an improvement of more than four percentage points since the first quarter of fiscal \u201908. That\u2019s excluding the benefit from this quarter\u2019s vacation accrual adjustment. Comparing our fourth quarter SG&A costs over the last three fiscal years you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve reduced the growth rate by five percentage points.", "Turning to gross profit, total gross profit dollars in the quarter were just over $4 billion a 7.4% increase reflecting the slow growth rate in prescription sales and as mentioned the heavier promotional activity on the front end. Gross profit margins decreased 34 basis points to 27.64. Retail pharmacy margins increased due to a greater use of generics but total pharmacy margins were impacted negatively from the higher growth rate of specialty pharmacy which has a high dollar ring but a lower margin as a percent of sales.", "Front end margins were essentially flat and helping the front end was a shift toward high margin items such as our private label brand products but hurting front end margins were heavier than normal promotions as I just mentioned.", "Now let\u2019s look at our tax rates, our working capital and our CapEx. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 37% compared to a rate of 35% in the year ago period when we had some favorable adjustments. Accounts receivable were up 13% in the quarter driven primarily by third party sales and slower Medicaid payments by states such as California and Illinois. We showed continued progress and focus on inventories in the fourth quarter which were up only 6.8% or less than our 8.8% sales gain. Accounts payable increased 14.9% and this was primarily due to the timing a few major payments.", "Our net debt at the end of the fiscal year was $977 million compared to a net debt of $651 million a year ago. Our net debt included $82.7 million of short term debt, $1.34 billion of long term debt and this was offset by cash and cash equivalences of $443 million at the end of the year. You\u2019ll recall that in July we restructured our debt portfolio when we issued $1.3 billion in five year senior notes at 4.875%.", "With our strong financial footing we have the flexibility to ensure that drive our core strategies and evaluate opportunities as they may arise. We will continue to be disciplined, however, with our capital allocations, our focus on working capital and our continued sharp cost control. Capital expenditures including new stores, distribution centers and IT development reached $2.2 billion in 2008. Since our last conference call we announced a slow down in our drug store organic growth rate. That will lead to lower capital expenditures going forward.", "We expect to reduce organic net drug store growth rate from the current 9% growth to a long term rate of approximately 5%. Let me give you a year by year schedule for how we\u2019ll take that down. We\u2019ll open 495 net new stores in fiscal 2009, 425 in fiscal 2010 and 355 in 2011. As Jeff said, that still makes us one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing retailers.", "Many of you have asked why we decided to slow our growth rate at this time. I want to reiterate that our focused ROIC from new stores continues to be as robust as it was in the past but there are good reasons why we decided to moderate our growth. First and foremost it allows us more time to develop our management ranks and focus on improving the shopper experience. Improving the shopper experience to drive fierce loyalty with our shoppers and ultimately a larger basket size is one of the single biggest levers of value creation that we have and we are going to free up resources to do this.", "Secondly, we want the flexibility to continue to invest across our core strategies and be opportunistic if appropriate especially in this time of a very uncertain and very challenging economy. Lastly, for the reasons I outlined above and as a result of the increased earnings power over time we believe it will also help us increase our shareholder value.", "Now I would like to close my section with some thoughts related to the overall economic situation. It is our long standing policy not to give guidance but I do believe that it\u2019s important that we continue to provide perspective to our stakeholders on the overall market dynamics and related factors that impact our business. ", "While we continue to grow our business and out comp the industry in both the pharmacy and the front end and while we firmly believe our strategies are absolutely the right ones to drive our business and shareholder value the market fundamentals pose significant challenges in these uncertain times. As we have talked before IMS status shows the slowest script growth rate in many decades and we continue to see our front end consumers under significant economic pressure from higher inflation and a growing unemployment trend.", "While historically our business has been more recession resistant than most there is no question that at least as we move forward there will be some challenging times for retailers especially to the extent that the macro economic variables such as inflation and unemployment continue to move negatively. Having said that I am absolutely convinced that we have the right strategies which are the enablers to win in even the toughest markets which we have historically done. ", "We will look to turn market challenges into opportunities so we will come out of this difficult economy an even stronger company than when we went into it. We\u2019ll talk more to you about all the things we\u2019re doing in this regard at our analyst day conference next month. With that I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our President, Greg Wasson for an update on implementing our strategies.", "Greg Wasson", "First I want to thank all of our employees across the company for their sales and cost control efforts this quarter. As Wade said, we are operating in a very tough economy but we\u2019re taking care of our customers and doing everything we can to meet their needs. As I travel across the country I\u2019m overwhelmed by the support of our people. I believe they are the best in the business. I also want to commend our employee efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike; they were there to serve their communities and to help people when they needed us the most.", "Within five days of the storm we had over 200 of our 235 stores open in Southeast Texas taking care of customers and pharmacy patients. We were also one of the first retailers to reopen in Galveston to help out residents who didn\u2019t evacuate. Having spent the early part of my Walgreen career in Houston I\u2019m not surprised by the response and efforts of our folks to overcome a disaster like this.", "Now I\u2019ll spend a few minutes talking about the progress we\u2019ve made on each plank of our strategy to grow earnings and create shareholder value. Our first plank is broadening access to our products and services for organic expansion and acquisitions. We\u2019re building an impressive network of healthcare access that combines our mail, retail pharmacies our in store health clinics, our worksite health centers with our specialty pharmacy facilities, our home care centers and our long term care facilities.", "Let me be clear on this point we intend to be the most complete and convenient provider of pharmacy and healthcare services in the nation. Today we offer most or all these services in markets across the country. The next step is tying them together into a single unmatched offering to meet the needs of employer groups and managed care organizations. Payers are looking for accessible low cost convenient healthcare during times of soaring medical costs. Simply put, we\u2019re helping Americans meet basic healthcare needs with an affordable solution.", "Our second plank involves reinventing the customer and patient experience. We\u2019re in the early stages of a process intended to create a very convenient shopping experience in our stores. With the customer centric mindset we\u2019re working across the company to offer an efficient assortment of products, price points and promotions. We\u2019re really looking forward to our new CMO, Kim Feil to help us identify and meet the needs of our shoppers.", "One early example which is available in our stores today is the Walgreen Prescription Savings Club. This club is making medications more affordable for more than 45 million uninsured Americans. We\u2019re proving the power of this program and our brand over the last two months as we kicked off an aggressive marketing campaign. As a result our membership has soared over the one million mark. In this economy people aren\u2019t just looking for low cost alternatives, they\u2019re searching for the best overall value. That\u2019s where our brand reputation comes into play.", "We\u2019re offering patients a way to stretch their dollars without sacrificing safety, service, or convenience. Furthermore the Prescription Savings Club goes well beyond the discount generic programs at other retailers. We offer savings on more than 5,000 name brand and generic medications plus you can get any of more than 400 generic medications for less than a dollar a week. To top it off club members receive a 10% reward on all Walgreen\u2019s branded products that can be used on future Walgreen purchases. We\u2019re very excited about the early success of this program.", "Our third strategic plank expands the pharmacy related healthcare services that we offer. One part of this effort is our new Health and Wellness Division announced last spring. Today we are the largest provider of worksite health centers in the country through our Take Care Employer Solutions Group. The division also includes the Take Care Consumer Solutions Group which manages convenient care clinics at our select Walgreen Drug Stores.", "Between the two groups our Health and Wellness division manages nearly 600 health centers. Our goal is to have 800 retail clinics and Employer Wellness centers in operation by the end of fiscal \u201909. Another area where acquisitions have helped us build out healthcare offering is Specialty Pharmacy. We\u2019re experiencing strong growth in this business as we become the provider for more and more payers. Today we are the largest independent specialty provider in the country.", "Earlier this month we were named one of two specialty providers for Premera a health plan serving more than 1.7 million members in four Western states. One of the big factors in winning this business was our ability to integrate specialty pharmacy services with our retail pharmacies and with our infusion services through our home care branches. Specialty pharmacy is increasingly important to us because it\u2019s the fastest growing sector of pharmacy expanding at about 15% a year. The new products awaiting FDA approval in 2008, 80% are specialty drugs according to IMS Health.", "Fourth, finally our fourth plan supports the three I just discussed by developing the systems and capabilities necessary to carry them out. We\u2019re conducting an across the board review of our support and cost structure to place the right resources in the right spots. We want to ensure that our costs, culture, and capabilities support and enable our strategy. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jeff to wrap things up.", "Jeff Rein", "I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019re making. We\u2019re becoming a sharper, faster moving company that\u2019s more focused on customers. We\u2019re put the people and strategy in place for future growth. We\u2019re working hard to ensure we\u2019re successful in a tough economy. Over the long term the impact of the baby boom generation on healthcare is too strong for prescription sales to continue their current trend. That means demand for our retail healthcare offering will be strong for years to come.", "As an affordable and accessible provider of high quality healthcare we\u2019re positioned very well to take advantage of this long term opportunity. As Wade briefly mentioned we\u2019ll hold an analyst day conference on October 30th. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll provide financial analysts with details on our plans for Pharmacy operations, the front end customer experience and other new insights that we haven\u2019t offered before. ", "While you can listen online to the webcast of the presentation analysts who attend in person also will have a chance to meet our management team including the new members we\u2019ve added over the past year. As we close out another record year at Walgreen\u2019s I\u2019d like to thank all our supporters for backing us and we look forward to our prospects for successful fiscal 2009.", "Rick Hans", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "I want to ask about the promotional activity during the quarter which you called out more in your press release than your remarks. The press release essentially indicates you over invested, you did mention that but then it spoke to that you\u2019re going to ratchet back investments. One way to look at it is what would the quarter have looked like if the promotional activity you\u2019re going to ratchet back to had been in place during the entire quarter so that we can get a sense of how much over investment you think you might have put into the quarter.", "Jeff Rein", "What happened during the quarter is when I talk about over investment is we drove too many promotions to get folks into our stores. We want to be more targeted, we want to create value and we want to make sure from the customers point of view it\u2019s a value. What I was talking about particularly in the press release and even at the conference before was we made this investment but people did not buy the impulse items that we thought they would in the past.", "Typically when people come in they buy the coupon items, they buy the promotional items and then the market basket typically goes up in a good way, in terms of profitability because they\u2019re buying extra items. That did not really happen this time.", "Wade Miquelon", "You\u2019re probably looking in the range of $0.01 to $0.02 per share in terms of heavier promotional activity versus what would have seemed to get for it.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "On the million members that you have in the Prescription Savings Club what kind of multiple of that are in your plans and if you look at those million members do you have a way of figuring out through your files which ones are net new pick ups or return customers who might have gone elsewhere and which ones are just customers who are joining the club to create savings for themselves?", "Jeff Rein", "It\u2019s actually been a very popular card right now. Our goal is actually several million. We hadn\u2019t given out a specific goal yet but I can assure it\u2019s going to be several million. I know Greg has been intimately involved in that.", "Greg Wasson", "I do think there\u2019s tremendous up side. There are 40 million uninsured Americans out there so we\u2019ve got a long way to go now that we have a million. As far as new patients I think what we\u2019re really excited about is we just kicked off that marketing campaign on August 1, which was targeted to bring in new patients. We\u2019re seeing nearly 25% to 30% of the patients coming in since are new patients to Walgreen\u2019s and we think that will continue to grow.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "That\u2019s of the one million its 25% to 30% to make sure I understand that?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Of the rest that are just current customers does the economics of the plan including the membership fee and other things when you look at that, let\u2019s say the lifetime over a years worth of business with that customer is that net neutral or dilutive or accretive for that customer in terms of earnings for the stores.", "Greg Wasson", "Certainly a net positive. What we\u2019re seeing with even existing customers who choose to use our Prescription Savings cards one is obviously you\u2019ve got to consider the retention factor and two there\u2019s absolutely an increase in compliance with our prescription members. We think that\u2019s a good thing for healthcare.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America ", " ", "As it relates to the healthcare strategy that seems to be a bit more dependent on acquisitions are you finding there are enough attractively priced platforms big enough to make a difference in the consolidated company\u2019s numbers or do you just still anticipate a lot of smaller deals over the next couple of years?", "Jeff Rein", "There are more opportunities. As you know healthcare is evolving very, very quickly right now. It is consolidating a bit so there are more opportunities. We typically don\u2019t comment on current and future acquisitions but I can tell you by putting all of this together we are becoming the affordable low cost accessible provider whether it\u2019s the Take Care Clinics, the On site clinics at employers, the hospital clinics, the Walgreen Stores themselves, all ties together once again to bring folks easy into the system and save them money.", "There are more opportunities whether it\u2019s big or small that\u2019s debatable at this point of course but I can assure you it\u2019s all coming together and has been well received not only by the public but the payers and also the employees.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America ", "You were quite clear a couple years ago I think in the annual report where your areas of interest were, there\u2019s not change to those listed areas?", "Jeff Rein", "Let put it to you this way, we are always looking at acquisitions. We are always looking at healthcare and we are always looking at our business model to make sure that we are going down the correct path. Something might have been going on two years ago. As you know the whole world has just changed in the last couple weeks. We are certainly open, we\u2019re flexible, we\u2019re adaptable and that\u2019s one of the reasons actually we brought new people into the company like Wake, Sona, Kim, Stan Blaylock, Hal Rosenbluth just brings a different perspective and gives us different ideas. I would say that we\u2019re still marching forward.", "Wade Miquelon", "I would just say there\u2019s really no change in the standpoint that we continue to put it through the same filter which is number one we\u2019re only looking at things that are on strategy and that means it really has to link to our assets and our capabilities it has to be strong for the core of that. It\u2019s got to have a strong financial payout. Finally, we have to believe we\u2019re highly capable of executing with excellence. We\u2019ll continue to use that filter as we go forward.", "Jeff Rein", "You will definitely not see get us get off track in terms of acquisitions or how it relates to healthcare.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "About a month ago you talked about the consumer and they\u2019d really sort of gone into a shell mid July and beyond in terms of cherry picking. We have heard from other retailers things were a little bit tougher after Labor Day. What\u2019s the update on where your consumer sits and are they still as cautious, did they get more cautious or what?", "Jeff Rein", "In terms of the consumer they are still being very cautious, they are very promotionally oriented, and they\u2019re looking for value all the time. They\u2019re still buying products obviously. It\u2019s a good thing we are in a recession resistant type business. They still need their medication; they still need their toothpaste, toiletries and so on. ", "I think people are being cautious but actually for us that\u2019s not so bad because the products we sell, once again, they need them on a daily basis or that the small things in life like $5 toys or $10 gifts that make people happy. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom. For example, let\u2019s say Christmas sales, we expect to have a decent Christmas. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be spectacular but I think it\u2019s going to be decent. People are not going to give us on Christmas; they\u2019re not going to give up on Halloween. They still want to take care of themselves and their families, have some fun.", "Usually what happens for Walgreen\u2019s is a poor economy is actually better for us particularly around the seasonal events because people are trading down. Once again most of the products that we sell are not that expensive. It\u2019s about the same as I mentioned a couple three weeks ago but still I think we\u2019re in a very good position going forward.", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019re certainly seeing in this environment an up tick in private label sales which also helped us overcome some of the margin pressures and additional promotional pricing. So it\u2019s definitely an economy that\u2019s helping us with private label.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Have you guys rethought or will you rethink with your new marketing person the idea of a loyalty card and whether that can direct promotional dollars better or not.", "Jeff Rein", "That is one of the things under consideration. As you know Kim has a lot of experience in that area in that share came from IRI so she\u2019s not only a great marketing person but she\u2019s very, very analytical. We believe over the years our best loyalty card has actually been our SITES. We have class A SITES, we\u2019ve put a lot of money into being in the right location, the best location but a loyalty card may be in the cards. We\u2019ll certainly look at that when Kim comes in.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "In the quarter retail gross margin was up, pharmacy was up, front end was flat, so gross margin was up what would the retail EBIT margin have done. I\u2019m not sure what your retail SG&A dollars grew at. Would retail margin have been down for the quarter or not.", "Wade Miquelon", "I don\u2019t think we usually give that out. I think you can probably follow the math a bit across the lines but I think in general we don\u2019t give that out.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Going forward you think that it\u2019s highly likely we will see overall margins up and front end up because of your pull back in promotional spend?", "Jeff Rein", "It depends on the buy; also as you know we\u2019re being very careful on the inventory we\u2019re putting into the stores. As you know we grew inventory less than sales this time so if the sell through is pretty good then our margins will come out pretty good too, so it\u2019s a little bit of a wildcard. We\u2019re trying to be very, very careful on our promotion; we want to make sure they make sense. Keep in mind that when you\u2019re looking at our margins overall we are selling more specialty products and the margin was flat in the front end, it was up a little bit in the pharmacy, the retail stores. ", "The margin was squeezed by the specialty products that we are selling. As you know they do have a lower margin but high gross profit dollars.", "Wade Miquelon", "On the front end there is the balancing factor between promotional activity and in finding the sweet spot of good everyday pricing. In these challenging economic times we have to continue to make sure that we drive good loyal traffic through the front door. Again, I think we\u2019re going to fine tune our approach to it in terms of using just promotions per se but there\u2019s no question that we can\u2019t be uncompetitive either.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is this a new level of SG&A growth if you back out the vacation accrual 8% give or take is that sustainable?", "Jeff Rein", "We are committed to the cost discipline plan that makes sense to growing our company. We are very, very strict on this. There are opportunities not only at the store level but there are more opportunities at the corporate level. Believe me, going forward we are going to be very, very strong on this, very disciplined and make sure we do the right thing to grow our business.", "Wade Miquelon", "We\u2019re doing a lot of work to really understand a sustainable growth model both in best of times and more challenging and working backward from there to say how do we make all of our costs fit in that model, now do we stay agile and how do we make it something that\u2019s accretive consistently over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "As regards to the front end can you maybe discuss where you saw strength in various categories and also on the lines of private label can you update us in terms of your current penetration and what your goals are.", "Jeff Rein", "What was the first part of the question, I didn\u2019t hear that.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "Where you see strength in the front end from a category perspective.", "Jeff Rein", "In the health and beauty aids very, very strong particularly in the allergy department and also in food just been phenomenal. People are looking for a bargain. As you know we carry a wide selection of food. People can use it obviously on the way home or anytime during the day. We carry a full line of milk, refrigerated groceries, and canned goods and so on. This has been phenomenal. Once again on the drug side we\u2019re seeing a lot more people self medicate themselves. As you know doctor visits are down, they\u2019re not generating the prescriptions as much as in the past.", "However, people are still getting sick and they do go in and see the Take Care clinic nurse practitioner, they do come in and buy the drug wall themselves so we\u2019re seeing our drug sales be very, very strong on that respect.", "Wade Miquelon", "The other changing pattern we\u2019re seeing too is we\u2019re seeing a heavier shift towards private label as consumers are seeing good value. We\u2019re also seeing a shift in terms of overall traffic pattern we tend to see a bit of more frequent visits during the weekdays with slightly less on the weekends. I think this speaks to both consumers loading up on the weekend, maybe some of the larger stores but also seeing that we\u2019re a good value on the weekdays with respect to the cost of gas and cost of time.", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019ve seen about 100 basis point improvement year after year in private label and expect to see that continue to grow.", "Jeff Rein", "Private label has been phenomenal.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citigroup", "On the Specialty Pharmacy side you discussed there is a negative gross margin impact as a result can you talk about what percentage of your business Specialty Pharmacy represents right now? I don\u2019t know if you can give any additional color in terms of gross margin impact.", "Wade Miquelon", "Specialty Pharmacy is in the 6% to 7% range of the total business. Again, it\u2019s very high dollar range so it\u2019s very high gross profit dollar per se but again those margin in that business are much smaller as a percent of sales. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve given specific mix factor but you could probably do some back of envelope math and get a feel for it. The growth rates are very high in this area. That\u2019s providing the mix effect.", "Greg Wasson", "Keep in mind that specialty patients bring a lot of traditional prescriptions along with them. Definitely a good customer to have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I\u2019m sorry to harp on the gross margin question but I\u2019m not sure I quite understand it yet. If I look at your gross margin in the year over year increase or decrease and if we \u2018x\u2019 out LIFO, if you look at last quarter your FIFO gross margin was up six basis points and the pharmacy was up and the front end was down. This quarter your FIFO gross margin is down about 40 basis points and the pharmacy is up and the front end is flat. ", "The Specialty Pharmacy issue I think from a mix standpoint would have been there last quarter I\u2019m just not really sure what would have changed and does any of it have to do with the acquisition of CuraScript. I was hoping you would give us more color on that.", "Wade Miquelon", "If I fully understand your question, part of it on a year on year base is the acquisition of Option Care being folded in plus overall growth. That might be something that you\u2019re not picking up there because that was the subsitive mix effect.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Option Care was there last quarter or no?", "Wade Miquelon", "It was there last quarter but not year ago. I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re reconciling to. We had two weeks of Option Care in this quarter only versus 12 prior.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "From an acquisition standpoint I think historically you\u2019ve looked at organic growth as sort of a core competency and now it seems like acquisitions are becoming what you feel is more of your core competency in fact even bigger retail acquisitions. Can you help us understand what\u2019s changed over this time period?", "Jeff Rein", "I really wouldn\u2019t classify it as a change. Our whole strategy in terms of growth is to broaden access and connect all these points of care. We\u2019re still growing very strongly in an organic way. However, the industry, in terms of retail in particular is consolidating bit time. To have these broadening the access and having the points of care we want to make sure that we participate in this consolidation similar to what we did with Happy Harry\u2019s a couple years ago. If there\u2019s an opportunity we\u2019re open to it. ", "I think before we basically said we\u2019re just going to do organic growth only and that was that. As you know over the last couple years we\u2019ve said we\u2019re more open to these acquisitions that make sense from a strategic point of view. We\u2019re still going along the same path but once in a while there might be opportunities that it\u2019s obviously very good for us and good for the shareholders.", "Wade Miquelon", "Remember as said before, that our potentially single biggest value creation lever is to make our good stores out there even better. Being able to have the energy to take our core and do more from our core is really a great place for value accretion too.", "Jeff Rein", "An example of that may be the file buys Wade was talking about in terms of our core stores. These file buys in terms of either a small chains or independents going out of business it\u2019s a great, great opportunity for us. Once again, that\u2019s part of an acquisition but at the same time you\u2019re growing your core business.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The $76 million is that after tax or pre-tax?", "Wade Miquelon", "The $79 million is pre-tax.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "I\u2019m trying to understand \u201909 I took it as being somewhat cautious in \u201909. From a gross margin we had a pretty nice hurt from Specialty on gross margin is this something we should expect as we move forward into \u201909. On SG&A we did have a lot of one time items that flowed through \u201908 on a positive basis and when we look at \u201909 what should our expectations be for SG&A. Is it possible to have flat earnings next year, what are you guys really saying about next year. It seemed like you were being cautious, I\u2019m just trying to understand how cautious we should be as we look at this.", "Wade Miquelon", "On Specialty you\u2019re certainly going to see a little bit of dilution over time because the Specialty business is growing faster than the core. Remember that things like the acquisitions we\u2019ve done have made that disproportionate in the particular quarter. I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of effect there but I think from a gross profit dollar basis it\u2019s actually a very good thing and it\u2019s a good ROIC business and it\u2019s a good growth vehicle for us.", "On SG&A in terms of SG&A the key thing is what I mentioned earlier is that we are really looking at what our sales will be over time and working backwards to say what\u2019s the right SG&A structure. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of good work in the last few quarter to get some low hanging fruit but we\u2019ll continue to be very aggressive to make sure they\u2019re weeding out all of the costs that don\u2019t add value and having a model which is flexible and works in anything.", "In terms of flat earnings I don\u2019t want to go there. I think what I am foreshadowing is just that it\u2019s a very challenging economic environment. I don\u2019t think anybody here can predict with the events of the last few weeks where things like unemployment will go over the next quarter or two or three. I think we\u2019ll just have to keep watching it. Right now we\u2019ve done a very good job in this environment, we\u2019re out comping the industry front end and back end. We do have a good cost control; we are effectively keeping our margins in general in tact.", "I also think it\u2019s important for all of us in retail and across all sectors to make sure we keep a watchful eye on the consumer. I think the consumer is under quite a bit of pressure right now.", "Jeff Rein", "I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be able to come to our analyst day conference at the end of October where we\u2019re going to talk specifically about SG&A and programs and projects, initiatives that we have in place and going forward what we\u2019re going to do about that.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "Getting back Bob Willoughby and Ed was also talking about your acquisition strategy, just to clarify a couple things, is the PBM still just off the table or is that something you now think fits a little better. I wasn\u2019t clear with the answer there. As far as on the retail side Happy Harry\u2019s and the one that we don\u2019t want to talk about are very different as far as your market share in those areas are and is something changed in that aspect that you\u2019re more open to things with a lot more overlap?", "Jeff Rein", "In terms of the PBM we haven\u2019t changed our position on that. We think our transparent model has been well accepted in the marketplace and is the right path to go, the most profitable path to go. In terms of the retail acquisitions, if it makes strategic sense then we will go forward as long as it meets our hurdle rates and we\u2019re getting value to shareholders then it is something we\u2019ll go after.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "Can we talk a little bit about you mentioned shelf pricing and that you think you need to make some adjustment. Have you done any consumer research that gives you some sense of what consumers reception is about your shelf pricing?", "Jeff Rein", "We have done that and we do watch that all the time. We do competitive shops obviously; we have a consumer research department where we do look at what folks think about our pricing. What I was talking about earlier was the amount of promotional spend that we had to get people into the store particularly when we look at what we call rotos or the circulars that come out every Sunday in the Sunday papers. ", "In some cases we gave away more than we had to. It\u2019s always good of course to draw them into the store but then you have to be very careful of how you mark down products in the stores on a promotional basis. We just went a little bit overboard on that. Our shelf pricing, our everyday shelf pricing is good. We obviously look at the major competitors whether it\u2019s Target, Wal-Mart, CVS, and Rite-Aid and so on to make sure that we were right for that particular market.", "Greg Wasson", "We certainly want to understand to the fullest and that\u2019s why the values we\u2019re really look for Kim Feil to help bring us to really get out there and understand the consumer more and more what they see is value and what they don\u2019t. We certainly have a lot of focus in that area.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "I presume part of Kim\u2019s tasks will be to figure out if you are less hot, less aggressive on your promotions, what that\u2019s going to do with sales, is that part of her mission.", "Jeff Rein", "That is working all of us together whether its market planning and research, advertising, purchasing, it\u2019s an effort that gets together for everybody. Yes, we want to be very correct in what we\u2019re doing. One of the things that Kim will help us do also is to present one face of Walgreen\u2019s to the consumer to the customer. ", "Right now when folks come in sometimes it\u2019s difficult when you go online or you shop in the stores or you shop Walgreen Health Services we want to make sure that we are really working on that patient, that shopper experience that is very, very pleasing to them and as Wade mentioned earlier that creates that sense of fierce loyalty.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "I\u2019d like to go back to talk about expense growth. I understand that this is a moving process that you\u2019re working very hard on it. Wade was kind enough to talk about the two year which is how I look at it and you had a very, very easy comparison this past year especially in the fourth quarter. The comparisons start to get easier and if you do a two year it looks like you\u2019re running 11.5% dollar growth is that something that we should see as for the near term sustainable? Obviously you\u2019ve got an opportunity to do things in the future but I think that\u2019s a lot higher than the 8% that happened in the fourth quarter.", "Wade Miquelon", "The two year stack it\u2019s a good longer term metric but I think the key thing is when it comes to SG&A sometimes you\u2019re only as good as your last quarter because of all the things that go into it. I feel very good about the 8% number that we effectively hit. I think it\u2019s that we are making real progress in the short term. I think that we\u2019ve got other things that we\u2019re working aggressively. I think the trend there is very good and we\u2019ll continue to challenge all things and say do they add value or not. Are we best utilizing our resources? ", "We\u2019ve got to start with what we think our overall sales and gross profit are going and make sure that we engineer backwards to be efficient and accretive over the long haul.", "Jeff Rein", "The last two years if you look at fourth quarter \u201906 as shown on the slide we were at 28.3% growth for two years stacked now we\u2019re down to 23.3% excluding that vacation accrual. We are making progress and yes there is more to go. We absolutely believe there is more to go not only in the stores but in corporate and the way we do things.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "I\u2019ve got a question about the vacation accrual I\u2019m surprised nobody asked this. The most conservative way to look at it is to say that all of it is one time. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t clear from your commentary what timeframe that was multi-year, was that just this year so if we wanted to add it back to come up with a run rate how much of it should we add back?", "Wade Miquelon", "I would say effectively as you know it\u2019s a very large amount that why we called it out. It is a multi-year it goes over many, many years. It was not material in aggregate to this year nor any single year and that\u2019s why it was appropriate as part of this close to put it in this quarter. I think you could pretty much call the vast majority of it was one time in that regard as year end you\u2019re always going to have a lot of puts and calls so this was obviously a large unusual help item.", "We had several smaller hurt items that added up to a fairly large number too but I think for sake of transparency for the vast majority of this is all one time.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "My final question is back to Ed Kelly\u2019s question. If I understand what you\u2019re saying Option Care was not in the third quarter numbers and was only partially in the fourth quarter numbers for last year.", "Wade Miquelon", "Two weeks of last year in the fourth quarter.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "I would have expected that Specialty would have had a similar impact on the two quarters because there really wasn\u2019t that much difference and yet that isn\u2019t what happened. Is it because there was very big growth in Specialty in between fourth and third quarters?", "Jeff Rein", "Yes, we\u2019ve had very, very good success, once again being the largest independent provider and the services we provide, the quality we\u2019ll provide led by [Paul Mestropha] and company, they\u2019re doing a fabulous job and we are winning more business.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays", "I\u2019m very excited about you having an analyst meeting but next year could you maybe not do it the same day that CVS and Medco report earnings?", "Wade Miquelon", "We are deeply apologetic for that. We will delay our day and start it a little bit later and we\u2019re going to provide rooms, phones, lines for everyone so that they can dial in and do that early morning work as need be. We\u2019ll make sure we try to as best accommodate everyone so that you can serve all ends.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "On the Specialty side obviously the gross margins are less there. Is there still a positive contribution note on the EBIT lines from that business?", "Wade Miquelon", "Absolutely, from an ROIC point of view as well it\u2019s also despite the margin percent compression it\u2019s also one of the best businesses we can invest in.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "In the fourth quarter and year to year basis that business helped the EBIT line, it was accretive to the EBIT line year to year?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, that\u2019s right.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "You talked about the reserve being twice in 2009 if I heard you correctly were you speaking in dollars or percent of sales and is that something that would also help your comps at the same time. I\u2019m trying to get a sense for how much of a negative that might be inflation being higher in the coming year.", "Wade Miquelon", "Its dollars, it really depends in terms of your ability to get out front and price ahead of it. So it could be a hurt or it could be a help. If you think about it, it\u2019s sort of an accounting term so we don\u2019t necessarily want to be pricing to aggressively just to recoup that when maybe we should be looking at it from a FIFO basis. As a general rule of thumb I\u2019d say we\u2019ve historically been pretty good at offsetting it. Again, it\u2019s really a timing issue of how fast you can price in front of it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Neil Currie \u2013 UBS.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "One question about the real estate market where some of the problems we\u2019re seeing in the banks I know traditionally one of your biggest competitors for retail space has been the high street banks. Are you seeing any signs yet of that competition easing or maybe even some SITES being available.", "Jeff Rein", "That\u2019s a very good question; we have seen easing of the competition for good SITES. The banks started pulling back probably around six months ago approximately. You\u2019re right; they\u2019re actually one of our top competitors and really drove the costs up. They are pulling back big time and freeing us some SITES that we may not have ordinarily been able to obtain.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "The impact of that is it just more SITES available to look at or will those SITES that you\u2019re looking at become somewhat cheaper?", "Jeff Rein", "It is lower SITES; it\u2019s also more negotiating power on our end.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "No chance to take advantage of that and maybe rescind some of the slower growth that you\u2019re expecting?", "Jeff Rein", "We\u2019re doing what we can; I\u2019m not quite sure what you\u2019re saying there.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "You talked about cutting back the store expansion program might there be some opportunities to accelerate it a little bit?", "Jeff Rein", "Not at this point. We\u2019re pretty much committed for the next two years. We\u2019ll be down the 5% range for 2011. It does allow us though to make sure that we go after the very best of the best SITES. Once again, sometimes these banks pull away from an excellent location that we couldn\u2019t get otherwise and so obviously we\u2019ll put our priorities toward those areas that free up.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "I don\u2019t know if you saw the press release from Caterpillar to their employees where they are allowing employees to go to Wal-Mart to get tier one generics at zero co-pay whereas they have to pay $5 to go other drug stores. Do you have any comments on that and would you consider pulling out from that network?", "Jeff Rein", "Yes, we did actually see that press release. What it really gets into is what I talked about earlier in terms of transparency and the way our model is in evolving even more in the future. I know Greg has been involved in that\u2026", "Greg Wasson", "Obviously a pilot sounds like Wal-Mart but I think what it really shows I think Wal-Mart obviously is trying to go directly to employers and I think offer a solution for the employer. I think they\u2019re really going to cut out the middle man in the process. I believe they believe that the middle man traps costs as we do. As you know, we\u2019ve made two acquisitions in the employer wellness space. We\u2019re looking to get on campus with large employers, small employers across the country to do much the same thing to really provide value and help them lower their other healthcare costs correctly.", "I really think that it\u2019s really focused on the intermediary within the healthcare and pharmacy benefit management systems.", "Jeff Rein", "These trap costs as you know there\u2019s profit pulls, whenever there\u2019s a middle man there\u2019s a lot of profit. Wal-Mart is attacking that and rightly so and that\u2019s our philosophy also. We\u2019re aligned with them on this particular issue.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "We see the fact that you spent a bit more than you wanted to on promotional expense and people are cherry picking the promotions and maybe not spending on other things in the store. Would having a loyalty card help some of these issues because clearly you get information what the customer is spending and you can target that spending somewhat more effectively. In retrospect do you think this is something you should have considered before now?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think we have lots of vehicles for loyalty. Loyalty is a multi-dimensional thing. As Jeff alluded to great real estate and great service and a great environment is kind of job number one. Prescription Savings Club is another vehicle we have other ones as well. I\u2019m not saying a loyalty card is good or not good but I think for it to work there\u2019s really two key criteria and number one is how to you differentiate it so it\u2019s meaningful to people and provides real loyalty on things that they want versus just say price alone.", "Number two is you alluded to over time how do you really make sure that you mind the data in a way that is relevant to them. As Kim Feil comes in we\u2019ll continue to look at it say here are all the things we\u2019re doing whether it\u2019s Mega-Savers, our real estate platform, our PCS card are all those things right for loyalty or is there some other proposition? It\u2019s got to really go through that filter being differentiated, being meaningful and being able to be leveraged beyond the discount to make sense.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "I was thinking more from a practical point of view how can you get the data without having a loyalty card and analyze the effectiveness of your promotions and enable yourself to be less wasteful.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think the promotional effectiveness can be done. There are lots of tools to do that. I think it\u2019s the segmenting that we obviously have a lot of data on. A lot of our shoppers not as broad as maybe a broader loyalty card but I think the benefit there lie in being able to do better segmentation.", "Jeff Rein", "There are a lot of point of sale tools that are out there that we utilize in terms of market basket and things of that nature. Also in terms of this spend what I\u2019d like to mention is we did spend, in terms of marking down products that we didn\u2019t have to. As you know, the average customer comes into our store for 1.6 items, they usually leave with 3.2. Where we went a little too far in the fourth quarter is we marked down items in the store that we didn\u2019t necessarily have to once we already got them in. I think that\u2019s a differential there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to get Wade\u2019s views on share buy back and dividends. As you look at other companies have kind of slowed their unit growth model, McDonald\u2019s and others we have seen them increase share buy backs and increase dividends to focus more on return on invested capital. If you just talk about your approach on buy back and dividends. Also, the single A credit rating is kind of sack re-sack for some time for you and as you\u2019re continuing to put acquisitions out there I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re willing to let the single A credit rating go and does that change your approach to the sale lease back markets?", "Wade Miquelon", "We still remain committed as ever to keeping a very strong rating, really that\u2019s very important to us for lots of reasons, least not the credibility it gives us and the flexibility in the real estate market, the people that we work with. We\u2019re committed to that. In terms of share buy back we have done some in the past we\u2019ve frozen that program for a while. I\u2019m not saying that we would never re-look at it but I think we need to look at all of our different choices in terms of organic growth, some of the opportunistic stuff and I think we also want to monitor this economy as we go forward.", "I think that there are some good scenarios and some tough scenarios out there and I think we want to make sure that we have enough flexibility, enough liquidity and a rating that is very, very strong which serves the end. We\u2019ll put it through the filter then.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "It sounds like at this point acquisitions are still winning out over buy back and dividends is that fair to say?", "Wade Miquelon", "Only if they make good financial sense, good strategic sense and they\u2019re within our capabilities.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the credit rating I guess the reason I\u2019m asking that is I know you don\u2019t want to talk about the Longs transaction but that one seems to put you in a position where maybe the credit rating would come to question, any comment there?", "Wade Miquelon", "The agencies have obviously written that an acquisition would certainly put some downward pressure on their point of view. We would still be very highly rated I suppose at the end of the day. I don\u2019t know what more I can say versus that. Over the long term here we are very committed to keeping very strong credit ratings.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. ", "Rick Hans", "That\u2019s our final question. Thanks for joining us today. Remember we\u2019ll announce September sales this Thursday, October 2nd and we\u2019ll also be delighted to host you at our analyst day on October 30th.

Now at this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Hans, Divisional Vice President of Inventor Relations and Finance.", "Rick Hans", "Welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with Greg Wasson our President and Chief Operating Officer, discussing the quarter\u2019s highlights and the progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. Wade Miquelon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will provide details on the first quarter financial results before turning it back over to Greg.

In addition, I\u2019d like to introduce the newest member of our Investor Relations team, Lisa Mears; Lisa just joined us this month as manager of Investor Relations.", "We have allowed plenty of time for your questions on the call today but please limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can give an opportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time.

Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward looking statements. Now here\u2019s Greg Wasson.", "Greg Wasson", "", "Let me begin by thanking everyone who came to Chicago for our Analyst day in late October. We greatly appreciate your interest in Walgreens and enjoyed having the opportunity to meet you. We also appreciated the breadth of questions posed during the day and your comments and suggestions for our next analyst day. For any of you who missed our meeting the audio presentation and slides are archived on our website.", "Before discussing the financial results and strategic initiatives we put in place during the first quarter I would like to emphasize that the CEO search process has not slowed down the implementation of our strategic growth initiatives in any way. I can assure you we haven\u2019t missed a beat. We are progressing rapidly on the key initiatives which drive our three strategies. ", "As our Board, Chair and Acting CEO, Alan McNally outlined at the analyst day meeting, the Board determined that the search process would consider both internal and external candidates and take about three and a half to four plus months. At this point we would expect an announcement sometime in early 2009.", "To get started, today we announced that we are slowing our new store openings to 2.5% to 3% by fiscal 2011; this will reduce our CapEx by an additional $500 million. Both Wade and I will have more to say about this later. Net sales for the first quarter were a record $14.9 billion, up 6.6%. Comp sales rose 1.7%, net earnings were $408 million or $0.41 per share diluted compared to $456 million or $0.46 per share diluted a year ago. Our customer traffic strengthened as the quarter progressed, although basket ring was down as customers were buying essentials rather than discretionary items.", "Comparable prescription sales rose 2.6% in the quarter, the number of prescriptions filled in comp stores was virtually flat compared with a year ago but on an adjusted 90 versus 30 day basis we would have increased 150 basis points. For the quarter we filled 156 million prescriptions. Total retail prescriptions increased 3.7% over last years first quarter. That compares favorably to an industry wide decline of 0.5% as reported by IMS, excluding Walgreens.", "We\u2019ve talked previously about some of the factors affecting prescription sales despite these near term challenges we have seen benefits in December from a recent up tick in the flu and the later than usual Thanksgiving. We continue to gain prescription market share, we now fill 18% of all retail prescriptions in the country.", "We\u2019ve seen a big increase in a number of flu vaccines administered this season, delivering over 1.1 million shots which are more than twice what we did all last year. Special thanks to all the hard work of our pharmacists and nurse practitioners who are successfully building this business. As I said during the quarter we made great progress on the three growth strategies which you may remember are:", "Leveraging the best store network in America", "Enhancing the customer experience", "Major cost reduction and productivity gains", "I\u2019ll bring you up to date on our progress. As you can see on this slide over the last six months we have substantially reduced our plans for new store openings. In July we announced the reduction of the long term growth rate from 8% to just 5% in 2011. Today, we announced that we are reducing new store openings further to about 4% to 4.5% in fiscal 2010 and about 2.5% to 3% in fiscal 2011. This decision was made after evaluating the current economic conditions and concluding that we have substantial upside to drive greater value creation by enhancing the best community based store network in America.", "As a result, we believe that for the long term slowing in new store openings is an important strategic step. Because this is an increasingly dynamic process going forward we will be providing guidance regarding planned store opening data as a range rather than providing the exact number of openings as we\u2019ve done previously.", "Let me be clear, we will continue to open new stores on the best corners and end markets that deliver the highest return on invested capital. Our new Times Square store is a great example, we opened it in November and it has already become one of our top performers.", "In summary, moderating new store openings will one, support our customer centric retailing initiative, two, increase flexibility to invest opportunistically, three, save an additional $500 million over the next three years over and above the $500 million we previously announced, and four, drive greater value creation by strengthening the best community based store network in America.", "We continue to enhance the customer experience through new customer centric programs and improvements to store operations. These include efficient assortment, efficient promotion and refreshing our existing store base. We\u2019re also responding to the current consumer need for increased value by broadening our offering of what we call affordable essentials, basic staples such as food items, paper products and other consumables.", "We\u2019re positioning our stores to take advantage of the new consumer reality for retailers which means customers are making more purchases using cash and timing those purchases closely to the beginning or the middle of the month when they receive their employer or government checks.", "We\u2019re also meeting the needs of our cost conscious customers with money saving initiatives such as our Prescription Savings Club. This loyalty program serves the needs of the 46 million Americans who are uninsured as well as the millions who are under insured. We now have more than 1.4 million Prescription Savings Club members an increase of more than 400,000 in just three months and more than 30% of the PSC members are new Walgreen patients.", "As we\u2019ve said before, our private brand business is one of the strongest in retailing and continues to grow as consumers look for value. We\u2019ve also had tremendous momentum in our online business which reported a 45% increase in traffic to Walgreens.com during the month of November. Another component of consumer centric retailing is testing and evaluating new store formats. We are underway and as we make progress we will update you.", "Now let\u2019s talk about another major initiative which we are making good progress, POWER. POWER will transform community pharmacy as we know it today and it is currently being rolled out across Florida. As you may recall, POWER focuses on one, eliminating a significant amount of administrative tasks from the community pharmacy which will free up pharmacists to play a greater role as trusted clinicians, two reduce overall pharmacy costs, and three enable us to increase the breadth and dept of pharmacy services such as flu shots and vaccinations.", "In October we told you that POWER was in 152 Florida locations, today POWER is in 280 stores in Florida. The Orlando metropolitan market has been completed and we\u2019re well on our way to completing South Florida. By the end of the fiscal year we will have implemented POWER in all Florida stores, that\u2019s more than 760 locations and more than 10% of our total drugstores. We\u2019ve begun providing centralized fill in services 30 stores in Arizona from our Tempe mail service facility as you can see we are well on our way.", "We continue to leverage and enhance the core business through our growing pharmacy and health and wellness services and locations. We opened four new worksites and 76 new retail clinics in the quarter giving us a total of 661 retail and worksite clinics nationwide. We expect to be operating in about 800 locations by the end of the fiscal year.", "As Americans seek to control the cost of their healthcare services, our retail clinics provide cost effective, quality care that\u2019s extremely convenient to customers. In combination with our worksite clinics and health centers we help corporate clients control healthcare costs while encouraging healthy lifestyles for their employees.", "Interest continues to build; recently we opened locations for the 70,000 eligible employees and their families at the Disney properties in Orlando and a new health center in Las Vegas, serving 11,000 eligible members. We continue to expand our specialty pharmacy business which represents one of the fastest growing areas of healthcare today. On December 1, we completed the acquisition of a specialty pharmacy business from McKesson Corporation. The acquisition will further strengthen our position as the fourth largest specialty pharmacy in the country.", "I\u2019ll let Wade update you on the specifics of the quarter, the rewiring for growth initiatives and the financial impact to date of our new strategic initiatives.", "Wade Miquelon", "Given the context of a challenging economy our team worked hard in the quarter to deliver higher sales and control costs. As Greg said previously net sales increased 6.6% while total comparable sales were up 1.7%. This compares favorably with many other retailers for the past quarter. Net earnings were $408 million a 10.4% decline from last year. ", "Prescription sales rose 6.2% and represent 66% of sales for the quarter. Prescription sales in comparable stores rose 2.6%. The number of prescriptions filled in comparable stores was virtually flat although, as Greg pointed out, prescriptions were up 1.5% when adjusting for more patients filling 90 day scripts versus 30 day prescriptions.", "During the quarter we had approximately $0.045 per diluted share cost impact from a variety of items which includes first, an incremental $0.01 charge for LIFO reserve versus a year ago, second, a $0.01 cost, one time charge for rewiring for growth, third, $0.01 of interest expense above the year prior, lastly about $0.015 of year on year incremental investment for our retail clinic expansion.", "Gross profit in the quarter was $4.2 billion a 5.9% increase reflecting a challenging business environment. Gross margin was down 20 basis points in the quarter compared with the prior year. The overall margin was negatively impacted by lower margins of a non-retail businesses and a higher LIFO provision. This was partially offset by a higher retail margin as a result of the impact of generic drug sales. Front end margins were essentially flat year over year.", "SG&A expense increased 9.1% in the first quarter compared with an increase of 10% last year. While our base cost control was very robust this level of SG&A growth above sales growth can be attributed to three causes. First, we opened a record number, 212 new stores in the quarter and that is a very large driver of SG&A. Second, as I mentioned earlier we continue investing in our retail healthcare clinics. Finally, we incurred some one time costs associated with rewiring for growth and these are essentially all in SG&A.", "We have made significant progress in controlling the growth of SG&A in recent quarters. As you can see from this chart SG&A dollar growth in the quarter on a two year stacked basis has steadily declined from 28% to 19.1% despite very aggressive store openings. The same three issues I highlighted a moment ago and on the previous slide as negatively impacting our business near term will actually begin to benefit SG&A in the future.", "For example, slowing new store openings will allow for significant slowing of SG&A. We are likely to have our highest loss quarter and highest loss fiscal for retail clinics this year and we will receive significant ongoing cost benefits from rewire for growth beginning the end of this fiscal and on into 2011.", "Now let\u2019s look at a few other financial drivers in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% compared to a rate of 37.4% in the year ago period. Net interest expense was $15 million compared to zero last year due to the issuance of $1.3 billion in long term debt. The LIFO provision was $43 million versus $27 million in the first quarter of 2008. ", "In the quarter, we invested $638 million on additions to plant, property and equipment versus $490 million last year due largely to the addition of 212 new stores versus 166 last year. In fiscal 2009 we plan on opening a total of 540 new stores, yielding 475 net new stores yet our capital spending has been a bit front end loaded this year and we continue to estimate that capital spending for the full year will come in at around $1.8 billion.", "Accounts receivable were up 23.6% in the quarter and this was driven primarily by reimbursement timing, non-retail sales mix which has a higher normalized DSO and also the end of the quarter falling on a Sunday. Inventories grew by 9.9% driven primarily by record new store sales growth, slower comps and the effect of seasonal goods.", "Accounts payable increased 22.4% due primarily to timing of disbursement give the Sunday quarter end and the increase of inventories. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $1.5 billion reflecting short term borrowings of $1.1 billion, long term debt of $1.3 billion and offsets by cash and cash equivalents of $886 billion.", "As we discussed at analyst day, we are targeting $1 billion in annual cost reductions by fiscal 2011. Three primarily areas of opportunity include strategic sourcing of indirect spend, corporate overhead and store labor reductions, and POWER, which also includes workload balancing. We are making significant progress in all three areas.", "This next chart shows a schedule of timing of costs and benefits associated with rewire for growth. As you can see, during 2009 and 2010 we will incur one time costs of $300 to $400 million to achieve our long term objective of $1 billion of net cost reductions by fiscal 2011. We also expect to achieve working capital benefits of an additional $500 million through our customer centric retailing initiatives.", "In short, we are confident that our three strategies will enable Walgreens to get back to a path of strong EPS growth performance. The last thing I\u2019d like to focus on before I close, our exceptional balance sheet and strong cash flows are enabling and will enable significant financial flexibility as we move forward. Our Commercial Paper ratings of A1P1 and our long term debt ratings of A+A2 give us the ability to drive our strategies and do right things right at a time when many other corporations are struggling with liquidity. ", "We\u2019re proud of our credit ratings and we are committed to maintaining our high investment grade position grade position. Further, our decision to slow the pace of store openings to strengthen and enhance our core and to reduce unnecessary costs will only further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure that we have ample financial flexibility for a very strong future.", "Now I want to turn the call back over to Greg Wasson.", "Greg Wasson", "I\u2019ll finish with saying how extremely proud I am of the superb leadership team that we continue to build at Walgreens. To that end, today we\u2019re announcing the addition of three new Vice Presidents who are experienced leaders with track records of growth and success in their respective industries. Their contributions will strength our Walgreen management team and give us an even stronger blend of external talent and internal expertise.", "Bryan Pugh, most recently with Tesco\u2019s Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Markets joins us as Vice President responsible for the development of new store formats. He\u2019ll be focusing on affordable and essential merchandise. He helped design the fresh and easy store operations model and launched the retail grocery chain on the West coast as it grew to 90 locations in less than a year.", "Colin Watts, formerly with Campbell Soup Company and McNeil Consumer Healthcare Worldwide becomes President of Walgreens Health and Wellness Disease Management. Colin brings significant healthcare industry expertise to Walgreens and has a proven track record of growing consumer and healthcare companies in the US and globally.", "Jeffrey Zavada, formerly National Vice President Key accounts for United Healthcare, joins Walgreens as Vice President and Chief Sales Officer. We look forward to his expertise in helping Walgreens build a world class sales organization in order to continue to broaden and deepen our payer relationships.", "In summary, Walgreens has a winning strategy, an exceptional leadership team and a strong focus on execution to grow our business and create long term significant value for shareholders. I\u2019ve never been more confident about our future.", "Rick Hans", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re now ready for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Lisa Gill \u2013 JP Morgan", "Lisa Gill \u2013 JP Morgan", "Is there any way you can break out for us the SG&A as it pertains today to the new stores so that we can get an understanding of what your run rate looks like as we start to think about the slowing down of the stores and we start thinking about modeling for that? Secondly, I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re seeing, where you\u2019re taking customers from your RX savings club plan? As we start thinking about things like electronic prescribing, etc. how will that also impact some of the programs that you have in place around your generic programs?", "Wade Miquelon", "On SG&A either way I would frame it if you look at our same store SG&A year on year and the direct costs, hourly labor, etc. effectively that\u2019s kind of been 0% to 1% range or actually below our rate of comp sales. The balance of it isn\u2019t all new real estate, there is obviously other items in there some of which I mentioned like rewire investment. That gives you a general feel for the relative level of SG&A that we put into new stores and the fact that on a base level we have a pretty good sustainable model now in cost control.", "On the PSC or RX card I\u2019ll start there, I would say I think we are seeing a lot of traction and from a financial point of view I think it\u2019s a good thing because there is a fair amount of turn over, churn normally in prescriptions and really this is capturing a lot of that so net, net, net its financial accretive and also a great driver of loyalty.", "Lisa Gill \u2013 JP Morgan", "Where are you taking those customers from, are they coming from the other retailers, are they coming from the supermarkets, from Wal-Mart, where do you think you\u2019re taking them from today.", "Greg Wasson", "We don\u2019t know truly where we\u2019re taking them from. The opportunity of 46 million uninsured folks that didn\u2019t have cash and maybe some folks that weren\u2019t really taking medication or seeking compliance medication. The two biggies that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing 30% of the patients that are on the PSC card are new adds and we\u2019re also seeing increased compliance once their on. I think the opportunity is huge for the 46 million out there that are uninsured.", "Wade Miquelon", "We can\u2019t prove exactly where the share is coming from but we do know is we track, for instance, the $4 scripts, the generics that fall into that bucket that we have actually gained share in that now year on year after a year ago being tougher. I think it is a lot of the cash customers and again I think that\u2019s the validation that it\u2019s hitting those particular scripts.", "Greg Wasson", "To your e-scribe comment I think two things; we\u2019re certainly seeing increased compliance of prescriptions. We see more people picking prescriptions up that are on e-scribe once the doctor has written the order and I think you\u2019re certainly seeing increased formulary compliance which will increase generic utilization as well because the doctor will be able to see the formulary much easier.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "I was looking for more color on the gross margins, how were pharmacy margins up and then when you give the breakdown is the higher LIFO charge netted in those qualitative descriptions on pharmacy and front end? In the non-retail margin decline how much was that and what was the decline in the recurring businesses, ex. the growth in clinics?", "Wade Miquelon", "I don\u2019t know if we can give all the specific detail but effectively pharmacy margins were up slightly front end were close to flat year on year and yes LIFO for both is embedded in both. As you\u2019ll recall we have about $200 million for the year in LIFO or an increase of roughly $100 million planned. In terms of specialty, specialty does have lower margins and that has grown faster than the business so they\u2019re not declining versus where they were its simply just a mix effect of faster growing versus slower growing. ", "In the retail clinics that I called out is about a $0.015 year on year drain to overall profitability and that also has a disproportionately low gross profit just because the nature of work costs were allocated for that business. I hope that gives you directional feel but essentially front end and back end were basically stable to up slightly. All other factors bring it down back to neutral and the other businesses pulling down as I said.", "Greg Wasson", "I\u2019m sure, just as a reminder, specialty margins may be tighter but the gross profit dollars, as you know for script are huge.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "Can you give us any qualitative comments on December thus far in the holiday selling season? If you could elaborate on your comment about inventory, I think you said the higher increase was reflective of some effect of seasonal goods, in what type of markdown risk might we be looking at in this environment?", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019ll certainly be giving more information on December sales the first of January. Certainly, as you know, we lost a week of holiday sales in the quarter. We\u2019re certainly continuing to see a concerned consumer. However, the thing I\u2019m really glad of is that we\u2019re selling things that people need. As more people are leaning toward affordable essentials and staying closer to home I think we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019ll give you more color in January.", "Wade Miquelon", "On the inventory we did see a little bit of a bump just because of a few things. Number one, we always see both this time of year seasonally but also over the last few quarters we\u2019ve had slightly lower comps so a lot of these items are bought well in advance. As we sit here today we\u2019re working through that inventory level. I don\u2019t see anything above and beyond what we normally do in terms of write downs here. ", "Again, as we talked at the analyst day related to rewire for growth in terms of total efficient assortment they\u2019re making some charges but that would be well covered within what we\u2019ve outlined before related to that project. It\u2019s a bit seasonal, it\u2019s a bit adjusting to the new realities of the economy but we\u2019re working through that and working that out. I don\u2019t see that as an issue.", "Greg Wasson", "The two big drivers of inventory were the Thanksgiving shift in our new stores. The encouraging thing is that front end margins were flat and traffic was up so I think we\u2019ve really been surgically using promotions to drive inventory movement when needed.", "Mark Miller \u2013 William Blair", "I was surprised your front end margins were up so that looked good.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "The change which is material in the store growth today versus 90 days ago I know strategically 90 days ago you made the decision that you made and now you\u2019ve taken another step down. Is there something that you\u2019ve observed in results or analysis that you\u2019ve done other than just seeing the economy as soft to make the decision to further reduce the store growth as much as you have?", "Wade Miquelon", "Perhaps the biggest material change is just the economy continues to shift and change. It becomes more uncertain all the time. I think that\u2019s probably part of the factor. Related to that, I think that there will be opportunities for more file buys and we may see more consolidation in the industry and I think it behooves us to make sure we have financial flexibility to do that. ", "Lastly, I think we do believe that our strategies especially around the customer centric work at getting more from the core making stores better is the single biggest value creation lever we can pull. Everything we can do on that is worth that if its going to pay dividends.", "Greg Wasson", "As we get further along the lines of our consumer centric retailing initiative, to Wade\u2019s point, I think we\u2019re seeing more and more opportunities to use the existing 6,500 stores that we have with more efficient assortments, adjacencies, refreshes, re-paintings, remodeling. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re really excited.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Is 9% SG&A growth which is what it was in the first quarter, is that about as low as it can go considering the store growth investment that\u2019s embedded in the business at least for this year or can you do better than that?", "Wade Miquelon", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as low as it can go but I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty darn good if you look again the huge driver of the new stores. If you look at it just on a no new store basis it\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019d say the structural systemic things that we\u2019re doing in rewire to get that $1 billion going over the next three years are going to provide further step downs if you will. It\u2019s as good as it can be without the structural interventions that we\u2019re putting in place but those interventions will be significant.", "Greg Wasson", "I think the SG&A control we\u2019re seeing in the core business, of course drugstores has been pretty robust. As we see a couple of these major initiatives come on we\u2019ll see benefit.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "On page 20 you have a chart that talks about returning to double digit earnings growth and the arrow seems to point up as we look at 2009, do you want to give some guidance on how we should think about 2009 earnings from the company?", "Wade Miquelon", "Here\u2019s how I frame it, if we look at the last quarter and this quarter, recall last quarter I think we were up 10%, 11% but we had an accrual adjustment in there so effectively apples to apples we were kind of flat year on year. This quarter, with our 1.7% or 2% comp we had some other negative things that went the other way. Effectively we were again flat year on year. In this 1%, 2% comp range that\u2019s where we are before interventions.", "I think the kinds of things that are going to help us moving to the back end of the year and into the future will be again the customer centricity, big opportunities there, rewiring a big step up there, slowing of stores is definitely going to help over time but its going to take some time to get that benefit. The other wildcard out there is the overall economy which is challenging for everyone now. I do think that given that we\u2019re more destination in nature, more essentials and given that we\u2019re probably going to see some industry consolidation over time that will probably be in that as we go along.", "Without giving guidance for the year I just want to give perspective on really where were the last quarters have netted down and ensuing that the out periods what kind of things we\u2019re doing to bring that up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nathan Reich \u2013 Citigroup", "Nathan Reich \u2013 Citigroup", "My question is around the rewiring for growth initiative how does slower square footage growth change the cost savings that can be achieved with the rewire for growth if it does at all?", "Wade Miquelon", "It really doesn\u2019t at all. The things we\u2019re looking at are not really, obviously we\u2019ll get one benefit over time from slowing store growth just because there\u2019s so much front loaded costs to bring new stores on and we\u2019re diverting attention from making the core even stronger. With respect to how we factored in the savings and what we\u2019re looking at that\u2019s not really part of the equation.", "Nathan Reich \u2013 Citigroup", "If you could give a little more color on what front end categories are performing the best?", "Greg Wasson", "As we said, we\u2019re seeing strong increases in consumables, affordable essentials we\u2019re talking about groceries, snacks, paper products, basic needs that people are looking for. The discretionary categories are tight, the non-discretionary are up. We\u2019re also seeing good increases in over the counter items and our private label brand as people trade down and look for value we\u2019re seeing good increases.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "Is there any sign yet with unemployment rising that there is some further impact on consumer behavior in terms of pill splitting and script volumes in general. Secondly, as a corollary to that are you seeing any incremental pressure in reimbursement from companies whose budgets are under pressure?", "Greg Wasson", "As far as impact on scripts with unemployment it\u2019s hard to say. Certainly we\u2019ve all heard where folks are busy doctors less and picking up less prescriptions and that may be affecting the industry number. The good thing is we\u2019re seeing strong increases for prescription sales the numbers are up. We saw strong increases in the amount of flu shots we administered; our PSC card is showing strength so we\u2019re pretty encouraged with the trends we\u2019re seeing in pharmacy right now.", "Wade Miquelon", "We\u2019ve seen a bottoming or strengthening on the prescription side so there\u2019s really no short term evidence of worsening. Where we\u2019re seeing different behavior patterns is really more on the front end. Again, it\u2019s more towards discretionary items as Greg talked about. It\u2019s more towards private label, more towards paycheck time, more towards weekday buys versus weekend buys. You\u2019re really seeing the effects of the economy there much more than you\u2019re seeing it right now in the prescription side.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "If you look at WHS as a whole and think about its P&L impact could you just discuss that a little bit. Obviously it sounded like it was a little bit of an impact on margin maybe even on expenses. Do you think WHS was dilutive to the growth rate for the quarter or additive, what would the impact have been more from a bottom line standpoint?", "Wade Miquelon", "WHS wasn\u2019t dilutive from an earnings point of view because of the specialty businesses have lower gross margins and because they were growing faster than the balance it hits the gross margin impact a little bit on OCS. It was really the hit that I talked about at one point $0.06 it was on the health and wellness division side that was plan but that\u2019s really from the ramping up. We\u2019re going to start leveling that off and then we\u2019ll start cycling this. ", "This is really our biggest investment here that we see on the clinic side I\u2019ll just leverage on that too is that they\u2019re still on track in terms of that 2 to 3 year ramp up to profitability. Because it\u2019s negative doesn\u2019t mean that we have any less confidence that these things over time make sense.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "WHS in total you put everything together operating income, up or down versus year ago it sounds like you might have been down.", "Wade Miquelon", "No, I didn\u2019t say that.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "It did not detract from the EBIT growth rate of the whole company?", "Wade Miquelon", "The health and wellness division had a $0.015 but WHS did not.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Back to your decision to cut the growth again, I certainly applaud the decision although you don\u2019t currently have a new CEO in place as of yet I was just wondering it does sound like you\u2019re very close. With a new CEO on board with all this I would imagine that\u2019s yes. Secondly, I think the fear from investors will be that you are moving pretty quickly to do this. I think their fear is going to be that it\u2019s driven by deteriorating fundamentals as opposed to other opportunities. Could you address that?", "Greg Wasson", "As Wade said, we\u2019re certainly looking at the economy and making a prudent decision to where we\u2019re headed and how we want to use our capital going forward. I think that\u2019s a big part of it. More importantly, as I said it\u2019s certainly very strategic as we see it. I think that we\u2019ve got 6,500 of the best locations out there to date. We talked a lot about leveraging and enhancing that core business and core drugstores. As I said, with what we\u2019re seeing with our customer centric retailing there\u2019s just incredible opportunity to really choose and bring those stores on as we go forward.", "I wouldn\u2019t read much more into it than the fact that it makes sense in this economy and the fact that we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity.", "Wade Miquelon", "There is not deteriorating in the fundamentals. It\u2019s just a matter of being smart about our capital allocations choices and the value we can create by putting more into some of these levers refreshing stores and from the experience potentially more file buys or whatever may come is greater than the value of opening stores at the prior rate. That will be our beacon as we go forward.", "Greg Wasson", "It\u2019s what you lose to our balance sheet.

We\u2019re not doing silly things but we\u2019re making sure we are competitive in that regard in providing value. I\u2019d say it\u2019s difficult to fully predict.

We\u2019re watching items; we\u2019re watching them daily making necessary adjustments where possible.

We\u2019re looking at unsigned deals, deal by deal. Some of those may be further out, a little less difficult. Some of those are a little closer in to maybe some costs to it.", "Wade Miquelon", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at anything significant if there is any it will be certainly covered by our overall rewire effort. I\u2019d also say that we have pretty intensive process we continue to look at all our stores and make sure they\u2019re performing and they make sense. I could sit here and tell you that there\u2019s the number of stores that we maybe should shut down because they\u2019re not productive they won\u2019t be less than a handful so there\u2019s nothing material there either.

We\u2019re definitely going to use it to drive our strategies. As we said earlier there\u2019s a lot of opportunity that we\u2019re learning through customer centric retailing that we can put back into our stores there so that would probably be a top priority.

I think with the economy and the challenge and struggles a lot of the independent and small chains are having today it\u2019s probably a little more opportunity over the last couple years.

There was a time a few years ago where workload balancing was really highlighted as being an opportunity and I mean using stores and excess capacity at existing stores and then the shift to a more central fulfillment is kind of change. Could you talk about it, I don\u2019t really understand why you went in that direction?", "Greg Wasson", "With workload balance as described a couple years ago we have seen benefit and that really helped us move work between stores and really help existing stores continue to grow volume. If you have a store out there that may be averaging 300, 350 a day and a store down the road is going to help them you see that it increased lift. I think what we\u2019re beginning to see now with POWER is a huge opportunity to leverage the entire enterprise our mail service operations as well as our central processing utilities to work around.", "We see the opportunity to fill as many as 30% to maybe 40% of our chronic prescription centrally but a big part of POWER is not just a central fulfilling of prescriptions its shifting the order entry work and the insurance processing to a more efficient platform to become more efficient and allow the store pharmacist to spend more time with patients.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think of it as they\u2019re not at all different directions, in fact, they\u2019re evolutionary and complimentary because the workload balancing is the first step of being able to do that virtual paperwork, we\u2019ll call it and central fill goes beyond that to be able to the physical work as well. As Greg said, it\u2019s not just about the cost it\u2019s about freeing up those resources. Dynamic workload balancing will always play a role as it did in some of the hurricanes being able to on the spot shift the paperwork and be fluid there is also a nice tool in the arsenal to help reduce costs.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The difference is you\u2019ve said that you have a lot of immature stores and that fixed cost is already in place at those stores to build the capacity you need in POWER you actually have to add more capital and essentially more fixed costs. I guess I\u2019m still a little confused why not lever what you already have is there a regulatory constraint?", "Wade Miquelon", "From a paper flow point of view that\u2019s true, we can leverage that in place but over time that\u2019s not going to be the best systemic solution. We\u2019re going to have to have a central scale; you\u2019re going to get in a central facility visa vie the paperwork or the physical flow by leveraging that network. We are taking advantage of those new stores in that way. That\u2019s more of an evolutionary short term fix versus and end game where you have true scale.", "Greg Wasson", "I wouldn\u2019t look at it as its one or the other, we\u2019re leveraging both. Workload balancing is allowing us to continue to leverage those new stores now as we speak. POWER allows us to really move a lot of work into a more efficient manner on top of that.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Back to a discussion about the front end and seasonal merchandise, is it your expectation, did you go into the holiday with very low level of inventories or do you believe that you\u2019ll end up having markdowns that might be noticeable in the front end gross margin?", "Greg Wasson", "We did go in with less inventory than last year. We did anticipate tougher economy. Going into next year we\u2019ll probably even be looking even further reductions as we buy for holidays and seasons. Right now I think we feel pretty good. As I said, we\u2019re watching inventory daily, making adjustments, moving merchandise around from store to store, market to market. As we move toward the end of the season we\u2019ll see more. I think we\u2019re managing it pretty effectively at this point in time.", "Wade Miquelon", "The wildcard still is the recent weather, snow and cold snap we\u2019ll see how that plays out here the next few days. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re talking anything above and beyond the usual that we always have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Halper \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Steven Halper \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Could you go through your thoughts on the sku rationalization efforts and is there something there that prevents you from going even quicker than you have been?", "Greg Wasson", "We have gone through about a little more than 30% of our total categories already. As far as looking at the efficient assortment, the adjacencies and moving pretty quickly there we\u2019ll begin to see rollout of those categories as early as May. We intend to move pretty quickly. We\u2019re really encouraged, I think the team is moving pretty quickly to move through the categories.", "Wade Miquelon", "The speed at which we\u2019re doing it, it might be long to you but it is really extraordinarily rapid for the number of categories we\u2019ll be changing. Its very important move so it has to be done right, it has to be bedded with research, with shoppers, qualified and has to be executed flawlessly in the stores. As Greg said, by May we\u2019re going to have a big wave and we\u2019re working our way through almost half of all categories now in terms of doing the work. I don\u2019t think we could be going any faster and doing it a quality way at this time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "A question on the LIFO charge, did I hear you say that the expectation is for $200 million this year?", "Wade Miquelon", "It\u2019s about $185 million I forget the exact number but that\u2019s almost double the year prior.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Could you talk about that a little bit given the fact some retailers are talking about potentially deflationary environment next year?", "Wade Miquelon", "If you think about the year being broken into four quarters we\u2019re actually ahead of pace a bit for that annualized rate but that\u2019s because we saw last fall a lot of price increases coming through and the step up when all the commodity prices were up. Now I think what we\u2019re not going to see necessarily is we\u2019re not going to see either a lot more increases on top of that or a lot of these front end suppliers aren\u2019t going to probably be dropping their price directly either. They might promote more but you seldom see list price declines. That\u2019s the front end.", "On the Pharmacy end we\u2019ll have to see how it goes the next month or two but we have seen some price increases and especially on the branded side there may be some more before the next administration is fully in place. I would say it\u2019s too early to tell at this point but we think overall for the year that\u2019s a pretty good number.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "On the one time costs associated with some of the cost initiatives like POWER can you give a little more color as to what constitutes those costs on the one time part?", "Wade Miquelon", "Over time it\u2019s obviously going to be things like consultants that are helping us, it\u2019s going to be things like potential with the skus elimination. We\u2019re going to see some potential write downs associated with that and there could be obviously some people costs, transition costs, those are the big buckets. In this first period the bulk of it would be people costs associated with helping do the work. Things like consultants and other ancillary charges.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bakley Smith \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Bakley Smith \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "I wanted to get at the reduction in square footage growth a little bit. We you growing too fast before and now you feel like you\u2019ve right sized or do you feel like your view on the industry and the opportunity out there has changed significantly in the last six months or a year?", "Greg Wasson", "I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re growing too fast. I think what we did in the past is organically we found some of the best corners in America. I think now we realize we have 6,500 of the best locations and there is opportunity to take that capital that\u2019s freeing up and invest back into those stores to drive some incredible value. We\u2019re going to continue to invest and find those best corners. We\u2019re still going to look for the best corners across the country. We\u2019re going to look for markets that make sense strategically to continue to grow share in and certain make sure that it gives us the return on investment we\u2019re looking for.", "Bakley Smith \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Could we call this a planned remodel, do you have a new remodel in mind or is it in process? It sounds like you\u2019re going to step up the remodel effort a little bit and is there a program that\u2019s going to be associated with that or is it adhoc at this point?", "Greg Wasson", "Its work in progress. If you think about our consumer centric retail initiative first you\u2019ll see new category planograms rolled out through all stores that we talk about coming out in May with more efficient assortments, the adjacencies, departments moved closer together that make sense. At the same time, we\u2019re looking at a new design, new format and that\u2019s what you will hear more about. Certainly we\u2019ve got to understand more as far as where we\u2019re headed and put the cost to it so we understand how much capital will be required.", "Rick Hans", "That\u2019s our final question. I want to thank you all for joining us today. A couple of quick reminders, we\u2019ll announce December sales on January 5th so we\u2019ll host our annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday, January 14th at Navy Pier in Chicago, remember it begins earlier this year at 10am Central Standard Time. As usual, we\u2019ll host an analyst Q&A session immediately afterwards. Our next quarterly financial announcement will be Monday, March 23, when we announce fiscal 2009 second quarter results. Until then have a happy holiday and a great new year.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s call we do appreciate your participation you may disconnect at this time.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Now I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Hans, Divisional Vice President of Inventor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead sir.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you Angel, and good morning everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter Conference Call. Today Greg Wasson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will discuss the quarter\u2019s highlights and how we are reinforcing our key strategies through changes in our corporate structure; Wade Miquelon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will detail the second quarter financial results before we begin taking your calls. John Spina, our Vice President and Treasurer, also is joining us on the call today.", "When we get to your questions, please limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can give an opportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time. Today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our Investor Relations website located at investor.walgreens.com. After this call, this presentation will be archived on our website for 12 months.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward looking statements. Now I will turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Wasson", "Thank you Rick, and thank you everyone for listening to our call. We appreciate your continued interest in Walgreens. It is my first call as CEO, which makes it very exciting for me personally, but it is also an exciting time for Walgreens. First, we are moving fast to execute our growth strategy and strengthen our position as America's most convenient provider of consumer goods and services, as well a pharmacy and health and wellness services.", "Second, in an economy more challenging than most of us have experienced in our professional lives, Walgreens is well positioned to win. We are responding to the new consumer landscape with new merchandising experts focused on value. And third, we are aggressively reducing costs across the company, and have maintained a healthy balance sheet, which gives us significant flexibility at a time when cash is king.", "Now let's review the quarter's financial highlights. Net sales for the quarter were a record $16.5 billion, up 7%. Comparable store sales, adjusted for calendar shifts and last year's leap day, rose 2.1% in the quarter, while front-end comparable sales decreased 0.2% on an adjusted basis.", "We are continuing to see evidence of customers changing their buying habits. Front-end comps or discretionary items were down in the second quarter, but that was offset by positive comps for nondiscretionary and other items. Another good sign is that we are holding our own in terms of attracting customers into our stores.", "Adjusted for last year's leap day, comparable store traffic was virtually flat in the quarter when compared with a year ago. That means we're keeping our doors swinging at a good pace even while the retail industry as a whole is seeing more doors permanently close.", "Net earnings were $640 million or $0.65 per share diluted compared with $686 million or $0.69 per share diluted a year ago. Remember that last year's earnings benefited from an extra day due to leap year. Earnings per share this quarter were reduced by a net $0.04 after costs and benefits for our Rewiring for Growth initiative, which I will talk about more later.", "As we noticed in recent quarters, consumer behavior has changed dramatically in recent months beyond just the kind of products they are purchasing. Job losses and other financial pressures have led to fewer doctor visits, which means fewer prescriptions made, written and filled. Despite that fact, we have filled 164 million prescriptions during the quarter, an increase of 4% over last year's second quarter. That compares favorably to the industry-wide decline of 1% has reported by IMS, excluding Walgreens.", "The first half of fiscal 2009 saw us open or acquire 269 drugstores. Even though that is 13 fewer openings than a year ago, the significant impact from our slowdown in new store openings will hit later in fiscals 2010 and 2011. We also opened 117 Take Care clinics in the first half of the year, including 41 in the second quarter.", "During my first 60 days as CEO, one of my key priorities has been to manage \u2013 has been to build our management team and its structure in a way that fully supports our three key strategies. Again those strategies are one, to leverage the best community store network in America, two, to enhance the customer experience inside our stores and three, to significantly reduce our costs and boost our productivity.", "Now let me recap the moves we made to our senior management team in the second quarter to put the right people in charge of the right processes. First Randy Lewis, who is in charge of Logistics and Distribution, is now our Senior Vice President for Supply Chain Management, a pipeline with tremendous opportunity for inventory and cost reduction.", "Now George Riedl is now leading the ongoing rollout of our new POWER pharmacy program, which I will talk about more a little later. George will also continue to manage pharmaceutical purchasing.", "Bryan Pugh is now leading our merchandising divisions for all front-end categories in addition to developing new store formats. Finally, Tom Connolly takes over our facility division. Tom is replacing Bill Shiel, who retired after 38 years with us. Bill had the hard work of turning our division of 7000 community stores into reality, and we certainly thank him for that.", "In addition to securing the best store sites in America, Tom will take more of a portfolio management approach towards our growing organic store growth rate. Historically that growth rate was in the 8% range and even reached 9% in fiscal 2008. Now that we're stepping down that rate to between 2.5% and 3% by 2011, it is absolutely the right thing to do for three reasons.", "First, it provides flexibility to invest in our core strategies and improve shareholder value. Second, we will have more time to development management and focus on the shopper experience. And third, a prudent step in the context of today's economic conditions.", "We are seeing consolidation continue in the industry and our financial flexibility allows us to take advantage of these opportunities when they make sense. Last week, we agreed to acquire prescription files from 11 Drug Fair pharmacies in New Jersey, along with 32 other Drug Fair locations we would purchase and operate.", "Also in February, we agreed to acquire 12 Rite Aid locations in San Francisco and eastern Idaho. The next piece of our strategy I want to update you on is financing our customer experience. One of the ways we are tackling this is through our customer centric retailing project. CCR is about streamlining assortments and reworking promotions. It is not simply about SKU reductions, but about prioritizing categories and items within categories.", "As an example, we plan to get more space and add items to categories like skincare and cosmetics. These are signature categories that build brand and create loyal customers. We are rolling out 40 categories with optimized assortments to all of our stores by this fall.", "These categories account for more than half of our front-end sales. We will do the rollout at the same time we normally do resets in order to avoid disruptions during peak sales periods.", "New formats driven by CCR will be piloted in 35 stores by summer. These stores will represent various markets and demographics that we get a good read on results. Besides the new assortment of basic departments, these stores will include a lower store profile and new layouts designed around customer solutions.", "After analyzing this initial effort and confirming its success, we plan to fully convert several hundred stores to CCR before Halloween. Then, after holding for the holiday sales period, and making any needed adjustments, we plan to roll out CCR formats at the beginning of calendar 2010.", "Over the next 18 months, our goal is to touch every store in the chain. That is what I mean when I say we are going to juice our stores. Obviously, this will cost some money and we will pay for it by refocusing some dollars, previously earmarked for new stores to taking care of the older ones.", "One part of CCR that has moved forward very quickly is our Affordable Essentials program, launched chain-wide in February. This program includes basic staples such as food, paper products, toiletries and other consumables marketed together to move customers up to Walgreens from traditional value retailers.", "And the third piece of our strategy I want to highlight is cost reductions and productivity gains. Over the past four quarters, we have made dramatic improvement with selling, general and administrative costs, which has allowed us to better leverage gross profit dollars. That continued this quarter. SG&A costs increased only 8.1% in the second water over the year ago period. The increase was only 5.7% when factoring out our net restructuring costs.", "Meanwhile the gross profit dollars increased 5.1% on an adjusted basis. We expect this moment to continue as our corporate restructuring program called Rewiring for Growth moves forward. We took our first steps under this plan in January, when about 400 corporate and field management employees took advantage of our voluntary separation program. Many of them spent 25 years or more with Walgreens, and are the ones who built the systems and executed the strategies that took this company to new levels of success. And we are certainly in their debt for all they accomplished, and now it is our job to build upon those accomplishments.", "Earlier this month, nearly 200 additional jobs where eliminated from corporate and field management staff. These moves along with our voluntary separation program and other labor savings are streamlining our corporate structure. They also put us on target towards our goals of eliminating 1000 corporate and field positions by the end of August, which will contribute to $1 billion in annual cost savings in fiscal 2011.", "One of the many structural changes we are making, one that really excites me is the decision to move our 29 store operations market Vice-Presidents out of the corporate office. Today they reside in the market for which they are responsible to support all of our businesses in that area and to drive growth and profitability.", "This level of leadership on the ground and living in the market will move us from operating stores in communities to serving communities across America. We also expect to achieve cost savings, productivity gains, and improved pharmacy patient experience through the rollout of POWER pharmacy. POWER moves the administrative tasks involved in filling prescriptions to the central facilities, enables our store pharmacists to spend more time as the trusted clinician with our patients. It also means our pharmacists can provide additional healthcare services, such as wellness management and immunizations, and it makes us more competitive by improving the efficiency of our filling process.", "POWER also ties in closely with our slowing of organic store growth. With POWER\u2019s added capacity, we won't have to open new stores as quickly to relieve high pharmacy volumes at existing stores. POWER has already been implemented in nearly 400 of our approximately 780 Florida stores, with 19% of prescriptions being filled at our central facility.", "In addition, more than 30 Arizona stores are using key components of POWER. George Riedl will manage the rollout for the remainder of our Florida stores by the end of August. Converting pharmacies to this system is as much about change management as it is about technology. And George, who is a pharmacist and lead the launch of our original online pharmacy in the late 90s, is the best person to help our pharmacists adapt to the changes that will transform how a community pharmacy is practiced.", "Now, I would like to update you on our health and wellness division and what our folks there are doing to expand health services through our community store network. In January, we connected our prescription drug offering, retail clinics, and worksite health and wellness centers under one umbrella called complete care and well-being.", "This program provides large employers with affordable, accessible, and high-quality care for their employees, dependents and retirees no matter where they work or live. On the retail clinic front, we opened 41 Take Care clinics during the quarter, and openings will continue this year.", "Beyond just increasing the number of clinics, we are also working to expand our service offerings to patients. Some that we recently introduced or plan to in the future include health evaluations, an expanded vaccine suite, skin assessments and procedures, and disease management services for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease that will be integrated with the medical community.", "In addition, in two Florida markets we are piloting our Take Care clinics as administration sites for the injection and infusion of specialty drugs. These programs are preview of how we can integrate businesses like homecare and specialty pharmacy with worksite health centers, in-store clinics in our retail pharmacies. These services and others also will help reduce the seasonality inherent in the clinic business.", "In addition to building strong relationship with employers, we're going direct to consumers with our Prescription Savings Club. On the club, the 1.7 million members, more than 30% of them are new to Walgreens. Plus, PSC members like the convenience of picking up a 90-day supply at the local pharmacy. As a result, they are bringing us their entire pharmacy business and increasing their compliance with their medication.", "Now before turning the call over to Wade, I would like to comment briefly on the economy and health care reform. The new economy and its effect on consumers is dramatically changing the retail landscape. Many people have commented about once-in-a-generation shift in consumer attitude. We are adjusting immediately to this new consumer through programs like Affordable Essentials and stronger promotion of our private brands.", "I would like to point out that we are being extremely prudent in our capital allocation and protecting our balance sheet. We believe our cash position and credit ratings are reassuring to investors during these turbulent times. And finally President Obama's plans for health care reform would certainly impact the retail pharmacy industry. His plans call for affordable and accessible health care, and he understands that medication can lower overall health costs.", "We are well positioned to respond with our convenient pharmacy and health and wellness services. And that is one of the reasons I'm so optimistic about our future, even while we navigate some extremely difficult retail waters and align our company with the new realities. We also have the advantages of, one, selling basic necessities that people need, two, convenient locations in communities where people live and work, and a winning strategy and good progress on key initiatives to move us forward.", "And finally a top management team that blends internal expertise, outside talent and new thinking. So now Wade will update you on the specific financial results for the quarter. Wade?", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you Greg. I would like to reiterate Greg's confidence in our three key strategies and their ability to create shareholder value over the long term. Turning to the quarter, net sales increased 7%, while total comparable sales rose 1.3%. Total comp sales were negatively impacted by 0.8 percentage points with the calendar shift in last year\u2019s leap day. This places us in good shape compared with other retailers, and we believe a (inaudible) given the amount of transformation that we are currently undertaking.", "Prescription sales rose 7.8% and represent 63% of sales for the quarter. Prescription sales in comparable stores rose a solid 2.9%, and were negatively impacted by 0.7 percentage points by calendar shifts in last year's leap day. The number of prescriptions filled in comparable stores increased 0.3%. That was negatively impacted by 1.6 percentage points by more patients filling 90-day scripts versus 30-day scripts. Also calendar shifts in last year's leap day negatively impacted comparable scripts by 0.7 percentage points.", "Net earnings for the second quarter were $640 million, a 6.7% decline from last year. This year's quarter included a $93 million impact or $0.06 per share from costs associated with Rewiring for Growth. We are now starting to see some Rewire benefits as well and this quarter had approximately $0.02 per share benefit from Rewire, giving as net costs from the program of approximately $0.04 per share. In addition, the quarter included impacts of a negative $0.01 per share for the LIFO reserve versus a year ago, a negative 1% per share for interest expense above the prior year.", "Net these items had a total year-on-year quarterly cost of $0.08 per share or $0.06 per share after factoring in the Rewire benefits. Looking at our service performance in recent quarters, you will know the numbers have essentially stabilized in a very tough retail environment. With the progress we are making on programs such as CCR, and the Affordable Essentials roll-out, I believe we are poised to grow sales in the front-end despite the challenging economy.", "Gross profit in the second quarter was $4.7 billion or a 4.8% increase versus the year ago quarter, reflecting the slowing economy.", "Gross margin was down 60 basis points in the quarter compared with the prior year. Negatively impacting margins were lower front-end margins due to promotional pricing and product mix, non-retail businesses, and a higher LIFO provision. Helping the overall margins was an increase in pharmacy margins as a result of the impact of generic drug sales.", "Before addressing SG&A expenses and the impact of a slowdown in store openings, I would like to revisit a couple of slides that we first introduced in the first quarter of 2008, and we're updating today. This slide shows the front-end performance by store class for each of the past seven years. You will see that despite a weak retail environment, our newest class of stores is performing close to the long-term average. Simply put, our store front-ends are as productive as always.", "On the pharmacy side, our newest class of stores is a little below average, which can be attributed to several factors. First, we are opening more stores recently in markets that tend to build script counts at a slower initial rate. Second, we are operating fewer 24-hour pharmacies as a percentage of overall pharmacies. Third, the economy is affecting the number of scripts patients are filling, and finally we are seeing a market impact from 30-day scripts converting to 90-days.", "Still our new store ramp up curve fairly robust, and although scripts have slowed slightly in the 2007 class, we expect them to return to their historical growth rate as the economy improves, and as initiatives such as Power and Prescription Savings Club continue to separate our pharmacies from the pack.", "Cost control has been a central focus for the past 18 months. And our significant progress in cutting SG&A growth continued this quarter. Our increase in SG&A dollars in the second quarter was only 8.1%, and just 5.7% if you take out the costs for Rewiring for Growth.", "On a two-year stacked basis, SG&A dollar growth in the second quarter has declined from 25.5% to 16.9%, primarily due to salary and store expense control. Going forward, slowing new store openings, opening fewer retail clinics, and realizing significant costs from Rewiring for Growth will all reduce growth in future SG&A.", "Let me show you where we are in the cost reduction progress. Three primary areas of opportunity include strategic sourcing of indirect spend, corporate field and store overhead, and POWER.", "This chart shows the schedule of cost in benefits associated with Rewire on an EPS basis. We recorded $93 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter. That included $59 million for voluntary and involuntary employee separations, $11 million for inventory write-downs associated with CCR, and $23 million for consulting and other costs. Overall, we're still on track for $300 million to $400 million in costs through fiscal 2010.", "Now originally, we had thought the 2009 costs and benefits would offset each other in this fiscal year. Now we expect a few cents per share net negative impact as we have accelerated some of our Rewire cost efforts. But again, we are on track with respect to our total cost as well as on track to record more than $500 million in net benefits in fiscal 2010. We are also on target to achieve our long-term objective of $1 billion in annual cost reductions by fiscal 2011.", "Now, let us look at some of our other financial drivers in the quarter. The LIFO provision was $49 million versus $31 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily reflecting higher than anticipated price increases for non-prescription drugs and other front-end merchandise. Next are the $93 million in restructuring costs that I have summarized previously.", "Net interest expense was $20 million compared with $2 million last year due to the issuance of $2.3 billion in long-term debt. The effective tax rate was 36.7% compared with a rate of 36.8% in the year ago period. Accounts receivable were up 21.2% in the quarter, driven partly by growth in third-party retail prescription sales, and the impact of the quarter ending on a Saturday.", "Thanks to excellent supply chain management by everyone, inventories grew only 3.5% despite a sales gain of 7%. Accounts payable increased 17.9%, again due primarily to a normal business growth and the quarter ending on a Saturday. As part of our focus on liquidity, we held a successful bond offering in the quarter of $1 billion in 5.25% 10-year treasury bonds. That was a spread of 2.875% to benchmark treasury notes, an exceptional result in these times by any standard.", "Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $785 million compared with $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, and that reflects long term debt of $2.3 billion offset by cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion.", "Next, we finished the quarter with more than $2.8 billion in cash and credit lines available, more than sufficient to operate in the toughest retail environments and to drive our winning strategies. Hence, we feel great about our financial strength and liquidity and our balance sheet should only strengthen as we slow store growth, improve inventory, drive cost savings, and work our way back to target double-digit earnings growth over the next few years.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $242 million, up 19.3% over a year ago. The big driver was amortization for prescription file buys, which continued to be robust.", "For the first half of the fiscal year, we invested $1.1 billion in additions to property, plant and equipment versus $1.0 billion last year, and mostly for the addition of 245 new stores versus 275 last year. We continue to estimate that capital spending for the full year will come in at around $1.8 billion or about $400 million less than fiscal 2008.", "Free cash flow amounted to $647 million for the first half of the fiscal year, up 40% from year ago. Disciplined operations, inventory control and a slight slowdown in store openings were the driving factors here.", "And many of you have asked about forecasting capital expenditures in future years, and in particular cost per store remodels and refreshes. Much of that will be expense dollars included in our Rewiring for Growth costs that we have outlined. If there are remodels that require capital expenditures, we will outline those for you in the future. As a general rule, we would expect our capital investment to continue to decline over time, but we're just not prepared yet to put a dollar amount on that.", "So, wrapping things up, I believe we're off to a great start with our three key strategies, and they will take us to an entirely new level over time. The strategies are in motion and we're starting to see the fruits of that labor. And we remain committed to return to double-digit earnings growth as part of our overall shareholder plan to create long-term value for our shareholders.", "And now I would like to turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you Wade. Angel that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions) And we will take our first caller Mr. Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "Ask you a few questions on the sales. You know on \u2013 I guess Greg, do you see a permanent shift towards staples from discretionary in Walgreen stores, you know, requiring fairly fundamental change in either in your mix, your merchandising, your pricing, and you know is just signaled by your hiring, you know, a new merchandiser from outside, not just outside Walgreens but from the discount store industry.", "Greg Wasson", "I don't see, you know, a permanent shift, Andy. I do think that the right balance between making sure we have good value items such as the Affordable Essentials that are stacked up in stores with prominence in our ads and our stores to swing doors is critical. You know, obviously the right balance to make sure we offset, you know, any margin pressure that we\u2019d see from value pricing is got to be adjusted in the mix, and how we promote, and I think one of the things you will see us do is really aggressively promote our private brand to help offset that, but I do think you know, in going to Bryan Pugh that we now moved into merchandising area. I think Bryan is going to bring a lot of great experience. We are really, really looking to get to understand our customer, and know our customer more, we can file. And I think you\u2019ll see a lot more target merchandising toward our customers.", "Wade Miquelon", "And I would just pile on there and say you know, I think part of this is also recognizing that we do have the best retail corners in America, and making sure that we have the right staple offerings there is just simply the right thing to do.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "In terms of driving traffic or just because, I guess back to the original point of the question, just because that is at least now and maybe into the future what a drugstore can expect to \u2013 its consumers to take away.", "Greg Wasson", "I think you know, as I said Andy I\u2019m telling you, I hope I am getting to your question, I think you will see us, you know, continuing to make sure that we are swinging doors as I said. I mean we're going to have, going to have good value items on the front page of our rotas. We have good value items stacked up in stores, but at the same time you know, I think the merchandise selection, the promotional activity you will be seeing help will help offset that margin, and I think there is tremendous upside getting on private label.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "So you're going to remain committed to general merchandise and a pretty robust you know, gift and Christmas program.", "Greg Wasson", "Absolutely, you know one of the things we hear loud and clear is that our consumer likes our fun atmosphere. They like seasonal. They like the items, being able to find items quickly, the new items as they are launched. So we are not going to deviate from that part of our business. That is where we excel and have excelled for years.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "Thanks, and just one follow on, Wade on the Rewire initiatives. I've heard that you know, and I assume this would be the case anyway. So you're really managing down full-time equivalence with some top, you know, from top-down directives at the store level and also overtime pay, whether it is for assistance or what have you. Is that \u2013 how are you considering that. Is that part of your rewire savings, or is that part of the normal course of just running a tighter shift at Walgreens?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I think, you know, I guess what I would say is that, you know, we're looking everything off of the 2008 base. We are looking for as you know savings in three buckets. The middle bucket is really looking for savings and corporate overheads, field management and at the store level, but except that there is some tightening there, yes, that is factored into it.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "Okay, so on a pro forma or run rate basis have you given what you have done at the store level, and have you already reached the 1000 heads on a full-time equivalent basis?", "Greg Wasson", "That 1000 heads is in the store level number really. That 1000 heads is more of a corporate and field level. So that's a really separate initiative. So again, you know, for the 1000 number we've been targeting, it's really primarily corporate and field management separate from store labor.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "Okay, let me one follow-up, and then I will surrender. So, at the store level could you take \u2013 what is the full-time equivalent reduction that you think it is going to work out to?", "Wade Miquelon", "We haven't given any numbers or thoughts on that. Obviously, if we\u2019re going to reduce labor there we are going to have to re-engineer processes. People work very hard at the store; they've got a lot to do. So making sure that we have simpler promotions, few allotments and all that is going to help, but we haven't given any specifics on that to date.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Next we will go to Robert Willoughby of Banc of America.", "Greg Wasson", "Good morning Robert.", "Wade Miquelon", "Good morning Robert.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America", "On the receivables build there, can you comment on how much may be attributable to the shift into healthcare franchises that you have, and then just a follow up. Have you really clearly laid out kind of plans for cash. How much kind of goes into retail, how much goes into healthcare over the next 12 months?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I would say that, you know, there is not really any market shift from the mix in healthcare there. The primary reason for this slight, you know, receivables change year-on-year, again I said is really the Saturday timing. So you\u2019ll see that balance up over time. Also, as there has been in the public domain, little bit of timing on some of the Medicaid payments. But that should work its way out over time.", "So I think essentially, which you just see here is anomaly, mostly of ending on a Saturday.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay, and just how you split your CapEx going forward between healthcare and retail?", "Greg Wasson", "You know, the bulk of it is still going to be on the core, right. Everything we are doing is to reinforce the core. The bulk of our spending is you know, things like new store openings, remodel and refreshing on our stores, IT infrastructure and distribution infrastructure to support our stores. So, you know, the overwhelming majority will continue to be on the core.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America", "But I can\u2019t get you to kind of commit to a healthcare acquisition spend by any means, could I?", "Greg Wasson", "No.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to John Ransom of Raymond James.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Hi good morning. Could you tell me your SKU rationalization, how much is that affecting your front-end sales, and when do you think you will be through that process?", "Greg Wasson", "John, it is Greg, you know, we are just beginning to, you know, as I said roll out some of the categories. We are not seeing any effect on front-end sales. Actually we are looking for an opportunity to grow sales, but keep in mind we've got \u2013 we are through about 50% to 60% of the categories of merchandise we have now.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Greg Wasson", "We are going to rule out 40 of those, as I said by fall. We are looking at the results as we rule them out, and it will begin to pile at full CCR formats in 35 stores in spring.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Just an idea, how many SKUs you are trying to take out, and what those \u2013 has that changed since you talked, started talking about it this fall. Has the type of stuff you are taking out changed as you learn more?", "Greg Wasson", "You know, I think \u2013 I think the one thing that we are doing is, you know we had maybe a year ago kind of had a benchmark goal out there of a percent reduction, but I think it's much more laser focused now by category, and you may see some categories where, you know, maybe a 20%, 30% reduction, maybe see some of our signature categories with maybe a single digit reduction.", "So I think it's just really using shopper based principles to really determine what those merchandise categories should be and how to optimize them.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Yes, and what percentage of your front-end is Walgreens private label versus third-party, and where do you think that could get to in a couple of years?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, about 20% of our business is private-label now, still growing fairly healthily. I mean I don't, you know I only have to surmise what it could be. Obviously, it is seen in countries overseas, you know, Germany, UK, Italy et cetera. Those at the very high-end can approach, you know, 40ish percent over time, but really I think it depends by category, and at the end of the day how do we make our brands, you know, play very well with our private label, kind of have an overall portfolio to give the customer the right choice.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. That's helpful, and then the other thing I wanted to ask you was this 90 day going to or 30-day going to 90-day retail. I know one of your responses is to do more automated prescription fills to lower your cost. Is there any other strategic response that you might use with your mail-order or otherwise to get ahead of this.", "Greg Wasson", "I think one of the things we are most excited about is the POWER initiative that we talked about. And I think we have tremendous opportunity there to take costs out, we are central filling in Orlando now about 19% of chronic prescriptions. We think there is tremendous upside there yet.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Greg Wasson", "We are also moving, as you know, a lot of the work such as insurance verification and so forth out, which is reducing lot of the tasks within the stores.", "Wade Miquelon", "But I also think our PSC card, what we are really seeing is we are seeing about 20% of the prescriptions filled 90-day or being filled for 90 day supplies versus the typical prescription trend of about 4%. So we are encouraged that folks look for 90-day supply within drug channel in the convenience we offer.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And then finally, how is much Take Care costs for you this year. I know, CVS has talked about something like about a nickel dilution. What kind of \u2013 is Take Care going to be profitable? When do you think that might have profited, assuming it is not profitable now, and how much is that costing you?", "Wade Miquelon", "It is costing us almost $0.06 cents a share.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay.", "Wade Miquelon", "You know, we believe this year is probably the most dilutive year, in other words will start to creep moving forward, although we won't move in the black next year. There will be less losses. Of other models, just remember that this model to become profitable on a stand-alone basis without a script or a front-end sale, you know, our models typically runs 2 to 3 years. So those losses we are incurring is not you know, because our older stores or older clinics are, you know, accretive and productive. It is just because of the timing of putting so many clinics in the last year. So again it really will become profitable sort of a function on when that overall \u2013 you know, those overall majority of stores start to getting that 2 to 3-year aging cycle.", "Greg Wasson", "You know, I like to add that we\u2019re seeing majority of stores are surpassing breakevens but you know, I would like to point out, I do not see this as a seasonal business. I think that strategically long-term these \u2013 providing access and affordable health care is a huge opportunity for us to leverage our community stores within \u2013 and that is the reason we are putting a lot of effort into additional services that can be offered to the clinics as well as leveraging Walgreens\u2019 labor model to help improve the operating model within the clinics.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Okay. And are you guys still taking off the table, if a big health plan wants to sell their PBM. Is that still something strategically that you would say is off the table or is that something you might look at now?", "Greg Wasson", "We will certainly continue, our key strategy is to broaden and deepen our payor relationships with managed care organizations and PBMs at large. So, we don't certainly see, you know, deviations from that at this point in time, and I can\u2019t comment on the specific opportunity.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Sure, all right, thank you.", "Greg Wasson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Neil Currie of UBS.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one. Bryan Pugh\u2019s appointment as Head of Merchandising at just the front-end. Also he has a role in format, could you, maybe give us a bit more detail as to what his role is here, and what format you maybe considering, and whether you might venture into any particularly new formats?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, Neil. Bryan is going to \u2013 yes, I originally brought him into lead new formats, and then I\u2019d recently given him front-end merchandising, but as far as new formats, I think initially to be making sure that we launched the CCR initiative that we have across the chain in a very prudent and efficient manner. We will be testing, as I said in 35 stores that new format which is lower profile, low profiles as well as optimized merchandising.", "But also, we will begin to explore new formats, based on our customer research that we are getting from Kim Feil, our new CMO, and begin to pilot in select stores . I think there is tremendous opportunity now that we\u2019ve brought all the resources together under Bryan to really begin to be more efficient, to learn and study what we pilot. We are looking at high-volume urban locations, and how we can leverage new formats to help accelerate our growth in urban areas and so forth. So I think Bryan is going to really help us there.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Would you consider formats without a pharmacy?", "Greg Wasson", "I don't think anything is off the table, but certainly be in a pharmacy and that being our franchise, I think it really will be something that we have to consider. So I don't see that being studied right now.", "Wade Miquelon", "We do have a few stores today that are very successful without a pharmacy, but those are in very specialized locations, may be tourist areas or whatever, but you know, broad scale it really doesn't make any sense for us right.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "And I just wondered where you are at the moment in terms of SKU rationalization. Is there any figures you could give us around that?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I think as we outlined here in kind of the script, we are getting ready to move not only to those 30 or so you know, pilot stores, but also into you know, a reset of 40% of the categories through the fall here. You know, again as Greg said there is no one-size that fits all for categories. We will try looking in that 15% to 17% overall reduction range. Some categories may be being flat or slightly up with their signature and other ones being down more markedly, but if you want to re-emphasize that because of the SKUs we taking out are either very slow moving, have lots of better alternatives in the store, you know, are desired by our customer base, you know, et cetera, the category by category belief that it is an opportunity to actually build sales through better facings, through more relevancies for better preselection, and it is the risk of losing sales, and the real key will be executing it flawlessly.", "Greg Wasson", "Certainly, and our signature categories are referred to such as skin and over-the-counter cough and cold and so forth. You'll see less SKU reductions in some of our, you know, discretionary categories such as hardware or automotive and so forth.", "Neil Currie \u2013 UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Next we will go to Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Good morning. So a few questions, previously, I think it was at the analyst meeting back in 2008, you had talked about a comprehensive loyalty program, which would include the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club, but also you know, potentially more of like a typical rewards card kind of like CVS has its Extra Care. Can you talk about your current thoughts there?", "Greg Wasson", "We brought Kim Feil in as our new Chief Marketing Officer, and as you know she's got a strong IRI background, customer insight and customer research. Certainly you know, we believe that to improve and accelerate customer loyalty within our franchise is an opportunity. Kim\u2019s first objective was to study and learn who our customer is, and more about our customer and how to target those customers, but with that we certainly think our loyalty program is of value. And she is working through how we would consider going to market and the proper loyalty program for Walgreens. So a lot of effort being put there Deborah.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Okay, very helpful. And then on the real estate side, since you're one of the key retailers or so growing, can you talk what you're seeing with regards to construction cost, site availability, and also your ability to renegotiate leases?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think construction costs have been basically flat, maybe slightly better. I think availability, you are probably going to see, you know, more availability than you've seen in the past, and again we only go for the best corners, but historically you know, we tend to maybe be looking at those corners versus retail banks and others. So that will probably open up over time. But on renegotiation I would say, you know, no. I mean in general I think we structure these deals, you know, these long-term deals in a way that we believe is beneficial for both parties. And I think that even if we are able to renegotiate or restructure some, you know, it wouldn't be a marked amount of money.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Okay, and then last question on the POWER initiative in Florida, how are the stores benefiting and have you seen an impact on the consumer as a result of increased attention by the pharmacist, and maybe how are you measuring that?", "Greg Wasson", "And that's exactly one of the main benefits from POWER is to improve service levels and free the pharmacists up, and certainly we are measuring, and we see you know, we see a pretty kind of neutral effect right now, and I think that's probably good Deborah, because there is \u2013 with any system rollout, you know there is a lot of technology, a lot of change in management that were thrown into the market. I think we are certainly pleased with what we are seeing. I think the potential to improve service levels and really allow that pharmacist to spend more time with patients is going to be incredible, and that's the reason we continue to roll it out.", "Deborah Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Thanks so much and best of luck.", "Greg Wasson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next will go to John Heinbockel with Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "A couple of things. How would you guys look at the front end margin reduction, and how would you generally break that out discretionary clearance markdowns around Christmas versus you know, normal promotional activity, you know, that you will have pretty much every quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "I give it to you a few different ways. You now our \u2013 we have a little bit of drag from the businesses like specialty, which have a lower margin but you know, very small. You know, our assessment part of gain was from the Rx retail margin, and in the front-end, you know, margin was now maybe 70% of that, but at the end of the day almost the entire reduction could be attributed to seasonal closeout and clearance, and I think we did pretty well this seasonal period, you know all things considered especially since our buying happened, you know far before we saw the total impact of the recession, and I think as we move forward, we\u2019ve made the right adjustments for that, but I guess the other way I\u2019m saying is you could slice it is that almost all that is essentially, you know, some types of seasonal or write-down mix.", "Greg Wasson", "I think we did a pretty good job in pulling down our seasonal buyer for the Christmas and holiday, but at the same time obviously there are lots of folks down there that were early with markdowns and we had to react to, but I think even more so is we did decide to take some markdowns because we want to turn that inventory into cash this year. And I think that was a prudent thing to do. Certainly we've reacted to the upcoming seasons as Wade said to make sure that we\u2019ve adjusted to the new economy.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And then you \u2013 and Easter is fundamentally different than Christmas in terms of discretionary importance, so you would not expect the same type of \u2013 or anything close to it for Easter.", "Greg Wasson", "We feel pretty good with Easter right now. Again we were able to make the adjustment with our buy. We've got a longer selling season this year, two extra weeks in April. So, you know, we certainly don't expect and hope to have the same type of markdown challenge that we had with Christmas holiday, but you know, we feel pretty good.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is there a plan to sort of manage non-discretionary front-end growth to a certain level may be flat and you know, keep investing in value alongside, whatever cost reduction you're getting or do you actually thinking you can see some improvement there?", "Greg Wasson", "You know, I think we are seeing a lift in non-discretionary categories and other items now offsetting the drop and the duration, we have seen more discretionary categories. So I think that balance will be critical, and that's the reason again, I think there is opportunity for us to continue to grow our private-label sales, which will help offset their margins.", "Wade Miquelon", "I wouldn't see any reason why we couldn't strive to make improvements in margin in all of our categories, you know whether we are being more targeted in discretionary, whether we are pulling our staples through more effectively or whether we are you know, driving you know, more business to private-label, et cetera.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "All right, and finally what do we see right now with regard to reimbursement pressure, but I know it is always there, has it picked up given the macro, will it pick up? And it doesn't look like we're seeing a lot of issue \u2013 a lot of big cuts on the Medicaid front statewide but is that coming?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I think as you have said we have experienced reimbursement pressures and constantly managed that. Hey John, I think with, you know, healthcare reforms there is going to be opportunities for us to provide access solutions, but at the same time there is going to continued reimbursement pressure. And I think we've got to continue to do what we've done over the years and manage that aggressively, build the resources, Stan Blaylock [ph] over water and health services has the horsepower to continue to manage and get the best reimbursement force, but I think we will continue to see it. I don't see it accelerating any more aggressive than they have in the past but certainly we are prepared for it.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) We will take our next one from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi Good morning guys.", "Greg Wasson", "Hi Ed.", "Wade Miquelon", "Hi Ed.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Greg, how do you manage the risk of hurting sales by pulling products out that may be your more loyal customers are looking for in terms of the SKU rationalization, and does not having a loyalty card program raise that level of execution risk?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, good question Ed. I think as far as how we manage the risk, you know as I said, we are really using what we call a shopper-based principles to look at these departments, and we are truly looking item by item, and what the true profitability of an item is, but we're also looking at the regional and the geographic value of each item as well. So, we are really being careful not to select and not to cut out. What has really made us unique, and that is the fact that we typically do have the item to fit certain geographies.", "So being real careful there. As far as royalty \u2013 not having loyalty program, does it add additional risk? You know, I don't believe so, I think I see us \u2013 I see tremendous opportunity as we go forward, as we know more who our customer is, and how to market drug directly to customers. So I think we are managing that risk prudently and appropriately.", "Wade Miquelon", "And I will just build on Greg's comments here, on the SKU reduction, we are being extraordinarily thoughtful, and apart from the profitability analysis, also we're doing a detailed shopper basket, which is by category to make sure that the end proposition is even better, the vetting process for testing or the wave of rollouts is going to give us lots of opportunities to make sure that our read is what we believe. So we should be good there. As Greg said I think the loyalty \u2013 building more loyalty is a great opportunity for us, and invested heavily in loyalty in the past, in things like the best corners in America, but to the extent those other things we can do that make sense, we will certainly consider.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then you know, you have been more aggressive on the new store acquisition front recently. How important will this be going forward? How do you evaluate these opportunities, and just how do you balance doing this is with focusing just on improving your core store base?", "Greg Wasson", "I think that as we always do, we will certainly look at every opportunity to make sure it fits strategically Ed, as well as gives the right ROIC that we need going forward. I think we are continuing to see pressure and industry consolidation that we will have to look at and analyze, and do it appropriately. That is kind of what I meant my Tom Connolly changing our real estate strategy to more of a portfolio strategy going forward, to make sure if there is an opportunity that makes sense in a certain geography, we will consider it, but we will certainly manage that mix between organic and potential opportunities in a prudent way.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Greg, I mean, the company on the past made a bid for \u2013 or at least attempted to look at Longs Drug Stores. Now that you are CEO, I mean, are you open to doing something like a large deal or do you think you are just more value and focusing on your core store base right now?", "Greg Wasson", "I think that right now we are absolutely focused on our three-part strategy Ed which is, you know, taking and leveraging those 65,000 stores we have, and improving the front-end. I think there is tremendous value there. I do think that we will absolutely consider every opportunity, and if it makes sense strategically, and it makes sense financially we are certain to consider it going forward.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And we will take a last question from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan.", "Lisa Gill \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thanks very much and good morning. Greg in the past you have talked about utilization trends, and I think you made the comment that there are less doctor visits et cetera, but yet it looks like your numbers are pretty strong on the pharmacy side, and then additionally, it looks like RX retail on the gross profit side are coming from generic utilization. So maybe can you talk a little bit about those two things, one, are you just taking market share is that why your numbers still look positive on the pharmacy side, and then secondly, can you talk about what you are seeing for generic utilizations trends, are you seeing a conversion within your book, and as you take that opportunity to now do some central fill, and have more time with the member. Is this giving you an opportunity to convert people from one therapeutic class \u2013 I am sorry, from one therapeutic prescription to another, for example, within the statin class and moving a member to a generic.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, good questions Lisa. I will try to get to all of them. We do continue to take and grow our market share within pharmacy, and I think that we do have the luxury as we stated I think in a call that we're going to get some softening trends this time last year, but we are also continuing to outpace IMS. You know, I think that there are several things going on. I think that we are doing very well with our PSC card in response to the class of $4 generics from a year ago. We are actually seeing an increase in that category going forward. So, I think that shows that our convenience and our strategy worked there. I think we are continuing to see some struggles within the industry in this economic environment within independents and regional chains and potential (inaudible) there, and I think we are really, really promoting service as we going forward.", "As far as generic utilization in our book, I think we are and will continue to see increased utilization over the next several years. I wouldn't say that where we want to be yet on therapeutic generic opportunities. I do think that the opportunity exists with our pharmacists having more time in being freed up by POWER to do more therapeutic switches, but I wouldn't say that we have seen a huge opportunity there yet. But I do think that other opportunities that we are seeing, immunizations and vaccinations are tremendous opportunities with Zostavax being a vaccine for 55-year-olds and older seniors across the country. So hopes that gets to your questions Lisa.", "Lisa Gill \u2013 JP Morgan", "And then just as a follow-up, when you think about central fill, and obviously you are doing it in the Florida market. But is there an opportunity to roll this out nationwide, and if so what percentage of your prescriptions do you think you could see going through central fill.", "Greg Wasson", "Maybe I will take the second question first. You know I think there is potential to do maybe 30%, 35% of our prescriptions to go through central fill that is kind of backing in from the percentage of chronic prescriptions that we get still ahead of time. The second will be really more dependent on how successful we are with, you now with State regulation and legislation that allow us to fill across states and between states. We're certainly are leveraging Orlando mail service \u2013 mail service facility in Florida. We intend to leverage our Tempe mail service facility in Arizona, to begin to central fill and aggressively work to show the value that we are seeing in Florida, as we work with other states to improve the legislation process \u2013 legislative process. That is it Lisa.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the question and answer session for today. At this time, Mr. Hans, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rick Hans", "Folks that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. We will announce March sales on April 2. Please keep in mind that each default in April this year compared to last year's march Easter, which was the earliest since 1913. This will of course have a big impact on our March front-end sales comps. We will need to look at combined March-April sales to get a true picture of performance for those months.", "Our next quarterly financial announcement will be Monday, June 22, when we announce fiscal 2009 third-quarter results.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Hans, Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Cecilia and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, our President and CEO, will discuss the quarter\u2019s highlights, including updates on our three key growth strategies. Wade Miquelon, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will detail the second quarter financial results before we begin taking your calls. John Spina, our Vice President and Treasurer, also is joining us on the call today. ", "When we get to your questions, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up so that we can give an opportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time. ", "Today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our investor relations website located at investor.walgreens.com. After the call, this presentation will be archived on our website for 12 months. ", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive, and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of factors as they related to forward-looking statements. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you, Rick and thank you, everyone for listening to our call. We certainly appreciate your continued interest in Walgreens. Today I am going to review the quarter, update you on our three strategies, and share some thoughts on today\u2019s consumer and healthcare reform. ", "In the third quarter, we posted solid results in a difficult economy while recording significant restructuring costs. Net sales for the quarter were a record $16.2 billion, up 8%. We continue to see consumes save more, use less credit, and spend closer to payday. This is challenging to all retailers, including us, but we are well-positioned to continue to grow. ", "Net earnings were $522 million, or $0.53 per share diluted, compared with $572 million or  $0.58 per share diluted a year ago. Earnings per share this quarter include $0.06 of rewiring for growth costs and $0.06 in rewire benefits. ", "I am pleased with our ability to generate cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion in the third quarter, a 54% increase over a year ago. For the nine months, our cash flow from operations was $3.3 billion, up 31% over a year ago. Inventory control was one of the key drivers for our cash flow improvement. ", "Implementing our strategic initiatives is improving our cash flow, which in turn allows us to invest back into our key strategies and start the virtuous circle all over again. We are often asked to clarify our cash priorities so let me do that now. ", "Our first priority is to ensure a sound balance sheet and ample liquidity to whether any storm during these tough economic times. Second is to ensure that we continue to invest in our winning strategies for the future, such as CCR; and third is to make sound decisions that reward shareholders. As a reminder, our board will review dividend and share repurchase options at its July meeting. ", "Most of you are familiar with our three strategies that are intended to help us return to double-digit earnings growth. Those are leveraging the best store network in America, enhancing the customer experience, and implementing major cost reductions and productivity gains. As part of our first strategy, late last year we announced that we would slow our pace of store openings from the current 9% to 2.5% to 3% in fiscal 2011. This slowing will have a positive impact on our operating profit and ROIC. That\u2019s because we\u2019ll lessen the financial drag of a large number of new store openings each year. As you see from this chart, new stores don\u2019t turn profitable until their second or third year and as those stores continue to mature, their profitability grows. I think we just got the slide up. With our past store growth, we\u2019ve put down the tracks for significant ROIC improvement. ", "Now our store growth hasn\u2019t slowed yet but SG&A already has dropped significantly. That reflects our rewiring for growth efforts and the fact that we\u2019ve done a good job managing store operating expenses. ", "Beginning in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll see a sequential decline in new store openings toward our 2.5% to 3% growth target, as that slowing of new stores begins, it will contribute to SG&A control going forward. I\u2019ll pause a few minutes so you can view the slide. ", "Looking at our second strategy, we hit new milestones in the third quarter with one of our key initiatives for enhancing the customer experience, customer-centric retailing. CCR is redefining our customer offering through enhanced store formats, fine-tuning the role of various categories within the store, optimizing product assortment, pricing, and promotions, and enhancing our vendor relationships. ", "The four big wins of CCR are improving the customer experience, thereby driving higher sales, lowering costs, and reducing capital employed. ", "In the quarter, we rolled out the new CCR format to 35 pilot stores and here\u2019s a before and after look at one of those locations. You see our CCR format on the lower right is more open, less cluttered, and provides better sight lines to help locate products. Also posted a short video on YouTube showing a store\u2019s CCR transformation. You can find that video by clicking the link to it on the homepage of our investor relations website after our presentation. ", "It\u2019s too early to extrapolate any results but these 35 stores are performing ahead of plan on all metrics, so we are encouraged that achieving all four wins is possible. Each of these 35 stores was converted in about a week and with minimal disruption to sales. Our plan is to roll CCR out to about 400 stores this fall. And after a break for the holidays, we plan a nationwide rollout through calendar 2010. ", "Besides the 35-store pilot program, we\u2019ve completed, optimized assortment resets for 36 of our first 40 product categories nationwide. Through that optimization process, about 4,500 SKUs were eliminated for about 18% of our total. That\u2019s one of the contributing factors to this quarter\u2019s tight inventory control. Please note we are not reducing SKUs for reduction\u2019s sake. We are developing a preferred assortment that our shoppers are telling us they want. ", "Meanwhile, gross profit dollars increased 6.6% on an adjusted basis. We\u2019re encouraged that gross profit dollar growth has stabilized over the past two quarters. ", "We continue to focus on cost reductions and productivity gains around our business. One way we are doing that is by transforming community pharmacy and our power project is an enabler of that. We\u2019ve nearly completed rollout of power in Florida and rollout in Arizona is underway. ", "SG&A expenditures in the third quarter were up only 7.4% excluding costs associated with our restructuring versus 10.2% a year ago. SG&A is up slightly from the second quarter 2009 in part because we opened 162 new drugstores this quarter versus 45 in the second quarter and in last year\u2019s third quarter, we opened 122 new drugstores. ", "Looking ahead, I\u2019d like to address two other topics -- today\u2019s changing consumer behavior and healthcare reform. Today\u2019s consumer is more value-driven than in the past and this may be a permanent shift. We\u2019re positioning ourselves to be more relevant to the customer through programs like our affordable essentials, CCR, our prescription savings club, and our private brand strategies. ", "The latest AC Nielsen report for the 12 weeks ending in April shows our private brand dollar sales growing 12.8%. That compares with an increase of 7.6% for all drugstores excluding Walgreens and just a 1.2% increase for all other food, drugstore, and mass merchandise retailers. ", "Our convenient store locations and iconic brand also give us a competitive advantage during times like these. We are in communities where people live and work and entrusted by 5 million shoppers every day for their needs. ", "On the healthcare reform side, things are heating up in Washington. If left unchecked, some estimate healthcare costs could increase from $2.5 trillion a year now to $4 trillion within a decade. Walgreens and the retail pharmacy industry have a role in generating savings in healthcare. Our pharmacists and clinicians at retail and employer clinics are accessible, affordable providers of quality care and it makes good economic sense to include them as part of the solution. As is widely proven, better prescription compliance is key to lowering healthcare costs. ", "Another example of the role our clinicians can serve, more than 16,000 of our pharmacists will be licensed by this fall to provide flu vaccinations and immunizations. We also have nurse practitioners located about 350 in-store clinics to handle routine family illnesses at a much lower cost than an emergency room visit. These services fit very well with the major themes of healthcare reform access, affordability, and disease prevention and wellness. ", "In addition, we are pioneering new approaches to achieve better healthcare outcomes. In coming quarters, we\u2019ll pilot a chronic care management service in four markets focused initially on type two diabetes. The service will integrate capabilities across all of our platforms, including pharmacies, retail clinics, call centers, and mail service to enable patients to better control their condition. ", "Bottom line, Walgreens provides affordable, accessible, and quality solutions to both the change in consumer and the demands of healthcare today and will continue to improve and invest in these areas. We know we can do more. ", "So now Wade will update you on the financial results for the quarter. Wade. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. We feel very good about our results in a very challenging environment. In the quarter, net sales increased 8% while total comparable sales rose 2.8%. Prescription sales rose 8.2% and represent 65.6% of sales for the quarter. Prescription sales in comparable stores rose a solid 3.8%. ", "The number of prescriptions filled in comparable stores increased 4.9%. That includes a benefit of 1.6 percentage points for more patients filling 90-day scripts versus 30-day scripts. Now, recall that we reported in May sales -- when we reported May sales ,we announced that we are now following a more typical industry convention by treating one 90-day prescription as three 30-day scripts for both comparable scripts and total scripts, and this truly reflects better prescription usage. ", "Despite rising unemployment, our prescription trend is stabilizing. We filled 187 million prescriptions during the quarter and our U.S. retail scripts increased 8.3% over last year\u2019s third quarter. That includes an impact of 1.4 percentage points from patients filling 90-day scripts rather than 30-day scripts. ", "We exceeded by 5.7 percentage points the industry wide growth rate excluding Walgreens as reported by IMS. ", "Net earnings in the third quarter were $522 million, or a decline of 8.8% from last year\u2019s quarter. However, this year included a $99 million pretax impact from costs associated with rewiring for growth, or $0.06 per share diluted. Offsetting that was about $0.06 per share diluted benefit from rewire. ", "In addition, the quarter included negative impacts of negative $0.01 per share diluted for the LIFO reserve versus year ago and a negative $0.02 per share diluted for interest expense above the prior year. ", "Gross profit in the third quarter was $4.5 million, a 5% increase versus the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was down 80 basis points in the quarter compared with prior year. Negatively impacting margins were front-end product mix, including LIFO, non-retail businesses, and CCR markdowns. Partially offsetting the overall margin decline was an increase in pharmacy margins resulting from generic drug sales. ", "Our focus on cost control continued in the third quarter as we recorded an increase in SG&A dollars of 8.4%, and just 7.4% if you take out the cost for rewiring for growth. On a two-year stack basis, SG&A dollar growth for the third quarter declined from 24.9% to 17.6%, primarily due to store salary and expense control. And as Greg showed you, slowing new store openings will reduce SG&A growth, as will the significant cost benefits resulting from rewiring for growth. ", "This chart summarizes the costs and savings for restructuring related charges through to the first three quarters of 2009, with a net cost to date of about $0.04. As we mentioned in our last call, because we accelerated some restructuring costs this year, we expect to be a few cents per share net negative. ", "Now, let\u2019s look at other highlights from our income statement. The LIFO provision was $32 million versus $16 million in the third quarter of 2008. We lowered our LIFO provision in the quarter from 2.25% to 2% due to lower-than-anticipated inflation, and you\u2019ll recall that last year\u2019s LIFO provision was roughly 1.25%. ", "Next are the $99 million in restructuring related costs, highlighted by $65 million in SKU discontinuation, $28 million in consulting and other costs, and about $6 million in costs associated with workforce reductions. ", "Net interest expense was $25 million compared with $2 million last year due to the issuance of $2.3 billion in long-term debt, and the effective tax rate was 36.4% compared with a rate of 37.3% in the year-ago period. ", "Now here you can see the components of working capital that we can most directly impact. Accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. Some of these as a percent to sales has improved by nearly 11% in the quarter, primarily due to inventory improvement. Total inventories were down $173 million, or 2.4% against total sales growth of 8% and a total drugstore growth of 9.7%. ", "Over the last four quarters, FIFO total inventory growth has ranged from plus 10% to flat in the most recent quarter. Adjusting for store growth, FIFO total inventories on a per store basis fell 9% in the most recent quarter. As you can see, we have made significant progress but of course we can always do more. ", "Our net cash position at the end of the quarter was $52 million, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and long-term debt of $2.35 billion. This cash position compares favorably with a net debt of $785 million at the end of the second quarter and a net debt of over $1.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. ", "Our financial strength and liquidity are in very good shape and our balance sheet should only strengthen as we continue to slow our store growth and prove inventory and drive cost savings over the next few years. ", "For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we invested $1.5 billion on additions to property, plant and equipment versus $1.7 billion last year, mostly for the addition of new stores. ", "We estimate capital spending for the full year to come in at about $1.8 billion, or slightly higher, about $400 million less than fiscal year 2008. ", "For fiscal year 2010, slowing store growth will result in lower CapEx for new stores but we will increase our investments for systems and other improvements in existing stores. In total, we anticipate next year\u2019s capital expenditure to be approximately $1.6 billion and we will be vetting the final number in the coming months. ", "Now let me say a little bit more about our cash flow performance. These graphs demonstrate the improvements in the cash that we have generated from store operations and inventory control. Our cash flow from operations in the quarter increased to $1.5 billion from $985 million a year ago, a 54% increase. Meanwhile, free cash flow for the quarter stood at almost $1.1 billion compared with $375 million a year ago, or nearly a three-fold increase. So I hope you can see the efforts we are making on cash flows are truly bearing fruit. ", "Looking forward, I am extremely optimistic about our future. We have many opportunities, such as leveraging the best retail network in America, driving CCR is only the beginning of our journey towards customer centricity and realizing the benefits of rewiring for growth. ", "Like any company, we have tailwinds and headwinds. Reimbursement pressure and economic uncertainty will undoubtedly provide challenges but winning companies can turn these challenges into opportunities, and we will. ", "For example, for healthcare payers, accessibility, cost efficiency, and better outcomes are the order of the day and we are well-positioned to step up and help. On the consumer side, growing companies with winning strategies and strong balance sheets can gain loyal customers in unprecedented ways during down economies and we intend to be one of those companies. ", "So I\u2019ll just close by saying we are committed to returning to double-digit earnings growth and improving ROIC as part of our overall plan to create long-term shareholder value, and I hope that I have conveyed this message to you today. ", "And now I will turn the call back over to Rick. ", "Rick J. Hans", "Cecilia, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first today to Mark Miller of William Blair.", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "Can you discuss what you think the impact to the P&L will be of the store remodels in 2010? So based on what you\u2019ve learned so far from the up-front expense from converting the stores compared to the benefits as they accrue, do you think it\u2019s reasonable to think that this will be a drag on EPS going forward?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Obviously we are finalizing the modeling for it. I\u2019ll give you a rough range. The rough range, we\u2019re probably talking in the order of $30,000 to $50,000 per store, doing the bulk of stores. Obviously the new stores coming out won\u2019t need to be done. There\u2019s some inner city stores that won\u2019t need to be done, so it\u2019s not overall a tremendously significant number. We are seeing lots of other benefits coming from CCR, so while there will be some cost and investment here, mostly expense, we also believe as we continue to go forward, we\u2019ll be getting benefit coming from rewire to help pay for that. And from CCR. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "Okay, but -- so net of it all, I mean, it sounds like there might be more expense as you go into this until you get more of a -- I guess accrual and the benefits, which come a little bit later?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, yeah, I mean, obviously the benefits come -- the benefits from the store remodels come after we\u2019ve remodeled but there\u2019s other benefits from CCR, such as the more efficient pricing, promotion, supply chain work that we are already starting to see and will continue to see. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "Okay. My other question is the comment was made about rewired being on pace for the $1 billion in annual cost reductions by 2011. There was no comment for 2010, so can you give us some update -- is that $500 million net savings number still a reasonable range or is that somewhat fluid?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We\u2019re absolutely on track. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "For the $500 million next year?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "For this year, next year, and the year after. ", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "Okay. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman of Canaccord Adams.", "Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams", "On the path to achieving double-digit earnings growth, and I don\u2019t know whether you think about it on just the one-year or two-year basis, can you talk about structurally where the expense dollar growth you think has got to go? And then related to where it was this quarter, I think on a two-year basis, 17%, does it continue on a straight path downwards or are there some spikes along the way?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think if I interpret the question, kind of try and understand where SG&A will go over time, you know obviously this quarter\u2019s SG&A, I think we made very good progress when you look at the number of store openings, which is the major driver. I guess what I would say is over this quarter and last quarter, we\u2019ve actually seen our established store base, our comp store base SG&A negative, so we are making tremendous progress and then over time we\u2019ll also overlay increased benefits that we get from the entire rewire initiative. So without giving a number, it should help you kind of factor into your model just how much of that SG&A is driven not only by store growth but also as we see the benefits fully come through, what we could potentially overlay on that. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think we feel good about where we are as far as rewiring and restructuring costs that we talked about earlier, but I also think we are doing a very good job on just an everyday operating model, with an operating structure within the stores, store operations groups are doing a very good job controlling expenses, and I think with the slowing of stores, as Wade said, we\u2019ll begin to see a pretty good improvement there. ", "Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams", "And with the slowing of stores, and I guess as you get closer to the end of CCR, [and I know I might be stepping forward] -- mid-single-digit expense dollar growth, you know, a good ballpark to think about? And then let me just throw out my follow-on -- markdown risk with CCR and the magnitude of that impact to gross margin, and then whether that\u2019s likely to accelerate as stores go by or is that something that is being done in the warehouse as well?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I\u2019ll take the CCR markdown and let Wade come back to the SG&A but one of the things that we are doing and one of the reasons you saw a little bit of margin compression this quarter was a lot of that is coming from early markdowns from CCR products. And what we did is we decided to move on some of those items early, to be able to sell them through at a higher margin than waiting late until we roll out the departments and then having to take more aggressive cut. So we\u2019ve been actually moving through a lot of that inventory over the last two or three months and taking advantage of normal traffic to discount some of those products at a more profitable price, so I think we\u2019ve moved through a lot of that inventory. We\u2019ve got some more to go through but a big chunk of that was what affected this month\u2019s gross margin. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "On the SG&A, you kind of referenced over time can we see kind of a mid-single-digits -- I would say that\u2019s very reasonable and perhaps [better]. ", "Simeon Gutman - Canaccord Adams", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley ", "Could you give us a little more detail on what we should be watching for in the healthcare reform in terms of generics, access for the public, margin compression that could come out of it? ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Mark, I think that as I say internally a lot, is that certainly healthcare reform, there\u2019s certainly some threats and there\u2019s opportunities. I think as the administration tries to provide more coverage for the 47 million uninsured, there\u2019s certainly going to be focus on costs and so we\u2019ll be focused on margin pressure and reimbursement pressure. But that\u2019s something that we deal with and have dealt with over the years. ", "I do think the opportunities are great as well. Certainly with coverage for more than 47 million Americans, there will be more prescription volume, just like we saw with Part D. I also think that the administration, one of the key principles is prevention and wellness and an understanding and realization that prescription drugs are a big part of that, so I think we have a great opportunity to play a part, as I said earlier, with access and affordability. ", "This weekend, you saw [Wil-Pharma] made some concessions to help with the donut hole in Part D. I think that\u2019s a positive. That will help seniors that have had been challenged during that -- when they hit the donut hole. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley ", "Is there any pressure on retail to make any concessions?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think that probably no more than what we\u2019ve experienced. Obviously I think that holding down costs, both on the medical side and prescription side, will be a focus. You know, we\u2019ve had some challenges in a couple of states as is out there, and you\u2019ve probably heard with Medicaid, but we think we have solutions and we think rather than rates, there\u2019s ways to improve generic compliance for states and really, really help improve the quality of the benefit they offer. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll go to Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good morning. Two things -- first of all, on the SKU reduction, can you just quantify how far along you are in that process?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I\u2019d say probably roughly, you know -- I\u2019m going to just guess the number, two-thirds. I\u2019d say we are more than halfway for sure. As Greg said, we\u2019ve been very aggressive early to clean up the pipes, if you will, just because A, it\u2019s obviously less expensive than waiting and B, I think it\u2019s enabling us to move faster and more quickly on the ultimate [inaudible]. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "So if you had to guess how far along you are in the markdowns necessary to accomplish that -- ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Two-thirds. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay. And then the second question is as you think about cash flow going forward and you frame this roughly $1.6 billion next year, the depreciation of the business I think is running around $1 billion. With store growth going towards 2%, do we ultimately get to where you are running around $1 billion of CapEx after we get through the incremental investments that the business needs to accomplish, rewire? How do you think about how that behaves going forward?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We haven\u2019t given obviously that kind of out guidance but I would say that\u2019s probably kind of a bottom threshold. If you consider three-ish percent store growth, the basic maintenance infrastructure that we need and then the basic distribution [of systems], that\u2019s kind of a rough floor, I would say. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay, and then if I could sneak one last one in -- in terms of the reset stores, the 35, you said that they are running ahead of plan. Can you just quantify what you are seeing out of those stores in regard to -- I guess really how you are evaluating them, if it\u2019s an expense, if it\u2019s a gross margin, if it\u2019s the sales, if it\u2019s a mix -- what you are seeing out of those stores?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think, Eric, you know, obviously it\u2019s too early to extrapolate and give any numbers on that. I will say that the two areas that we\u2019ve really been focused on in those 35 stores is the rollout period itself and what\u2019s the disruption of sales look like. We feel good there, that we are not -- that we are doing better than we expected, and as well as obviously the lift coming out of it. We feel good there, we are beating those metrics. But I do think the four wins that we talked about earlier, the improved sales, improved margin, the reduction in payroll and inventory is what we are absolutely focused on and we believe we are going to be able to achieve. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "You know, in the shopper feedback right, which ultimately the experience is coming back very positive as well. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Scott Mushkin of Jefferies.", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "Thanks for taking my questions. First, the store you show us, the transformation, was that -- did that cost $50,000 or is that more?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "What you will see on YouTube, that\u2019s kind of the general range. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "Thirty to fifty-thousand -- so you\u2019re not -- I mean, just to understand the process, because a lot of companies have done this and they have spent a lot more, it looks like a pretty radical change in the interior d\u00e9cor and what not. Is that not right?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No, you know, I think the best way to look at this, Scott, this really is what we would call a refresh of the store. You know, it\u2019s obviously the improved assortment, the optimization of SKUs, lowering the profile of the store and the [Gondola] height, so it\u2019s not -- you know, there\u2019s a lot that happens in that shot but it\u2019s really refresh. ", "Obviously the other thing we\u2019re looking for is as we roll through this, you know, our costs may be a little higher as we go into the first 35 stores but as we become more efficient with the process and the conversion, we expect to see even more efficiencies and therefore reduced cost. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "So [if you\u2019re going to keep going on the line], so if we say $40,000, you expect us to be about a -- and you are going to run none of it through CapEx, it\u2019s all going to be an expense next year, about a $300 million expense?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, a couple of things -- number one is, [I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s] 90-ish percent expenses, not all expense, obviously counting -- and separately we\u2019re probably not talking 7,000 stores. We\u2019re probably talking 5,000, 5,500, again because the new stores coming online are refreshed and are starting to reflect the new format, as well as there are some very unique stores we had in urban areas, small format, whatever that don\u2019t really lend itself towards this type of refresh. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "So -- okay, $200 million, $250 million, now is that net of the $500 million next year or is that -- or is it $500 million on top -- like, this is -- that expense is contemplated with the $500 million that we are supposed to get in savings?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "This is separate. The $500 million, you know, again is reflective of the rewire, so the SG&A reductions. The CCR program is separate with excluding the SKU reduction, which is also driving down labor, so you\u2019ll see this as a separate bucket of costs but we\u2019ll also have of course benefit associated with the CCR that we hope to outrun this by. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "Okay, so you don\u2019t expect a -- you expect the $500 million, we shouldn\u2019t have $200 million extra expenses here next year, just to clarify?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "The net $500 million is basically the net of the one-time costs associated with rewire and the SG&A benefits of rewire, right? ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "Right. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "It\u2019s effectively a separate program from this. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "Okay, so if I was going to do like a little [key] account though, I\u2019ve got $500 million there, I\u2019ve got $200 million offsetting it potentially, and then going to -- because you saw the mix, you guys cited mix as an issue with gross margin, that probably doesn\u2019t go away so how are we thinking about gross margins as we go into fiscal year 2010? I know Wade you had said before we didn\u2019t think going to the -- going more consumables would hurt gross margins at all but it seems to have this quarter and it was only in -- it wasn\u2019t in that many stores. So how are we thinking of gross margins next year?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think we had a little compression this quarter, obviously the but big factor here was really markdowns and LIFO. I think as most retailers saw, May was a bit more challenging month than we had the few prior months, so we are seeing a bit of a -- kind of call it a bit of a lagging market out there right now but I think we feel pretty good that we are taking lots of steps over time here, that despite perhaps changing mix, we\u2019re going to continue to drive the private label. They can be more efficient in terms of how we price and promote and I think that we\u2019ve got offsetting things that are going to help to stabilize and increase the gross margin over time. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Scott, I think we have to keep in mind too that obviously the benefits of CCR should help cover a lot of these costs as we roll it out and also, you know, one of the things that I think we are excited about, obviously private brands picking up quite a bit for us, as we talked about, but also with the work that [Ken Fyle\u2019s] done on our customer segmentation, I think we can become much more effective and efficient with our promotional strategy and drive more effective volume but at the same time, protect margins. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "One final one, thanks, and then I\u2019ll give it up here -- are you guys using third-party liquidators? And then Wade, if you can go over that LIFO thing again, because I think you said your LIFO rate was down but the money, the charge was up? I didn\u2019t actually fully understand that, so those two things -- third-party liquidators and LIFO, and I\u2019m done. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We\u2019re not using third-party liquidation at this point. We\u2019re really just trying to make sure that we market at an appropriate price and move it out on our own, so there might be some later but right at this point, we\u2019re not. ", "In terms of LIFO, it was down -- it was basically down for the -- the rate for the year was 225 but we dropped it to 2 in this quarter, but versus year-ago, it\u2019s up, so my number being up again was referencing 2% for the year versus 1.25 a year ago, but the being down was referencing the rate going into the quarter was 225 and we dropped it to 2. ", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies", "Thanks. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Meredith Adler of Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. I would just like to start with trying to figure out where the $0.06 of cost-savings showed up in the numbers, because you talked about an SG&A rate of 7.4%, or 7.3% but is that -- where are the cost-savings?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "You are getting cost-savings at several levels. You are getting it in the indirect spend bucket. You are getting it in headquarter, SG&A, you are getting in the field [inaudible], and you are getting it in the stores. You know, what you have to remember again is that our new store openings, right, on an established store basis, we were negative. Our new store openings were significant for the quarter versus year-ago. You\u2019ll see that number start dropping starting next quarter but again, if you were to take out the new store opening relating costs, you would have seen that we were in general probably slightly negative. ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Actually my question though was how are you recording the savings -- does it go into the SG&A line?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yeah, it\u2019s folded into whatever item it\u2019s in. ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Then I don\u2019t really understand why you gave us the actual number and the adjusted number if the adjusted number includes $0.06 of one-time costs and $0.06 of one-time savings -- doesn\u2019t that mean the reported number is the growth rate for SG&A dollars?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, I think what we are trying to do by showing the savings and the benefit is we are basically -- remember, recall we said at the beginning of rewire we would each quarter report what were the restructuring and one-time costs, things like reduction in forces, and we would also likewise report that the benefit we are starting to see, so you can track to that $300 million to $400 million over time and also track to the net flush 500 and $1 billion savings. So that\u2019s the only reason we are giving that. Obviously we\u2019re a company that\u2019s still driving GAAP but we want you to have the perspective of how we are tracking along that and we are folding all those expenses and all those costs into the lines that they belong in. ", "So we will cycle -- I mean, think of it this way -- the benefits that we are starting to see are going to keep recurring but we are going to cycle these one-time costs. So if you want to know what\u2019s more of a sustainable level, you could effectively take the costs out and see the trajectory that we are on. ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s helpful. Now a question about inventory -- how -- at what point do you think you have gotten to the inventory that you want to? You are two-thirds of the way down in the SKU rationalization. Is there any other inventory activity that will go on, either the distribution centers or related to CCR? Or when you get done with this category rationalization, you\u2019ll be done with reducing inventory?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think as Wade said, we\u2019ve still got some opportunity to go through with CCR markdowns but we are also focused on older inventory that we have in the system. We are also focused on better seasonal buying but the big thing, and the thing I am really excited about, is our supply chain initiatives and as you know, or may not know, I moved supply chain under Rainy Lewis from -- so he\u2019s managing inventories from the vendor to the customer, all the way through and I think we are going to begin to see incredible opportunity there that I am really excited about. We moved our forecasting folks under Randy and so forth, so I think we will see a lot of opportunity going forward in the supply chain initiative improvement. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Just to be totally clear, these costs that we are incurring now associated with rewire are really only those SKUs that are being discontinued permanently but there\u2019s -- you know, as Greg alluded to, there\u2019s lots of opportunity for us to keep improving overall inventory as a separate, ongoing structural initiative. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "We\u2019re working with our vendor partners in ways that we haven\u2019t in the past to provide a more seamless exchange from them to us. ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "That\u2019s great. And when you look at the categories that you have already rationalized, did you get a complete transfer of sales to other items in the category or was there any net loss of sales in those categories?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "For the most part, we are seeing a transfer and a pick-up in sales.  You know, we do have about 30-some of the first 40 categories rolled out. We\u2019re beginning to see some nice lift in several of those categories, so I think it\u2019s designed -- it\u2019s doing exactly what we had hoped to do, which is a better customer experience and increased lift. ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and I just have one final question -- when you think about all the opportunities, have you made any assumptions that the customer will be a little bit disquieted by the changes happening at the stores and that there could be an impact on sales? Or is the assumption in the early reads in the 35 stores that this is just a net positive?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Certainly we are surveying and getting feedback from consumers as well as the movement within the stores and Meredith, so far it\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve got good feedback. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve heard over the years is that we needed to lower the profile in our stores and I think this accomplishes that and I think that has absolutely been received well. And I think we aren\u2019t changing the stores so drastically that shoppers are confused as far as where items are and so forth. So so far, we have -- we are positive with what we are seeing. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "As Greg said, even though it\u2019s too early to call it a victory, certainly when we initially modeled this, we expected to see some substantial early dip just as shoppers get reoriented in the store and that comes back and increase over time but in fact, really not seeing much of that and we are seeing a very quick trajectory to increase sales. So apart from the anecdotals and the consumer and the survey data all being positive, we\u2019re exceeding the plan significantly both on the [dips] and on the ongoing, and so that\u2019s a very good sign. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "And that\u2019s why we built in a couple months pause here to go back and learn and understand before we roll out the next wave of stores. ", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Lisa Gill of JP Morgan.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan  ", "Thanks very much and good morning. I just had a couple of questions on the prescription side of your business. Greg, I think you made a comment that you were seeing better prescription volume than IMS. Could you maybe talk about where you think that\u2019s coming from? Are you taking market share from others? And then secondly, when you made the comments around generics being better, is there a particular drug or do you think as the seniors are starting to fall into the donut hole, that\u2019s what some of the driver is? And then thirdly, which would be around reimbursement, I know there continues to be pressure on the Medicaid side but are you feeling any pressure in the commercial market?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Maybe I\u2019ll start with the macro level a little bit -- I think that was your second question, Lisa. You know, I think as an industry, certainly we are rounding some softer comps from last year, so I think we are seeing a little bit of that but I also think we are seeing what we call Medicare Part D maturity where as more and more folks are becoming eligible for Part D, we are seeing more utilization from seniors. I also think that we are seeing, as I said, benefit design -- more benefit designs that make generic drugs more affordable and therefore more people are staying compliant and using the prescription meds. ", "As far as ourselves, you know, I think we are seeing two or three things. Again, we\u2019re rounding those softer comps as well so that\u2019s some of it but we are also -- we\u2019re also benefiting from the Medicare Part D effect and we are gaining share in the senior market. I think we are also seeing a benefit from some of the weaker competition in the marketplace. You know, obviously there\u2019s several struggling. And I also think our PSE card is attracting new patients and we are pretty pleased with it. ", "As far as pressure on margins, as I said, I think we\u2019ll continue to see, as we have in the past and have to manage that, I think what we need to do and will be doing is to help work with states and plans for ways to save costs that\u2019s just not rate-related. I think there\u2019s opportunity to still increase generic utilization. There are states out there that are not driving generic utilization to the rate that they can and there\u2019s huge savings there as we work with them. ", "So I think it\u2019s really more spending time with plans with states to help them understand how they can deliver great savings through other means. ", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan  ", "And any thoughts around wanting to be bigger in your PBM to help to try to drive some of those costs down through the programs that the PBM could offer?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think that as you\u2019ve heard us say, we want to be a greater and greater provider of services and provide greater value to all plans out there, all payers. I think that we are seeing a strong interest in the employer solutions model that we are -- that we have talked about, where large employers are looking for solutions to land health and wellness and pharmacies on their locations. I think that we are also seeing an opportunity for us to potentially be the back of the house, so to speak, for some of the plans that are out there. As you know, one of the large managed care organizations recently divested their PBM. I think there\u2019s folks out there that are looking at doing different things and I think everything from maybe outsourcing to provider services to potentially the entire PBM and I think we could -- we are going to be looking to see if there\u2019s opportunities there for us. ", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan  ", "So are you interested if one of the managed care companies look to do something like that, is that something -- ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "We want to be a provider and so what we are really interested in is being able to provide mail service, retail prescriptions, and specialty services to payers across the country. That\u2019s what I\u2019m really interested in, Lisa. ", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan  ", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go next to Debra Weinswig of Citi.", "Debra Weinswig - Citigroup", "Good morning. Greg, could you go through some of the details in terms of what you are doing to be proactive in terms of shaping healthcare reform in Washington? And then also with regard to CCR, could you maybe share with us some of the qualitative feedback from your customers?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Deborah, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time obviously in D.C. over the last several weeks and what I -- when I go out, what I intend to do is really three things; one, I want to get a better understanding of what the latest thinking is in some of the plans that are being made, and as you know it\u2019s changing daily sometime. But secondly, I want to position ourselves as an employer  as well and be able to talk about the fact that I want to continue to provide benefit, medical benefit to my employees because I think that\u2019s where real innovation happens, is in the private sector. And then I also talk a lot about what I believe we can do to help as a provider, and certainly I think that is along the lines of prescription drugs, I think that we have community pharmacists that can be utilized in greater ways and there\u2019s a lot of interest in how community pharmacists can be used going forward. And I talk a lot about our retail clinics, as you might expect, and there\u2019s a lot of interest in that model being able to provide access and lower cost acute care. ", "And I\u2019m encouraged, Deborah, by the opportunity that we can play and there\u2019s a lot of interest from the administration along those lines. ", "Debra Weinswig - Citigroup", "And then the -- ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "As far as CCR and qualitative, I think again our customer feedback has been good. Certainly we are early on and we\u2019ve got to do a lot more of that but again, I think based on the early metrics that we are seeing, we\u2019re pleased with the lift that we are seeing so far, we\u2019re pleased with the feedback we\u2019re getting. Obviously we are going to be doing a deep dive over the next couple of months and understand that better but so far, we feel pretty good. ", "Debra Weinswig - Citigroup", "And then on the CCR stores, has it been traffic or ticket or both that\u2019s been giving you the lift?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "It\u2019s been both. ", "Debra Weinswig - Citigroup", "Great. Well, congratulations and best of luck. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "And our final question today comes from John Heinbockel of Goldman Sachs.", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Greg, as you evolve CCR, the remodel here, do you think it will get tweaked or what\u2019s out there today is pretty much what you think you will go with as you go through the significant rollout?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Good question. You know, I don\u2019t -- other than -- unless we hear and get some feedback in the next couple of months before we start the next wave, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a lot of drastic change of any type. This is -- again, I\u2019d look at this as CCR is an opportunity to refresh our stores across our network and then I think obviously we\u2019ll begin to look at new concepts and new formats and different ways to improve upon that. You know, I\u2019ve been pretty public. I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us in select stores to create a new and unique beauty experience. I think there\u2019s opportunities to do some improvements upon that CCR refresh as we go forward but CCR in itself I don\u2019t see a dramatic change in the plan that we have today. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yeah, and I\u2019ll just say where the tweaking might occur is really as we go category by category by category, every single category, are we seeing the lift we thought, whatever. There might be a few categories that need some adjustment but in aggregate in terms of the overall layout, shelf life, planogramming, et cetera, we feel we\u2019re 90%-plus right on course. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Was the store of the future model too radical a departure? And in particular, I would have thought the Caf\u00e9 W would have a lot of promise. Does that just not have a good return profile as you go forward?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, I think the store of the future, John, was a good test for us and we -- there\u2019s some good learnings there and I think there are parts of that store of the future that we may be able to pull forward as we go forward. As you noted, the cosmetic department, there\u2019s some good learnings there from that. But I think it\u2019s far too soon to say that that is the new -- the store of the future for us. ", "And your second point was, John?", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Caf\u00e9 W -- it looked like that would have promise to do more soda fountain, coffee program, but is the return there? Is that the issue?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think with Caf\u00e9 W, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s based on the store. You know, we\u2019re doing well with it in select stores and I think there\u2019s an opportunity for us to have it in our future and again I think it will be based on store location and demographics. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Do you think that prototype store will lift pharmacy sales as well as the front-end, or it\u2019s mostly front-end driven?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "You\u2019re talking about the store of the future or the -- ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "No, the 35 pilot stores. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "You know, I think it will be both. Certainly if we attract new patients, new customers, we\u2019ll see lift. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then finally, what\u2019s the prognosis -- I know you mentioned state Medicaid a bit earlier. Washington went well for you, sort of well for you, compared to where it was. Are we going to have this -- sort of that -- is this going to be a recurrence where the states put out these very aggressive reimbursement targets and through litigation or whatever, we get dialed back to something more reasonable? Or are we going to sit at a reasonable level at the beginning?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "John, that\u2019s certainly hard to predict. I do think that we cannot fill prescriptions below our cost and we\u2019d much rather be filling prescriptions for Medicaid patients across the country and I think we will have to approach and take state by state based on how they go forward. ", "I do think that there\u2019s huge opportunity, like there was in the state of Washington and like we are doing with the state of Delaware for us to help states save cost in other ways. Generic utilization, as I said, and I think we\u2019ll be proactive, much more proactive going forward with states to help them design better benefits that help one, provide a better overall healthcare for their beneficiaries as well as reduce cost. ", "John Heinbockel - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. ", "Rick J. Hans", "Hey, Cecilia?", "Operator", "Yes, sir?", "Rick J. Hans", "We\u2019re not tired yet. We\u2019ll take another question. ", "Operator", "Okay, no problem. We\u2019ll go next to Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Thanks for taking another question. You know, I look at your gross margin this quarter and from a headline perspective, it doesn\u2019t look very good because of the costs for rationalizing SKUs. But underneath that, the trend of it is actually better than what it was last quarter. I mean, it\u2019s down about 23 basis points on a [inaudible] basis. It was 38 [ex the noise] last quarter. So as we think about the gross margin going into next year, clearly you start running up against some easier comparisons. What\u2019s the probably that we are able to at least get this line kind of flattish as we look to next year?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, I think everything you said is pretty astute. I mean, obviously we\u2019re focused on improving this over time. I would just say I think right now, you are seeing a bit of a transition phase. We\u2019ve got a lot of things going on. We\u2019re kind of, I call it changing the tires while the car is moving but still, we\u2019ve got traffic, even in this kind of tough economic year we\u2019ve got traffic increasing, which is very good. Again, we\u2019re making lots of changes to clear out the old stock, to refurbish stores. So I think obviously our goal is to increase this over time. We will be cycling an easier base period and I think that\u2019s important to note as well. ", "I don\u2019t want to predict exactly what it will be but certainly we are working on improving this over time and I think right now we\u2019re just in a bit of a -- of kind of a transition and mostly I feel very good that we are still again swinging the doors and driving sales in a pretty tough economic environment as well. ", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Great. And then Wade, on the inventory side, I know that you\u2019ve publicly said that you\u2019ve got a $500 million goal in terms of reducing inventory. It sounds to me like the body language is that maybe the potential is more -- is that fair? ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, we had originally said 500 associated with the SKU assortment work. You know, kind of call it the CCR rewire combined, but I think as Greg alluded to, that\u2019s really just one phase of what we are doing. It\u2019s really I think the supply chain initiatives changing how we work, you know, the broader systemic things that will provide additional benefit. We just haven\u2019t put a number out there yet. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Ed, I will say I\u2019ve never seen Randy Lewis so excited. ", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "And then a question for you -- I\u2019ve heard that you are thinking about adding liquor to the stores. Where do you stand right now in terms of assessing whether you are going to do that? How many stores do you sell it in today? How big could it be?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "We are looking at beer and wine, Ed, versus spirits. You know, we do have several markets now, the Southeast and the Southwest, where we still have full liquor. We\u2019re looking at beer and wine. We think there\u2019s an opportunity obviously to add that to our convenience goods. I don\u2019t know really the total number of stores yet. We\u2019re kind of in the early stages of it. ", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "And the stores where you do sell beer and wine, what percentage of the front-end sales does it typically account for?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "It\u2019s single -- small single digits. ", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Small single digits?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yeah. ", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then Greg, last question for you, I was just kind of hoping that maybe you could go back to that question on the PBN business and maybe just help us understand strategically how you are thinking about that business longer term. Do you need it to collect -- to connect the dots between specialty, the stores, the clinics? It sounds like you want to grow that business -- is that right? And it sounds like whether it\u2019s via acquisition or organically, you may consider that? And that to me seems like a bit of a change in rhetoric. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "No, Ed, I\u2019m glad you came back to that. No, I don\u2019t have a change in philosophy there at all. We want to be a convenient provider of all pharmacy and health wellness services to all payers and I think there\u2019s an opportunity to work even closer with the payer community, whether it\u2019s PBNs and/or managed care. And as we link our provider services together, I think that\u2019s where the real value is and I talk about that we are growing, we\u2019re building our specialty platform. Now we\u2019ve got the number on infusion platform across the country. We\u2019re growing our clinics, as you know. We\u2019re growing our employer on-sights across the country. As we link those provider services, there\u2019s where I think we can provide huge value to a payer and I don\u2019t believe we necessarily need to have a PBN to be able to do that. I\u2019d much rather would want to work with all payers to be able to bring those services to them versus link up with one or two in particular. ", "Wade D. Miquelon", "And one thing we like to say is, as you know, we had a PBN and whatever you call it,     it\u2019s the capabilities that underly it that we have and we continue to want to be very good at. So it\u2019ll be formularies, [inaudible] to claim support -- you know, it\u2019s really the capabilities that we are trying to drive versus the spread game or something else. That\u2019s where we are really focused. ", "Gregory D. Wasson", "And Ed, we\u2019re a major specialty provider for several managed care organizations across the country today. We provide mail service for several organizations across the country. You don\u2019t necessarily need to have that PBN to be able to do that and I think, as I said, the value that we think we can provide to help control medical costs is to integrate and link our provider services so we really provide value. ", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Rick J. Hans", "Folks, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. Remember we\u2019ll announce June sales on July 2nd. Also, because Yom Kippur falls on Monday, September 28th, we\u2019re accommodating those who are observing the holiday by moving our next quarterly financial announcement to Tuesday, September 29th.

Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rick Hans, Divisional Vice President of Inventor Relations and Finance.", "Rick Hans", "Welcome to our First Quarter Conference Call. Today, Greg Wasson our President and CEO will discuss the quarter\u2019s highlights, sales trends and the macro environment. Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will detail the first quarter financial results before we begin taking your calls.", "When we get to your questions, please limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can give an opportunity to as many investors as possible during our limited time. You can find a like to our webcast under Investor Relations at Walgreens.com. After the call this presentation will be archived on our website for 12 months. We\u2019re also making the call available as a podcast. You can download that too at our Investor Relations website.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of factors as they relate to forward looking statements. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Wasson", "Today I\u2019m going to review the highlights of this past quarter, update you on our sales trends, and provide the latest on the progress we\u2019re making on our three strategic initiatives.", "In the first quarter we reported record earnings and sales with solid double digit earnings growth, even in this difficult economic environment. We also continued to generate strong cash flow, a direct result of improved working capital, especially inventory, and drugstore performance. Net sales for the quarter were $16.4 billion up 9.5% over a year ago. Net earnings were up 19.6% to $489 million from $408 million a year ago. Earnings per diluted share were $0.49 a 19.5% increase from $0.41 per diluted share last year. This quarter includes the impact of $0.03 of restructuring and related costs.", "Cash flow from operations in the quarter more than tripled to nearly $1.2 billion from $312 million a year ago. Meanwhile, free cash flow stood at $864 million compared with -$326 million a year ago. This strong cash flow gives us the financial strength and flexibility to continue investments in our three core strategies. In the quarter we also increased our dividend by 22% and bought back $150 million of company stock under the stock repurchase program we announced in October.", "Looking at our sales in more detail, comparable store trends improved in the first quarter. An early flu season and a well executed flu shot campaign which started a month earlier then last year contributed substantially to the performance, especially in September and October. We saw some softening in November as this year\u2019s flu season declined and we faced tougher comparisons with last year\u2019s flu season.", "The quarter saw some challenges including a slow start to the holiday shopping season over Thanksgiving weekend, which dampened November sales. It\u2019s clear that consumer concerns about unemployment levels and the economic climate are weighing on spending. Consumers are focused on value and discretionary items are not high on their shopping lists. That led to the weak sales trends we saw in late November and that continued through mid-December.", "We entered the holiday season with lower inventory levels and with a focus on basics as we anticipate a cautious consumer. While we don\u2019t report December sales results until next month, we believe we will see good sell through on seasonal items. Like every Christmas season, our performance is driven by the final days, which makes this a big week. It could be more important this year as more consumers delayed their holiday shopping to last minute.", "The calendar works in our favor this year with Christmas falling on a Friday. That means the convenience of our more than 7,100 drugstores with over half the US population living within two miles of them, will make them ideal destinations for last minute shopping needs and as always our stores will be open on Christmas day.", "In addition to the final Christmas rush, we anticipate growing demand this week for H1N1 flu vaccine as additional supply is delivered. We\u2019re working with government agencies to obtain more H1N1 vaccine and we intend to have it available at virtually all of our pharmacies as soon as possible. Mobilizing our pharmacy staff for flu shots is a great example of how we are advancing the profession of pharmacy as a valuable resource on the front line of healthcare. Our pharmacists are going beyond the dispensing of medication to providing preventative healthcare services.", "Now I\u2019d like to update you on our three key strategies which are:", "Leveraging the best store network in America", "Enhancing the customer experience", "Achieving major cost reductions and productivity gains", "We continue leveraging our existing store base and growing market share even as we slow our new store openings. Over the past seven years, as the prescription market has grown 16%, we\u2019ve steadily grown our retail pharmacy market share from 13% in 2003 to 18.5% of all retail prescriptions today according to IMS Health Data. We see opportunities to continue that growth not only through organic store openings but also through comp store sales increases, prescription file purchases, and acquisitions that reinforce our core. An example of that is our recent transaction with Eaton Apothecary pharmacies in Boston\u00a0which is expected to close in January.", "As most of you know, one of our major initiatives is part of reinventing the customer experience is our customer centric retailing format, which is now in more than 400 stores in Texas. The stores have better sight lines, a new layout organized around customer solutions and an overall improved customer experience. We\u2019re pushing the CCR rollout a few weeks to the beginning of March so that we can also include our new store decor package with the conversion work. The decor package is an important piece of the overall CCR customer experience which we want to include in this next wave on conversions. We expect to meet our goal of nearly 3,000 stores converted to CCR by the end of fall 2010.", "Related to CCR our beer and wine rollout is now in nearly 1,600 stores. This category provides another reason for customers to shop in our stores. To sum up, CCR gives us a four way win. It helps us improve sales, it takes work out of stores, it reduces working capital deployed, and it provides a better customer experience with greater relevancy and efficiencies.", "As we reinvent the customer experience we are also transforming community pharmacy. We intend to create a new service model which our pharmacists focus more on the patient then administrative tasks. Transforming community pharmacy will improve service, quality, and efficiencies so that we can offer patients valuable new healthcare services that generate incremental revenue.", "As a first step, we implemented centralized pharmacy operations in Florida and Arizona and work to fully leverage our workload balancing system. These centralized operations made a significant impact during the fall flu season in Florida where our pharmacists provided more than 600,000 seasonal flu shots with virtually no additional payroll. Chain wide we provided more than 5 million seasonal flu shots this fall, up from 1.2 million for all of last year\u2019s flu season.", "As we expand from immunizations into other areas, we\u2019re taking our suite of health and wellness services to the marketplace by going directly to employers, government entities, managed care companies, and pharmacy benefit managers. ", "Let me be clear, our center of gravity is our community drugstores and this slide shows the depth of our national footprint of pharmacy, health and wellness services which include more than 7,100 retail pharmacies and pipeline of more than 500 already approved new drugstore locations, over 350 take care clinics, more than 380 worksite health centers on the campuses of major employers, more than 110 pharmacies located in hospitals, clinics and medical centers, especially pharmacy distribution network with nine locations, 5 institutional pharmacies, and more than 100 home infusion respiratory service centers. Finally, two state of the art prescription mail service facilities.", "This unique set of services allows us to tailor our offering to the needs of our clients. For example, we\u2019ve recently expanded our relationship with Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield for which we currently are provider, especially in home infusion services for their members. We now also offer Highmark employees access to worksite health centers and pharmacies at their Pittsburgh and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania office, creating a unique employer healthcare solution.", "What makes this important is that we are bringing more services directly to not only employers but also to managed care companies and PBMs. Our bundled programs are an example of how the private sector is innovating to make healthcare more accessible and affordable.", "Finally, we continue to make significant progress on our strategy to reduce costs and productivity. As you see from this chart, we achieved our goal this quarter of gross profit dollar growth exceeding our SG&A dollar growth. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion in annual savings in fiscal 2011.", "Looking ahead, we plan to build on the progress we\u2019ve made this quarter. We have the right strategy in place and remain very confident in our ability to execute it. At the same time, we are cautious in our view of the economy and will focus on consumers basic needs. In this environment we have an opportunity to drive our winning strategies while others may not have the resources to do the same. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet provides us with flexibility to invest in programs and opportunities for future growth.", "Meanwhile, in Washington DC, talks continue on healthcare reform bill. It certainly remains difficult to say what a final bill may look like but in general we support the Obama administration\u2019s guiding principles of improved access, greater affordability, and higher quality as part of any reform platform. The shift in focus to preventing and managing chronic disease by emphasizing health and wellness is something we intend to capitalize on. Our extensive network of community pharmacies and more than 70,000 health professionals position us on the front line of healthcare. Our pharmacists and nurse practitioners can have a positive impact on people\u2019s behavior through direct face to face interaction.", "Finally, I\u2019d like to thank three Board members who announced last month that they will retire from our Board of Directors at January\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. Cordell Reed and Marilou von Ferstel\u00a0provided invaluable insight and contributed greatly to the Board over many years. Charles R. Walgreen III, grandson of our founder, is retiring after 46 years of Board service.", "As we said in our annual report that many of you recently received, his legacy surrounds us. When he started with the company in 1952 we had 403 stores. By the time he retired as CEO in 1998 Cork expanded the company to nearly 3,000 stores. Along the way, he built a record of sustained success, provided huge career opportunities for thousands of people throughout the company, and established a culture of quiet determination.", "In October I really enjoyed the chance to be with Cork at the grand opening of our 7,000th store. He\u2019s provided amazing leadership and we\u2019re really going to miss him. Cork, we wish you, Cordell and Marilou the best in retirement.", "I want to thank all of our Walgreen team members for their contributions to these strong results as well. I also want to wish them and all of you a Happy Holiday Season! ", "Now Wade will give you an update on financial results for the quarter.", "Wade Miquelon", "Let me get into the details behind our financial results. In the quarter, net sales increased 9.5% while total comp sales rose 4.9%. Prescription sales rose 10% and represented 56% of sales for the quarter. Prescription sales in comp store rose a solid 6.1%. That was helped by a 1.1 percentage point from our flu shot program, a program which we led the drugstore industry.", "We filled 194 million prescriptions during the quarter, an increase of 12% from a year ago. That includes the benefit of 0.7 percentage points from patients filling 90 day rather than 30 day scripts. On a comp store basis a number of prescriptions filled increased 9.2% and that includes a benefit of 1.2 percentage points from 90 day scripts.", "We exceeded by 5.5 percentage points the industry wide pharmacy growth rate. Excluding Walgreen\u2019s as reported by IMS and that is in line with a trend over the past six months. As Greg mentioned, and I\u2019m pleased to report, earnings per diluted share were $0.49 in the quarter or $489 million including the impact of $0.03 in restructuring and related costs and $0.08 in savings associated with the company\u2019s rewiring for growth initiative. This reflects a 19.5% increase from $0.41 per diluted share or $408 million in the same period a year ago. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings per share would have been $0.52.", "Gross profit in the first quarter was $4.5 billion a 9.3% increase versus the year ago quarter. Gross margin decreased 10 basis points compared with the year ago quarter to 27.7%. Negatively impacting margins were front end product mix, non-retail business and CCR markdowns. Helping overall margins was an increase in retail pharmacy margins due to the impact of generics and flu shots, although those gains were partially offset by third party reimbursement pressure including the impact of ADP changes on Medicaid prescriptions. Also helping margins was a lower LIFO provision compared with the year ago quarter.", "The two year stacked SG&A dollar growth shows improvement compared with the year ago quarter, dropping from 18.6% to 16% and up from the fourth quarter two year growth rate of 14.1%. Clearly, as we cycle these comparisons it becomes more difficult to continue that pace of SG&A reduction. Given the inherent complexity of our business we want to provide you with a better understanding of the key drivers and building blocks of SG&A growth.", "Let\u2019s review those drivers in detail. First, store openings, which we anticipate at 4.5% to 5% this year, but on a four quarter moving average basis the store count will effectively grow 6% to 7%. This tempers the immediate benefit to SG&A of our slower store openings. Our four quarter moving average remains high and as you won\u2019t see a significant dip in that average until the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, at that point we expect to see some SG&A leverage from our slowdown in store openings.", "Second driver to keep in mind is inflation, which we expect to run about 2% to 3%. Third, acquisition and business mix SG&A is anticipated to increase about 1% to 2%. Fourth, CCR reset, as Greg mentioned, we plan to have nearly 3,000 stores converted by the end of fall 2010 and these are to cost of $30,000 to $50,000 per store. Then there\u2019s always a few other puts and calls in any quarter that takes place.", "Finally, while rewiring for growth is expected to provide a net benefit of $500 million the net benefit to SG&A is expected to be about $425 million in fiscal 2010. This chart summarizes the savings and costs for rewiring for growth restructuring charges since the initiative has started in last year\u2019s first quarter. Total rewiring expenses this quarter were $42 million. We anticipate approximately $140 million in rewire expenses in fiscal 2010. We remain on target for a net pre-tax savings of about $500 million this fiscal year and a net pre-tax savings of $1 billion in fiscal 2011 both versus our base of 2008.", "Now let\u2019s review some additional income statement details. The LIFO provision was $34 million versus $43 million in the first quarter of 2009 and that represents anticipated LIFO provision of 1.75% for the year. Its also lower then the 2% we anticipated heading into the quarter and a 2% that we recorded in fiscal 2009. ", "Next, for the $42 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, including $28 million in sku discontinuation, $7 million in consulting and other costs, and $7 million associated with workforce reductions. Net interest expense was $21 million compared with $15 million last year due to the issuance of $1 billion in long term debt in January 2009. Net interest expense benefited from a fixed rate to floating rate swap executed in July 2009 on the $1.3 billion note issued a year prior. The effective tax rate was 37% compared with a rate of 37.6% in the year ago period. We expect a tax rate of approximately 37% for the fiscal year.", "Accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable are all components of working capital that we can most directly impact. The net sum of these as a percent to sales has improved by 24% in the quarter, primarily due to inventory improvement. I should mention that accounts receivable benefited from timing issues this quarter. Even without that, receivables would have been virtually flat.", "Total inventories were down $800 million or 9.9% against total sales growth of 9.5% and total drugstore growth of 7.8%. Among other interventions we were helped by our sku rationalization program which is now roughly 80% complete. FIFO total inventories on a per store basis fell 13.7% in the first quarter. Controlling inventory continues to be a top priority and as you can see, we have made great strides over the past four quarters.", "Controlling inventory of course helps cash. Our net cash position at the end of the quarter was $773 million which compares favorably with net cash of $236 million at the end of the fourth quarter and a net debt of over $1.5 billion at the end of last year. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $3.2 billion and long term debt totaled $2.4 billion. We were also able to pay out $136 million in dividends during the quarter and buy back $150 million in company stock. Our financial flexibility and liquidity are in very good shape.", "Greg gave you the details on cash flow performance but this slide shows the comparisons and improvements in cash that we have generated from store operations and improved working capital. We plan to continue returning cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and buy backs and you will recall that our September dividend was 22.2% increase over the year ago quarter. In addition, we set a long term dividend payout target of between 30% and 35% of net earnings.", "As I mentioned, we also announced a $2 billion stock repurchase program at the same time. By the end of the first quarter we had repurchased $150 million in company stock under the program. You\u2019ll recall the plan was approved in mid-October has left us with a limited number of open trading days to make purchases.", "In closing, I remain very optimistic about Walgreen\u2019s future, with many opportunities as we focus on executing our core strategies. We will continue to drive growth both organically and through smart acquisitions including prescription file purchases. I emphasize smart growth because it\u2019s all built around prudent risk taking and ROIC focus designed to deliver long term shareholder value.", "To reiterate Greg\u2019s point, we are confident in our strategy and cautious about the economy. As we move through this uncertain economy, we continue to be agile and do what\u2019s right and drive smart decisions for both the short and the long term. Building on Greg\u2019s earlier comments, I also want to thank everyone at Walgreen\u2019s for all of the accomplishments this quarter. It would not have been possible without all of our team member\u2019s efforts. We thank them for that and we wish them and you a Happy Holiday Season!", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "You have the number of about $425 million in net benefits for rewire and previously you\u2019d been saying $500 million isn\u2019t that correct and is there something that\u2019s changed there to bring that number down?", "Wade Miquelon", "No, obviously its $500 million net benefit year to year but we wanted to is point out that if you do the reconciliation of where one time costs have gone because some of those one time costs go in items like COGS but the SG&A impact if $425 million. The total impact in terms of P&L is $500 million. We can give you the detailed breakdown of again where the benefits are coming through and where the costs, then you can do the reconciliation from SG&A to COGS and other.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In your mind there\u2019s zero change in the way that you\u2019re looking at this or in your expectations?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, there\u2019s zero change. As we give the detail on the P&L line items thought I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever done a clear reconciliation of exactly how the difference hits the various lines and that\u2019s what we want to do here.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "The cost savings in general, obviously you continue to progress towards realizing more cost savings on a quarterly basis. How should this flow for the year is this something that takes place sort of fairly even or it will continue to build each quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "A little bit, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s always going to be a little bit lumpy because different initiatives are time for time. Things like inventories clean out when they clean out and the other ones depending on when they\u2019re announced or when they\u2019re planned they can have different impacts. Yes, it\u2019s going to build but I wouldn\u2019t say it was perfectly linear. We can\u2019t always even predict it exactly because of the timing of certain events.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "As we think about the gross margin, how should we be looking at this line item for the rest of the year? You got some benefit this quarter from the flu shot. Comparisons ease quite a bit over the next couple quarters, is it unreasonable to think that your gross margin should be up for the year?", "Greg Wasson", "Obviously we\u2019re going to continue to see a cautious consumer that\u2019s going to be looking for non-discretionary products and more value. We\u2019re also going to be countering that reimbursement pressure on pharmacy. I do think obviously where we\u2019re going to try to counter the margin pressure obviously will be to drive more private brand. I think there\u2019s more opportunity in pharmacy to drive more services such as seasonal flu. We\u2019re definitely going to continue to see a cautious consumer. I think that it\u2019s tough to predict right now.", "Ed Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On the share repurchase side, I know you touched on it; I was a little disappointed I thought the number would be higher. What should we expect going forward do you think?", "Wade Miquelon", "As I alluded to, we actually didn\u2019t have a lot of days from the time we announced the program to where we weren\u2019t in blackout. I think given that, actually $150 million was pretty good. I don\u2019t know exactly, I hesitate to through a number out there but I can say we certainly, $150 million doesn\u2019t reflect that we weren\u2019t confident in buying our stock back, it was really just a matter of number of trading days we had available.", "We are, by the way setting up a 10B-5 so that we\u2019ll be able to be able to purchase even when we are in blackout systemically through the rules of that program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "If you could just talk a little bit about the discounting environment on the front end right now, it sounds like the sales are a little softer and I\u2019m curious if that has spurred more discounting?", "Greg Wasson", "I think that certainly there a lot folks out there driving promotions and I think we\u2019ve seen softer seasonal sales then we had last year. I think as far as the promotions we\u2019ve been and will remain pretty surgical on where we\u2019re going with markdowns and promotions. I think the good thing is that we anticipated a softer season, bought down in seasonal goods last year. I think we\u2019re in better shape so we won\u2019t need to be as aggressive in markdowns post-holiday. ", "Last year, quite the opposite happened we had to be aggressive; we had a lot left over. I think we\u2019re going to be extremely surgical about where we go with markdowns, additional promotions and try to balance that with swinging doors.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "All the commentary on the SG&A components, are you trying to tell us that investors have gotten a little ahead of you on expectations on the SG&A reduction, a little signal that 2010 is a little to high right now?", "Wade Miquelon", "We\u2019re completely confident in the savings we\u2019re going to deliver. If some of these components, I\u2019m not sure that everyone has the same understanding and clarity of the different building blocks of how we get there. For example, when you think about the impact of SG&A on new stores it\u2019s not the number you do for the year it\u2019s the 12 year impact that you cycle and that\u2019s considerably higher. You\u2019ve got all the building blocks now to do the math but again making sure that people have the understanding and the clarity of what goes in there I think is important so that over time people can see the direct impact of the rewire initiative and how it flows through.", "Greg Wasson", "We feel pretty good about the job we\u2019ve done in the past four quarters with store SG&A and our store folks have done a tremendous job. Certainly we\u2019re going to be copying those tougher quarters going forward.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Is there any way you can quantify how big the AWP hit was on gross margin this quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "It was about $25 million so that range.", "Greg Wasson", "It was pretty much in line with our forecast that we had given for the year. We\u2019re watching it monthly but so far it\u2019s pretty much what we predicted.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Can you talk a little bit about how the reset store strategy is evolving, you talked today about the decor and pushing it into March, can you talk about how that whole thinking is progressing?", "Greg Wasson", "Certainly we started off with the 35 pilot stores, we\u2019re able to compare performance of those versus the control stores that we had set up, and we\u2019re still feeling good about how they\u2019re performing versus control. The next phase was to go Houston and Dallas, roll out mass markets which we completed about mid-October. The learning\u2019s there was one, how do we roll this out in a mass market versus individual stores around the country. I think a lot of good learning\u2019s came out of that to help us improve that process and reduce the costs of the rollout itself.", "We\u2019re still analyzing obviously numbers coming out of Dallas and Houston to look at maybe if there are opportunities to improve before we roll out in March. The real reason for delaying it the two weeks into March is we do want to add the decor package. It didn\u2019t make sense for us to start a rollout before that new decor package was finalized. I actually saw it Saturday we got good results on it; I liked what I saw so by March 1 we\u2019re rolling out both the conversion as well as the new decor package in parallel.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "The addition of the decor package changed the costs or the time to implement meaningfully?", "Wade Miquelon", "No, they\u2019re always factored into the costs and it pretty much done in parallel. Again, making sure that we have it right is important to the overall proposition.", "Greg Wasson", "It was included in the $30,000 to $50,000 cost that we\u2019ve been talking about.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "As the data has moved on with Houston and Dallas, what have you learned? I think you talked about maybe a comp improvement you needed of a point or two to make the math work. Can you talk about how that\u2019s going?", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019re still analyzing data. The only thing that kind of threw a kink in it is we probably wouldn\u2019t have picked Houston because comping on hurricane there so it\u2019s been kind of difficult to get apple to apples numbers. I think the key learning\u2019s that we\u2019re really addressing, looking at is again we\u2019re looking at sku by sku did we take out some skus that maybe we needed to add back. We feel good with the 3,500 items that we have reduced. I also think what we want to do is look at local unique stores.", "For example, this has worked well in the majority of our stores that are pretty much according to prototype. When we began to look at maybe Hispanic stores, African American stores, maybe beach stores, and so forth, the uniqueness there is what want to now address. We\u2019ll have more data and I think hopefully by our next quarter call we\u2019ll be able to share more. I think we\u2019ll have a good two month to drive through the data and analyze it and give you more color on the next call.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "On the beer and wine rollout can you give us any sense on is the comp benefit from that material and how\u2019s the profitability of that influenced the overall store?", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019re in about 1,600 stores now. The comp benefit will be material. We think that not only will it drive sales but also it\u2019s a nice basket item, it drives basket size as well. As far as the margin, we\u2019re really working through the mix now as far as what we hope to obtain. We\u2019ve got a private label wine that we just launched that has a little higher margin we feel good about. We\u2019ll know more about that as well as we come through the season.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ann Hynes \u2013 FTN Equity", "Ann Hynes \u2013 FTN Equity", "Can you give us some more details around H1N1, what is your internal expectations, how many flu shots do you think you\u2019ll receive, and I guess the economics? I\u2019m assuming that you get the flu shots for free and you\u2019re just charging an incremental charge to administer it. How should we look at that in the coming months?", "Greg Wasson", "It\u2019s kind of hard to predict because we\u2019re really working with obviously the government and the individual states. Most of the states at this time have worked through what they call the priority high risk population and how they\u2019re opening distribution up to the pharmacies across the country. We have provider agreements in 49 states excluding North Dakota. We have product in about 3,000 stores in 36 states today. We\u2019ve given about 350,000 H1N1 vaccinations to date. ", "We\u2019re depending on how the states begin to open up and utilize pharmacists across the country. We think they will and we\u2019re working with the states and the government to make sure that they understand how we can help.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Not to be simplistic but on the SG&A side if I\u2019m hearing you correctly we should be looking for the type of differential over the next couple of quarters. I know that year to year comparison is good, maybe a little bit tougher but on a two year basis it looks actually fairly flat. The improvement we saw this quarter is it fair we should assume that\u2019s a good proxy for the next couple of quarters?", "Wade Miquelon", "You\u2019ve got to run the model out quarter by quarter and put in the timing of how that store lag happens like I said, things like the CCR initiative is almost all SG&A contract labor resetting stores so when those stores hit and things like that. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little more complicated then that but in general you\u2019re probably not too far off.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "On the pharmacy side you talked about the AWP hit. I\u2019m assuming some of that concept better dispensing fee in certain states. Any other positive offset to that we can look forward to as the year goes on?", "Greg Wasson", "We are working state by state to try to get improved dispensing fees and that\u2019s certainly something we\u2019re focused on. I think the things like improving our generic penetration rate to help offset it. The services we\u2019re talking about with flu shots and so forth that we\u2019re going to rolling out will help offset some of that. We\u2019re also looking at taking out supply chain costs as well and operating costs with our transforming community pharmacy initiative as well as our supply chain efforts to try to offset it.", "David Magee \u2013 Suntrust Robinson Humphrey", "Will generics be enough positive or negative this year, we have another kind of light year ahead of us here and I\u2019m just wondering how the profitability levels will beef that product anyway?", "Greg Wasson", "Obviously we\u2019re not going to see another big wave until the latter half of 2010-2011 on generics. At the same time, we work to improve our utilization or penetration of generics of the existing generics as much as we can.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I\u2019d like to just go back and talk a little bit more about Medicaid. The states all have pretty significant budget problems. Do you think that they\u2019re looking at the AWP cut as maybe sufficient for them to cut their Medicaid reimbursement or are you expecting that there could be another round of cuts as they try to balance their budgets?", "Greg Wasson", "It\u2019s hard to say, it varies state by state. I think some of them may see the reduction as sufficient. Some, depending on the state, may be looking for more. We\u2019re going to have to certainly work with each state individually and try to bring them other solutions to help reduce costs. Believe me; we\u2019ve got to focus on each individual state today.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "The states generally don\u2019t do much to incent patients to fill with generics. Is that changing, are they getting more understanding about the benefit of that?", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019re working with them to help them understand that for every x% in generic utilization there\u2019s x% savings. I think us getting state Medicaid directors and helping educate them and look for alternative solutions is exactly where we\u2019re going.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "About AMP, can you give us an update about where that stands? Is that going to be put into place?", "Greg Wasson", "It\u2019s awfully hard to predict what comes out of healthcare reform. Certainly with the Senate probably passing something its looks like they\u2019re passing something before the holiday. There is AMP legislation and language in both bills. We feel good about the new definition of AMP how the benchmark is established and we\u2019re obviously looking make sure we get enough of a multiplier on top of that AMP to make sure the pharmacists can afford to continue to serve Medicaid patients across the country.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Obviously the flu shot program by any measure has been a huge success. What do you learn from this you can apply to potentially other initiatives internally? Have you done any analysis around the retention rate of the new customers?", "Greg Wasson", "The first thing tells me and tells us is that this is a great illustration that consumers across the country value the convenience and access that community pharmacists can bring in addition to prescription drugs. For us to administer better then 5% of the nation\u2019s seasonal flu shots I think basically indicates that. As far as the learning\u2019s I think certainly there are ways that now if we go into next season we\u2019re going to be able to improve the process as far as some of the administration work and so forth at patients come in.", "I think as far as new services, there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to do more script like services in our community pharmacies such as flu shots. Retention rate, I think we saw that about 40% to 42% of the flu shot patients were new to Walgreen\u2019s. We won\u2019t know the retention probably for another 30-60-90 days certainly that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be analyzing to get a better understanding of that. Once we do know then next year we can certainly work to make sure that we have good programs out there to improve that retention rate.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "In terms of power, can you talk about the savings; obviously it\u2019s just been a few markets that have been driven so far by the initiative. How should we think about a rollout plan?", "Wade Miquelon", "The big idea here we call it is transform community pharmacy of which power as you know is one initiative, there\u2019s other things; dynamic work load balancing, some of the reengineering efforts we\u2019re doing. So far so good in power. As you know, we\u2019re strong in two states now and Florida is over 10% of our business. We\u2019ve rolled out now in Arizona, Phoenix. So far, so good. We\u2019re seeing, again good customer service levels now, we\u2019re seeing more importantly a lot of time freed up for other things. ", "In Florida in flu shots we gave 15% or more of our total flu shots in Florida with out adding any overtime pay. Honestly that would not have been possible or even remotely possible without the power initiative to pull some of that transactional work out. We feel very good about it. Again, its taking a shorter time to fill pharmacy and wait times is one of the key elements of success so that\u2019s helping as well. We feel good about it and we feel that both the front end and the central fill have broader applications across the country.", "Greg Wasson", "With transforming community pharmacy there\u2019s really kind of three buckets there that we talk about. One is what we\u2019re doing within Florida and Arizona with centralization of some of these tasks that Wade just mentioned. The other is we\u2019re continuing to leverage the dynamic workload balancing technology and systems across the entire nation to leverage excess capacity at some stores to help others. Third, really we\u2019re just going back into the existing pharmacies and looking at the complete work flow and the work process that takes place, continue to work to find ways to improve processes and take costs down.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Can you talk about traffic and ticket in the quarter and were there any real differences by month?", "Rick Hans", "Could you repeat the question?", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "Can you talk about traffic and ticket in the quarter and were there any real differences by month?", "Greg Wasson", "We\u2019re seeing traffic hold pretty good. We\u2019re up in traffic. We are down a little bit in ticket. Our units per customer are running a little bit down. Therefore, we feel good that we\u2019re swinging doors, people are coming in. That goes to the promotional point that we don\u2019t really need to over promote people to get inside. The real focus now is driving and working basket size and units per customers.", "Wade Miquelon", "Even though our traffic has been robust as Greg suggested over the quarter it was a bit heavier in September/October driven by the flu shot traffic. Still even as today we still feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "You guys redid your distribution contract with Cardinal. How much did that help in the gross margin in the November quarter?", "Greg Wasson", "That\u2019s been over a year ago I guess at this point in time. Certainly we worked with Cardinal, they\u2019re our main supplier and obviously we feel like we\u2019ve got good costs and a good rate with Cardinal but we don\u2019t give that out.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "When you talk about your gross profit savings as part of your $1 billion, is that the sku rationalization or how should we think about that?", "Wade Miquelon", "You mean the $1 billion CCR initiative?", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "You said you broke it out, its not all SG&A, part of it is gross profit, and could you talk a little more about the gross profit savings?", "Wade Miquelon", "The rewire for growth initiative which will have ultimately $1 billion benefit. In the short term some of the one time costs are in things like SG&A, consulting fees and reduction in force, etc. A lot of the one time costs are in cost of goods for inventory write downs due to sku elimination and the like. It\u2019s the timing of the one times in cost of goods year on year that means that defacto all of this doesn\u2019t flow net to SG&A. We can give a reconciliation table but you\u2019ll see year by year benefit and year by year costs and some of those costs end up being in SG&A and some of those costs end up being COGS and some end up being in other. You have to reconcile each one of those to know where the net impact shakes out.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Once you work through this short term is there any cost savings in your gross profit line long term or is it all going to be in SG&A once you get through?", "Wade Miquelon", "It\u2019s going to be in SG&A.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "There was a pretty big cancer injectable drug that went off patent in August, Eloxatin. Just to clarify, through your specialty you\u2019re not really participating in any of the oncology market. Is that a market that you\u2019re looking at long term?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, we are in the oncology space and we anticipate playing a bigger role in oncology going forward. Frankly our infusion platform that we have built over the last couple years with Option Care positions us extremely well to play in oncology going forward because a lot of those drugs are not only injected but infused drugs. We definitely think we can put together a unique service model to work with both payers and pharmaceutical companies that are in the oncology space.", "John Ransom \u2013 Raymond James", "Sequentially in the February quarter as the flu shots slow down just isolating the flu shot in your gross margin in the November quarter going into the February quarter how should we be thinking about pulling that out in the February quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "There are a lot of different puts and calls. Obviously we had the basic flu in this quarter and then next quarter we\u2019ll have some H1N1, how much remains to be seen. Those are effectively helps because of margin and how that flows through. We also have some other things like reimbursement pressure which might have slight different timing quarter to quarter. Again, it\u2019s probably a little bit too early to say how all those will flow through exactly especially because H1N1 remains a little bit of an unknown for now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Did I hear you say you expect good sell through for Christmas? If I heard you right, is that more driven by the lean inventories or the day fall or do you have some history that says when there\u2019s a big snowfall with this kind of timing its going to force people to stores as well.", "Greg Wasson", "This is the time of year when a retailer becomes a weatherman. I do think that based on our position going in that depending on how this last week certainly comes together I feel pretty good as far as where we\u2019ll be on the amount of seasonal left over that we have to reduce. Last year, as I said, I think it\u2019s an opportunity for us, last year all retailers out there certainly were in a position with some pretty large carry over quantities. I guess a combination of where I believe we are this year depending on how this last week comes through and as compared to last year I think there\u2019s opportunity there for us.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Can you remind me, did you make a concerted effort last year to reduce the pack away? Really take some margin hits.", "Greg Wasson", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019d say out philosophy had changed much. We had always had a pretty aggressive markdown where we\u2019d go 50% maybe throughout the season and then depending on the quantity of the item we have a pretty sophisticated system that it will help us determine what that markdown needs to be is it 50%, do we need to go to 75%. Based on last year\u2019s inventory level we were in many cases on the more aggressive end of that markdown program. Nothing\u2019s really changed as far as our carry over, our pack away program.", "I think this year, as I said; we\u2019re in a better position so I\u2019m not as concerned about the aggressive markdowns that we took last year.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Could you update us more on the direct to payer initiatives that you started and I think you just briefly mentioned it? Maybe could you quantify maybe the number of folks you\u2019re talking to or proposals on the table, what kind of expectations you might expect to see for closed deals similar to the ones you had with Caterpillar in maybe the next year or so?", "Greg Wasson", "I want to clarify, when we talk about going direct to employers, managed care organizations PBMs we\u2019re talking about going direct with all of our services. I think if you go back in time five or 10 years ago when the industry was a little more fragmented it was a little more difficult for a drugstore chain to go direct to an employer, direct to a managed care organizations organization. Today with our suite of services we have everything that an employer or managed care organizations organization would like to take to their clients. ", "We\u2019re talking about going direct, especially going direct with retail pharmacy programs. Our worksites are now what I would say becoming more of an employer healthcare solution to take to employers as well as managed care organizations. We\u2019ve got a robust pipeline. If you look at the employer healthcare solution model there are a lot employers that are interested in trying to figure out how to control their healthcare costs while improving the quality of health for employees there\u2019s a lot of interest in that product.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "The Texas stores the cost to do that is that in part of the $42 million the restructuring or is that in addition to or was the captured in previous quarters?", "Wade Miquelon", "The cost of all the CCR refurbs is not included in the one time costs so it\u2019s a separate initiative. This $30,000 to $50,000 per store is mostly SG&A. For the Texas area we don\u2019t have the refurb package in yet and that will be coming, the refresh package will be coming on the next wave of all stores.", "Andrew Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Was most of the work completed the quarter you just reported or split with the prior quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "A little bit split.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "If you look at what you\u2019re seeing from the consumer do you think they have slowed down their spending here in the last month and a half or do you think you guys as a channel are getting crowded out by mall based retailers as people go back and spend on those types of products such that post-Christmas you don\u2019t get credit out as much?", "Greg Wasson", "I do think that it\u2019s the macro consumer in general. I think they are indeed spending less on discretionary and I think that includes seasonal this year. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve being crowded out, I think what we are seeing for the past several seasons whether its Halloween, Back-To-School, or Christmas we are seeing shoppers that are becoming more and more last minute. That\u2019s the reason we said this week obviously is important week for us because I think we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of those last minute shoppers.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "When you think about the consumer, if that\u2019s the case then January is not going to be a lot different then December, when you think about the consumer getting healthier do you think your comps outside of CCR and beer and wine your comps will basically keep pace with the labor market and unemployment and that\u2019ll be the tell tale sign for an improvement in comps?", "Greg Wasson", "I do think that post the Christmas holiday season there are a lot of non-discretionary purchases with seasonal goods. I think once we get through the holiday we should see less of an effect on pure seasonal merchandising and the effect it has on our comp.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "As part of the CCR retool with the decor package are you making any other changes to departments whether it be cosmetics or it\u2019s basically just the decor?", "Greg Wasson", "With CCR, one is basically the refresh that we\u2019re talking about in Houston and in Dallas and the addition of decor package, that\u2019s pretty much as is. We are looking at certainly the modifications, maybe the changes that we learn regarding skus and so forth as I mentioned earlier. We are indeed looking at additional opportunities to improve the format whether its in beauty, whether it\u2019s in expanded food and beginning to look at pilots and a better understanding of how we can improve the experience and become more relevant to the future shopper.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "That could be part of CCR 2011?", "Greg Wasson", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it part of CCR. I think CCR you\u2019ll see CCR-2 which will be just continued modification improvement of the refresh that we have out there now. I think some of these others I\u2019m talking about would be bigger format changes as we understand how we can leverage that footprint that we have now in areas like beauty, food, and so forth.", "John Heinbockel \u2013 Goldman Sachs ", "The CCR cost, how much of that is incremental as opposed to what you normally would have spent? Secondly, you guys now have $3 billion plus of gross cash, how do you think about doing something with that, obviously you\u2019re not earning much in the bank?", "Wade Miquelon", "The CCR costs, effectively almost all of it is incremental. Its really because of the nature of how we\u2019re executing it, we\u2019re doing it very quick, we\u2019re using onsite crews and things to make sure we have minimal disruption in our stores. Again, we\u2019re hoping the benefits of CCR help close to pay for this thing on the run. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve positioned and talked about that. Again, I think in terms of the size of the investment its actually pretty miniscule investment relative to the impact that we get from the stores and expect to get.", "On cash, we\u2019ve laid out our cash priorities. Obviously it\u2019s not great having money in the bank earning almost no interest but we also want to be very smart and very ROIC driven. Just because we\u2019re generating cash doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to feel compelled to doing something that doesn\u2019t earn a good robust return for the company and for the shareholder.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "I wanted to go back to the CCR in Houston. Is that helping or hurting sales? I know we didn\u2019t answer what its moving comps up by but do you guys view it as helping sales at this stage or hurting?", "Greg Wasson", "As I said earlier, it\u2019s a little too early to tell. With some of the variables that we\u2019ve got thrown at us right now as far as the season and the hurricane comping in Houston. Believe me, we\u2019ll have better insight by the next call and be able to feel a little bit better about where we are what kind of numbers we are seeing.", "Wade Miquelon", "Note that all these stores always had a planned dip just from the initial, not shut down, the work going on. We\u2019ve modeled what that planned dip is. In most cases we\u2019re doing better then the planned dip. Still there is a structural bend as you get into this initially.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "I also had a question on the decor package. My impression being down in Houston was you actually did switch the decor package and so as to say another switch of decor or just a clarification there?", "Greg Wasson", "When we went it we gave a refresh to the existing decor package which was minimal in cost. What we\u2019re looking at rolling out in March is a complete new decor package with different graphics and so forth.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "Talking about the dip, as we do 3,000 stores, any magnitude there of what kind, is it mostly front end or how do we look at the dip?", "Wade Miquelon", "Mostly front end. We haven\u2019t given a number but its something two or three weeks come out of it then go positive. I don\u2019t think its going to be that material that I would worry too much about it.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "One final thing on SG&A, is your thought process here, I think you said that 7% to 8% growth range that would seem to be a little bit above where the street was and could take your earnings down below the 240 level, the street I guess is down there. Is that how I should be looking at this?", "Wade Miquelon", "The reason we give clarity on SG&A first and foremost was just because we wanted to make sure that we maintain transparency and credibility with you and all of our stakeholders in terms of these rewire for growth benefits so that people can see that they actually are being delivered. Again, because there\u2019s lot of moving parts in that SG&A and in some cases lack of clarity of how new stores, the rolling average how that impacts whatever there is a wide range out there in terms of how SG&A is modeled. ", "That I think is really the key thing that we wanted to focus on with this is to make sure people understood how they should look at SG&A, how can they have confidence over time that in fact these rewire savings are being delivered as committed.", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "Consulting fees in the quarter, what were they?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think it was about $7 million", "Scott Mushkin \u2013 Jefferies", "That\u2019s coming down nicely", "Wade Miquelon", "Clearly over time I think we feel we did the right thing by getting lots of outside help. In fact, a lot of what we\u2019ve been doing is changing the tire while the car is moving and our people are working very hard in their day jobs. The additional capability has been helpful so that we can keep running the business. Clearly over time we\u2019ve got a lot of great people and we\u2019d like to be much less reliant upon that and much more dependent upon our great people.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn it back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rick Hans", "That was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. We\u2019ll announce December sales on January 6th. Please note that reflects our new schedule of announcing monthly sales on the third business day of the month rather than the second business day.

We won't be providing specific details regarding the economics of the deal, but I would say that we are very pleased with the outcome.", "The agreement provides the framework we need to operate our business going forward, which is also good for patients or pharmacists and shareholders. We look forward to continuing to meet the needs of patients and payers across the country. We're also looking forward to building a mutually beneficial relationship with CVS Caremark and other PBMs.", "Now let's move to the quarter. As you saw from our press release this morning, Walgreens reported record sales of $17.2 billion in the quarter, a 6.1% increase over the last year. Third quarter net earnings were $463 million compared with $522 million in the same quarter a year ago. And we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion fiscal year-to-date.", "Our reported EPS of $0.47 included $0.04 in costs resulting from the Medicare Part D tax charge, $0.02 from the impact of our Duane Reade acquisition and $0.01 from our Rewiring for Growth initiative. Net sales for the nine-month period grew 6.1% to $50.6 billion, and net earnings were up 3.2%.", "We anticipated that this would be a challenging quarter for several reasons. First, the weak economy continued to impact discretionary spending. Second, we faced prescription reimbursement pressure compounded by slower period in relative introduction of new generics. And third, we were cycling last year's high incidents of H1N1 flu, which impacted prescription comps by more than 1% in the quarter.", "While we planned for these headwinds and saw a number of positive signs in the quarter, we also believe there is more we can do. Let me touch on some additional highlights of the quarter.", "We filled a record 198 million prescriptions and increased our market share to nearly 20%. We made significant progress on our Customer-Centric Retailing initiative, opening or converting 500 stores. We closed on our acquisition of Duane Reade and began the integration to drive the expected benefits and synergies.", "We continued on track with our cost control initiatives. We took steps to directly address some of the reimbursement pressure we're experiencing. And we restructured the healthcare division to bring new and unique pharmacy, health and wellness solutions to the market.", "Now let's take a more detailed look at the quarter. This slide provides a good snapshot of the quarter's performance relative to recent trends. During the third quarter, gross profit dollars increased by $290 million or 6.5%. SG&A dollars increased $307 million or 8.6%. It's important to note, without Duane Reade, gross profit dollars grew 3.2% and SG&A dollars grew 6%. This rate of growth is near the low point of our SG&A dollar growth over the last six years.", "And even at this low rate of SG&A dollar growth, we are investing in areas that would generate incremental sales. These include our e-commerce group, our sales and client services organization and our private brand business. At the same time, we continue our relentless focus on cost control.", "Gross profit dollars were impacted by the weak sales and reimbursements I mentioned earlier. Our goal is to consistently drive gross profit dollar growth in excess of SG&A dollar growth.", "Next I'll give an update on our Customer-Centric Retailing initiative. Here is a quick look at where we stood at the end of last quarter with total CCR stores. As you may recall, we expect CCR when fully implemented in Brussels reduced working capital and store labor and enhanced the overall shopping experience.", "In order to achieve that, we are optimizing and enhancing our existing assortments. We're improving category and production adjacencies, improving site lines throughout the store and finally refreshing all our stores with a new in-store branding package.", "Through the end of the third quarter, we've completed the opening or conversion of over 1,200 stores, 500 more than we reported to you last. We now expect to have over 2,000 CCR format stores by the end of the calendar year. While this is fewer than the 2,500 to 3,000 we had previously anticipated, the slowdown is critical to applying important lessons to future conversions.", "Our latest CCR accomplishments include the following: The time needed to convert a store to CCR format is currently 20% less than the earlier conversions. We're adding key categories such as our successful beer and wine rollout which is now nearly 3,600 stores and on track to be in more than 5,000 stores by the end of the calendar year. And in the third quarter alone, this category added more than 50 basis points to front-end sales comps.", "We added back several hundred products, primarily to the complement product class in categories such as automotive and hardware, and we initiated the introduction of new SKUs in existing categories such as our new branded electronic sets. All of this adds up to a refresh of our stores at a relatively low cost.", "Recall, last quarter, that we showed you the performance of our pilot CCR stores. That time, front-end sales at those stores were outperforming the control stores by 1.9%.", "I'm pleased to report today that for the 26-week period ending May 29, the same pilot stores are now outperforming the control stores by 2.6%. The Signature product class in which we want to win versus all retailers continues to outperform the control group by nearly 5%. Our Power product class, in which we want to be the best in the drugstore industry has experienced an increase in sales from 2.4% last period to 3.1% this period.", "The Staples product class, which includes everyday needs, slipped slightly. We are sorting those reasons now and will continue to focus on improving it. And in the Complement product class, which are impulse buys or convenience items, we added back SKUs to all stores including the control group. And as you can see, the CCR stores improved versus the control group.", "So the complement product class compromises 6% of front-end sales, and we are very pleased with the improved performance.", "Although results are preliminary, our second wave of CCR store conversions is trending well against the rest of the chain, and in Dallas we're encouraged by the improvement in sales variance versus the rest of the chain as well. If you recall, Houston had a larger percentage of stores impacted by the reduction of SKUs in the complement product class that led to more pronounced sales impact in those select stores, which are now showing improvement with the reintroduction of key SKUs.", "We're also making good progress integrating Duane Reade into our company. Duane Reade's new format is performing well, and I would encourage you to visit our recently relocated midtown Manhattan store, which is performing well above expectations. Duane Reade contributed $272 million of sales in the quarter. We believe that this business represents an excellent strategic fit with Walgreens.", "Since the acquisition, we are even more excited with their capabilities in urban retailing, loyalty private brands and beauty. We believe there is real opportunity to leverage these areas to the rest of our chain. And for example, an initial selection of Duane Reade's Delish private brand consumables will be offered across the chain in August.", "As I mentioned earlier, this was a challenging quarter as we anticipated. Our strategy, which is built on the strength of our center of gravity, our 7500 community drug stores, gives me confidence we can win in any environment. We're located within five miles of nearly 75% of the U.S. population. Our plan with CCR is enhancing the customer experience and providing the low cost refresh of all stores.", "We continue to transform community pharmacy to build on our nearly 20% market share and improve the patient experience. This includes expanding our scope of services by offering flu shots and other immunizations. We're bringing new and unique pharmacy and health and wellness solutions to employers and other payers from our worksite clinics to our hospital onsite pharmacies and from our specialty pharmacy to our market share leading home infusion capabilities. We offer a broad spectrum of healthcare solutions.", "And we continue to have a relentless focus on cost control and productivity gains. So in spite of the environment, we hit many milestones in the quarter. We generated strong cash flow, and we continue to return that cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Walgreens has already returned over $1 billion to shareholders this fiscal year.", "Looking ahead, I'm very optimistic about our company. We're focused on leveraging our 7500 convenient community drug stores, and I'm confident in our strategies and our goal to deliver double-digit earnings growth, increasing return on invested capital and top-tier shareholder return.", "And finally, I want to say how proud I am of the way of the way our team members responded to a difficult environment, and their commitment to drive sales, reduce cost and improve customer service. I firmly believe their efforts will be reflected in our performance in future shareholder returns.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Wade, who will update you on the financial results in the quarter. Wade.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, net sales increased 6.1%, net earnings declined 11.4% and earnings per diluted share were $0.47 or $453 million down from $0.53 per diluted share or $522 million in the same quarter a year ago.", "Our reported EPS of $0.47 included $0.04 in costs resulting from the Medicare Part D tax charge, $0.02 from the impact of the Duane Reade acquisition and $0.01 from our Rewiring for Growth initiative. And that compares with $0.06 in rewire costs in the year ago period.", "Prescription sales rose 5.7% and represented 65% of sales for the quarter. Prescriptions sales in comp stores rose 1%. As Greg noted, we built a record 198 million prescriptions during the quarter, an increase of 5.9% from the year ago. And that includes the benefit of one percentage point from patients filling 90 day rather than 30 day scripts.", "On a comp store basis the number of prescriptions filled increased 2.5% and that includes the benefit of 1.3 percentage points from 90 day scripts.", "Now, let me say a few words about our front-end comp store sales; these sales in the quarter were up 0.1% as we continue to face slower demand for discretionary goods. Also hampering the quarter were weak flu season compared with last year's unusual H1N1 flu and the recall of certain OTC products.", "Despite this performance, we compare well to the industry. When viewing a true apples-to-apples time period, that compares our front-end comps with our top three competitors we are out performing for the same period they most recently reported as shown in this chart. And this is another why we feel good about CCR.", "Turning to gross profit, the margin improved 10 basis points in the quarter; the primary driver was an increase in front-end margin, which more than offset the negative impact of lower margins in the pharmacy.", "On a dollar basis, I'll start by pointing out that the front-end provided the majority of gross profit dollar growth in the quarter. As you may know, the rate of generic introductions and other factors is going to affect gross margins in ways we believe distort our underlying performance. And as a result, we focus on gross profit dollar growth as an important performance metric. And that grew by $290 million in the quarter.", "Now, let's look at some of the drivers of that gross profit dollar growth. The pharmacy gross profit dollar growth was negatively impacted by two primary factors. First, we are in a period of slower rate of generic drug introductions. We expect less impact from this in fiscal 2011 and a significant benefit in fiscal 2012 due to large number of new generic introductions scheduled for that year.", "And second, we continue to be impacted by reimbursement pressure, which we have experienced for years. Looking at the bigger picture, our core pharmacy business is strong and expected to get stronger as indicated by our record scripts filled, market share increases, our expanded pharmacy health and wellness solutions. And that includes flu shots and other innovative programs such as optimal wellness in 90 day refills.", "Moving to SG&A transit, two year stacked SG&A dollar growth shows some improvement compared with the year ago quarter, dropping from 17.6% to 16.5%. And when you adjust the two year stacked SG&A dollar growth to the acquisition Duane Reade, you will see a drop fro 17.6% last year to 13.4% this year. And this illustrates our continued focus on SG&A control.", "Let me walk you through this SG&A adjustment. We reported SG&A growth of 8.6% in the quarter; first, we adjusted for the net impact of rewiring for growth, which had higher cost last year. And next, we accounted for the acquisition and operating expense associated with Duane Reade, which gives us the SG&A growth for the quarter, of 6%.", "Some of our improvement can be traced to the benefits from Rewiring for Growth, and this chart summarizes the saving in cost for restructuring since inception. The net saving in the quarter, was $0.04 per share versus the year ago period. And please note we added two new lines to this chart to illustrate the cumulative savings by quarter and a total run-rate savings over the 2008 base year.", "You can see that restructuring benefits are on track with cumulative savings by quarter at $0.11 per share and the run-rate over the 2008 base year at $0.37 per share. Total rewire expenses this quarter were $17 million and for the first nine months they totaled $87 million. We expect approximately $140 million in rewire expenses in fiscal 2010, although some of these costs may not be fully realized till early fiscal 2011.", "We remain on target for net pre-tax savings of $500 million this fiscal year and net pre-tax savings of $1 billion in fiscal 2011 both versus our base year of 2008.", "Now, let's review some additional income statement details. The LIFO provision was $18 million versus $32 million in the third quarter of 2009. That represents anticipated LIFO provision of 1.25% for the year; next of the $17 million in restructuring costs in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 42.5% compared with a tax rate of 36.4% in the year ago period. The higher rate was impacted by a non-cash charge due to the elimination of Medicare Part D subsidy. We expect the tax rate of approximately 37% in the fourth quarter.", "Accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable are the components of working capital that we can most directly impact. And the net sum of these as a percent to sales fell 4.1% in the quarter compared with the year ago. Total FIFO inventories rose 4.3% against total sales growth of 6.1% and total store growth of 9.7% including Duane Reade.", "FIFO total inventories on a per store basis fell 4.9% in the third quarter. Controlling inventory continues to be a top priority. And as you can see, we have consistently made great strides over the past six quarters.", "Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of the fiscal year was $2.8 billion. Free cash flow increased to $2 billion in the first nine months versus $1.7 billion in the same period last year. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion, and our long-term debt totaled $2.4 billion.", "To update you on capital expenditures, last quarter we estimated $1.4 billion for the year. We now anticipate CapEx for the fiscal 2010 to be around $1.2 billion, as we make sure we're focusing on investing in the right projects at the right time.", "Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allowed us to pay out $136 million in dividends during the quarter and buy back $254 million in company stock. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, we returned more than $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases.", "We plan to continue returning cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks, which nearly tripled in the first nine months compared to the year-ago period. Our current dividend payout ratio was 25%, and you'll recall that we previously set a long-term dividend payout ratio of between 30% and 35% of net earnings. The next dividend announcement will be on July 14.", "Like Greg, I am confident in our strategies. We are focused on driving smart growth, enhancing the customer experience and meeting our goals for cost reduction and productivity gains to create value for shareholders.", "And now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.", "Operation-and-Answer Session", "(Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Ann Hynes with Caris & Company.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", "My questions have to do with CCR. When I look at your estimates on First Call, they're all over the place. And I think part of that is because people are modeling the CCR initiative differently. So end of 2010, 2,000 stores should be done, and you have 3,500 to 4,000 left. How should we break that out annually for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012? Would most of those be done in 2011?", "And I guess the cost associated with it also, I think you had been saying that the cost per store would be $30,000 to $50,000. And in your last 10-Q, I believe it said it was up to 40,000 to 55,000 per store now. So can you just clarify how we should model that going forward, so maybe some of the estimates become more in line with each other? And also, does that include Duane Reade stores? And I guess that's it for now.", "Greg Wasson", "I'll start with the last and then back up. It does not include the Duane Reade stores as far as the total CCR. We are doing certainly remodelings within the Manhattan area to help them complete their journey of remodeling those stores.", "As far as CCR, you're right. If we look, there is about, as we said, 5,500 total stores in the chain that would be conducive to the CCR fit. We will have 2,000 by the end of the calendar year. We expect to have the remainder of those done by the end of 2011 calendar year. So you can factor that in.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", "Well, I guess the cost per store in your last 10-Q, it said 40,000 to 55,000. But I think in your previous presentations, you were saying 30,000 to 50,000. So I guess how should we model cost per store for fiscal 2011?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I'd use the latest, the 40,000 55,000. We're encouraged, Ann, and we may be able to pull that down. And if we are, we will give an update on that. But as I said, we're seeing from when we started about a 20% reduction in the cost to convert these stores. We're down to about four days. So I think we are optimistic we maybe able get it lower, but I think that's probably a good number to use.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Greg, you mentioned that you slowed down the conversion to CCR to apply some credible lessons. Could you elaborate on what you have learned so far, and then the impact that those learnings are having on the newer conversions? And then also, could you maybe give us a bit more color on the performance of the conversions beyond the pilot stores?", "Greg Wasson", "I think the key learnings, and we kind of called that on our Q2 call, was the complement categories. And again, even though they're are only 6% of total sales, there are many stores that have a high percentage of sales coming from the complement categories.", "And I think we took out some items that we probably didn't need or should have taken out. We've added about 200 items back into those stores and in particular those compliment categories, things like automotive hardware. In many stores, we may be more like the general store in a particular community. So I think we feel good with what we're putting back in. And I think you could see the improvement on the complement categories.", "The other thing that we're exited about is the recent rollout of the actual refresh package, the d\u00e9cor and branding package that we're putting out there. I think as you recall, when we rolled out in Houston and Dallas, we didn't have it ready. We are rolling it now with the new conversions, and we are going back into Houston and Dallas I believe it's next week to put the new branding package in those two markets. So we're excited there.", "And as I think you might have one more question as well, did I cover your points?", "Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Well, the other question I actually have for you in relation to the reimbursement pressure that you've been talking about, is there a way to quantify the impact that that's had on the gross margin this quarter? And then, Greg, you mentioned that you are beginning to address some of the issues causing you reimbursement rate pressure. Is there more a work to do on that, meaning are there other PBMs that you need to go talk to as well?", "Greg Wasson", "Well, I'll take the first one and let Wade jump in on how to quantify. I think with the temporary slowdown in the generic pipeline that we've led to over the past year, I think that's probably heightened some of the reimbursement focus that payers have. And I think the good thing is that's a temporary period, and I think when we get into 2012, with the added generics, there'd be a little relief there.", "But in this interim, I do think that we're focused on making sure that we get a fair value from payers for the services we provide. And I think we have 7,500 stores in all 50 states. We have 24-hour stores and communities across the country that many don't. So we're just focused on working with payers to make sure we get a fair value. And I think we're recognizing that people value Walgreens and their network.", "Wade Miquelon", "I'll just add some color. If you look at year-on-year generics, that's $0.02 to $0.03 down versus a year ago. As we talked about the impact of the lower flu incidents of about 100 basis points in totality is another $0.02 to $0.03.", "And then building on Greg, we did see some reimbursement pressure. I would not say that it was unplanned reimbursement pressure. I think that's been for some time that while it's always cut by the layer that this is kind of an 18-month period that we see to be maybe a little bit more challenging that unusual. But again, I don't think there is anything we have unanticipated.", "But I think moving forward, all three of these things have a potential to get stabilize and get stronger over time.", "Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Does this contract with CVS Caremark change your view on growth at all going forward whether it be new store openings or acquisitions? Does it mean that you want to throw olds faster?", "Greg Wasson", "I'm not going to comment much on the CVS Caremark situation itself. But our plans haven't changed regarding our organic growth rate that we sit out there of 2.5% to 3% by the end of fiscal 2011. We still have a strong balance sheet. We're going to be looking for acquisitions that make sense strategically. And so our plans still remain as they have been over the past several months and a year.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I wanted to get a feel for how much of a headwind we're going to be facing here from the swine flu in the fourth quarter, because swine flu obviously was building from basically this point all the way through December. And just want to get an idea how much of a drag we should expect on both the prescription copy and the front-end.", "Greg Wasson", "Last year, as we've said, we administered 5.5 million seasonal flu shots in addition to a couple of million H1N1. And most of that was in the first quarter. So we're going to get about 7.5 million total flu shots. We expect to play a big role in the seasonal flu program this fall.", "Last year, I think we had 16,000 to 17,000 of our pharmacists certified. Today, Kermit Crawford is with me, tells me we have about 23,000 certified pharmacists. We're looking forward to adding the Duane Reade pharmacists of nearly 1,000 to participate. So we did a good job last year. We certainly expect to do a better job this year.", "Kermit Crawford", "We're certainly looking forward to another strong flu season. Like Greg said, 23,000 of our pharmacists are certified. Over 91% of our stores have two full-time certified pharmacists in it. So when we look at the pneumonia, Zostavax, tetanus, other immunizations, we look to have a very strong season this year.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I understand you'd like to get back to a normal flu season patter. But this fourth quarter that we're working on now has got a very big swine flu year-ago it's comparing against, I'm just curious if you could quantify how big that was.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I think, Mark, we actually experienced quite a bit at this third quarter and in fact probably a significant amount of third quarter that we're going against. And we absolutely anticipated in fourth quarter, I don't know if I've got the number that Wade can give, but it is a headwind. We anticipate aggressively going after more flu shots in the first quarter as well as the tail-end of the fourth quarter.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think you saw the impact more this last quarter, and then it remains to be seen in the first quarter. For the fourth quarter, I don't think there is going to be a huge impact either way. There is a big upside on the flu shot part of the season which should hopefully offset any reduction in the first quarter from the overall trend.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, Wade, on the SG&A cost savings, for a long time you were talking about 25% of that savings coming out of the Florida Central Fill. Have you really achieved much of that or is that really also to come in 2011? And what areas are you looking for in 2011 to get the additional $500 millions in savings?", "Wade Miquelon", "What we've actually said is that the 25% of our $250 million is actually a broader umbrella of transforming community pharmacy, which Florida POWER plays one part, but it's much broader than that.", "So if you look at our aggregate across the country, the work to be done, and Kermit, maybe you can comment, we're confident that we'll be able to deliver that.", "Beyond that, we've got indirect spend, opportunities as well as corporate field and other SG&A opportunities. So all three buckets would step up next year. And there is a big step up in the TCRx what we call the transform community pharmacy overall umbrella. ", "Kermit Crawford", "Yes, Mark, we're very confident that we're going to beat our cost savings goal for 2011 under TCRx. But in addition to that, we've talked about enhancing our customer experience and our customer service. And we've put some automation and enhanced some of our technology to improve customer service by using up some of the additional capacity we have in the system.", "For example, if a patient were to touch on a prescription in tomorrow in one of our 25-hour stores, our scheduling system now schedules that prescription to be filled on the overnight where we have capacity, therefore freeing up the pharmacists during the day. So we're filling the same number of prescriptions, but we're creating more free time during the day.", "And as well, the third part of that was the (inaudible) services, which we talked about the flu and other immunizations. So all three of those parts of TCRx we think are on track.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And, Kermit, while we've got you, obviously during the dispute with CVS, there was some disclosure that Maintenance Choice was pressuring you. Is there anything you can do to counter that as they continue to build that out?", "Kermit Crawford", "Mark, as we talked about, we're very pleased with our agreement that we have with CVS. We would not go into any of the specific details around that agreement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derek Leckow with Barrington Research", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Just a question on the SG&A growth, 6% SG&A dollar growth, and that's adjusted obviously. But, Wade, can you help me understand what the SG&A dollar growth is doing at store level, and is there a bigger component coming out of some of the corporate activities herein in the fourth quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "We try to get the bridge before. It's a fairly complex bridge. But at the store level, yes, we have some base level store salary inflation, maybe 18 bps as a percent of sales. We also might have been a bit of occupancy. Our occupancy is up about 20 bps as a percent of sales. And that's really driven by the fact that we've skewed over the last three years more store openings to really the A+ sites on the East Coast and West Coast.", "Other than that, we've given a little bit of a walk here in the presentation. I know Rick can share with you the details. But in aggregate, I'd also say, for the number of stores that we opened over the period, 6%, when taking out Duane Reade, it's about as good as we've done in many years. It's trending in the right direction.", "Again, what primarily drives SG&A right now is new store openings. And like I said, some folks might have missed a bit of just the baseline inflation in store salaries as well as the occupancy.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "I'm sorry, I don't have the presentation right in front of me here, Wade, but the 6%, is that roughly what's going on at store level as well?", "Wade Miquelon", "No, the store level would be much less on a same-store basis, anywhere from 1% to 2% (short), which is really primarily driven by store salary inflation. And like I said, there is about 20 bps as a percent of sales from increased occupancy. And again, that's because of the decision to open more stores in A+ site on the East Coast and West Coast.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "And just one question on your working capital here. It sounds like inventory is up a little bit, and I wondered if store level inventory is down. But where the rest of the inventory? Is that something we should be thinking about coming out of the system in the fourth quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "The same store inventory is actually down, right? And I think we made good progress there. That down across the board in stores as well as our distribution chain. I think we had opportunity to continue to improve that both in pharmacy as well as the front-end, and we'll do so.", "But again, on a same store basis, we've made progress. Again, albeit not as much as we made in prior periods, but I don't think that we've run the gamut on that yet.", "Derek Leckow - Barrington Research", "Can you quantify how much opportunity there is in terms of inventory reduction?", "Wade Miquelon", "I'd hate to do it here on this call. I mean obviously we haven't announced anything publicly, but I think we've obviously got a lot of low-hanging fruit opportunity already from some of the store network, streamlining that. But now, we're looking more holistically at our supply chain opportunities there to operate a bit different; change how we think about some of the buffer stocks, replenishment etcetera.", "And so I think that that's kind of the next generation if you will, of improvement.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "I was hoping we could talk a little bit more detail, first about reimbursement rate. Is it fair to say that when you talk about fewer generics, you've got older generics macking, and newer generics, there aren't as many of them coming in at a more profitable stage. Or are we seeing lower reimbursement per script for the drugs that are macked?", "What I'm saying is, is it a mix of age or the level of reimbursement?", "Greg Wasson", "Meredith, it's a little of both. To your point, I think some of the older macks are coming down a little bit, as well as the newer are coming down a little more quickly. But at the same time, I do think that the bottom-line is that generic utilization is a win, win, win for everyone. And our focus is to continue to drive a higher percentage of generic utilization.", "And I think when we see more and more come out the latter half of 2011-2012 for our fiscal year, certainly we'd see the benefit there. We're watching Mack's diligently with all payers.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think Greg said it, but we are at a temporary period of fewer new generics. At the back end of calendar 2011, that starts to change dramatically. So that is what it is.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then you've talked about 90-day at retail has been boosting comps. Could you talk about whether you see that concept, that kind of program expanding? Are you working on joint ventures with PBMs? And then I also have a question about limited networks.", "Greg Wasson", "I absolutely think that a retail 90 benefit and offering is going to become a greater and greater part of the pharmacy industry. I think as more and more generics come out, we see a greater percentage of chronic prescription drugs. And 90-day retail benefit just makes sense.", "I think the good thing is that employers who have had only a 90-day mail benefit for years, by adding a retail 90 in a broad network of retailers, it gives them the opportunity to one, give their employees a benefit that had they had not wanted to use mail, lower cost by increasing the penetration of total 90-day prescriptions. And a broader network can be put together to give choice as well.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think the evidence is coming out that one of the best ways to reduce overall healthcare costs is through better adherence. And 90-day is clearly a tool to drive better adherence and compliance. So I think that that trend is also favorable and we'll see that play out over time.", "Greg Wasson", "So Meredith, to your point, we're working with all payers; all PBMs, managed care organizations to provide them a 90-day retail solution.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "But is 90-day at retail profitable if everybody is able to do it, if you're not getting any of the benefits of sort of a limited network for 90 days?", "Wade Miquelon", "Of course, just like 30-day is profitable with the same open network, so is 90-day. And I mean it could be structured in a win, win for both the payer, but also for us. And like I said, drives adherence and compliance, and provides an innate list from that over time as well.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, with what we're able to bring to all payers in a situation where they are able to put a broad network together, you figure Meredith, you take to cost to fill this out, you have a reimbursement that makes sense. It's a win-win for everyone.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And limited networks, where do you think that goes, and are you concerned that that leads to significant more competition on reimbursement cost?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I think limited networks in some form or fashion have been around for years. You go all the way back to the 80s where (inaudible) most restricted networks. We know that patients do want choice, and there are ways to provide value and lower cost, and provide choice at the same time.", "So I think there would be limited networks around, and there always have been. I do think that folks can balance both choice and value and cost with a broader network. And I think that's what we're seeing more of.", "Wade Miquelon", "We haven't seen an uptake in that. I mean, at the end of the day, if that's where it wants to go, having a 20% share and being within 5 miles or 75% of the population, I think that we're positioned extremely well in that case.", "Greg Wasson", "And Meredith, I think you may begin to see preferred networks based on performance, which we would welcome.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And you don't think that leads to more competition between retailers on reimbursement rate?", "Greg Wasson", "No I think where healthcare is going is, the provider that can really show value with clinical outcomes, reduced cost, provide choice, to lower the entire medical spend versus just the pharmacy spend is where we are headed as a country as well as us as a company.", "Operator", "Moving on to David Magee, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Couple of questions, one, the question about the flu season that's this fall, last year there was a lot of attention being paid to H1N1 and obviously a lot of vaccines being given. I understand that you're better positioned this year than last year, in which you had a good performance. Do you think that the public will be as aware of it this year, and will be as motivated as last fall, and if you had a shot last fall, do you have to go back at all?", "Greg Wasson", "Latter question, yes. The CDC recommends a seasonal annual flu shot. And there was probably some heightened concern last year due to the H1N1 pandemic. I think the fact of the matter is that there is more and more folks getting seasonal flu shots year-over-year because of the effectiveness.", "We do know that there were around a 150 million or so doses produced last year. Looks like the latest info we're getting is that there are going to be more produced this year. So we feel good with how we're positioned.", "And well, David, it's interesting combining the seasonal flu shot with H1N1 in the same dose. So I think people will probably tend to be more interested because they can get both in one dose.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "The second question has to do with the performance on the CCR pilot stores. You've had an acceleration here of late. Does that have upward potential to it? And I think somebody earlier asked about the non-pilot stores, how they were doing. I didn't hear the answer on that one.", "Greg Wasson", "We're feeling good about the trend we're seeing in CCR. As I said, we were 1.9% in the pilot stores that are reported on Q2, 2.6% in those pilot stores overall this year. I feel good that we're making real progress in the complement category. That's where we sell the significant (mess) on some of the SKUs.", "And at the same time, what we're beginning to see, David, is that last year when we began closing out the 4,000 SKUs, that was companywide. And what we're beginning to see now is as the new planograms come in nationwide, we're adding items. We're beyond kind of the optimizing the SKU level. We're actually enhancing the categories and the departments that we're putting on chain-wide.", "So we're not only seeing improvement in the CCR stores, but we're beginning to see improvement based on enhanced categories chain-wide.", "Wade Miquelon", "And, Dave, let me just maybe address part of the underpinning of your question. But we have been very diligent about looking market-by-market of control and pilot stores and our market share in those markets as well the overall share in comps.", "And as we illustrated here, we feel pretty good that our aggregate comps on apple-to-apples basis outperformed our top three competitors, which basically means that the control is strong too.", "Greg Wasson", "So obviously it's a tough environment out there, but we have to make sure that we're not only looking at whatever the comp is, but making sure that from a market share point of view on a competitive basis that we're actually outperforming others.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "So do you think that 2.6 is an appropriate proxy to the more recent Convergent?", "Wade Miquelon", "Absolutely. And I think you can extrapolate again our aggregate versus other comps and add the 2.6 as a hopefully baseline or better move forward.", "Operator", "And next from (Susquehanna) we'll go to Bob Summers.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just wanted to dig a little bit more into the SG&A line and better understand about the change in the net cost savings. And I can't access the presentation right now. What the four quarter trailing average store growth is? And understand maybe why we're not doing a little better job on that line at this point.", "Greg Wasson", "Well, Bob, I'll jump in and then have Wade give more details. I agree with his comment earlier. I think we removed Duane Reade in light of the 5.9% new store growth. Our SG&A trend is pretty consistent with where we have been over the last two or three years. We certainly didn't fall out of bed. We certainly know that there's opportunity, we are going to keep pushing.", "The goal I have, that I have given this team is to make sure that that two-year stack year-over-year continuously go down. I am sorry you can't open the presentation, but when you look at the bar graph, the two-years stack with Duane Reade out, we have continued to improve year-over-year on a two-year stack.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then, sort of secondly with respect to the overall sales environment, two questions. First, are you starting to see any impact from people rolling off of discounted Cobra? And then, second, with respect to the front-end, where's the incremental pressure coming from?", "Are you seeing share loss to discounters or dollar stores, and are you concerned that some of this given the overall employment market is a little but structural longer term?", "Greg Wasson", "I can't say that we've seen anything on people rolling off Cobra, and maybe it's something we should dig into. Well, I can't say we are seeing that. Bob, as far as the front-end I think we are still seeing some continued pressure on the discretionary categories, although we're feeling better with what we are seeing currently.", "As I said, we are beginning to roll out some new and enhanced planograms and categories chain-wide. In addition to CCR, we're beginning to roll back some of the private brand as I said from Duane Reade. But as far as the pressure, it's mainly still in the discretionary categories, because customers are still holding on to their cash a little bit.", "Wade Miquelon", "And Bob, I would add that, further in this sluggish economy, finances are an important cause of low adherence to prescription medication therapies. So between the economy and a tough H1N1 comparison of last spring, I think that is more what's happening in this quarter on the pharmacy side of the business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then lastly, you talked about a 50 basis point lift from the alcohol rollout. Where do you see that trending, or what's your own bogey of where it can go?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I think there's no reason that shouldn't be able to be in 2% to 3% of the front-end over time. But of course, its how many you roll out and when you cycle, whatever, but I would say that's kind of I think what it should comprise. So what it is in terms of actual lift would depend upon the timing of when they're rolled out and how you cycle that.", "Greg Wasson", "I feel we had to watch, Bob, the basket that comes with that which we're encouraged by.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Debra Weinswig with Citi.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "I know it's early, but any unexpected benefits so far from the Duane Reade acquisition?", "Greg Wasson", "I think certainly, as I said we are really encouraged and excited. But with there private brand, frankly expertise in what they've done with private brand in that market, and that's the reason we're pulling back some of that in August as we said to begin to see what kind of lift we can get throughout the chain.", "So, I think there is huge opportunity there. Their loyalty card, they just re-launched it a couple of months ago. They're seeing pretty good results from it. I think we can certainly learn from some of the things they are doing as we pilot our loyalty card.", "Cosmetics & Beauty, we're excited there, I think their fresh food, urban retailing. So, the more excited we are and the more we think that we can pull out their expertise back through the chain.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "As you roll out some of their private label into your traditional Walgreen stores, what will that replace, if you will, in your existing stores?", "Greg Wasson", "It's interesting, we do a terrific job as you might expect in, kind of, the health and beauty private brand products, you know, the (inaudible) and so forth that we are known for. Where we under-penetrate and have over the years is in consumables, and that's where they over-excel, and in their delicious snacks, their cookies, their food, their consumable items.", "So, we are going to continue to drive and enhance our OTC offering, which we've done well for years. But we think they can really help us in the consumable space.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, and in another way I think we've done a great job at kind of the me-too at a better value for consumers. But I think that, in terms of really differentiated propositions, in particular in food, they are really best-in-class doing a great job.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "And then also, Wade, as you look at it from today, because obviously you've had a lot of excess in traction with regards to expense reduction, what would you look at, say, as the biggest expense reduction opportunities going forward?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I think the key thing is to deliver on; job number one, is to deliver on our Rewire commitment. We've got that planned; now we have to just run that play. So, I say that's good news.", "Beyond that we're actually doing a lot of work, what I would call in two different streams. One is kind of the day to day, how do we think about making increments in everything we do everyday. We have a group now dedicated to that, and separately also what are the next big breakthroughs, what are the big structural areas we should be looking out to transform. And we've got some ideas there as well.", "But I think I guess just to wrap it up I think that the first job number one is to deliver on the rewire commitment and put that to bed, while we also figure out as a company how to be more systemic and not make these cost reductions a once-every-five-year event - really build it into our day-to-day.", "So we're challenging everything all the time, how can we do it better, more efficiently, faster, and we've put significant resources and a new structure around that for the company. So I feel pretty good that on a going basis that we'll be more on a continual process there.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "And the last question, I agreed with your comments with regards to front-end comps, and when you look at your front-end comps versus the peers, it doesn't look like you're losing share to anyone else in the drug store channel. It doesn't necessarily look like there's anyone out there in the competitive landscape of all retail that's doing particularly well, maybe the club channel. Where do you think consumers are going to buy those items?", "Greg Wasson", "Overall, I think consumers are just pulling back their spending in total Debra. But I do think that we are encouraged, when we look at apples-to-apples that we are winning against our major competitors, and we are digging share across many markets. So I think it's some that's cut back on discretionary spend in total.", "Wade Miquelon", "If you look at the internals, our food traffic remains strong, which is people are coming, the items remains fairly strong. It's really the dollar'ing per item, where people had to trade down or make sacrifices. You see it in the other trends too in terms of people spending more after paycheck and less at the end of it, people who move more away from credit to cash etcetera.", "So I think it really is aggregate right now; is the bit of a suppressed consumer, which I think is good for us as this comes back. But I think the key thing we're doing is, through CCR and the other efforts to make our stores much more relevant.", "First, I think its big opportunity to make those assets more accretive over time. And so the items we're launching in the new environment is going to help with that.", "Debra Weinswig \u2013 Citi", "And also, as you are building out your loyalty card and as you are building out your private label, it seems that you have a real opportunity in this environment to capture if you will this \"new consumer\" as well.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, we definitely would agree with that. I think there is tremendous opportunity to grow our private brand offering. And that creates loyalty in itself as you know.", "Wade Miquelon", "And as Rick said before, if you look at beer and wine for example, beer and wine is not just what we're going to get for the list over time. We're finding when you do the basket diagnostics, that actually we're picking up more of that flow item or less consumer, who might not come by Walgreens because there was one or two items they couldn't get through that Mini shop. And that gives us a lot of encouragement.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Wade, on the generic impact, I think you said it was $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter versus last year. Can you at all tell us when do you think that bottom, I mean you are kind of hinting at it, that it's sometime between now and sort of next few quarters and are you implying that even though fiscal '11 through August 11 is not going to be when the big waves kicks in that you are still going to have, that swing will turn positive in fiscal '11 on generic?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, we have a step down this whole year; so, we've seen it throughout the year. We're going to have another bit of a step down next year and then really at the en of calendar '11 is where we get a really nice step up and then the following year an even nicer step up. So, I hesitate to quantify the exact numbers in part, because actually no one can predict exactly when these things hit. But that's the basic pattern.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "So is it fair to say that $0.02 to $0.03 is kind of the worst type of impact you would expect in realizing it's more like horse shoes than precise, but at least in terms of magnitude that's about as big you would expect in any one quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I say next year you could see another one to two on top of it, but we've got a lot of good stuff going as well. So, I mean, in aggregates there's lots of big moving parts, but we do see a bit of a step down next year, not to the degree we've seen this year and then I guess that we started to see a sequential year step up.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And then on the house keeping side, I think you talked about the AWP lawsuit settlement, that's still running at about $25 million a quarter?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, about the same flow-through.", "Wade Miquelon", "We'll start to cycle that next fall.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I think in the past you've called out the dilutive expense from clinics. Is that neutral this year or is that still a dilutive churn?", "Wade Miquelon", "That's now moving to slightly accretive. So on a relative basis, it's not accretive. It's still a loss, but it's less loss than the year ago. And I would expect that that's going to keep becoming relatively accretive moving forward. And we are still very much big believers in this. Not only from an amazing experience what it does to our halo effect, but also our stores are now moving into three and four years.", "Many of those are moving into the black and that's now the kind of torture test of fully loaded economics with no benefits in the front-end or the script basis. So again on a relative basis, it's year-over-year accretive, but where also the older ones are ramping nicely as planned. So, it gives us a lot of confidence that this is the way to go.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "In terms of Bob's question with some of the extended (covers) falling off, it might be interesting to see since there are cheaper ways to get healthcare if you're not insured how that goes?", "Greg Wasson", "We definitely think we're going to be able to play a big role in the access challenges with healthcare reform, Andy, as you might expect. That's the reason we're so bullish on these clinics.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And on the front-end, you said the markdowns were lower, is that due to the competitive environment in anyway or is it just due to the amount of markdowns you took last year with the rewire?", "Greg Wasson", "The amount of markdowns we took last year due to rewire.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And are you saying that the competitive environment is about the same? I mean, I'm seeing some signs of rationality versus some of the competitors like the supermarkets where some milk prices are moving up and I think in prior quarters they were using them as loss leaders? So well, how would you characterize incrementally the competitive environment overall in retail?", "Greg Wasson", "I'd say it's pretty much what we've seen in the past six months to 12, I think there are folks that are out there still trying to go after the discretionary spend with consumers. I do think and as I said we're encouraged with what we're seeing currently. We'll see, I think people are still watching their, Andy.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "My last question is on your direct-to-employer offering. Is there a way or is that an offering that can be run by an HR department in parallel with a PBM that has a mandatory element to it where the maintenance drugs could still be done in that type of a situation?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, Andy, we have several relationships where we have direct arrangements with a payer over the years. The real opportunity we have, as you know, is we lead with the worksite health center solution that we have. And once we get in and really begin to provide real value and build the relationship with employers, there is other services that we can offer that we're able to deliver. If that indeed includes prescription drugs, then we can do that as well. But what we really want to do is get in and provide real value to an employers medical spend in total.", "Rick Hans", "Folks, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. We'll announce June monthly sales on July 6. The next quarterly financial announcement will be September 28. That's when we'll announce fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and yearend results. Until then, thank you for listening, and we look forward to talking to you soon.", "Operator", "And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference today.

(Operator Instructions)", "At this time, for opening introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rick Hans.", "Rick Hans", "Welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 year-end conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, our President and CEO will discuss the quarter and fiscal year highlights and our continued progress in executing our core strategies. In addition, Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will detail our fourth quarter and fiscal year financial results.", "Also joining us on the call, and available for questions is Kermit Crawford, our President of Pharmacy Services.", "When we get to your questions, please limit yourself to one.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our website at investor.walgreens.com for the reconciliations. Also, I am available throughout the day by phone to answer any additional questions you may have.", "You can find a link to our webcast under our Investor Relations website. After the call, this presentation will be archived on our website for 12 months. We're also making the call available as a podcast. You can download that too at our Investor Relations website.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Wasson", "Thank you, Rick, and thank you everyone for joining us on our call this morning. Today I want to cover three main points; first, our fourth quarter and year-end results; second, I'll discuss the initiatives we have underway to improve front-end sales through our Customer-Centric Retailing Initiative; and three, I'll highlight the industry-leading effort we are making to provide our customers with convenient access to flu immunizations as we continue to transform community pharmacy.", "As you saw from our press release this morning, we reported record sales of $16.9 billion in the quarter, which is a 7.4% increase over last year. Fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 11.4% to $0.49, which includes $0.05 per share in acquisition and restructuring-related costs that compares with $0.44 in the same quarter a year ago, including $0.03 per diluted share and restructuring-related costs.", "This quarter we generated record cash flow from operations of $925 million, an increase of 8.6%. Net sales for fiscal year 2010 grew 6.4% to a record $67.4 billion and net earnings per diluted share were up 5% to $2.12.", "Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2010 totaled $3.7 billion, and free cash flow was a record $2.7 billion. Looking back on fiscal 2010 I feel very good with the number of significant milestones we have achieved. We filled a record 778 million prescriptions, up 7.5% from last year, and our retail pharmacy market share has increased 60 basis points from a year ago to 19.5%.", "We administered more than 7 million seasonal and H1N1 flu shots or more than any other retailer. We opened 291 net new drug stores. We acquired Duane Reade's 258 drugstores, the largest acquisition in our company's history which gives us a leading drugstore position in the New York metro area.", "We converted or opened more than 1500 stores to our Customer-Centric Retailing or CCR format. Beer and Wine was added as part of our selection to more than 3,500 stores in fiscal year SG&A growth, adjusted for restructuring cost and the Duane Reade acquisition fell to 6.5%, its lowest level in decades.", "And Wade will provide more details on the quarter's SG&A growth a little later.", "And finally, we returned $2.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2010. And in September, we completed the $2 billion share repurchase program we announced in October 2009.", "So I take great pride in our team's operating execution this past year. Their efforts give me great confidence that we will continue to drive our core strategies in 2011. We'll continue to slow store openings with a goal of 2.5% to 3% this fiscal year. Our effort to enhance the customer experience will continue to gain momentum with the acceleration in the CCR store refreshes, and we plan for our cost reduction and productivity efforts to provide $1 billion in savings in fiscal 2011 versus our base year of 2008.", "As you can see the impact of these saving efforts when looking at the progress we've made in SG&A dollar growth the last few years.", "This chart shows how generic drug introductions produced peaks and valleys in gross profit dollar growth during much of the decade, hitting a high point in 2007 before reaching a low in 2009. I addition we felt the effects of the slowing economy beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which further negatively impacted gross profit dollar growth.", "As you can see, unfortunately we have had periods when SG&A dollar growth exceeded gross profit dollar growth. However, excluding the impact of Duane Reade and restructuring cost, SG&A dollar growth slowed in the last two years. That resulted from the Rewiring for Growth initiative, scaling back on new store openings, and progress from other cost savings initiatives.", "Today, we are in a much better position to manage SG&A dollar growth in relation to gross profit dollar growth. And it's worth noting that in the latest quarter, despite the economy's impact on gross profit dollar growth we were able to increase those dollars faster than SG&A.", "Now I'd like to provide an update on CCR and how it's driving improvements to our front-end.", "As I talked about previously, CCR is reducing working capital and store labor. And most importantly, it is improving sales and the overall shopping experience by optimizing and enhancing our existing product assortment by improving category and product adjacencies through improving site lines throughout the store, and by refreshing all our stores with a new in store d\u00e9cor package.", "As a reminder, we have about 5,500 out of our 7,500 stores targeted for CCR refreshes. As the end of the third quarter, we have opened or converted more than 500 additional stores, the CCR bringing our total number to more than 1,800. By the end of calendar 2010, we'll have over 2,000 CCR stores.", "Our rollout of beer and wine has now reached nearly 4,200 stores. And we expect to have more than 5,000 stores by the end of the calendar year. Our customers find this selection a convenient way to consolidate their shopping trips and it builds basket size.", "This extensive refresh of our stores is being accomplished at an average cost of $50,000 per store. And I'm very encouraged by the favorable customer response these stores are receiving and the improved performance we're seeing from this investment.", "In fact, the overall performance of our CCR pilot stores is getting better and better as we continue our refinement. On our last conference call we showed you the pilot store's performance measured by our four product classes versus a control group of store.", "For the 26 week period and in May 29, our pilot stores outperformed the control stores during that period by 2.6% across all product classes. In the latest 26 week period and in August 28, our pilot stores outperformed the control group overall by an even better 3.7%.", "The improvements that we're making, including new product adjacencies, new assortments in merchandise and the in store d\u00e9cor package; all are consolidated into our results.", "Now, let's update results from our wave one and wave two CCR rollouts. As you know after we launched our pilot stores in spring 2009, we rolled out wave one of CCR to all stores in the Dallas and Houston markets. These two markets have faced unique economic factors impacting their comparisons to non-CCR stores in other markets, therefore we're focusing on our market share in Dallas and Houston.", "Our latest reports for these two markets show that we are maintaining our market share across our top 60 categories versus our food, drug and mass market competitors. We're also encouraged by the improving sales results we're seeing in both markets.", "In addition, these stores will get a lift from the new in store d\u00e9cor package they received during the fourth quarter. Next, our wave two stores which consist of 203 locations are outperforming our non-CCR stores in the 13 weeks after their conversion.", "CCR continues to gain momentum and we fully expect it to contribute to front end sales as we complete it's rollout by calendar 2011. I'd like to cover my last major topic; this year is flu season. Let's start by reviewing last year's monthly sales comps.", "It's easy to see that script growth and front end sales reacted very strongly to the early flu season. Both benefited from customers coming to stores to get immunized and for the prevalence of H1N1.", "Meanwhile, the rest of the year showed more normal trends with front end comps generally improving since December. In the fourth quarter our margins also improved and we saw increases in comp store market share for our top 60 categories.", "Here, you see the incidence of cough, cold and flu throughout last ear. It was the early onset of flu activity that caused our first quarter spike in comp sales. In particular, script counts, including flu shots, peaked by the end of September. And by November, we administered nearly all the seasonal flu vaccine we had. And we believe we could have administered many more doses had we not run out of vaccine.", "As a result for the rest of the season, we administered H1N1 vaccinations and finished up the program by February. As I mentioned, we easily surpassed our goal and provided over seven million total shots.", "With this graph, you see how unusual cough and cold and flu incidence was when comparing it to the two previous years. It's more typical for the incidence of flu to peak around February, which is what happened in the two seasons prior to last year. If this year's flu season is typical, we have from late August to early January to provide flu shots before the flu peaks.", "Now, I'd like to highlight some of the key differences in this year's flu season from last. First, customers only need to get one flu shot this year that will cover both the seasonal and the H1 in one flu strains. The centers for disease control and prevention now recommends everyone over six months of age get a flu shot versus an emphasis in past years on seniors and those with compromised immune systems.", "And third manufacturers made over 40 million more doses this year. So of course we can't predict the timing or the intensity of this season's flu activity, but we are ready with an unprecedented effort to deliver as many as 15 million flu shots to our customers.", "We now have more that 26,000 certified immunizing pharmacists and nurse practitioners compared with 16,000 at the start of last years flu season which is why we are offering flu shots all day everyday this year versus the limited hours last year.", "Importantly, we have a new medical billion option through several health plans, including national agreements with United Healthcare and Cigna and regionally we offer it for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois and North Carolina among others.", "In addition, we made it easier for our staff to handle the administrative for flu shots by streamlining the process. And in terms of marketing, we sent direct mail pieces with pre-populated flu shot forms and ramped up our online and T.V. advertising, including a partnership with the ever popular Dr. Oz.", "With all these efforts in action, we have already provided more than 2 million flu shots through yesterday. And remember, as I pointed out earlier, that typical peak of cough and cold and flu incidence it's still more than four months away.", "In closing, we believe our flu shot program is a great example of how close we are to patients and how easily we can reach them. That's what health plans and other payers are saying they need from us, face-to-face access to improve patient outcomes and provide preventative care. We're doing that with our 25,000 certified immunizing pharmacists, more than 1,000 nurse practitioners and 7,500 pharmacies located within five miles of nearly 75% of the population.", "We've heard very clearly from payers how important we are to their network of providers. Now one else can match our base of retail pharmacy locations, hospital and medical pharmacies, worksite health centers and retail clinics and specialty and infusion pharmacy centers.", "We have the reach and capability to help payers lower their total healthcare costs while improving quality in clinical outcomes through our complete Pharmacy Health and Wellness solutions.", "As we begin fiscal 2011, we are positioning our company to serve as a true community-based retail, health and daily living destination. Towards that end we have recently named Mark Wagner, previously our Executive Vice President of Community Management and Operations to the new position of President of our Community Management Division. Also Kermit Crawford, who is our Executive Vise President of Pharmacy has been named to the new position of President of our Pharmacy Services division.", "These moves and other realignment will result in improved execution through out the chain and strengthen the alignment of initiatives across the organization.", "Before I close, I want to say I am very optimistic about our company's future. I also want to thank all of our employees for the tremendous execution over the past year, and what I know they can accomplish in the upcoming year.", "Now, we'll turn the call over to Wade who will update you on financial results in the quarter and the year.", "Wade Miquelon", "Let's review the quarter's result in more detail. Greg covered sales and earnings, so let me skip down to prescription sales which grows 6.5% and represented 66% of sales for the quarter. We filled 194 million prescriptions an increase of 6.7% from a year ago. And that includes the benefit of 0.8 percentage points for patients filling 90 day versus 30 day scripts.", "On a comp store base, the number of prescriptions filled increased 3.3% and that includes a benefit of 1.2 percentage points from 90 day scripts. Prescription sales in comp stores rose 1.6%.", "Frond end comp sales in the quarter were up 1.2% in spite of a slow demand for discretionary goods. Total comp store sales were up 1.5%. For fiscal year 2010, again I will focus on sales number on this chart.", "Prescription sales rose 6.3% and represented to 63.2% of sales for the year. We filled 778 million prescriptions, an increase of 7.5% from last year. And that includes the benefit of 0.8 percentage points from patients filling 90 day versus 30 day scripts.", "On a comp store basis, the number of prescriptions filled increased 4.5%, and that includes a benefit of 1.2 percentage point from 90 day scripts. Prescription sales in comp stores grow 2.3%.", "Front end comp store sales were up 0.5% for the fiscal year, while total comp store sales increased 1.6%. Compared to the industry our sales continue to perform well. In viewing a true apples to apples time period that compares our front end comps to the top three competitors based on their most recent quarterly reporting, we are outperforming two of the three as shown in this chart.", "And we were only 40 basis points below the third competitor. Turning to gross profit, the margin improves 70 basis points in the quarter. Front end margins benefited from pricing, promotion and other improved efficiencies as well as lower rewiring for growth expanses.", "On our pharmacy side, margins benefited from new generic introductions, partially offset by reimbursement. Gross profit dollars grew by $1.4 billion in fiscal 2010, and we view that as an especially strong performance in the face of several headwinds during the year such as the economy, which we estimate slowed comparable store sales by two to three percentage points that's equivalent of about $500 million gross profit impact.", "Other headwinds include pharmacy reimbursement, such a new AWP definition for Medicaid prescriptions and a slowdown in the rate of new generic introductions among others. And combined, we estimate those factors were about $1 billion headwind over the course of the year. In spite of this, we grew gross profit dollars faster than SG&A dollars in the quarter, excluding restructuring costs and Duane Reade.", "The two years net SG&A dollar growth was higher this year compared with a year ago primarily due to costs associated with the Duane Reade acquisition. And when we adjust for the acquisition and restructuring related factors, you will see the two-year stat drops to 12.1% versus a 14.1% two-year stat a year-ago to 23.4% stat two years ago.", "Although SG&A continued to trend down, it gets a little tougher each quarter to maintain the same rate of reduction as we lapse significant progress made over the previous periods.", "As we get to core SG&A growth, let me walk you through the adjustments for the quarter. Our reported increase in SG&A dollar growth was 11%. As you can see, Duane Reade's acquisition-related cost and operating SG&A, slightly offset by the impact in the quarter of Rewired costs contributed five percentage points of total SG&A dollar growth.", "In addition, new store openings contributed 3.8 percentage points to SG&A dollar growth. Remaining SG&A dollar growth was a combination of inflation, acquisitions, and business mix, including strategic investments and CCR conversions.", "We achieved a net benefit of $615 million for Rewired for Growth in fiscal 2010 versus our goal of $500 million. That's primarily a result of moving some cost to the program into fiscal 2011, and for some benefits arriving earlier than expected. Therefore, we are expecting an additional $400 million in net benefit in fiscal 2011 because we remain on track to reach our goal of $1 billion in savings in the current fiscal year.", "The chart summarizes the EPS impact of Rewired savings and costs for restructuring this last year's fourth quarter. The net savings in the quarter was $0.08 per diluted share. Again, you will see that restructuring benefits are slightly ahead of schedule with the cumulative savings by quarter at $0.16 per share and the run rate over the 2008 base year at $0.46 per share.", "Now let's review some additional income statement details. The LIFO provision was $61 million versus $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, and that represents a LIFO provision of 1.7% for the year as we experienced inflation in the pharmacy, slightly offset by a slight deflation on the front-end. We plan for the LIFO provision to be 1.5% in fiscal 2011.", "Total Rewire expenses this quarter were $19 million, and for the fiscal year they totaled $106 million. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.6% compared with a tax rate of 35.8% in the year-ago period, and we are planning for a tax rate of approximately 37% in fiscal 2011.", "Accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable are the components of working capital that we can most directly impact, and the net sum of these as a percent of sales fell 1.9% in the quarter compared with a year ago. Total FIFO inventories rose 9.1% against total sales growth of 7.4% and total store growth of 8.1% including Duane Reade.", "FIFO total inventories on a per store basis increased 0.9% in the fourth quarter, and this small increase comes after an 11.1% decrease in the year-ago period.", "To update you on capital expenditures, CapEx for fiscal 2010 was $1.0 billion short of our original estimate. That was primarily due to a strategic decision to delay the investment of our new point-of-sale system and other IT investments and the timing of certain real estate investments.", "We expect CapEx to increase in fiscal 2011 to approximately $1.4 billion as we now move ahead on our point-of-sale system rollout and other key investments.", "Cash flow from operations for the fiscal year was $3.7 billion, just slightly short of last year's record of $4.1 billion. Free cash flow increased to $2.7 billion in the fiscal year, versus $2.2 billion for the same period last year. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.9 billion, and long term debt totaled $2.4 billion.", "Our strong cash flow and balance sheet allowed us to pay out $541 million in dividends during the fiscal year, an increase of 21.3% over fiscal 2009. Our fiscal 2010 dividend payout ratio was 26%. And you will recall that we had previously set a long term dividend payout target of between 30% and 35% of net earnings.", "During the year, we repurchased $1.6 billion in stock. Combined with our dividend payouts, we returned a record $2.2 billion to shareholders in fiscal 2010. And I'm very proud to report, this month we have completed the $2 billion stock repurchase plan that we announced in October 2009 three years ahead of schedule.", "As we consider future use of the cash, we will keep following our four basic guidelines. First, we'll maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Next, we'll continue to reinvest in our core strategies. Third, we'll invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet our return requirements. And last, but importantly, we will return cash to shareholders from surplus cash flow in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.", "This policy demonstrates our ongoing commitment to delivering value to our shareholders.", "Now I'd like to briefly conclude by saying that we remain very optimistic about our company's future as we continue down the path of smart growth, with an emphasis on the customer and cost and productivity gains.", "I want to thank all of you for your support. We are very proud to have returned a record amount of cash to our shareholders in fiscal 2010, especially in this difficult economic environment.", "Now I'll turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Wade. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller - William Blair", "My one question is going to be on gross margins. Can you describe the change from last period? I know the generics moved up through the quarter, but it's hard to see that that would have explained fully the change in trend. And so, without any guidance going forward it's very tough to get the quarters right.", "Can you tell us what might have been unique to this quarter? What here is recurring? And then if you can give us some sense for how you are planning expenses in fiscal '11? Do you think gross profits grow at least in line with sales or less than sales? Thanks.", "Wade Miquelon", "I guess the things I would say is, first as gross profit goes, you know we are up nicely this quarter and a couple of factors that played into it. First, from the front-end we are up nicely, which was a combination of many things; it was more effective pricing promotions, more effective plus markdowns, better buying, lots of different factors, but we feel very good about the directionality of the gross profit in the front end.", "If you look at the pharmacy, basically we had some help from generics in this quarter. As you know, in prior quarters we've had some lags, but we had some help from generics. And that helped to offset some of the underlying reimbursement pressure. And we've also had some positive efforts from reimbursements as well. So that was effectively a mixed bag there.", "Going forward, what I'd really say is that our team model overtime and again understand quarter-to-quarter there can be some volatility. But what you should be seeing overtime is our continued effort to focus on gross profit dollars. And to make sure that those gross profit dollars overtime are able to outrun our SG&A.", "And we feel pretty confident we can do that. But that's really the model that we're focusing on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Co.", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Co.", "So I was wondering if you could just give us some thoughts about SG&A dollar growth as we go into next year. I mean are we going to see that continue to be less than sales or is it going to be more than sales? And how is the CCR program going to fit into that.", "Greg Wasson", "I'll jump and let Wade kind of tag along a little bit. But our goal was obviously to keep our SG&A dollar growth trending down. We feel good with where we've been over the last quarter or two. And our bigger goal was frankly to make sure that just SG&A dollar growth is less than gross profit dollar growth.", "So I think we feel good with where we are with rewiring. We're going to deliver the $1 billion that we had set out by the end of 2011. I think we'll continue to see some improvement from the slowing down of new store openings that we called down actually on this call.", "And we really got some good focus across the entire organization on just cost control. We got a relentless focus on cost. So I think what we could say is we're focused on continuing to drive that trend down and keep it less that gp dollar growth.", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Co.", "Wade, are you going to add anything?", "Wade Miquelon", "No I think Greg said it all, I think we've done a good job of bringing it down. You know you've got some reconciling items. So you can see it when you take out things like new store openings and others. We're making real progress. We feel very confident in our Rewire for Growth uptick from year to year. And beyond that, we put a significant amount of effort into looking at how we do kind of continual reengineering process improvement so that it's really an ongoing process of improving things versus getting to one time.", "So again, we've focused on driving gross profit dollars up and trying to drive SG&A dollars below that. And I think we feel very good about all the good initiatives and interventions we put in place.", "Scott Mushkin - Jefferies & Co.", "So just two quick clarifications and I'll give up the floor. First, was there any one-time payment in that gross margin number you reported in the fourth quarter which was quite strong? That's question number one.", "And number two is; when you give the order weight of what you are going to do with your cash, it seems like the shareholder is number four. Should we think of it as number four or is this just the way you kind of present it?", "Wade Miquelon", "The first one, there is no one-time payment or at least nothing substantive or material; there is nothing I can even think of in that number that was true operating performance. And the second one, I would say because it's number four, it doesn't mean it's number four priority.", "I view these almost as a balanced matrix. We are not going to compromise a strong balance sheet, but we're also not going to focus on returning cash to shareholders.", "Is that the fundamental question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ed Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse", "I just want to start with maybe a follow up. On the gross margin side, Wade, it sounds like you're clearly encouraged by what you're seeing on the front end? Is there going to be follow through on that now, through 2011? Is that how we should be reading how you answered that question?", "Wade Miquelon", "Look, I would say I think the store ops and merchandising folks and marketing folks are doing a terrific job. We're focusing on all levers. Right, we've got a lot of good initiatives and plays. The CCR initiative is working and it continues to improve. The various subsets, things like beer and wine are working well. The focus on price and promotions is working well. We're being very disciplined in buying. We're doing better buying.", "So I really feel like there is a lot of blocking and tackling across all things and I'll to work on that. So I would there is no magic in the improvement, it's just a lot of hard work across a lot of core initiatives and we feel that we're doing the right things right.", "Greg Wasson", "And, Ed, I'd like to add certainly we've still had a tough economy. We still have a tight consumer. And I would agree with everything Wade said. I think we're doing everything we can do to manage through that profitably. But we still have a tough consumer and we're going to have to make sure that we balance swing indoors without giving up too much margin.", "I think the operations folks and merchandisers had done a nice job in balancing that.", "Ed Kelly - Credit Suisse", "All right. And then if I could just add one last question here. Greg, where do you stand on flu shots currently where they were this time last year? And then sort of intertwined with that, you don't give guidance obviously for next year? But at your analyst's meeting a couple of years ago, you laid out getting back to double digit growth.", "The street is going to be up probably at least mid teens now for next year, given where they were before today's report. Can you do double digit growth for 2011? Is that in the mix?", "Greg Wasson", "Ed, I'll answer the second one first. And then flu maybe I'll turn it over to Kermit. But certainly, our goal as we stated in 2008 is to get back to double digit earnings growth. And stronger return on invested capital trends in order to grow our shareholder return or shareholder value.", "So that goal hasn't changed. As far as timing, obviously we don't do that, Ed. I think we're doing all the right things to achieve that goal. As far flu shots, as I said, we've just over two million through yesterday. I'll Kermit kind of maybe take it from there and talk about where we are versus last year. And some of the things that we're doing this year that give us confidence that we're going to hit that 15 million flu shots.", "Kermit Crawford", "Ed, as you remember last year in the first quarter we provided five million flu shots. And as Greg said, through yesterday, we've provided over two million flu shots this year. I think what I'd like to say is last year we were very disappointed that we couldn't help more of our customers because of the lack of the flu vaccine.", "And this year, that won't happen. I mean we're prepared to be there for our customers and to be in stock. So we have an unprecedented campaign this year that we put in place to reach our goal of 15 million flu shots. Greg talked about our 26,000 certified pharmacists and nurse practitioners, more than anyone or any other retailer in this country.", "We're also providing more access and convenience this year versus last year by offering flu shots everyday all day. I actually had a customer send me an email just the other day to talk about how wonderful it was that you could get a flu shot at 9:30 pm at night. And flu patient satisfaction of course, we have had greater than 90% give us the satisfied or very satisfied overall experience.", "So we have truly reformed the delivery system for flu shots in this country. And also, Greg talked about the CDC recommending a universal flu vaccine with everyone over six months of age getting a flu shot. And if you think about last year, our seven million shots only represented 3.5% of the market.", "So with that market significantly growing, this year our 15 million goal is certainly going to be aggressive and a challenge. But we certainly think that that is something that we can beat. And our flu gift card has given us a tremendous amount of early awareness.", "Remember last year the CDC moved up the flu season to September. Normally the flu season doesn't actually start until October. So that gift card has given us a tremendous amount of early awareness. So we're excited about this season which actually doesn't start until sometime in the next two weeks. But we're already two million shots into it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "The execution wage talk about the merchants and the positive gross margin, front end gross margin trends in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about how the performance improved so markedly in 4Q relative to 3Q? That the 4Q gross margin seemed like it improved a lot more in 3Q. Was it something that they improved on even further? What contributed to that material step up in 4Q relative to 3Q?", "Greg Wasson", "I'll jump in. I think certainly for the quarter we saw less aggressive markdowns and summer clearance than we did a year ago. I think that contributed some. I think also less aggressive clearance in our CCR markdowns, we're pretty much through that.", "That obviously contributed some. But I also think they did a nice job in really maintaining and balancing that pay off between price and promotion. And I think we've done a nice job with what we call our key value items. Our basis everyday items and making sure we're priced right to show value.", "As well as what we put on the front and back page of our ads. But also at the same time not giving up excess margin. And I think what we're really enthusiastic about is the opportunity that we still have to drive private brand penetration and the learnings that we are able to bring back from Duane Reed to help us expand that.", "So just a good balance of price and promotion.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Related to the spend, the second part of the question is, I understand the vision long term for the gross margin dollars to grow faster than SG&A dollars which makes sense. Is you think about achieving that goal in 2011, what are the factors that are in your favor or not in your favor to accomplish that goal in 2011?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think what I'm try to say is on the front end we'll continue to I think gain momentum on the quarter initiatives we laid out. CCR as you've seen the results, it's still only partially out there. But they're getting stronger all the time. So we believe that is going to give further momentum.", "If you think about the pharmacy obviously there is a balancing act where we've done a lot of good jobs to take efforts to strengthen and to stabilize reimbursement, although pressure will still be there. But we still got the expansion script life services coming in our favor.", "And then ultimately, we'll have an illusionary wave. We do have things like AMP out there which are unknowns, but I think that in our model we try to do as good as we can as planned for the toughest case. And then if a better case comes, that's a tailwind as well.", "So those are the core kinds of things. Again, a look at the economy before, it's very tough out there. Whether it's going to get easier any time soon? Nobody knows. But we're trying to plan a model. It's going to successful even in tough times. That's what we're focused on.", "Kermit Crawford", "One of the things that Wade has mentioned in the past is that we can't control the introduction of new generic. So between the slowdown in new generics some of the deflation in the old generic and AWP we had a huge headwind against us last year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "One more question on gross margins, but you mentioned improved pricing, promotion and other efficiencies, how much did that contribute to the 70 basis points? And what exactly did you do to improve pricing and promotion? And then, how far along are you on the test of the loyalty card? And did that have any impact?", "And then just, this is around the gross margin topic. Can you talk about what you thought with regard to private label penetration for the year and the quarter? And where are you right now? And what are the goals?", "Greg Wasson", "I think I get all of those Deborah. I think as far as front end there's a contribution to total margin, I don't know if we have broken that out, if we have. But I think we definitely were encouraged by what we did, we do at the front end.", "As far as the breakdown as I said, I think that we are really focusing to make sure that we are price right on key items that really drive value in our consumers mind today. And our folks are looking for valuable private brands, bonus sizes of national brands. And I think that we just did a nice job, as I said not giving up excess, but at the same time swing indoors.", "So, I think we have to understand, and we have a pretty good idea of what the value of our convenience is and what that delta is that we can get for that convenience. And I think we're really on top of making sure we manage that delta.", "I think the next question on loyalty. As you know we have rolled out or started to pilot in three markets, in May of this year. So we got about three to four months of data now. We feel good; we're encouraged with the early results from those three markets. We also, as you know through the acquisition Duane Reade have acquired a loyalty program that gives us a lot more data and some rich data.", "So we're encouraged where we are. We're willing to get about a good six months to may be eight months of data, before we decide how to fine tune it and when we'd begin to implement it nationwide. We should have enough data after the first year to begin to think about, when we'd go nationwide.", "Let's see, I think you talked about private label. What I'm encouraged most with was private label is, we've over-penetrated, over indexed in our private label with what where you would think we do and that's an over-the-counter cost goal, the health and beauty type items. We've under -indexed to our 20% or so total penetration in consumables. That's where Duane Reade brings a tremendous amount of expertise and talent because of their history with Loblaws and come out of a strong private brand consumable retailer.", "So we're looking forward to bring in through a lot of their expertise to drive our penetration in the consumables. And we began that last month or two with our first introduction of the Duane Reade private brand throughout the chain with about 15 to 20 core SKUs.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citi", "So I think it feels like to a lot of us is, this is a real breakout quarter from a gross margin perspective. I mean, was this driven more by process, or technology, or how would you kind of sum it up?", "Greg Wasson", "I think all of the above. I think one of the things that we probably haven't maybe talked about as much or maybe even made that clear is that CCR is much more than just what you physically see in the store. And certainly, we're focused on the results that we're seeing in store sales, customer experience, throughput and all of that. We feel extremely good about it.", "But in the last 12-18 months Bryan Pugh and his team frankly have rebuilt the entire plumbing of our merchandizing process. So we have much better sophistication in the systems to be able to manage multiple planograms or categories. We've really improved our ability to understand pricing in that delta we're talking about for convenience.", "So I think it's frankly a lot of process system improvement that's helping us manage that and achieve that balance I'm talking about between price and promotion more so than we have in the past.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Willoughby - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Just a quick one on Duane Reade dilution going forward. Anecdotally, what's left to consolidate there and can you have a sort of guess on the EPS impact for the next fiscal year?", "Wade Miquelon", "Dilution this year ended up being about $0.05 or $0.06 maybe, a little bit more than we anticipated prior, as we pulled some items aboard. I think next year we're roughly staying around $0.02 to $0.03 dilution. So that might be a little bit on the low end of that, because again we pulled some of those forwards. And then going on, we're move into (our $0.03 to $0.05).", "For the most part, we're now at the point where it's roughly awash. But again, prior to little bit of dilution last year, but I've hit the low end of the $0.02 or $0.03 because we did pull some of those one-times forward into this prior fiscal.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.", "Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets", "On the Rewire, just wanted to clarify, you got about $100 million extra savings in fiscal '010, so you're sort of bumping down the $500 million to $400 million in fiscal '11. Is that exactly right?", "Wade Miquelon", "We had, between the savings that (Duane) cost, its $60 to $70 million more and then the one-times being $40 million less which pushes over.", "Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets", "Do we see a lot of that incremental upside, $500 million to $600 million of net positive in the fourth quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well we certainly saw a nice pick-up because we actually accelerated some of our plans for next year into the fourth quarter. So that certainly helped. But I think moving forward those will carry through as well.", "So our goal is to at least meet our goal of $1 billion, and hopefully we'll beat it. But we're really focused on is meeting it. That's the goal, is to absolutely meet it under any conditions.", "Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets", "And then just on generics, I think Kermit mentioned before, fewer new generics in fiscal '010 and some deflation on some older ones. How are you thinking about fiscal '11 versus fiscal '010 on the generic front sort of all in?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, Tom, I think great year. I think on the generic front where Kermit was going is, last year was a really tough year as far as the new generic growth that we saw versus the year before. We still have a tough or a tighter year for new generics this year, but it's certainly less than the dip that we saw last year from the previous year. And as you know, by next fiscal year, the following fiscal year we're going to be into the new generic wave.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I wanted to ask you, first on the uptick in the remodels, is that sort of the control group, the 40-50 stores? What's the sample size there, and can you discuss how that translates to (inaudible) other stores you got done and stores going forward? And also, can you discuss if you have done any other large metro markets and what the results would be, and what's coming off those markets?", "Greg Wasson", "I think the first number you're referring to that I gave is the 35 store pilot group, which we are seeing a 3.7% or so tick up from the previous quarter. And really that's our best control group, or the best group that we're looking at, because we have a good control group of stores to measure. We feel good with the improvements we're making and the trend we're seeing.", "The other group that we're really focused on that I called out were the 200 stores in the wave two. And we feel good with where they are, as I said the 13 weeks after conversion. So obviously we're running up in comp sales in a tough economy, so we feel good overall. Keep in mind that even though we will only have, or will have 2000 stores converted to CCR, a lot of the CCR benefits we're seeing chain-wide now with the enhanced categories and the assortments that we're able to roll out.", "So hope that answers your question.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "I guess outside of taxes or markets that are very competitive, or the economy nosedives quickly or something, why shouldn't what we're getting at the pilot stores eventually translate to a large majority of the remodels?", "Greg Wasson", "Well, we hope that it would Andy, and the good thing is, is as I said that we're a year into those pilot stores, nearly, and we've made a lot of improvement. So we feel good with that trend.", "Wade Miquelon", "Remember that this is really, I would say kind of foundational work; it's really, you're just trying to get the base platform right for the future, except that it's increasing our sales, it is increasing our margins, it is helping reduce our working capital and we're providing a better customer experience. I think that's the key thing is trying to keep these four metrics positive as we build that base for the future.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "So it sounds like you think, in terms of sales growth, CCR is more of a cumulative process than, you know a one-time wonder, a great remodel, we hit it, that type of thing.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I mean, this is ongoing. This is just the first step of a many-year, (many-light) journey. So it's really trying to improve our store experience to the benefit of our customers.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "And another topic if I could, and then I'll get off. Can you update us on some of the direct payer progress? It might be, you're seeing it here in the marketplace or I think there might have been some internal changes in how you're going to market there or how you are managing that? And perhaps as you exercise that way of going to market, what is the strategic value of having a PBM for Walgreens?", "Greg Wasson", "Well, Andy, we feel good with where we are with our direct-to-payer's. And by payer, we look at that as employers, our pharmacy benefit management partners that we work with, health plans, and the government and so forth. I think a good example of the progress we're making in our direct-to-payer approach is what I talked about with our flu shot. We had national agreements with UnitedHealthcare and CIGNA on providing flu shots to millions of their members as well as many of the regional Blues. And that was a result of Hal Rosenbluth and his team that I think you're alluding to.", "We have consolidated our sales and client services organization under Hal and his teams. We now have one group that's bringing all Walgreen's Pharmacy and Health Wellness solutions to all those payer segments. And I'm feeling very good that we're really encouraged with what's happening there and I think across all payer segments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ann Hynes with Caris & Company.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", "In your prepared comments, you talked about a $1 billion gross profit headwind that you've faced in 2010. I think you said $500 million came from the economy. You mentioned generics, you mentioned AWP.", "When we looked at fiscal 2011, I guess about $1 billion. What do you think will be repeated? And then also maybe what things could be impacting gross profit in 2011 that would be a headwind, like A&P for instance? I guess what are your expectations on that?", "Wade Miquelon", "Ann, it's an excellent question. I guess what I would say is, on a relative year-on-year, the economy is factored. Now it's up to us to make (innovations) to be successful in any economy. So you don't have that kind of, call it step-down effects.", "There is undoubtedly reimbursement pressure. We don't think there's going to be as much pressure as we saw last year. That was probably the greatest year, as we said of $0.5 billion'ish between the less than normal generic lift between AWP and between the variety of other reimbursements.", "So we think it will be challenging, but not as challenging. A key part of that is A&P. There's certainly a lot of activity happening around that, you know for us to speculate when or if that kicks in exactly on the day the amount is probably a bit premature; there is lot of activity. But certainly we're assuming across all reimbursement, it will still be a challenging environment, although I would say probably not as challenging.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", "So is it fair to say, maybe of that $500 million you only experienced half of that in fiscal 2011?", "Wade Miquelon", "I would hesitate to give any number. I think you know it's premature and some of these things are very binary. But I would say that last year, there was a lot of challenging factors and I don't see this year at least repeating that in aggregate.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi Greg, couple of things. On the reimbursement issue, what's the prognosis for State Medicare this year? You would think that that might be tougher than last year. And then long term how do you think the reimbursement tug of war between retail and PBMs plays out? You might think, long term, after the generic cycle maybe it gets tougher secularly and they try to protect profitability.", "How do you think about those two things?", "Greg Wasson", "Hi John, good to hear from you. I think that State Medicaid's AMP, you know I'd kind of lump those all together as Wade said. I think that certainly there's going to be a headwind. And right now there's a lot of moving parts in AMP that we're on top of regarding timing and what the final impact will be.", "But certainly whatever we end up seeing, not only have we planned forward already as Wade said, but I think we'll still be working with states, both regarding State Medicaid as well as Medicare with the government. But as far as state, we think we can bring a lot of value to the states, not only with how we can help them on their pharmacy costs, but also on their total medical costs.", "And that's John, I think where we really are focused. And probably the biggest maybe difference between us and others would be, we're focused on helping provide value to all payers including state to lower the total medical costs and not just pharmacy. So we'll be focused on working with them across the entire medical spend.", "As far as the relationship or the reimbursement environment with the commercial payers, the PBMs and others, I think that it's all about providing value. And I think payers going forward are all going to be looking for help to improve the quality of their healthcare spend as well as controlling that cost. And as I've said several times, keep in mind, pharmacy is only about 10% to 12% of total medical spend for most employers across this country.", "We are seeing employers more and more focused on looking at how to improve the total medical spend, both from a quality and a cost. So I think it's all about us providing value and that's why we're trying to transform community pharmacy as we are doing, to provide more value.", "Wade Miquelon", "As you recall, AMP was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006. And there are certainly reasons that that implementation has been delayed, and one of those is that there's a study out that says over 12,000 independent pharmacies would have to close their doors that couldn't survive in an environment where you have further rate cuts.", "So there is a challenge around the implementation of AMP, and we recognize reimbursement pressure will continue but we expect to be able to manage our commercial segment going forward as we have in the past. And although the pricing index may change, we wouldn't expect it to have a dramatic impact on our current reimbursement economics.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then one final question. When you think about the frond end as it sits today in this economy, how do you look at price elasticity in terms of the question of how much do you want to invest promotionally? How do you look at price elasticity today versus maybe a couple of years ago? And is the dynamic interchange here such that maybe gross profit grows less because of sales growth more because of margins improving than might have been the case a while back?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think the key thing is that in any challenging economy, one learning globally is, is it is important to focus on value. But value doesn't always mean price. In fact value is about reframing the value you provide. We provide fantastic convenience; we have great private label offerings. If you look across the store, we're expanding things to make it even more convenient for people to get more things.", "As Greg mentioned, we've done a terrific job of focusing on things like the key value items that people really, really, want to make sure that we're sharp on. So I think the important thing for us is not to just get into a price war game, but to really say, what are the things that we can do to provide value.", "And even on the back end flu shot, a flu shot from Walgreen's is $30, is a tremendous value. It's cheaper than going to a doctor and getting it, and it's certainly a lot cheaper than getting sick and being out of work or (hastening) contaminant flu or whatever. So I think we are in a good spot to provide good value in the front-end and the backend. And I guess what I would just say is, it's important for us to recognize that that doesn't mean just cutting prices.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Hans for any additional or closing remarks.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you for joining us today. We'll announce September monthly sales on October 5. After that our next Investor Relations event will be our Analyst Day on November 4.", "We look forward to seeing many of you there. For those who will not be attending in person, Analyst Day will be simultaneously webcast through our Walgreen's Investor Relations website.", "Our next quarterly financial announcement will be Wednesday, December 22; that's when we will announce fiscal 2011 first quarter results. Until then, thank you for listening, and we look forward to talking to you soon.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's call.

At this time I am pleased to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Hans.  Please go ahead, sir.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you Jennifer and good morning everyone.  Welcome to our first quarter conference call.  Today Greg Wasson, our President and CEO, will discuss the quarter\u2019s highlights and our continued progress in executing our core strategies.  In addition, Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will detail our first quarter financial results.", "Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Kermit Crawford, our President of Pharmacy Services.  When we get to your questions please limit yourself to one.  As a reminder today\u2019s presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and I would direct you to our Web site at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliations.

Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Wasson", "Thank you Rick and thank you everyone for joining us on our call. This morning I want to cover three main points.  First I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results.  As you saw in our release this morning this was a particularly strong quarter in terms of earnings growth as we continue our focus on gross profit margins and controlling our costs.", "I\u2019d like to point out that we were up against a very strong quarter a year ago as well.  Second I\u2019ll discuss the economic environment and some of the challenges we\u2019re likely to face as we move into the second quarter and the balance of the year.  And finally I want to highlight our progress in the quarter on our key initiatives, particularly some of the great work our people are doing and also bring you up to speed on our flu shot program.", "We reported record first quarter sales of $17.3 billion, which are up 6% from $16.4 billion last year.  Net earnings for the quarter were $580 million, up almost 19% from $489 million in the same quarter in 2010.  First quarter net earnings per diluted share were up 26.5% to a record 62 cents.  That compared with 49 cents per diluted share in the first quarter a year ago, which included 3 cents in restructuring and restructure related costs associated with our Rewiring for Growth initiative.", "Strong cash flow trends continued this quarter with cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $892 million.  Now taking a more in depth look at the quarter, let me turn to our front end performance.  In this chart we\u2019re comparing our front end performance this quarter to last year\u2019s first quarter by month.  As you can see, we cycled some challenging comparisons in September and October.", "For the quarter front end comps increased by 0.4% versus 2.7% a year ago.  We continue to focus on and enhance our approach to merchandising to strike the right balance between margin and sales.  We\u2019re sourcing product globally and having great results from our recently opened office in Hong Kong and we\u2019re managing our pricing models and promotional investments.  All of this is having a positive impact on front end margins.", "We continue to expand our new beer and wine convenience category.  We\u2019re now in nearly 5000 stores up from just under 2000 in November 2009.  And that growth has contributed more than 75 basis points to the front end comp.  Our fresh food initiative is bringing healthy products to food (grocers) in Chicago and other select locations and we\u2019re taking the best of Duane Reade\u2019s approach to urban retailing and beauty and expanding it into select Walgreen\u2019s stores.", "We\u2019re also integrating the best of Walgreen\u2019s pharmacy expertise into Duane Reade.  As we roll out our customer centric retailing initiative across the chain we\u2019re seeing improved sales, increased efficiencies, lower inventory and a better customer experience evidenced by our improved customer satisfaction scores.  We call it a four-way win and you\u2019ll see it reflected in our front end comp, gross margins and SG&A.", "For second quarter our December holiday season will once again be influenced by the final days.  We opened the season with a solid Thanksgiving weekend but this is an important week for us.  With our stores open Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we\u2019re an ideal destination for last minute shoppers.  Just as our front end performed well this quarter, our pharmacy turned in solid results especially when you consider double digit script comps in September and October of the prior year.", "Prescription sales in comparable stores grew 0.9% compared to last year while comparable script growth was 2% over the same quarter last year.  Recall that flu shots are included in our script comps.  Prescription sales accounted for nearly 66% of sales in the quarter and climbed 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year.  As of November 30th we increased our leading retail prescription market share 40 basis points from a year ago to 19.7%.", "Even with our strong results this quarter we believe it\u2019s important to remain very focused on the economic outlook and the challenges it presents for our business in the quarters ahead.  Unemployment remains high at 9.8% across the country.  Spending on discretionary items remains slow and value continues to be a priority for customers.  We are convinced that the new consumer focused on convenience, value and day to day necessities is here to stay.  And we intend to be well positioned to serve her needs.", "Looking ahead, we expect to see continued pressure from third party payers including the government.  While it\u2019s too early to speculate on the eventual impact of AWP, states will continue to experience budget difficulties and as a result we anticipate increased reimbursement pressures.  While we face uncertainty in the economic and political environment, our results this quarter demonstrate that the execution of our core strategies is generating the results we want to achieve.  We\u2019re seeing the impact of slowing store openings in our performance.", "We\u2019re on track for store openings of 2-1/2 to 3% in fiscal 2011 compared with nearly 9% growth just three years earlier.  Our efforts to enhance the customer experience are gaining momentum.  CCR along with other initiatives is helping us serve customers more effectively and is driving better results for the front end.  And we continue to remain focused on our cost reduction and productivity efforts to provide $1 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2011 versus our base year of 2008.", "The impact of these savings efforts is clear when you look at the progress we have made in SG&A dollar growth this quarter and over the last few years.  To give you a sense of how deeply our strategies are penetrating here is a look at CCR through Q1.  We have converted or opened approximately 2100 CCR stores, which is nearly 30% of the chain.  By the end of 2011 we will have reached our plan of more than 70% of the chain or approximately 5500 existing stores transitioned to CCR.", "Now let me provide a brief update on our flu program.  As we mentioned in our last call, we have 26,000 certified immunizing pharmacists across our store base plus nurse practitioners and take care clinics to deliver flu shots all day every day.  As a result, through the end of the first quarter we were able to administer 5.6 million flu shots, more shots than we were able to provide last year in the middle of the H1N1 pandemic.", "Today aside from the federal government Walgreen\u2019s provides more flu shot immunizations than any other single entity in America.  This is part of our overall initiative to transform community pharmacy and give our highly trained and skilled pharmacists and nurse practitioners the opportunity to provide access to care and preventative services in a way that no one else can.  And our efforts in flu are just beginning.", "We\u2019re taking our proven expertise and expanding into the nearly $40 billion total immunization market.  Let me make one final comment on the flu.  We don\u2019t know how the rest of the season will play out.  There are fewer shots being administered across the country this season but with strong support from our vendors and a 2 cent per share flu vaccine inventory write off this quarter we believe there is minimal inventory risk for the rest of the season.", "At the same time we are prepared to continue serving our customers who come in for flu shots.  With our strategies in place we have a strong foundation to achieve our financial objectives.  At analyst day we stated a goal of increasing gross profit dollar growth by 100 basis points faster than SG&A dollar growth.  And with the upcoming generic wave gross profit dollar growth becomes a critical top line metric.", "Wade will get into this in more detail but I want to provide some context.  As you can see from this chart, this quarter we\u2019re getting the relationship between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth right.  The impact of the recession into late 2009, generic cycles from a high point in 2007 to a low in third quarter 2010 and meaningful reimbursement impact in 2010 all affected our gross profit dollar growth across quarters.", "We clearly must continue to manage the impact all these issues have on our business.  As we make progress working for example with states and payers to find solutions on reimbursement for all stakeholders and continue to generate momentum on our initiatives, our goal is to create solid gross profit dollar growth.  In terms of SG&A dollars, you can see we\u2019ve had periods when SG&A dollar growth exceeded gross profit dollar growth.", "Our goal over the past several years has been to create a culture where cost efficiency and a focus on productivity are always part of our decision set.  As our results show on this quarter, we\u2019re right on track.  We are in the final year of our rewire initiative.  We expect to reach $1 billion in savings and transition the discipline of rewire into continuous process improvement innovation to make it part of our DNA.", "Our goal continues to be annual SG&A growth of 6-1/2 to 7-1/2% for fiscal 2011, which includes costs associated with the restructuring, Duane Reade and new store openings.  At the same time though we expect we will continue to have some of the volatility you see on this chart from quarter to quarter even as we keep our growth target in sight.  Keep that volatility in mind as you consider our performance in the second quarter, which is typically driven by seasonal sales and cough, cold and flu, all of which we can\u2019t predict in advance.", "Shifting from SG&A, I want to conclude by emphasizing our commitment to creating value for shareholders.  Over our history we have paid a dividend for 312 straight quarters and raised our dividend for 35 consecutive years.  In the last eight years the company\u2019s dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 22%.  And in the last two years we have returned a record amount of cash back to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Last July the board approved a dividend increase of 27.3% compared to the year ago dividend and during the quarter we paid out 17-1/2 cents in dividends per share.  As a part of our share repurchase programs we completed our $2 billion initiative, buying $360 million in company stock.  We launched our newly announced $1 billion share repurchase program with a purchase of an additional $150 million.", "These share repurchases added 4 cents of EPS to our quarterly results.  Through both the dividend and share repurchase programs we have returned a total of $676 million to shareholders in the quarter, putting us on track to continue our tradition of creating meaningful, long-term shareholder value.  Before I turn it over to Wade I want to wrap up by saying that while we are very pleased with this quarter we are far from complacent.", "We still face a difficult economic and political environment with a lot of uncertainty and we don\u2019t expect our competitors to stand still either.  Nonetheless, it is great to see our strategies yielding the results all of us expect from our company.  These results reaffirm our belief in the work we\u2019re doing and in our conviction that we can become MyWalgreen\u2019s for everyone in America.  That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, making the most of our center of gravity, our 7600 stores, owning outright the strategic territorial well.", "We want to ensure when customers experience Walgreen\u2019s they know we are there to help them live well, stay well and get well.  Delivering products that meet customers\u2019 everyday needs and providing solutions that improve prevention and chronic disease management, we are focused on becoming America\u2019s first choice for health and daily living needs.  As we do that right we will deliver value for customers, for our 244,000 employees who are working hard this season and for our shareholders.", "In closing today I want to thank all of our employees who have done so much over the past couple of years to make our results this quarter a reality.  We\u2019re asking people to work differently and think differently and I know it\u2019s not always easy.  But Walgreen\u2019s people are resilient and committed.  We wouldn\u2019t be here today without all of their hard work and good ideas.  So thank you to every one of our employees who is doing what it takes to make this such a great company.  With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you Greg and good morning everyone.  This morning I\u2019ll review our financial results in more detail including a discussion of recent gross margin and SG&A trends.  I\u2019ll take you through our other key financial metrics and I\u2019ll update you on our front end and pharmacy activity.  Greg covered our sales and earnings so I\u2019m going to start off this morning with some detail on our prescriptions.", "Prescription sales increased by 5.3% accounting for 65.8% of sales in the quarter.  We filled 202 million prescriptions, an increase of 4.6% from a year ago including 0.8 percentage points from patients filling more 90-day versus 30-day prescriptions.  Pharmacy comp sales increased by 0.9%, front end comp sales increased by 0.4% and total comp sales increased by 0.8%.  Finally, our script comp increased by 2% versus the challenging 9.2% a year ago.", "As Greg detailed, we were cycling difficult comps in the quarter from the impact of H1N1 on both our front end and our pharmacy.  Because of those difficult year over year flu comparisons, traffic was down 0.9% for the quarter but we\u2019re very pleased the basket improved by 1.3%.  Turning to gross profit, our margins increased by 80 basis points in the quarter to 28.5% while our gross profit increased by $407 million or 9%.", "As in fourth quarter 2010, our front end margins improved significantly year over year as a result of improved merchandising including promotions and pricing, sell through and other efficiencies.  Recall in the year ago quarter we had markdowns associated with our CCR inventory reductions.  Last year we had $28 million of inventory impact versus only $1 million this year.  On the pharmacy side margins were up slightly benefitting from generics but partially offset by reimbursement pressure.", "We also began cycling the impact of AWP, which went into effect in September of 2009.  To help you better understand the quarterly progression of our gross margin let\u2019s look more closely at how margins have progressed over the past six quarters.  This chart illustrates the directional impact of the front end and the pharmacy and provides the combined impact year over year.  In this quarter as in last quarter, we were comping lower front end margins.", "Each of the last four quarters has seen improvement in the front end, making increasing gross margin gains more challenging to achieve.  In pharmacy we were comping a positive margin driven a year ago by generics.  Finally, a couple other considerations as you model our margins and gross profit dollar growth for future quarters.  First, we will continue to see some volatility resulting from timing of generic introductions.  As we said before, we expect a lift from new generics in 2011 to be less than the lift we received in 2010.", "In addition, January is typically the month when the benefit plans reset and we see some changes.  As a result, we expect to see some incremental reimbursement pressure.  I\u2019d like to now turn to our SG&A trends.  As Greg highlighted, SG&A dollars increased by $263 million or 7% on a GAAP basis versus 7.4% a year ago and a two-year stacked SG&A of 14.4%.  Now this compares favorably to our previous first quarter two-year stacks highlighted in the graph, stepping down steadily from 28% in 2008.", "This graph adjusts SG&A further for Duane Reade and Rewire.  Our two-year stacked SG&A growth fully adjusted is 10.3%, an even more favorable comparison to our prior year\u2019s adjusted two-year stack growth, which showed a steady decrease from 28% in 2008.  Looking at the first quarter more closely you can see that we reported SG&A growth of 7%.  Duane Reade was our major swing factor in the quarter, impacting SG&A by 20 basis points or $8 million from acquisition expenses and by 410 basis points from operating expenses, leaving us with core SG&A growth in the quarter of 2.9%.", "Our net costs for Rewire had a 20 basis point positive impact on our reported quarter as they were lower than a year ago.  With respect to Duane Reade let me remind you that we continue to expect approximately 2 cents of net profit dilution in this fiscal year.  Taking a look at SG&A growth by quarter for fiscal 2010 you can see that last year our second quarter SG&A growth was 5.1% due to a slow down in our CCR roll out and solid cost management in light of an earlier flu season last year.", "This will be a particularly difficult quarter from an SG&A compare standpoint.  In the third and fourth quarters SG&A growth stepped up as a result of our Duane Reade acquisition and these fluctuations demonstrate that unique drivers impact both our gross profit and our SG&A dollar growth.  While we may continue to experience volatility on a quarterly basis, I want to remind everyone of our longer term SG&A goals and how this quarter fits into that framework.", "As we stated at analyst day, we have an SG&A dollar growth goal of 6.5-7.5% for fiscal 2011 with the following building blocks.  Our goal for SG&A growth attributable to new store openings is 2.5-3% for the year.  In this quarter it was up 3% as a result of the impact from lower new store openings.  In the quarter we opened about 60 fewer stores than last year while next quarter we expect to equal last year\u2019s pace for store openings.", "Our goal for SG&A attributable to our business mix and inflation is about 2 to 2-1/2% for the year.  But in the first quarter it was actually down 0.1%.  This is a tribute to the fantastic store level expense control in the quarter in spite of continued wage inflation and business investment SG&A pressure.  Finally, we anticipate an SG&A impact from Duane Reade acquisition and our restructuring initiatives to be about 2% for the year.", "Remember we will cycle out of this in April so almost half of the year will not be impacted by Duane Reade.  However, this entire quarter did include the Duane Reade impact.  In summary, we believe 6.5-7.5% is the appropriate fiscal 2011 goal given what we know today.  We hope all this gives you better understanding of the volatility we\u2019re experiencing quarter to quarter and the building blocks of our SG&A and the progress that we have made over the past couple of years.", "And finally I want to tie all this back to our financial goals, particularly how we will work to return to consistent double digit earnings per share growth.  As we have said, after respective inputs to our model, SG&A is where we believe we have the greatest control.  Our long-term goal is 3.5-4.5% growth.  To meet our long-term goal of double digit EPS growth we need to grow gross profit dollars by about 100 basis points more than our SG&A dollars.", "And as we meet our financial goals we will continue to include our shareholders in that success.  As you know, we completed our $2 billion share repurchase authorization this quarter and we have announced and executed against our new $1 billion authorization.  Now I\u2019d like to give you some more detail on some of the initiatives that helped lead to our results this quarter.  As you know, our Rewire assumptions are incorporated into the SG&A goals but we will continue to provide quarterly detail through the completion of the program.", "We are on track for $1 billion in savings by the end of this fiscal year and this quarter we recorded an incremental savings of 9 cents versus the year ago period related to our Rewire initiatives.  Restructuring charges in the quarter were $8 million and we anticipate approximately $40 million in related expenses in the remaining months of fiscal 2011.  Since inception we have incurred $366 million on our Rewire program. ", "Our total annual benefit run rate is now at 55 cents per share versus our 2008 base.  Turning to our income statement, we increased our LIFO provision in the quarter to 2%, up from 1.8% a year ago, giving us a LIFO charge of $42 million versus $34 million a year ago.  Our net interest expense of $20 million is on trend with the year ago as is our tax rate of 37%.  As a result of our share repurchases, our average shares outstanding including dilution were 934 million, down 5.9% from last year\u2019s 993 million share count.", "Cash and short-term investments were $2.1 billion, down from last year\u2019s $3.2 billion.  While our cash and short-term investments are down, we have been very active over the past 12 months.  We invested $1 billion in capital expenditures, $1.1 billion in Duane Reade including assumption of debt and $252 million in final buys and other acquisitions.  And we also returned $2.6 billion to shareholders.", "This was all funded by very strong cash flow generation.  Accounts receivable, inventories and payables are the working capital components that we can most directly impact.  Accounts receivable were $2.5 billion or down 4.1% versus the prior year due to changes in Medicare Part D payment terms and offset partially by Duane Reade.  LIFO inventories of $7.9 billion were up 5.8% year over year, which includes $300 million in Duane Reade inventories.", "Accounts payable were just short of $5 billion, down 1.7% versus last year.  Looking more closely at our inventory trends, total FIFO inventories increased by 6.6% against a total drugstore count increase of 7.1% including Duane Reade.  On a per store inventory basis inventories decreased by 0.4% following a decrease of 13.7% a year ago.  Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $1.2 billion and on trend with last year\u2019s $1.2 billion.  Free cash flow of $892 million was slightly higher than last year\u2019s $864 million and we expect capital expenditures for the year to be about $1.4 billion.", "For my final set of metrics I will update our front end and pharmacy productivity performance.  This chart gives our front end sales per store by class of year and it shows that sales increased from Year 1 to Year 5 by 44-51%, which I\u2019ve highlighted here for you.  Despite a tough economy and our focus on rebalancing margin and sales, our performance stands up to last year, which we feel very good about.", "In addition, our sales by class year remain very close to our averages.  Looking at first year sales, the last nine class years you can see that front end sales have averaged about $2 million per store each class year.  When we recognize that recent first year sales are slightly lower than average but especially in light of current economic conditions and with our CCR goal to increase front end sales productivity balanced with margins, we are pleased that these first year numbers are remaining steady over time.", "On the pharmacy side of our business scripts more than doubled from Year 1 to Year 5 and our 2005 stores, the most recent class of stores with five years in operation, are performing quite well.  They\u2019re posting the highest growth in scripts per day as well as the most scripts per day per store.  And first year script counts continue to average between 110 and 120 scripts per day.  So as you can see, the numbers show our pharmacies are continuing to turn into a consistent performance despite one of the most challenging economies we have faced in years and factors such as a number of new 24-hour stores and the slower introduction of blockbuster drugs.", "Now I want to close today emphasizing that we are very pleased with our performance this quarter.  We posted strong earnings with an emphasis on cost control.  Gross profit dollar growth and SG&A growth are trending in the right direction although we remain focused on the continuing volatility in our quarter to quarter performance.", "But nonetheless we feel we are on the right track to meet our goals.  Our strategies are yielding the results that we expect and we are creating value for all of our stakeholders.  I want to thank you for your support and with that I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to Rick for Q&A.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you Wade.  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our prepared remarks.  We are now ready to take questions.", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you sir.  The question and answer session will be conducted electronically.  If you would like to ask a question please do so by pressing the star key followed by the digit 1 on your touchtone telephone.  If you are using a speakerphone please be sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment.  Once again that is star, 1 on your touchtone telephone to ask a question.  And our first question will come from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf", "Hi.  Good morning and congratulations on the fruition of a lot of what you\u2019ve been working on.  I wanted to ask you I think at the analyst day you laid out about it was around 500 million of dollars over last fiscal year of expenses from AWP and generics and reimbursement pressures and I think everybody understands this year that as you said, it\u2019s less controllable for you all given it\u2019s partly political and other pressures.", "But could you help us give us qualitatively your sense of to what degree it will be less this year?  I assume you think it\u2019ll be less.  And maybe even quantitatively if you have some kind of range budget, how much less those expenses might be this year?", "Wade Miquelon", "You know Andy, I\u2019m not going to give a specific number.  I mean I think we said last year that last year in terms of about half a billion dollar step up in reimbursement pressure and again a combination of things like AWP, less generics, etcetera.  But there is certainly reimbursement pressure that exists.  We\u2019ll have some this year.  I think I\u2019ve said that we don\u2019t anticipate it\u2019s going to be as tough as last year.  So with that I\u2019ll leave it there.", "Greg Wasson", "Yeah Andy, you know and I think what we had said several times is that 2010, all that coming together last year was against a pretty good year on 2009.  So we don\u2019t expect the hurdle to be as much.  The other thing we do know is that 2011 will have less new generic introductions than 2010.  But we\u2019re hoping that all that that came together in 2010 was pretty huge impact to have to go against over 2009.", "Wade Miquelon", "There are unknowns too.  AWP agreement, the impact of that remains to be seen so I think even there are things that we just don\u2019t know as well.", "Andrew Wolf", "Okay.  I appreciate that.  But I mean I think most people are looking at this and saying generics, I think you\u2019ve been talking about it, a lot less pressure.  Reimbursements at least on the private side - less pressure.  Is it fair to say the government and the state Medicaid as they look at AWP, that\u2019s where the most variability might come in?", "Greg Wasson", "Yeah.  I think Andy we\u2019re going to continue to see pressure across all buckets, commercial, government and states and I think we\u2019ll continue to do what we have done over the years.  Certainly we\u2019re going to negotiate for fair and predictable rates as we have in the past.  We have got to begin to provide and continue to provide value added services that help reduce the entire medical cost, not just pharmacy such as immunizations and so forth and certainly keep a focus on our costs.", "With that said, I think the plans typically reset in January and so I think we\u2019ve got to keep that in mind for Q2.  I think the states we will see as they try to manage their budgets, they\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to reduce costs.  And that\u2019s the reason we\u2019ve got to get to them with solutions that are beyond just pharmacy reimbursement but helping them on their medical costs with our take care clinics and everything else that we think we can do to help them so in addition to the increase in generic utilization here.", "So we\u2019re going to continue to see pressure but I think we understand that.  We\u2019re going to continue to work to provide value.", "Andrew Wolf", "Okay.  And just I wanted to ask on the basket size being up in dollars, if you can give us a flavor for whether any of that was item comps, was that all on the price side?  And just if it was price driven, was it actually getting some price increasing in the drugstore categories or was it more efficient promoting?", "Greg Wasson", "Yeah.  I would say Andy, it was a little bit of both as far as item and price.  But I think Brian and Kim as I\u2019ve said and I think this past quarter I feel good with how they have managed their price and promotion.  I think they\u2019ve really gotten laser focused on finding the right items to drive value in both the everyday items that we have as well as in the ads and making sure that we\u2019re buying better.  I think better sourcing, which has created less markdowns over the past quarter and the quarter before.  So I think it\u2019s kind of all of the above.  I think they have really done a nice job figuring out how to drive and shop value for the consumer with key items.", "Andrew Wolf", "Okay.  And what percent of the SKUs, this being my last question, that you took out of the store, what percent or maybe in hundreds have you kind of put back in where you kind of overdid it on some of the rationalization?", "Wade Miquelon", "It\u2019s really just in the low hundreds, a couple hundred SKUs.  I mean I think and given the magnitude of the circa 5000 SKU reduction I\u2019d say that they were pretty close to the mark.  We had some opportunities but again, we\u2019ve added back just a couple hundred SKUs.", "Andrew Wolf", "Got it.  All right.  Well, thanks a lot.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks Andy.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey guys.  Thanks for taking my question.  So I think you\u2019re hinting that we should not extrapolate the first quarter results into the second quarter.  It seems like there are some tougher compares.  So my question is that if holiday sales are strong and then we get into January and February and flu, cough and cold are up year over year and they were basically non-existent last year, can you see nice earnings growth in the second quarter?", "I guess I also want to understand your front end gross margin improvement in the context of some of the promotions you\u2019re running right now.  So first, what level of vendor support are you receiving from programs like Jingle Cash or is it all self funded?  And how should we think of your level of promotion activity during the holiday season year over year?  And then finally, how with the promotional program of spend 25 get a $5 coupon, does that work mathematically so gross margins are not pressured?  So I mean there\u2019s a lot in there.", "Wade Miquelon", "Okay.  That\u2019s a lot so I\u2019ll start and then maybe Greg can take it.  And if we miss something you\u2019ll have to come back and help us circle the wagons here.", "Scott Mushkin", "Sure.  Sorry it\u2019s a lot.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think this is definitely a very, very good quarter so we feel good about that.  Moving ahead I mean we\u2019re focused really on getting back to those long-term goals.  So I think that the message here is that quarter to quarter in any given quarter there can be some volatility up or down and we really want to keep people focused on kind of the more longer term picture of creating value.", "There are some unknowns still in the quarter.  We\u2019ll see how the holiday season finishes out.  We\u2019ll see if we get cough, cold.  All those thing will help.  So I think all we\u2019re really saying is first and foremost there will be some quarterly volatility.  But we remain committed over the long haul to deliver these goals.  And we feel that we\u2019re off to a very good start for the fiscal.", "Greg Wasson", "Yeah.  Scott, hopefully I\u2019m not repeating what Wade said, I\u2019m trying to get to your questions.  I do think that as you said, Q2 is highly dependent on Christmas sales, holiday sales and certainly cough, cold and flu.  We don\u2019t know how that will turn out.  It\u2019s hard to predict.  And we\u2019re certainly going to drive as much as we possibly can.  To your point, we are against some tough compares in both SG&A from last year.  We did a nice job last year because of a weak flu season and weak holiday sales with cost containment and managing SG&A.", "And with gross margin as well if you recall because of the less markdowns last year we had a pretty good margin increase in December, which offset the tough comps.  So we do have some tough compares.  But at the same time we\u2019re going to continue to drive price and promotion.  We think a lot of our initiatives that are clicking in will help.  Keep in mind and I think we did say at the same time, we do have the January time period when third party plans typically reset and we may see some incremental reimbursement pressure there.", "But you put all that in together and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on driving GP above SG&A as we stated in our goal to be at the annual meeting at the analyst day.", "Scott Mushkin", "So that\u2019s really great color.  So it sounds to me it\u2019s safe to say that how goes sales is kind of how goes second quarter because of some of the tough compares.  Is that fair to say?", "Greg Wasson", "I would say obviously top line is everything but I think it\u2019s all three.  I think we\u2019ve got to drive comps as we said.  But it will be how we manage the gross profit and the margin, SG&A and how we manage that against those tough compares from last year.", "Scott Mushkin", "And then getting into the Jingle Cash promotion and I know I threw a lot into my first question but how do I look at that from a mathematically I mean $25 spend and get a $5 coupon to use in a week?  Is there a level of lift that we should be looking for when you report your December sales in January where we know the program has been successful?", "Greg Wasson", "Scott, obviously we\u2019re still analyzing the performance of it as we speak.  It ends I think it\u2019s actually tomorrow.  So I think it\u2019s been a good promotion.  I\u2019ll tell you from awareness standpoint such as you\u2019re aware of it yourself, I think it\u2019s been a great promotion from us.  We\u2019re analyzing the numbers now.  We\u2019ll know more as we complete the program.  But I think it was a good opportunity for us to get out there on national TV and advertising.  I think we have driven awareness and I think we\u2019ve driven people in our stores because of it.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay.  And then the final question and I\u2019ll yield the floor.  When we look at Duane Reade and we have been very impressed and we ran a whole note about that, and we look at Walgreen\u2019s and some of the stores in your urban areas, I mean how quickly can you get some of these stores, Duane Reade-ized?  And are there 1000 stores in the Walgreen\u2019s portfolio that can bring in most of what Duane Reade is doing?  And what would the costs be and how quickly could that be done?", "Wade Miquelon", "I guess I would say is we\u2019re not going to just do a cut and paste of what we\u2019ve done at Duane Reade.  I mean what Duane Reade has done is right for Duane Reade and there are elements of that that are right at different stores and different permutations.  So we\u2019re already taking many of the learnings across whether it\u2019s private label or beauty or fresh, etcetera.  But again, there is not going to be just one cut and paste that goes back across the whole franchise.", "Greg Wasson", "Yeah Scott and I\u2019ll weigh in here.  I think the way to look at Duane Reade in addition to what it gave us in New York as the leading position in that market, many of their initiatives that you\u2019re talking about really support the initiatives we have in place.  Private brand - we\u2019re expanding and enhancing private brand.  They\u2019ve got some great expertise there so we\u2019re going to bring that together and be able to accelerate that.", "Their upscale beauty, fresh food - the good thing is they really complement and enhance many of our initiatives, which will help us accelerate.  So it really won\u2019t be just a plug and play of 1000 stores here, 1000 stores there.  It really depends on what makes sense across the entire footprint for us to put in place.  There may be some stores where we expand grocery, there may be some stores where an upscale beauty offering makes sense and there may be others where it doesn\u2019t.", "So it\u2019ll be - it\u2019s pretty much just helping us accelerate the initiatives and that\u2019s the reason we think we have such a tremendous opportunity in the front end of our stores.  CCR is the beginning and these initiatives now will help us really drive the front end.", "Scott Mushkin", "Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions.  I really appreciate it.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes.  Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Willoughby", "Hey Wade.  I was a bit surprised that cash flow wouldn\u2019t be up more year over year on the stronger earnings.  Are you scraping the bottom of the pickle barrel on the working capital improvement?  And then just secondarily, do you have a share base goal for fiscal \u201911 that you mentioned?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, they\u2019re still pricing more pickles in there.  I think recall a year ago I think we had same store inventory down around 14% or something.  So that\u2019s part of what just cycling that kind of number.  And in these numbers now of course we have if you extracted Duane Reade and the impact they have of receivable, payable and inventory, actually the numbers would look a little bit more impressive.", "So I think we certainly have opportunities in working capital and in particular inventory and we\u2019re focused against that and we\u2019ll continue to drive that.  With respect to the share goal, I mean I really can\u2019t speculate.  As you know, we\u2019ve got the billion dollar program out there.  We\u2019ve announced that we\u2019d like to complete that within two years.  How fast again we\u2019ll go with that remains to be seen.", "Robert Willoughby", "Okay.  And lastly, just on if you look at the Lipitor opportunity can you remind us are you expecting a better gross profit dollar per script on that product or will there be pressure on that gross margin dollar?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yeah.  I think Robert any time with a generic you will see an increased gross profit per dollar.  So how much it\u2019ll be is yet to be determined but certainly over the branded product we\u2019ll see an increased gross profit.", "Robert Willoughby", "That\u2019s great.  Thank you.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark Miller", "Hi.  Good morning.  My question is on the CCR store remodels.  You\u2019re not providing the breakout by category and you didn\u2019t comment on the lift and probably because a lot of the initiatives here apply across the whole chain.  But would you be willing to sort of break some of the prior comments on the comp lift you\u2019re seeing versus control stores?  Are you seeing a different rate of gross margin improvement in those remodeled stores?  If you can comment on the cost of running those stores with fewer SKUs and any further customer research you have done on those.", "Greg Wasson", "Yeah Mark, Greg.  I do think your first point is right on.  We have actually had 2200 or so stores that are actually converted.  But you know, a lot of what we\u2019re doing in CCR now is embedded throughout the entire chain.  So I think that is what\u2019s helping us with our comp and our margins and so forth.  With that said, we\u2019re seeing good customer satisfaction scores.  We\u2019re continuing to see efficiencies in the stores themselves with more holding power of the best selling items, less stock room inventories.  So therefore that\u2019s helping us with store labor.", "It is our four-way win that we\u2019re looking for.  So the trends that we shared in quarters before are still for the most part directionally the same.  And but it gets more difficult as we spread most of CCR throughout the entire chain to compare and convert the store to the rest of the chain.", "Mark Miller", "Okay.  And then my other question is on purchasing and sourcing.  I guess we\u2019re talking a lot about the things that Walgreen is doing, interfacing with the customer and the assortment.  But I\u2019d like to look at the other side and think about initial markup.", "Can you just tell us again where we are with direct imports?  You did highlight some initial gains but I guess my understanding is Walgreen\u2019s is still very underdeveloped in terms of contracting and bringing your own product out of the Orient.  So where are we in that and just give us if there was any long range objectives you can share, that\u2019d be helpful.", "Greg Wasson", "Well, yeah Mark, I think we are probably in the beginning stages.  We have sourced product from the Orient for years.  Obviously we used a third party entity to help us with that and so we have set up an office in Hong Kong.  We have got folks over there that are beginning to become educated and more informed as far as what we can do directly ourselves.  We feel good there.  But we are in the beginning stages.", "Wade Miquelon", "And we have also made a lot of broadly, both domestically and overseas, a lot of inroads on better private label buying or private brand buying I should say.  And I think that we\u2019ll only get better and better in that domain as well.", "Mark Miller", "And just a final question if you think about the gross margin change on the front end, how much of it would you say would be reduction of markdowns, more appropriate promotion if you will versus improvement in the initial markup?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think it\u2019s all the factors we laid out, right?  It\u2019s more effective pricing, more effective promotion, less markdowns.  I mean I think all of the more effective use of funds, straight funds, I think all of those I would say are fairly balanced.  There is no one in particular that stands out.", "Mark Miller", "All right.  Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And next we\u2019ll take a question from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Fassler", "Thanks a lot.  Good morning to you.  My primary question relates to expenses.  Clearly some terrific progress here at the core.  You guided to 6-1/2 to 7-1/2% SG&A growth for the year.  You were 7% this quarter and store growth is going to come down progressively.  So any reason why the SG&A growth wouldn\u2019t - why this wouldn\u2019t be the quarter of highest SG&A growth and why you might not see decelerating cost growth from here?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think part of what will help guide you is to go back and look at that year ago trend and where we cycle.  In particular last year the second quarter was a very good quarter for SG&A so that\u2019s one of the harder ones to cycle.  And then as you move forward a month or two post that we move out of Duane Reade.  That helps us.  So I think really I would just guide you to look at the various building blocks we\u2019ve given and then also to look at the year ago period for kind of a two-year stacked look at some of those.", "Matthew Fassler", "And are there any incremental cost cutting initiatives Wade, that you have implemented since the commencement of the fiscal year that could contribute incrementally to that expense decline?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think what we\u2019re trying to do is rather than get into these once every periodic major cost cutting efforts or reengineering or whatever efforts, we\u2019re trying to really made kind of reengineering cost discipline a way of life so that we don\u2019t get into that position.  And so we\u2019ll see what additional benefit comes beyond the billion in future years.  But I guess what I would say is we\u2019re really looking at it as how do we continually transform and reengineer to be as effective as possible in all areas.", "Greg Wasson", "And this is Greg.  I\u2019d like to add to that.  Obviously we\u2019re going to continue to look for opportunities but at the same time we need to continue to look for strategic investments to grow some of the future parts of our business.  And I\u2019ve talked about before, e-commerce and our sales organizations and so forth.  So a lot of that will be obviously it will help offset the cost of strategic investments.  But we need to continue to invest in the future of this company and where we need to put resources.", "Matthew Fassler", "And just by way of quick follow up on the cash flow, the only line item that stood out was the payables were shook coming off of that year on year.  I\u2019m just interested in what drove that and what kind of trend you might expect for payables to inventory going forward.", "Wade Miquelon", "For the payables piece?", "Matthew Fassler", "Yes.", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, payables in part is again impact with the mix effect of Duane Reade year on year as well as there is just some of the impact in the various plans and the particular timing of those plans.  So I think payables over the long haul is averaged out as pretty consistent.  But quarter to quarter you get some of the quarter end effects.  And like I said, we also had Duane Reade in there, which we didn\u2019t have a year ago.", "Matthew Fassler", "Got it.  Thank you so much.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard.", "Tom Gallucci", "Good morning.  Happy holidays to everybody.  Just on the SG&A buildup that you showed Wade, it seemed like the big delta in the quarter anyway was on the inflation business mix and investment line.  Now I know you sort of held your goal steady for the year overall.  Was that line a lot better than you were looking for in the quarter or was there something in particular that you had expected it to be lower this quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "I mean I think it was pretty much in line with where we expected for the quarter.  And like I said, part of it is always how you look at the quarter is what you\u2019re cycling the year prior.  And again, if you look forward again, Q2 last year we had a lot of very solid intervention so we had a very robust quarter.  And then again in the latter quarters we had Duane Reade, which had an impact.  So I think we\u2019re all focused here very aggressively on trying to reduce costs.", "Part of what for our $1 billion program a big part of that was transforming community pharmacy, about a quarter of that.  And over the last couple of quarters the pharmacy folks have done a terrific job of stepping it to the next level of savings.  So I think you also saw that coming through in both Q4 of last fiscal as well as Q1 of this fiscal.  So that\u2019s probably the single biggest chunk in there.", "Tom Gallucci", "Okay.  And I\u2019m not sure if I missed it, you were sort of expecting the incremental 385 million to get to that billion on Rewire.  Where were you short of the quarter at this point?", "Greg Wasson", "I think year on year we had a step up of 9 cents.", "Tom Gallucci", "Right.", "Greg Wasson", "Right.  So I mean pretty much in terms of that complete step up and that delta by the way - remember we had a goal of zero net and then 500 million net for last fiscal and then a billion step up.  But we\u2019re very on track to do that.  It\u2019s 55 cents is what we right now, our annual run rate kind of versus our 2008 baseline.  And our total goal for a billion is about 54 cents.  So there is a little bit more to step up but we\u2019re most of the way home.", "Tom Gallucci", "Okay.  And last one - I know there is still some time left here that\u2019s sort of unpredictable but you had a 15 million I think vaccination sort of goal on the flu side of things.  Have you changed that or updated it at this point given some of the slow start?", "Kermit Crawford", "So Tom, this is Kermit.  So first of all, at the end of this week we\u2019ll have administered over 6 million flu shots, really more than any other retail provider in this country.  And as Greg said earlier, we\u2019re still the single largest provider of flu shots other than the US government.  So if you think about the conference call we had with HHS and CDC last week, we have administered over 6% of all flu shots that were given in this country.", "And that\u2019s up from our 3.5% market share a year ago so we have had strong support from our vendors.  You saw where we wrote off the 2 cents in the vaccine inventory in the first quarter.  And we sort of can\u2019t speculate how the rest of the flu season will play out but I will tell you we were very aggressive this year and we will again be aggressive next year.  Our goal is to remain the leading provider of flu shots in this country.  And last year we disappointed a lot of our customers by not having that inventory.  And that won\u2019t happen in this flu season.", "Tom Gallucci", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Greg Wasson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next we\u2019ll hear from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.", "John Heinbockel", "Hey guys.  Two things I wanted to drill down on so number one, how do you feel about the balance between front end margin improvement and front end comp?  And what opportunity is there to make some investments?  Again, you want to be careful about demand elasticity but make some investments to see if you can move the front end comp dial a bit.  And if you did that, do you think it would it be more productive to do something promotionally or to tinker with shelf pricing?", "Greg Wasson", "John, Greg.  Obviously that\u2019s the art of retailing, right, you\u2019re asking.  I think yeah, we\u2019re managing that very well.  And there is opportunity to continue to invest, to drive comp for sure and we\u2019ll continue to look for those opportunities.  But I think right now I think we\u2019re striking the right balance.  I think we\u2019re swinging doors.  We were down a little bit in customer count in the quarter but that was against a very strong flu season as you know last year.", "So I think that we\u2019re using our money and our spend properly and we\u2019ll continue to look for ways if there is an opportunity to invest to continue to drive comp we will.  But I feel good with the balance we have achieved.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yeah.  I would completely echo that.  I think any time you go after smart sales you might see a little bit of toughness in the comp but it shows up in the earnings.  But I think on top of that our folks are doing a terrific job of making our store experience better and also making sure that the items are more relevant, that we have more solutions.  And I think over time you\u2019re going to see that that\u2019s going to be kind of the next meaningful bump versus just promoting.", "John Heinbockel", "Because if you look at you talk about value longer term and in a tougher economy, where do you think your value perception stands today at the front end?  And do you think longer term the price gap versus discount type retailers versus drug guys, do you think that price gap on HBOTC needs to come down or it\u2019s okay where it is because of the superior convenience?", "Greg Wasson", "I think that the delta that I talk about a lot John, I think we monitor that to make sure that we\u2019re right, we\u2019re not over, that delta doesn\u2019t become too large to where we lose the convenience factor.  But yeah, I think we\u2019re right.  I think that our convenience will indeed a delta between us and a mass retailer.  Now believe me, we\u2019ve got to watch that.  There are items that we bring down and then others that we try to compensate for that.", "But I think we still have - our convenience still affords us a delta but I think then beyond that it\u2019s what Wade\u2019s talking about.  There are other ways to shop value.  As we come in with beer and wine and a better experience and fresh food and serving the food desert locations within the south side of Chicago.  That affords you elasticity John.  So I think we\u2019re managing our delta well and I think that convenience will afford us that in the long term.", "Wade Miquelon", "And just to reiterate what Greg said, people aren\u2019t looking for price.  They\u2019re looking for value.  And I think value can be served through enhanced private brand program, our pharmacy services, the things we\u2019re doing and expanding the role of the pharmacist.  All of these things versus other alternatives we think we can provide meaningful value.", "John Heinbockel", "All right.  And then finally how much visibility do you have on the January 1st contract changes, term changes?  And do you think - I know relations with the PBMs have been getting better given what Hal has been up to - but they\u2019re going to be under a little bit of pressure too this next nine months because of what\u2019s happening with generics.  Do you think that leads to more pressure in 2011 than comes off in 2012?  And do you have visibility on that now?  Or what are you thinking?", "Wade Miquelon", "The pressure won\u2019t be getting any worse than it\u2019s been historically.", "Kermit Crawford", "So John, I think there is constant pressure on reimbursement as plans look for ways to lower their overall costs.  And typically plans do reset the rates in January and some of the benefit design changes, which we do expect.  But when we think about how we are working with our partners and/or payers, it\u2019s more about bringing value.", "When you look at some of the programs that we have put in place around adherence that drive more adherence, programs like WOW, where we\u2019re actually doing screenings for patients with diabetics, growing/driving more adherence on their medications - all these things are leading to decrease in the number of blindness, amputations, kidney failures.  So we\u2019re helping them to lower the overall medical costs and really bring more value than just looking at a reimbursement rate on 30-day scripts.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay.  Thanks.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee", "Yeah.  Hi.  Good morning guys.  A good quarter.", "Greg Wasson", "Hi David.  Thanks.", "David Magee", "Really just have a two-part generic question.  Generics were positive here in terms of year to year impact on the last couple quarters I believe.  I\u2019m just curious what you think about this current quarter.  Or do we now turn into more of a negative year over year impact for the next couple of quarters?  And then later next year, anything different with regard to what you see with the generic wave in terms of timing of the different drugs so for the next year or so and how they come to market and what the reimbursements might be?", "Kermit Crawford", "David, just real quick, although the impact of this quarter was positive, I mean we expect that the gross profit impact of new generics will be slightly a step down this year versus last year.  And the way you look at generics, we mentioned it in our analyst day, is that some of the big generics that are coming, the Lipitors and things, are really going to impact us FY12.  So I don\u2019t think much has changed since our last quarter on the impact of new generics and how we look at it.", "Wade Miquelon", "And with respect to quarterly outlook Q2 and Q3 last year were not particularly good generic quarters, right?  So in terms of if there is a little bit of step down year on year but for the next couple of quarters we\u2019re circling what was a pretty dry base as well.", "David Magee", "I see.  But then later next year in late 2011 and 2012 anything different that you have seen that would (change the nature)?", "Wade Miquelon", "Pretty much what we have seen at the analyst day remains our current best thinking.", "David Magee", "Okay.  Great.  Thank you.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks David.", "Rick Hans", "Well folks, that was our final question.  Thank you for joining us today.  We\u2019ll announce December monthly sales on January 5th.  Our next investor relations event will be our annual shareholders meeting on January 12th.  Our next quarterly financial announcement will be March 22nd.  We will announce fiscal 2011 second quarter results.  Until then thank you for listening, happy holidays to everyone and we look forward to talking to you soon.", "Operator", "Thank you sir.  That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

And welcome to the Walgreen Co. Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I'm pleased to turn the conference over to Mr. Rick Hans. Please go ahead, sir.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Allen. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, our President and CEO, will discuss the quarter's highlights and our continued progress in executing our core strategies. In addition, Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will detail our second quarter financial results.", "Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Kermit Crawford, our President of Pharmacy Health and Wellness Services and Solutions; and Mark Wagner, President of Community Management. When we get to your questions, please limit yourself to one question. As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our website at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliations. Also, I'm available throughout the day by phone to answer any additional questions you may have.", "You can find a link on our webcast under our Investor Relations website.

Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory Wasson", "Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today. We will cover three main areas today. First, I'll touch on key items in our strong second quarter financial results. You saw this morning we had record sales and earnings for the quarter, contributing to our third consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth. Second, I'll take you through a number of recent actions that are accelerating the execution of our strategies. And finally, Wade will walk you through our financial performance in more detail and give you perspective on the second half of the year.", "Starting with our results today, we reported record sales of $18.5 billion for the quarter. That's up 8.9% from nearly $17 billion in the second quarter of last year. Net earnings for the quarter were $739 million, up 10.4% from $660 million during the same quarter last year. Net earnings per diluted share were up 17.6% to $0.80 compared to $0.68 in the same period last year. Our strong cash flow trends also continued this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $886 million, and free cash flow was $690 million.  We also completed $300 million in stock buybacks during the quarter, putting us nearly halfway through our $1 billion share repurchase authorization.", "Next, let's look at the key drivers of our performance as we continue to turn our core business strategies into results. Running comparable store sales increased 4.3% in the quarter. As the economy slowly improves and our initiatives take hold, we're seeing increases in both traffic and basket size. We also saw a strong performance in cough and cold products, which drove sales in all three months of the quarter, and reflected a later onset than last year of the cough/cold flu season. Beer and wine sales continue to grow, and added 77 basis points to the front-end comp for the quarter. And finally, we also posted good holiday performance. Sales for Christmas and Valentine's Day solidly beat last year's numbers and demonstrated the power that our combination of convenience and value brings to the customers who are shopping later and later into the season.", "We also had another strong quarter in Pharmacy. Prescription sales and comparable stores grew by 3.9%, and comp scripts adjusted for Dayfall, grew by 4.4% over the same quarter last year. The cough/cold flu season added 110 basis points to our script comp. Our share of the overall retail prescription market, not including flu shots, improved to 20.1% for the quarter. With that performance, we achieved a milestone, filling one out of every five retail prescriptions for the first time in company history. For the flu season this year, when we administered 6.4 million flu shots, while industry-wide demand for shots was less than we expected, we continued to grow our market share.", "Outside of the federal government, we provide more flu shot immunizations than any of the other single entity in the country. So we are confident in our strategy to pursue the flu and broader vaccinations and immunization markets aggressively. Through these efforts, we are making healthcare solutions affordable and accessible, driving prevention and wellness and leading the transformation of community pharmacy.", "Solid sales in both the front-end and pharmacy continue to support a healthy relationship between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth, allowing us to deliver on our goal of double-digit earnings per share growth. This quarter, gross profit dollar growth is $120 million or 70 basis points, above SG&A dollar growth. Along with strong seasonal sales, we're driving momentum in gross profit dollar growth through store openings and comp store sales, which include the positive impact of our Customer Centric Retailing initiative. In the quarter, we opened in 19 new stores, and transitioned 159 more stores to our CCR format.  Through the end of the quarter, we've converted or opened more than 2,300 CCR stores, well on our way to transitioning 5,500 new and existing stores by the end of 2011.", "SG&A control in the quarter was also very good in spite of tough comparison from a year ago. Comparable store expense was the primary driver of expense control, although we continue to see expense growth from new store openings in acquisitions like Duane Reade and CCR. More broadly across the company, we are focused on making cost control and continuous process improvement a way of life. That means moving away from cost savings through major restructurings to a discipline that ensures we are finding opportunities to be more efficient and productive every day.", "As you can see from this chart, our focus on cost is yielding results. Wade will walk you through more detail on how we see the rest of the year playing out in a few minutes.  We continue to make substantial progress on our key initiatives even in this challenging economic environment. While the economy is slowly improving, unemployment remains high at 8.9%, and food and gas prices are rising. As costs rise and jobs remained soft, customers continue to look for value. We're also seeing the impact of inflation with a higher LIFO charge this quarter. In addition, commercial and government reimbursement continue to be important areas of focus for us and anyone in healthcare.", "On the government side of the issue, it's still too early to speculate on the eventual timing and impact of AMP. However, as states wrestle with budget difficulties and the need to reduce overall spending, we do expect pressure to continue on Medicaid reimbursement. That's why we're working closely with the states and in doing so, helping them to understand two significant opportunities that we'll be developing over the next several years. First, it's important to note the generic wave that begins this November will be a big benefit to all payers including the states as drug cost trends improve. In fact, if you look at IMS projections for generic introductions in the next five years, more than one quarter of prescription drug costs will come out of the system due to brand-to-generic conversions. As a result, prescription drug cost, as a percent of overall healthcare spend, will likely decrease. Second, by improving patient compliance and adherence through these more affordable generic drugs, states can avoid billions of dollars in medically related costs such as emergency rooms and hospitalizations. So we look forward to working with states to highlight the importance of these two opportunities in terms of providing access to these affordable drugs as a means to control costs.", "Finally, this morning, let me update our work on our three core strategies, which are to leverage the best to store network in America, enhance the customer experience, and make major cost reductions and productivity gains. We continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors with progress in several areas. We're extending our community-based retail network with store openings running at 2.5% to 3% in fiscal 2011, while progressing on our transformation to become the leading provider of pharmacy and health and wellness solutions. Our successful integration of Duane Reade is moving forward, and we're on track with systems conversions. Also, the pace of Duane Reade store remodels in Manhattan is picking up as we head into the second half of the year.", "We're also leveraging our brick-and-mortar assets through our e-Commerce business with the goal to become the leader in multichannel retailing, providing our customers what they want, when they want it and where they want it. And as our cost performance shows, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2011 against our base year of fiscal 2008.", "Over the past several years, we have taken a number of steps to align our assets with our core strategies, such as the acquisition of Cardinal Specialty Pharmacy business, and the exchange with Omnicare of our long-term care operations for their Home Infusion business. Recently, we took additional steps to further advance that goal. As you know earlier this month, we announced our transaction with Catalyst Health Solutions. Catalyst will acquire Walgreens Pharmacy Benefit Management business, Walgreens Health Initiatives, in a cash transaction for $525 million, subject to certain adjustments, and we expect to close by the end of June 2011.", "The sale has three strategic benefits. First, we are divesting non-core assets, so we can further increase our focus and discipline on the execution of our core strategies. The transaction accelerates our strategy of leveraging the best community store network in America by providing an expanding pharmacy and health and wellness solutions to all of our patients and payers. Second, the sale accelerates our B2B strategy of taking pharmacy and health and wellness solutions to our customers, employers and government agencies, either directly or with our PBM and health plan partners, without the inherent conflict of owning a PBM.  And third, we retained and look to grow our Specialty Pharmacy and Mail Service businesses as they are an integral part of our full-service pharmacy offerings. ", "Catalyst is a strong company, and will be a good provider of PBM services to WHI customers and the Walgreen Co. An additional action we've undertaken recently again to focus on our core versus non-core assets is to limit our presence in the respiratory therapy durable medical equipment market in order to accelerate our industry-leading Infusion Pharmacy business. This decision is critical to our Specialty Pharmacy strategy as more patients and payers look to a single provider of both.  As a result, in December, we started the process of selling facilities and at this point, we've sold RT/DME [respiratory therapy/ durable medical equipment] operations in six states. Our goal is to ensure we effectively meet the needs of our customers, and that we're positioned for long-term success.", "We're also taking steps to further align our leaders and structure with our strategic goals. As you know, we recently announced Howe Rosenblum's retirement. He brought tremendous vision and commitment to Walgreens, and I look forward to continuing to call on his expertise as a senior consultant on healthcare services. As a result, we've completed the full integration of our Pharmacy and Health and Wellness businesses into our newly established Pharmacy Health and Wellness Services and Solutions division under Kermit Crawford. In addition, Jeff Berkowitz recently joined our company as Senior Vice President of Pharmaceutical Development and Market Access, reporting to Kermit. Jeff came to Walgreens from Merck, where he was Senior Vice President for Global Market Access. Along with his responsibilities to broaden and deepen our payer relationships, through his leadership of our contracting and pricing team, he also leads our enterprise-wide pharmaceutical purchasing teams for both brands and generics, and plays a vital role in expanding our relationships with our pharma partners.", "To support our strategy to become America's first choice for health and daily living needs, we established a new Daily Living Products and Solutions group headed by Joe Magnacca, who joined us with the acquisition of Duane Reade last year. As President, Joe will combine and lead our very strong marketing and merchandising efforts, while continuing to lead Duane Reade. With the combined leadership and experience of our Chief Marketing Officer, Kim Feil and our Chief Merchandising Officer, Bryan Pugh, he will head up one of the most talented teams in retail. We also recently brought on Graham Atkinson, our new Chief Customer Experience Officer. He comes to Walgreens. Graham's responsible for leading our company-wide effort to enhance our customer experience and develop our loyalty strategy. He comes to us from United Airlines, where he established a long and successful record in customer experience and loyalty, leading the development and operations of UAL's various award-winning loyalty programs.", "And finally, at Analyst Day, we stated our goal to become America's first choice for health and daily living needs, owning outright the strategic territorial well. This quarter demonstrates we are well on our way towards achieving that goal. We're pleased with our results this quarter. However, we remain cautious about the outlook, and confident in our direction. We will continue to differentiate ourselves to a laser focus on developing our core assets, our continued discipline on costs and a clear vision on how we can become my Walgreens for everyone in America. With that, I'll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review our second quarter financial results and key metrics in more depth. I'll tie the quarter back to our long-term financial goals, and review our capital allocation decisions in the quarter, and how we're thinking about capital allocation going forward. Let me start by saying that we were pleased with our strong performance on our key financial metrics, including sales, earnings and EPS, in what continues to be a very challenging environment. Our GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.80 included the impact of the following items, $0.01 per share from expenses related to the Duane Reade integration, and $0.01 per share from expenses related to our Rewiring for Growth initiatives. This compares to our second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.68, which included $0.02 per diluted share in restructuring and related costs associated with Rewire. Our FIFO EBIT increased by 13.6% in the quarter versus 3.2% a year ago. And finally, our comps improved across the board. Comparable store Pharmacy sales increased by 3.9%, and comparable front-end sales increased 4.3% with total comparable sales, up 4.1%.", "Looking at script number comps, our comparable prescriptions filled increased by 4.5%. Greg reviewed the key drivers of the quarter, so let me take you through some longer term trends. The green bars on this slide show our front-end comp by quarter for the past three and a half years, while the corresponding blue line represents our two-year stacks front-end comp. You could see that our second quarter front-end comp of 4.3% is the best in 10 quarters, marking a return to a level we have not seen since 2008 before the recession.", "As Greg noted, the significant factors contributing to the acceleration of this quarter's comp were increased in cough/cold and flu sales and the momentum we are generating through our CCR merchandising initiatives, including the rollout of beer and wine, and our stronger Christmas and Valentine's Day sales programs.", "Looking at longer term trends, I want to highlight that our two-year stack was trending above 90% prior to the onset of the recession, and that last year's second quarter appears to be the inflection point. Since that time, a combination of our own initiatives and a more stable economy had led to a stronger two-year stack trend. Finally, the breakdown between traffic and basket, with traffic up 1.6% and basket up 2.6% reflects our focus on achieving the right balance between sales and margin.", "Now let me recap the quarter, our Pharmacy business. Let's look at the last 10 quarters of our script comparisons, with the green bar showing our quarterly script comp and the blue line showing the two-year stack. You can see that our second quarter script comp of 4.5% is the highest level in the past five quarters, driven by higher cough/cold and flu, which contributed 110 basis points. In addition, the two-year stack is tracked consistently in the 6% to 10% range over the past 10 quarters. At nearly 8% this quarter, the two-year stack is currently trending above its 2009 level. Finally, Greg covered the flu shot update for this season, and my only additional comment is to remind you that we do not bear any further inventory risk related to flu shots.", "Turning to market share, as Greg highlighted, we achieved a milestone, filling one of every five retail prescriptions in the quarter for the first time in our history. Our 20.1% retail prescription share is up from a year ago. As with the various drivers of our Pharmacy business, we want to remind you that our prescription comp is the best metric to understand the trends in our Pharmacy business. This slide shows the spread between our Pharmacy sales comp and our prescription comp on a 30-day equivalent basis over the past 10 quarters, with the green line representing our pharmacy sales comp, the blue line representing our script comp and the black line representing the spread between the two. Since the third quarter of 2009, our prescription comp has exceeded our Pharmacy sales comp, with the spread a function of a couple factors, including brand drug growth and inflation, which tend to inflate the spread and generics' negative reimbursement flu-related drugs, flu shots, and the growth in 90-day prescriptions, which tend to narrow the spread. ", "We've highlighted the first quarter of 2010 to illustrate the impact on the spread from the flu-related scripts, which are largely generics and flu shots. And while this was the most negative spread of the past 10 quarters, it was a strong quarter in Pharmacy, demonstrating the disconnect between net spread and the financial performance of the business. With the coming generic wave, we would expect the sales comp to script comp spread to become increasingly negative, but keep in mind we generally make more profit per script on the generic versus on a branded drug. So going forward, I will encourage you to focus more on pharmacy script comp then sales comp per se.", "Our gross margin as a percent of sales is 28.8%, steady with the year ago. The front-end margins increased, but were offset by a higher LIFO provision in the quarter. Retail pharmacy margins were even with last year, as the positive effect of generic drug sales were offset by market-driven reimbursements. ", "The next chart illustrates our trends in front end and pharmacy margins, which we showed you in the last couple of quarters. And you can see that we have five consecutive quarters of margin improvement on the front end. And while additional progress becomes increasingly difficult due to the rising price environment, we have several initiatives in place for further front-end margin improvement.", "I would now like to turn it over to talk about our SG&A trends. As Greg highlighted, the SG&A increased by $306 million, including Duane Reade, were 8% on a GAAP basis versus 5.1% a year ago. And our two-year stack SG&A of 13.1% compares favorably to last year's two-year stack of 13.2%, and is a significant improvement versus our 2009 level of 19.3%.  This graph adjusts SG&A dollar growth for Duane Reade and for Rewire. Our two-year stack SG&A dollar growth, fully adjusted, is 11.1% versus 12.6% a year ago, and versus 16.9% in 2009. ", "Let me walk you through the progression from our GAAP SG&A dollar growth rate of 8% to our adjusted SG&A dollar growth rate. The Duane Reade migration and operating expenses added about 430 basis points to our SG&A dollar growth, while Rewire expenses were lower than a year ago. And that had a positive impact of 50 basis points, and resulted in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 4.2%. Also recall, we are on plan to deliver our full $1 billion of Rewire savings by the end of the fiscal year. While, you can see the numbers reflected in our SG&A dollar growth, we have included a reconciliation of the quarterly Rewire numbers in the appendix.", "Continuing down the income statement, as noted earlier, the LIFO provision for the quarter was significantly higher at $56 million versus $27 million last year. This increase negatively impacted the quarter's EPS by about $0.02 versus the prior year. Restructuring and restructuring related expenses were $6 million, down from $28 million last year, as Rewire now nears completion. And our net interest expense was $18 million, down from $22 million, reflecting the benefit of a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that we put in place last year. Net income was adversely impacted by a higher tax rate, which increased by 80 basis points from last year to 37.8% as a result of higher state and federal taxes. This increase negatively impacted the quarter's EPS by about $0.01 versus the prior year. For the year, we are planning on an effective tax rate of 37.4%.  And finally, our average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 62 million due to share repurchases over the past 12 months. ", "Moving to the balance sheet, our cash balance stands at $2.2 billion, down from $3.1 billion a year ago, reflecting a strong cash flow, our acquisition of Duane Reade and other efforts to return record amounts of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Accounts receivable decreased by 7.3%, while inventories increased by about 5.7%. Accounts payable increased by 6.1%. Overall, our working capital has decreased by 1.3%. And as a percent of sales, our total working capital has actually decreased by 9.3% as we continue to drive working capital efficiencies across the enterprise.  Our FIFO inventory increased by 6.9% in the quarter against an 8.9% increase in sales. While on a per-store basis, FIFO dollar inventory decreased by 0.2%, which is a strong progress against the 9.6% decrease a year ago.", "Shifting gears, I will now review our long-term financial growth goals, and look how we're performing against those goals through the first half of the fiscal and finally, frame a few of the issues that we face in the second half. Recall that our objective is to achieve long-term double-digit EPS growth, and our annual goal is to grow gross profit dollars by about 100 basis points more than our SG&A dollars, with the benefit of our continued share repurchase program. The first six months of fiscal 2011, our gross profit dollar growth was 8.8%, 130 basis points higher than our SG&A dollar growth of 7.5%. We had 931 million average diluted shares outstanding in the half versus 992 million in the first half a year ago which combined, helped us deliver 21.4% diluted earnings per share growth year-to-date.", "With the majority of Duane Reade and restructuring related cost behind us, our 7.5% GAAP SG&A dollar growth through the first half of the year is on track with plan. With respect to our other two SG&A dollar growth buckets, we are on track with SG&A related to new store openings, and ahead related to our core store inflation in business mix and investment. Let me remind you of our goal of 6.5% to 7.5% SG&A dollar growth for the year. It is likely that we will be on the lower end of that range even as we absorb the incremental costs related to things such as the divestiture of WHI. ", "Let me give you a little more context for both SG&A dollar growth and gross profit dollar growth for the rest of the year. Last quarter, we showed this slide to demonstrate the volatility by quarter in our SG&A dollar growth trends. As we look at our SG&A dollar growth quarter-by-quarter this year versus last year, it is important to recall the specific drivers in each quarter, including the Duane Reade acquisition, the timing of flu and the timing of other initiatives. In this quarter, we were cycling a very difficult SG&A dollar growth comp. And consequently, we were pleased with our 8% SG&A dollar growth for the quarter. And as the year progresses, you'll see our comparisons become easier. Looking at gross profit dollar growth by quarter this year versus last year, we see similar volatility, with performance driven by new generics and the timing of the flu. This slide illustrates the easier comparison for the quarter, and the more difficult comparisons in the upcoming third and fourth quarters, as we cycle the gross profit dollar benefit of CCR and the Duane Reade acquisition.", "Finally, I want to share with you another strong cash flow performance. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $886 million, up nearly 50% from $595 million in the year-ago quarter. And year-to-date, it is at $2.1 billion, up 16.3% from $1.8 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2010. Free cash flow in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $690 million, up over 80% from last year's free cash flow of $375 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $1.6 billion, up 27.7% from the first six months of fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $196 million and year-to-date, are about $469 million. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are expected to be in roughly the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range, excluding business acquisitions and prescription-filed purchases.", "Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to sell WHI to Catalyst Health Solutions in a cash transaction for $525 million. We expect the transaction to close by the end of June, and to be accretive to earnings in fiscal 2011, largely due to the one-time gain and neutral in fiscal 2012, not including the reinvestment of the proceeds. Given that we have a fairly low book basis, we expect our net one-time gain to be significant, and we will update you after it's finalized.", "We will retain the Specialty and Mail businesses, and be a strategic provider for Walgreen Co., and we intend to grow with Catalyst and all of our other key partners as well. We remain very focused on our disciplined approach to capital allocation, as we continue to tighten our strategic focus on our core assets. This chart is in the shape of a diamond, because we have four priorities that we balance very carefully. Our first priority is reinvesting in our core strategies, and you're seeing the results of those investments in both our front end and pharmacy numbers for this quarter. Our second is investing strategic opportunities that reinforce and support the core, for example, the Duane Reade acquisition and file buys. Also important is working to maintain a good balance sheet and strong credit ratings. I just ran you through those numbers, and I feel very good about the state of our balance sheet. And finally, and very, very important, is returning cash to shareholders. To give you more detail on our share repurchase program, in the quarter, we bought back $300 million of stocks, and we're nearly halfway through our current $1 billion share buyback authorization. In the quarter, we also paid out $162 million in dividends, and our last dividend increase was 27.3%. And we do expect meaningful dividend increases until we reach our target payout of 30% to 35%.", "So in closing, let me just reiterate that we are very pleased with our results. In the first half of the year, we are on track to meet our annual goal of double-digit earnings growth. We are making solid progress against strategic initiatives, and you can see that progress clearly laid out in our earnings, our cash flow and other things like expenses. You have our commitment that we will continue to focus on executing our strategy to deliver sustainable growth and value for all of our stakeholders.", "So I want to thank you for joining us today, and now I'm going to turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Wade. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Edward Kelly at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "First question for you on the gross margin, I guess it wasn't quite as strong as most of us have expected, maybe we were just too optimistic. But could you talk a little bit about how the margin played out versus your expectation this quarter, particularly on the front end? And then I know you mentioned in the press release the impact of higher commodity prices, can you just explain that a little bit in a little bit more detail?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, it's Greg. I'll start and maybe Wade can fill in. I think we were pretty pleased with where we finished up. I think when you look at the LIFO effect that we had on the front end, we continue to feel good with our managing our front-end margin, especially in this environment of commodity prices increases. I think we're doing a good job continuing to balance price and promotion, working for supply chain cost and so forth to reduce our cost of goods. But I think on the front end, we feel pretty strong there also, as you know, lapping strong increase from the year before. Certainly in Pharmacy, as we said, the generic increase that we saw was offset somewhat by reimbursement. The reimbursement step down that we saw in January, February is exactly pretty much what we planned for. And we certainly have to continue to manage to get there, and predictable reimbursement from our payers.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I'll just add on here. I think that we feel very good about our gross margins. I think what we're really focused on again is gross margin dollars, and trying to make sure to play the right balance to get the top line growing, as well as the profitability. So I feel, in general, we struck the right balance. We are seeing some inflation and obviously, commodities are up and those feed stocks will funnel through over time. I think we'll be very -- we'll be ready to manage it when that comes, and there'll probably be other opportunities to provide value, and private label and other things as well. So again, I think I'd encourage you to keep focusing on gross profit dollars, in particular, against that construct we laid out of SG&A gross or SG&A dollars.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, and just on the inflation front, everyone out there on the CPG [consumer packaged goods] side is talking about raising prices. So it seems like we're going to see more of it. I would assume that you've got a fair amount of pricing power within your model. Is that something that you should be able to navigate fine, or is that a risk going forward? How do we think about that?", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, I think, Ed, certainly, it's an environment that we're going to have to focus on extremely well going forward. As you said, we're going to continue to see higher commodity prices coming through, but we've managed through times like this in the past. It's all about staying competitive, store-by- store, checking the competition, making sure we go where we can, and make sure we're still providing the right value. That's why I talk about time and time again that retail is really all about balance, and making sure you're swinging doors at the same time, creating value. And so I think our convenience, as we've talked about before, allows us to some opportunity to get the delta there over others. And we just have to understand what that delta is line-by-line. So I think we feel good with being able to manage through it. Certainly, we're going to have to be focused.", "Wade Miquelon", "We'll use it opportunistically to drive our private label even harder if need be. We'll make sure that we have key price points versus competition. We'll make sure that our KBIs [key buying influence], the most important items we have, are priced right every day. So I think we'll be able to manage it very effectively, but I think it also gives rise to opportunity.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, and just to follow-up on the gross margin question. How do we think about the third quarter now? I mean your comparison is particularly easy. Maybe you could remind us of why that's so. I mean, I know last year's third quarter on the Pharmacy side was a tough quarter. Certainly, you cycled back in a pretty positive way and there\u2019s very good potential to see a pretty strong gross margin quarter again. I think that's how we're all thinking about it. So maybe you could help us as to whether that thought process is right or not.", "Wade Miquelon", "A couple of things, right, is there's a lot of -- last year, actually, if you look at our back half gross profit dollars, they were fairly very strong. And that's for a couple reasons, number one, is we have the gross profit lift from Duane Reade, but we also were cycling the year prior, above [ph] some closeout and other CCR impacts. So from that regard, that actually is a bit tougher compare but SG&A, obviously, is a much easier compare. So I guess what I would say, obviously, quarter-to-quarter, we lost the mix effects from seasonal and other things. I think I'd really kind of just trying to point you back to that goal of over time to have 100 basis points more gross profit dollar growth versus SG&A, and if we do that, the whole model works.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Maybe a bit more similar to what we have seen play out this quarter as opposed to what we've seen in prior quarters?", "Wade Miquelon", "I would just say there just a lot of moving parts quarter-to-quarter, and still a lots of things, not only seasonality, business mix, changes in plans, et cetera. But again, I think that we feel that our goal of making sure we have 100 basis points or more over time is the right goal, and the goal that hopefully, we should be able to achieve.", "Operator", "And next, we'll take our next question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Great, I'm actually going to take the other side of the gross margin on the SG&A front, actually, Wade, I was very impressed with the performance in the quarter. Are you finding that the culture of the organization has changed with regard to expense management? And that there might be further opportunities to reduce expenses in the future? And if so, what might some of those opportunities be?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Deborah, maybe I'll take that. Yes, there's absolutely a change in focus and as I've talked about, I think we've got cost reduction and productivity gain kind of embedded in the DNA of the organization. Now frankly, I think, going through our Rewiring for Growth initiative the last couple of years has really done that. And who knows, could be the biggest by-product of that initiative going in the future. So yes, I think we have folks that are focused in all aspects of the business, turning over every stone from supply chain to just SG&A, corporate expense, store level expense, how we run drugstores and so forth. So there's no doubt it's in our DNA. We think there's more opportunity, and we're going to go after it.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think, the way -- and probably, the big difference is rather from sort of cost cutting or restructuring, which we went through the past couple of years. Now it's really focused on continuous process improvement, and what we would call cost innovation. So putting as much creativity into innovating to be much more effective in doing new ways to drive our business and to manage our costs, as we would on top line growth. And I think that's the real kind of mindset difference.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, and then also, with over a 20% market share in Pharmacy, who do you think you're gaining market share from? And with the investments you've made in your business, do you expect your share gains to accelerate going forward? And how important have your file buys been to the share gains?", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, I think, Deborah, we're gaining share from just across the board, whether it's -- it varies region by region. So I think that as long as we continue to execute strong like we are, I think Kermit and his group, Mark has done a great job with improvement in service levels and customer sat [satisfaction] within our scores. So I think  we'll continue to execute, continue to gain share, especially if indeed the reimbursement environment gets a little more challenging, there'll probably be more opportunity for us to gain share. But it's pretty much across the board, varies a little bit by region, but we feel good with continue to grow share.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "And you found it broadly across the U.S.?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes. As I said, it may vary somewhat by region, but for the most part, yes.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, and then last question, I believe Kim Feil joined the company in September '08 as your Chief Marketing Officer and has obviously made a significant impact. What was it that made you reach out to Graham Atkinson for the role of Chief Customer Experience Officer? I believe you're the only retailer that I know that has a role like that in your company, which should obviously set you apart from your peers.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, I think you're right. Kim did start with us a couple of years ago. Kim has done a fantastic job in taking our organization from what I call good advertiser product to a world-class marketing organization. She\u2019s done exactly what we wanted her to do and continue to build that. I think what Graham brings to us is just flat out dead experience in both customer experience and loyalty with a world-class operation and world-class product that they built. And I think that his number one focus is enhancing and elevating our customer experience across the entire enterprise, loyalty of which is one part of it. And I think the winning retailers, going forward, will be those that really deliver an outstanding customer experience across the entire enterprise. That's what he's focused on, and we wanted someone that could come in and really just be laser-focused on that and work with Kim and her insights group and so forth to help deliver.", "Operator", "And next, we'll take a question from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "On the Rx side, you commented that the reimbursement pressure that you saw once the calendar turned was what you expected. Can you give us a little bit more perspective on how reimbursement rate changes are different or similar this year to prior years and what your expectations are, how that might behave as we move into 2012 with the next generic wave coming?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I guess the way I would frame it just roughly, Eric, is that last year, we said that we kind of have a year-on-year, probably our biggest step down we ever experienced through a variety of things. Things like AWP [average wholesale pricing], a few other changes, a few issues, say, we have gone through a few commercial plans and then also, a very large number of year-on-year generic step down. You added all that up, and we said it was almost $0.5 billion year-on-year. This year, we're not seeing anything in that magnitude for sure. So there's a little bit of pressure coming at us because generics are a little lighter than year prior. But overall, a little bit, not overly significant. Again coming into November, December next year in our 2013, we'll start to see a big generic wave, and that's going to be helpful then as well. So a little bit of pressure year-on-year, but not the kind of pressure we saw the year prior.", "Gregory Wasson", "And Eric, I think what is encouraging to us, frankly, is what we did see is what we anticipated.", "Kermit Crawford", "And Eric, this is Kermit. One other thing is that the step down this year is still -- there's a step down this year compared to last year. And we do expect to see that grow in 2012 and even more in 2013.", "Wade Miquelon", "And one thing I'd also share though is Kermit's team is also doing a lot of work to continue to reengineer our cost to fill for deleveraging new prescribe, our central flow capabilities, other streamlined processes. So we work it from both ends to make sure that we get to the best overall gross and net.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then a follow-up on the gross margin performance and outlook that the higher commodity costs and the higher LIFO charge, is there an intent or opportunity to recapture this, or is this just part of a more inflationary environment that creates some pressure on gross margin? I'm just trying to figure out what side of this you're going to end up on if you can offset it, or if you just have to absorb it?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I guess one thing, is remember that this is not all CPG-type products, right, that there will be some LIFO over time that tends to come through on the Pharma side as well. In some cases, we are able to price out ahead of it. So you might see the benefit in the numbers even despite the fact you might have an inventory LIFO hit. So I think the key thing for us is -- I'd be less concerned about what the LIFO movement is because over time, it doesn't move that much, and really more focused on whether it was sustainably over time able to get our portfolio pricing up to the level we need to for aggregate inflation, and I think that we're pretty good at doing that.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Eric, I think -- and Wade alluded to, I think, with an earlier caller, I think it's going to be a combination of, obviously, managing the competitiveness of those items. But also, driving our private brand help offset it, and we've got to be laser-focused on both of those areas to achieve the right balance. And I think with our opportunity to drive private brand, we feel pretty good about it.", "Operator", "And next, we'll take a question from Ann Hynes with Caris & Company.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", "I just want to go back to your gross profit and SG&A long-term growth of 100 basis points. At the analyst meeting, when asked if you expect to achieve that in fiscal 2011, you imply that, that probably wouldn't happen. So when I look at your gross profit comments, I guess, your comments around gross profit and being difficult in the second half, should we assume that, that may be gross profit and SG&A growth reverse, that maybe you have higher SG&A growth in the second half of 2011 versus gross profit so in turn, you maybe for annual -- if you annualize it, you're still growing gross profit over SG&A, it just reverses and it's a timing thing?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think just what I mentioned, sorry and I apologize if I wasn't clear, but I think what I mentioned meant to imply was that a, it is a long term goal, right, so it's year-by-year, et cetera. And that 2012 and '13 would probably be easier than 2011 to hit it because of all of the trends, generics, et cetera, but that doesn't mean that we're not shooting for that goal this year, that we think we can't achieve it. Through the first few quarters, I think we've got about 130 basis point average. We're trying to build our business around this to overtime sustainably hit it. But I think the impression I meant to give is that it would just be easier in '12 and '13 than '11, but it doesn't mean that '11 is still not our goal.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", "Okay, so it might be difficult to get that 130 basis points in the second half just because of the tough comparisons and maybe, some Medicaid pricing pressure?", "Wade Miquelon", "Could be, for sure, and there are still unknowns, things like AMP and other things. We just don't know yet. But again, this is what we're going to target to do. And again, we encourage you not to just judge it by any one quarter, but kind of look at the rolling effect of where we're taking our business over time.", "Ann Hynes - Caris & Company", ",", "All right, great, and just my second question, was around Medicaid. Do you have any incremental detail you can share about AMP and timing? And then I know -- I cover the hospitals and a lot of the hospitals are guiding Medicaid down 3% to 4% in the second half starting in July. Is that what we should assume for your Medicaid pricing, especially I know you have exposure in Texas? Just any more clarity on what we should assume for Medicaid pricing in the second half would be great.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Ann, as far as AMP, it's still uncertain as far as the timing and the impact of it. So I can't give you any more color there. As far as state Medicaid, again, same thing, we work with each individual state individually to manage fair and acceptable reimbursement as well as additional solutions. And as I said in my script, one of the things that we're encouraged by is that I think there's a lot we can do to help states with. And first and foremost, is making sure they do understand that the generic wave and the compliance adherence of generics is going to a huge positive for them going forward. Secondly, we've got a lot of solutions that we can talk to them about regarding the use of our retail clinics to offset medical costs. So there's no doubt they're going to be continued to be focused on reducing costs as everyone is in this environment. And we think we're actually positioned to help bring additional solutions.", "Operator", "And next, we'll take a question from Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask Kermit a few questions. As I recall, the SG&A cost saves that are left to go for this year are still largely on the prescription side of the house or the back end of the house. Can you talk about how you're positioned for delivering cost saves in the back half? And then second question for you is what's the approach for flu shots going to be next year? Are we going to keep pushing for more and more shots and did you end up making any money on the 6.4 million shots since we did have to take a write-down?", "Kermit Crawford", "Mark, so first on the SG&A saving costs, around our TCRx or what we call our transformation community pharmacy, we are on pace to meet our 2011 goal from our Rewire. So I still feel very good about the second of the year and the pace we're on to meet the cost savings associated with the Pharmacy. When it comes to our flu program, our flu program, I mean, we still are going to remain aggressive in our flu program, as well as in our broader vaccine programs. But we clearly established Walgreens as the leader in the flu shot market. And with over 26,000 certified pharmacists in United, we've proven that we can train our entire workforce. Even with the lack of demand this year in our flu shots, given only 6.4 million flu shots, we increased our market share by 50 basis points. So we feel very good about flu shots and additional vaccinations, and we certainly expect to grow that flu shot more this year. I guess to answer your question on did we make money. We don't make money when we sell flu shots. So we feel very comfortable about the flu and our other vaccinations. But to give you another example is you may have heard about the whopping cough that was broken out in California and Indiana, and we administered over 19,000 DPT vaccinations. So we're beginning to expand beyond flu to other vaccinations like pneumonia, like Zostavax, like GARDASIL. So we continue to see our opportunity in this $10 billion to $20 billion flu immunization and vaccine market.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I guess what I'm getting at is next year do you need to make a big inventory commitment in advance, or can you just let the market drive the flu shot volume higher and...", "Wade Miquelon", "I think, over time, it's going to be easier to align the demand and supply equation. You have to remember that this year was coming on the back of the H1N1 kind of issue. And so I think everybody had to go out and commit. But recall, we work with our vendors and for the most part, we are able to manage our inventory level down within a pretty close range. So I think over time, it's going to be easier and easier to align those two.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Mark, Greg, I'd just say this, certainly, this year, we learned a lot, and there's two things. I think the consumers definitely value our convenience to get flu shots, so the demand is there. We could expect that continue to grow. And second, we certainly know how to work with our Pharma supporters to manage the inventory a little better next year. So we feel good we'd be able to manage their inventory, as well as the amount of -- and still grow share.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "And Greg, just big picture question for you, do you feel you have everything you need now in terms of the portfolio, now that you've sold off WHI, and you've got the specialty in the Home Infusion businesses in house? Do you have everything you need and it's just a matter of executing and driving up returns from here?", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, Mark, that's a good question. It's awkward, I think I'm probably naive to say, I think we've got everything we need. I think as we continue to grow, there's always gaps. There's always sophistication and assets that may come available that make sense. But I think we certainly have come a long way, and I think what I'm really enthused with and feel good about is the focus because there's no doubt, and I've said this several times. Our center of gravity are those drugstores, and those drugstores are the center of communities across the country. And more and more focus we get on providing additional services, products and solutions to communities in need, the better off we'll be. So I feel good with some of the divestitures that we've done, because I think it's helping our focus. There certainly will be other gaps and other opportunities for us to continue to drive the business, file buys, prescription file buys, we expect to continue to see, as we talked about earlier. We're going to continue to grow specialty and Infusion business, and that could be through file buy-type opportunities as well. So I never say never, but I think I feel pretty good with the portfolio we've got right now.", "Operator", "And next, we'll got to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I thought it was interesting the initiative around educating on 90-day scripts, can you maybe just talk about the relationships you have here with PBMs or managed care companies around the 90-day scripts. Are you getting buy-ins from them around the 90-day, or are they giving you pushback because they're trying to promote their own mailer facilities?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Lisa, a little of both, which doesn't concern me because frankly, the consumer is voting, and the consumer is basically saying, hey, I want to get my chronic medications in a 90-day supply or if I do, I want to be able to use retail. They're voting for that more and more. Certainly, there are obviously others that want to fill those through the mail, and I understand that. The main thing that I think we're getting buy-in from the industry is we're not looking for 90-day supplies at retail to replace the mail benefit. We're looking forward to add to an existing benefit, and it's hard for anyone to debate the facts and the results of adding a 90-day retail benefit to an existing mail benefit. Then you get a higher 90 day utilization, you get improved adherence and compliance, good for the payers, good for the patients, good for everyone. So Lisa, as you would suspect there\u2019s probably -- there are some that are pushing back but ultimately, the consumer will vote, the payers will vote. And then in a few years, in my opinion, this will be a norm.", "Kermit Crawford", "Let me add to that. We did a survey and over 50% of the patients who were getting their 90-day supplies via mail, were unaware that there was a retail option to get their 90-day supply. And we've certainly had the outcome to show when you add a 90-day retail benefit to an existing 30-day, and mail benefit, you both increase adherence, which is addressing our overall company issue around adherence, because the lack of adherence is costing this company somewhere in the neighborhood of $300 billion in additional medical costs, as well as lowering the overall cost to the payer because in the long term, when you have a generic benefit in your plan and 90-day generics is driving higher utilization, it's going to lower the overall costs for the payer.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So Kermit, are you giving better pricing now? I mean, so if you look, generally speaking, the discounts given at mail order versus retail are generally substantially better and from a consumer perspective, they are usually paying two co-pays versus three. Do you have any managed care plans or PBMs [Pharmacy Benefit Manager] today that are willing to give similar pricing to mail to try to entice the person to do 90 days, or it's just the convenience factor of only having to pick up a prescription four times a year instead of 12 times a year?", "Wade Miquelon", "I would say that pricing is different by customer depending on what they give, what the terms and conditions are, so it varies. So answering that in one answer is difficult to do. But in general, we can provide a very good value proposition that's also good for our margin, good for the payer and good for the patient in a way which makes a 30-90 a win-win-win for everyone.", "Gregory Wasson", "Lisa, Greg. I want to pile on here a little bit. So I think you can look at a 90-day supply of prescriptions and the convenience that we bring by someone being able to come into our retail pharmacy within the community. Same way you can look at the front-end goods and the value that our convenience brings. People will pay for convenience. They pay for convenience for our front-end products, even though there may be competitive items. And they also pay for the convenience, whether it's an additional co-pay or half a co-pay for it to be able to walk in and see their pharmacist face-to-face. So our convenience, just like it does on the front-end, supports the pharmacy and a differential co-pay, if that's what it requires.", "Kermit Crawford", "And Lisa, the only thing I would add is that this is about lowering the overall total cost. And what we've seen with the 90-day retail plan is an increase generic utilization and an increase in the adherence. So both of those things lower the overall total costs for the payer. Those are about lowering our overall total costs.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, and I guess one more kind of Walgreen-specific question on this topic though. I mean, Greg, are you seeing that by offering more, people are more aware of the 90-day script, is this what's helping to drive some of your market share, is the belief that you can get this 90-day script at Walgreens, but you can't get it at Joe's Pharmacy, is that part of the drive of where you're getting the incremental market share?", "Gregory Wasson", "No, not at all, Lisa. I think that certainly, by having the 90-day available and if others don't, then we're going to -- it'll grow our share. But my intent is not to have a 90-day retail prescription available only at Walgreens. I think that the industry will see 90-day retail prescriptions become a norm for retail pharmacy. And so, therefore, I'm not about just only having a 90-day retail prescriptions available at Walgreens.", "Wade Miquelon", "I couldn't agree more. I think it is going to become an industry standard, and the reason is because it makes sense, right? It makes sense, it's what payers and patients are going to want, because it\u2019s going to give a better outcome in every way that you can measure it. I guess the one thing is with respect to kind of the IMS market share data, remember, the way they still see it is that 90 days is equal to one, and the 30 days is equal to one. So you wouldn't be able to see that kind of trend in those numbers anyway. But again, I think, it will become an industry standard, because it's hard to argue with the logic of it.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then I know I said it was the last question but just one more, Wade. If we look at this from a cost perspective for Walgreens, is it more cost efficient for you to fill a 90-day script? When we think about profitability, is it more profitable for you to fill a 90-day script or a 30-day script, and do you believe that you lose any traffic by that person only coming in four times a year? And I will stop there.", "Gregory Wasson", "I guess I would say, again, I mean, Kermit can talk about the actual fill. I mean it doesn't take a lot more cost to fill 90 versus 30, but there sometimes is a pricing offset. In the end though, by driving better adherence and all of that, again, we can win, we can help people stay with their meds. We can be successful that way. So I think from that point of view, it's a win. I would also make with respect to people that are coming in, a large number of people that come in to buy our script either go through the drive-thru, or they don't buy anything else anyway. We learned with drive-thrus that it's not about how do we keep people captive in our store. It's about how we give them what they want. We put the drive-thrus in and once we put the drive-thrus, then our business blossomed. Even though some people thought that, that might have pulled people of the store. And if people want a 90 versus a 30, if we give them what they want, we believe we'll be rewarded over time in lots of ways versus just on particular trips. So Kermit, do you want to add to that?", "Kermit Crawford", "And I think Lisa, the only thing I'd add to that is when we give our survey, over 2/3 of the people who were getting 30-day product medications in our stores were very likely to switch to a 90-day quantity if they were aware of it. So the people, 95% of the people want choice. They want to have the ability to make choice of where they get their 90-day prescription. 85% of the people in this survey thought that the face-to-face interaction with their pharmacist was important. So much like we do when we put drive-thrus in, we have given the patients what they want, when they want it, and how they want it. So this is more about patient choice, and giving patients what they want in a multi-channel environment. So you can get 30 day, you can get 90 day, you can get it, we can ship it via our mail service, or you can pick it up at our retail pharmacies.", "Operator", "And next, we'll move on to Patricia Baker with Scotia Capital.", "Patricia Baker - Scotia Capital Inc.", "Two very quick questions. First of all, Wade, both you and Greg referenced the real importance of driving private label. Can you tell us what sort of progress you've made in the second quarter over second quarter last year on a 12-month rolling basis? Have you seen an improvement in penetration?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I don't know if we can give the exact statistics. As you know, our private label tends to be about 20%. We continue to increase that over time, I guess the key thing I would say is we continue to strengthen the team. We've got a very strong private label team. Duane Reade had, not only a strong team, but they are also had great tiered offerings, differentiated offerings in some categories like foods, for example, where we were not strong as them. So I think, really, what I would say is the big story for us is to continue to enhance our capabilities, continue to fill out what I call our architecture in terms of the various tiers and what the brand nomenclature is going to be like across the store, and we just see that we have really tremendous upside here.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Patricia, I'd add, I feel good with not only the team and the talent we put together, as Wade said, but also where we stand at this point in time. We've got two opportunities here. One, we've got a very strong private brand already, in over-the-counter cough and cold, that type of product, that we have the opportunity just to make it even better and drive that even greater. We also have the under penetration I've talked about before in consumer consumables, which is where I think, obviously, the Duane Reade expertise, deal coming out of Loblaw's and the food business can help our existing team there tremendously. So we feel we got good upside there.", "Patricia Baker - Scotia Capital Inc.", "Okay, and presumably, if you improve the architecture, et cetera, we should be able to see better profitability but over time, the penetration should grow even...", "Wade Miquelon", "Couple of things, number one, as you know, it's more profitable than base and number two, if executed well, it's really differentiated [ph] just for other retailers too.", "Patricia Baker - Scotia Capital Inc.", "Somewhat related but not quite, in your opening remarks, Greg, you talked about the pace of remodels of the Duane Reade stores going to pick up in the second half, can you give us a little more color on that? How much of a pickup and exactly, how many stores you might be touching?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, I think I'll avoid giving numbers, Patricia. I will say this, the reason we're picking up the pace is we're excited with what we're seeing. And I'm sure if you haven't gotten into a few of those stores, you should, because you'd understand exactly why we're excited. So we definitely think we've got a tremendous opportunity in Manhattan. Duane Reade has a tremendous footprint in the market. The existing remodels are doing well, exceeding our expectations and so, therefore, it makes sense to increase pace.", "Patricia Baker - Scotia Capital Inc.", "Are you making progress at improving their pharmacy because they would have been under-productive pharmacies?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, I think that's an opportunity for us that Kermit's working on. We're in the process of some of the systems conversions right now. Our pharmacy systems, which will -- once we get that completed, that will allow us to be able to transfer prescriptions from a Duane Reade to a Walgreens across the country, and which is one of the things that really set ourselves apart over the last decade, was to build a -- to transfer scripts around. So yes, I think we're going to build to help them on the pharmacy side of the business just as they brought a lot of value to us in other areas of their business.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from David Magee of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. I guess just a quick observation and then a question. You referenced earlier about the third quarter being sort of a tough comparison, and I recall that as being sort of a disappointing quarter. And I know gross dollars grew, but everything else seemed to be below expectations for the third quarter last year. In fact, the last two third quarters were down on a year-to-year basis. So it seems like that in total, it's really not that tough a comparison, but maybe that's the observation yet -- what I wanted to ask though was just about the gross margin visibility. In the last couple of quarters, when you showed nice FIFO improvement, you talked about some structural improvement with regard to promotions and marketing. Are those still operative on a year-to-year basis, and is that something that should benefit us here in the third quarter?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Dave. I'll take the second, and Wade will get the first one. But yes, I think what we're doing with pricing promotion and the work that Bryan and Kim are doing, certainly, we're continuing to get stronger. I do think that as was mentioned from an earlier caller, that certainly, we're going to begin to see more and more commodity price -- commodity increases and so forth that will challenge us a little bit going forward. But that's exactly what we will have to do is continue to pass on what we can, what makes sense, stay competitive, drive private brand to balance it. So I think that the team is getting stronger. They're getting more focused on achieving that balance.", "Wade Miquelon", "I guess, like Greg say, with respect to the third quarter, I mean, I think the point we're making is that if you look at the back half of the year, the gross profit is harder to cycle, and the SG&A is easier to cycle, and it comes back to that 100 basis point model. What I would say also in the third quarter, I do recall we have some static in there, I think half the quarter, we had Duane Reade in, then we also had, I believe, a tax adjustment from the healthcare reform, things like that. So I think you have to read all the way through it, but I think  what we really want to, I guess, convey is again is factor that structural framework, that construct of gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars, and at the back half, SG&A becomes easier, gross profit dollars become a bit more difficult, and just think about that as you get into your models.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, and that's fair, but the sales numbers, also it seems to me, is sort of an easy comparison too. But just another quick question, what are you seeing right now with regard to your competition and the higher input prices? Are you seeing them trying to hold the line, or are you seeing any movement upward with regard to your peers?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, David, maybe I'll let Mark Wagner jump in, get him a question here. But I would say that we're seeing kind of a mixed bag. There's some out there that are holding, and some that are taking, the market...", "Mark Wagner", "Yes, that's right, Greg. I mean, we're doing competitive pricing everyday out there across the United States. I mean, we're looking at all our competitors and all our different zones around the United States. We're making pricing. We take price increases. We take price decreases. I mean it's just the everyday nature of our business. I would say that you probably see a little bit more price increasing coming through but at the same time, I mean we're seeing some nice trends in our private brands too as people switch over to something a little more affordable. So we're happy with the share increase we're getting. And we're happy with the execution we're getting in the stores, and staying on top of the pricing.", "Operator", "That's all we have for the questions today. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional remarks.", "Rick Hans", "Folks, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, we'll announce March sales on April 5. Keep in mind that March sales will be negatively impacted by this year's later Easter, which falls on April 24 compared to April 4 last year. The company will report combined comp store sales for March and April with the April sales results. We will report third quarter results on June 21. Until then, thank you for listening. And we look forward to talking with you soon.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, our President and CEO, and Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the quarter and the additional announcement this morning regarding Express Scripts. Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Kermit Crawford, our President of Pharmacy, Health & Wellness Services and Solutions; and Mark Wagner, President of Community Management.

Please see our latest Form 10-K and 10-Q filings for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory Wasson", "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on our call. I'll give you an abbreviated review of our strong third quarter financial results and then Wade will take you through the details of our performance. And finally, we'll spend more time on our announcement this morning regarding the PBM Express Scripts. ", "Starting with our results today, we had a very solid quarter, which demonstrates that our strategies are generating strong financial results. We reported record third quarter sales of $18.4 billion, up 6.8% from $17.2 billion a year ago. Net earnings for the quarter were up 30.3% to a record $603 million compared to $463 million a year ago. Third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.65, an increase of 38.3% versus last year's $0.47 per diluted share, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings per share growth.", "Strong cash flow trends continued in the quarter with cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $1 billion. In the quarter, we grew our gross profit by 8.5% and our SG&A by 7.2%. Our performance this quarter was a result of our ability to grow gross profit dollars faster than SG&A dollars, allowing us to deliver on our goal of double-digit earnings per share growth.", "This quarter, gross profit dollar growth was $122 million above SG&A dollar growth, yielding an EBIT growth of 14.8%. Driving our gross profit dollar growth, we saw solid performance across a number of categories including retail pharmacy, over-the-counter medications, beauty and personal care. While we continue to grow our business and invest in the future, our strategies are implemented against a backdrop of economic and regulatory uncertainties. ", "Persistent high unemployment, a weak housing market, high fuel prices and inflation all put pressure on consumers. In response, we believe our customers are managing their overall spending by buying more ad and private brand items, as well as continue to see mix shift to consumables and nondiscretionary items.", "Regarding inflation, we constantly monitor the competition and believe we are achieving the right balance between margin and traffic in our front-end comp. In addition, we continue to experience both commercial and governmental reimbursement pressure. On the government side of the issue, it's too early to speculate on the eventual timing and impact of AMP. ", "And on the regulatory front, we are pleased that the Senate took action on debit card reform. While the substance of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill is clear, both the timing and financial implications are still unknown, and it's premature to speculate on any impact to our business. As we respond to a changing business climate, we also focus on solid execution to generate results. Throughout this quarter, we continued with our Customer Centric Retailing conversions, and in early June, reached a milestone of 4,000 CCR stores. We're on track to achieve our goal of 5,500 stores transitioned to CCR by the end of October this calendar year. ", "Overall, we're very pleased with the pace and success of our CCR conversions. With Walgreen employees responsible for much of the work, we're completing stores 30% faster this year than last, with costs running at about $45,000 per store. Customer satisfaction is up in converted stores and we believe that the success of CCR is being reflected in our solid front-end comp store sales numbers. ", "In addition to our focus on our core business, we also recently made significant strategic advancements as we continue to align our assets with our strategies. In the quarter, we announced the sale of our PBM and the acquisition of drugstore.com. On June 3, we closed on our transaction with drugstore, and we're pleased to welcome our new team members to the Walgreens family.", "With the acquisition, we strengthen our position as the most convenient, multichannel provider of health and daily living, giving our customers more ways to connect and buy our wide range of products and services. I also want to acknowledge and thank the employees of WHI. We closed that transaction with Catalyst Health Systems on June 13, and I want to wish the team all the best in their new positions with Catalyst. ", "The sale sharpened our focus on our strategy to leverage the best community store network in America. In addition, the strategic relationship gives us the opportunity to expand all pharmacy products and services, including retail pharmacy, both 30- and 90-day supplies, mail service and specialty and infusion pharmacy, while Catalyst grows its PBM.", "Also, during the quarter, we developed collaborations with a number of hospitals and health systems designed to improve patient care, provide greater access to important pharmacy and healthcare services and lower costs. These collaborative relationships demonstrate how Walgreen pharmacists, nurse practitioners and other professionals are integrating our services and solutions into the healthcare systems within our communities for our patients' and customers' benefit. ", "In May, we announced a wide-ranging agreement with Johns Hopkins Medicine. The agreement promotes collaboration on population-based research. We'll also jointly review and develop protocols to improve outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. Continuing our focus on patient outcomes and chronic care, we launched a program with Northwestern Memorial Physicians Group of Chicago. Through the program, Walgreens and Northwestern Memorial employees will receive specialized care for chronic conditions. We will share important clinical information on the patient's care in progress with their primary care physicians to help enhance decision-making. ", "And finally, Take Care Health Systems, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens, has developed relationships with Ochsner Health Systems in New Orleans and Memorial Health in Jacksonville, Florida. With these agreements in place, physicians will share information with their patients on Take Care Clinics and on other healthcare options when their practices are closed or they are unable to schedule an appointment within a patient's desired timeframe.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Wade for more detail on our results.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by saying we are pleased with our strong performance on our key financial metrics in what continues to be a challenging economic environment. As Greg mentioned, our net sales increased 6.8% to $18.4 billion. And our net earnings increased by 30.3% to $603 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.65, a 38.3% increase.", "Our comparable sales trends have improved from a year ago with prescription sales up 4.1%, front-end sales up 3.9% and total sales up 4.1%. And our prescriptions filled were up 4.6% for the quarter. Looking at our comp trends more closely, our quarterly script trends, shown in the green bars, increased by 4.6% in the quarter, up from last year's 2.5%, continuing to outpace the industry growth rate of 1.1% excluding Walgreens. ", "On a 2-year stack basis, represented by the blue line, comparable prescription increases remain in the 6% to 8% range, with a spike in the first quarter of 2010 caused by the unusual timing and severity of the 2010 flu season. Retail prescription market share for the quarter was 20.1% compared to a 19.7% a year ago. ", "Our quarterly front-end sales comps increased to 3.9%, up from 0.1% a year ago. And we believe the CCR initiative, including expansion of and focus on core product categories and the rollout of beer and wine, continue to gain traction and drive our comps. The CCR initiative also helped drive the holiday sales comp this past Easter. And finally, the 2-year stack, shown by the blue line, continued to trend up after bottoming out in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.", "Compared to the industry, our sales continued to perform well. When viewing a true to apples-to-apples time period that compares our front-end comps to our top 3 competitors based on their most recent reporting, we outperformed all by a wide margin as shown on this chart. We also continued to outperform on a 2-year stack basis as well.", "Turning to margin, our gross margin as a percent of sales was 28.1% in the quarter compared to 27.6% last year. Overall margins in the quarter were positively impacted by higher retail pharmacy margins as the effect of generic drug sales more than offset market-driven reimbursements, and front-end margins were driven by OTC drugs, beauty and personal care and several private-label categories. And that was partially offset by a higher provision for LIFO. Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, our front-end margins, while flat in the second quarter of 2011, increased in the other 5 quarters as shown.", "Pharmacy gross margin in the quarter improved with the impact of generics. As we discussed in recent quarters, additional progress obviously becomes increasingly difficult to achieve on these strong numbers. And please keep in mind that we will continue to believe that gross profit dollar growth and increases in traffic and basket are the most relevant measures of our progress. Two-year stack SG&A trends continue to improve with 15.8% growth in the third quarter of 2011, down from 17.1% last year and 18.7% in 2009.", "After adjusting for restructuring-related costs and cost associated with the Duane Reade acquisition, our 2-year stack SG&A trends also showed steady improvement to 12.4%, down from 13.4% last year and 17.6% in 2009.", "Finally, walking through the progression of our reported SG&A dollar growth rate of 7.2% to our adjusted core SG&A rate of 6.4%, you can see the impact versus a year ago. Lower Duane Reade integration expenses offset SG&A dollar growth by 60 basis points. Higher Duane Reade operating expenses added about 150 basis points and lower net cost associated with our Rewiring for Growth initiative offset our SG&A growth by 10 basis points, all versus a year ago.", "Taking you through our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $50 million versus $18 million a year ago. Our estimated annual inflation rate for the current year remained at 2.25% versus 1.25% a year ago. Restructuring costs were $11 million, down from $17 million last year. Net interest expense was $18 million, down from $24 million a year ago, primarily as a result of reduced interest rates associated with our interest rate swaps. ", "Our effective tax rate was 35.4% versus 42.5% last year and recall that last year's effective tax rate included a $43 million charge in deferred taxes related to the Medicare Part D subsidy for retiree medical benefits. This year's third quarter benefited from a favorable state tax settlement. For the fourth quarter and the year, we expect our effective income tax rate to be about 37%.", "Average diluted shares outstanding were 922 million versus 982 million a year ago, due primarily to our share repurchase program. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.7 billion at May 31, up 14.7%. Overall working capital decreased by 2.3% versus a year ago while working capital as a percent of sales decreased by 8.5%.", "Total FIFO inventory increased by 7.7% in the quarter and by 5% on a per-store basis. For the 9 months ended May 31, 2011, we generated $3.3 billion in cash from operations compared to $2.8 billion a year ago, primarily as a result of higher net earnings. Capital expenditures were $699 million, down from $786 million last year. ", "As one of our core capital allocation priorities, we continue to return surplus cash to shareholders, and in the third quarter, we returned $535 million, including $160 million in dividends and $375 million through share repurchases. As of May 31, 2011, we repurchased $825 million against our $1 billion authorization. And as you can see year-to-date, we have returned a total of nearly $1.7 billion to shareholders.", "Now this slide shows our gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 7 quarters, with the blue line representing 2010 and the green line representing the first 3 quarters of 2011. The red line above shows the 2-year stack trend. Last year's fourth quarter benefited from the initial inclusion of Duane Reade, a higher level of organic store openings and the rollout of beer and wine to about 3,500 stores, all of which we'll be cycling in the upcoming quarter. ", "As you can see the fourth quarter, will have the most difficult gross profit dollar comparisons of the year. And we'll continue to see some volatility resulting from the timing of generic introductions. As an example, we received greater gross profit dollar help from new generics in the third quarter versus a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the help from generics to be significantly less than it was last year.", "We have a similar construct for SG&A dollar growth for the last 7 quarters, with the blue line representing 2010 and the green line representing the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2011 and the red line showing the 2-year stack trend. As you can see, we're cycling a high rate of SG&A dollar growth this year due to Duane Reade acquisition, so the compare there will be easier than the prior quarters in the year. ", "As Greg said, we closed both the WHI and drugstore.com transactions in June. We expect the sale of WHI to be accretive to earnings by about $0.30 in fiscal 2011, largely due to the onetime gain on the sale, and neutral in 2012, not including the reinvestment of the proceeds. As we indicated at the announcement, we anticipate the drugstore.com transaction will be dilutive to earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 by about $0.03 to the transaction related and onetime cost. ", "Based on Walgreens' intention to reinvest in the business, the company further anticipates the transaction to be dilutive to earnings per share by about $0.03 to $0.04 in fiscal 2012 and about $0.01 to $0.02 in 2013. ", "Well, in closing, we are pleased with our quarterly results, which represented record third quarter sales, net income, earnings per diluted share and free cash flow, all notwithstanding an unforgiving economic environment. It is a validation that our strategies are translating into solid financial performance. And I want to acknowledge every one of our 244,000 employees who work hard every single day to help drive these results. And now I'll turn the call back to Greg for details regarding the developments with Express Scripts.", "Gregory Wasson", "Thanks, Wade. First, let me start by saying while not easy, this was a very clear decision for us. And one that we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders, our patients, our customers and our company. ", "Based on the terms and rates that Express Scripts has insisted on and after months of unsuccessful negotiations, we have reluctantly concluded it does not make sense for our business and the strategic direction of our company to continue our relationship with them. As a result, we're planning not to be a part of Express Scripts pharmacy provider network as of January 1, 2012. ", "This means that in January, Express Scripts provider network will no longer include our 7,700 Walgreen stores and Duane Reade pharmacies. Despite today's announcement, we remain committed to serving all of our patients' pharmacy and healthcare needs in the Express Scripts plan through end of this calendar year. To give you more context on our decision, as the largest provider in the Express Scripts network, we no longer felt like a valued partner for several reasons. ", "They were insistent on unacceptable reimbursement for the value we provide. In fact, their proposed reimbursement rates were below the published industry average cost to provide each prescription. Express Scripts attempted to define unilaterally what does and does not constitute a brand and generic drug despite existing industry standards, which when combined with the unacceptable rates further compounds the problem.", "And third, they wanted the ability to move Walgreens into lower reimbursement networks and benefit designs without our approval and without fair compensation, reducing the predictability we need to forecast our business adequately. As I said as I began my comments, I want to emphasize this was not a decision we made lightly. We considered all our alternatives. But based on Express Scripts' position, it was very clear, principled decision for us.", "We believe the long-term ramifications of accepting Express Scripts' position with below market rates and minimal predictability would have been much worse than any short-term impact to our earnings. Given that, accepting Express Scripts' position would not have been in the long-term interest of our company, our customers, our pharmacists and our shareholders. ", "Furthermore, in a world where cost effectiveness and access to healthcare is so important, any time an intermediary continues to disproportionally grow its profit per prescription at the expense of the provider delivering the service, the relationship's out of balance.", "The fact is we fill one out of 5 retail prescriptions in America, patients and payers value the trust and relationship they have with their pharmacist. They value the high quality, cost effectiveness and convenience we provide, which is why we work with hundreds of PBM and health plan networks across the country. ", "To give you some of the history, we've been in negotiations with Express Scripts for many months. Our team worked hard in a concerted effort to come to an agreement on a contract renewal that makes sense for both parties. We came in to our discussions with Express Scripts with what we thought was a market-based reasonable approach to terms and rates. We proposed to lower rates on the behalf of the Department of Defense TRICARE program, the pharmacy benefit plan managed by Express Scripts that serves active and retired military personnel. We also offered to contract separately with Express Scripts for TRICARE beneficiaries in order to continue providing services for all active and retired military personnel.", "Under our proposal, the reimbursement costs of the DOD [Department of Defense] would have been lower than under Walgreens' new proposed commercial rates. For all other plans managed by Express Scripts, we offered to hold rates for a new contract at the level that will be in effect with Express Scripts at year end, which will be lower than current rates. ", "As for the impact on our business from this decision, we estimate that Express Scripts will reimburse Walgreens approximately $5.3 billion in fiscal 2011. This figure represents about 7% of our total company sales. Those sales divide into 4 distinct categories. Managed care represents 45% of the business, 18% goes to the Department of Defense, 26% to employers and 11% is Medicare Part D. Express Scripts processes approximately 90 million prescriptions that are expected to be filled by Walgreens in fiscal 2011.", "To mitigate that impact, we intend to work closely with our PBM and health plan partners. We've heard loud and clear over the past year from employers and payers that they value the choice, cost effectiveness, convenience and service of Walgreens. As a result, over time, we are optimistic employers and others are going to want Walgreens in their network. ", "Second, during the open enrollment period, we will reach out to the Medicare beneficiaries to make sure they know how to have access to Walgreens pharmacies they have known and trusted for years. We will assist them in finding Medicare Part D plans with access to Walgreens. And finally, we will work directly with employers and payers, who have the ability to work directly with Walgreens.", "For all of these reasons, we are optimistic about our ability over time to regain these customers and grow our business. For now, however, we're not going to speculate publicly about the amount of business we can retain in fiscal year 2012 or the potential impact on our financial metrics and stated goals. In the long run, we believe employers will want plans with Walgreens in the network. ", "With that said, Walgreens is moving forward with our strategies, and I'm confident in our future. Never in my years with this company have I seen so much interest from key stakeholders within the industry for the services Walgreens can deliver. We're prepared to live without Express Scripts in our world and work together with companies that understand the course we, in the healthcare industry, are taking.", "As we've demonstrated in this and recent quarters, we're focused on helping our patients live well and on our strategy to transform community pharmacy to improve the overall cost and quality of care. With that, I'll turn the call back to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Greg. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Can you give us a little more detail on how you'll go about with the mitigating strategies and how fast you can act on those conversions?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Mark, this is Greg. Yes, as we said, I think, first, I'll start with the Medicare Part D beneficiaries. The pharmacist has a very trusted relationship, a close relationship with all seniors and all Medicare Part D beneficiaries. We intend, as I said, to work with them to make sure we help them find access to plans that have Walgreens in their network during open enrollment. Two, we do believe that in most cases, PBM contracts, health plan contracts typically are 3-year contracts, and typically most of those turn over about once -- 1/3 of them every year. So we intend to work with the hundreds of PBMs and health plans that we do business with, that we think value Walgreens in their network. We heard that loud and clear over the past year that they want Walgreens in their network. And third, we think that there's a fair number of employers and health plans who have the ability to work directly with us and we intend to work with them as well.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Contrast this with what happened with CVS last year. It seems like the CVS dispute was more over macking [ph] and maybe talk about this one versus that dispute.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Mark, I think certainly this is about Express Scripts and the proposal we received from them. Frankly, as we said in the call, I think first and foremost, we weighed this and obviously didn't make the decision lightly. And we considered all the alternatives as I said. But really what we can agree with is someone having the ability to unilaterally decide what constitutes a generic drug or brand drug. We can't agree to someone putting us into a lower cost network or a network with a different benefit design, as I said, without our approval or without us getting compensated for the buying shift that, that creates. And third, we just can't accept rates that are less than industry average and does not value what we bring to the marketplace.", "Wade Miquelon", "I put it simply, I mean, while we're not here to talk about CVS Caremark, I guess, what I would say is that we are taking a principled stand that we deserve to be treated and compensated fairly for what we do. Nothing more, nothing less.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mark Miller of William Blair.", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "It seems like a lot of the grievances you're citing here have existed for some time. And so it could be viewed as, I guess, constant. What specifically here has changed? And then I guess, what are the aspects of prior settlements that you want to see in parallel? I think predictability is one thing. But I guess, why is this happening now and why not prior years?", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, I think that, Mark, Greg, a good question. First of all, the proposed rates are well below the market rates that we have. And therefore -- and in fact, less than the industry average to fill us and provide us scripts as I said. Secondly, there are industry standards out there that define generic drugs today that the industry uses. And for someone to unilaterally decide to redefine a generic drug does not make sense to us and we can't accept.", "Wade Miquelon", "And I would say, Mark, I mean, obviously, negotiating with PBMs, managed care, whatever is a way of life, right. It's just part of the game, everybody wants to make sure that they do what's right for their company. So it happens all the time, it's just very seldom does it goes public. And honestly, we are so far apart from what we believe is principled and fair that it's not something that's going to be -- it's not going to be resolved honestly.", "Gregory Wasson", "And Mark, I would say, we were surprised by the proposal that we received from Express Scripts a couple of months ago. Surprised that the terms and conditions we received, the fact that they were looking for reimbursement rates far below the market rates that we have. And as Wade said, we work successfully with hundreds of networks across the country all the time.", "Mark Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Can you just explain this last sentence in the third bullet, \"for other plans managed by Express Scripts, Walgreens offered to hold rates at a new contract at a level that will be in effect at year-end, which will be lower than current rates?\" I don't understand what that means.", "Wade Miquelon", "It means, we basically, as of December 31, offered to Evergreen that agreement, basically, right. But which we already feel quite frankly is not an acceptable agreement but that was -- in event, that's already below-market but that was what we felt was a very amicable proposal at the time.", "Operator", "Going next to Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Follow-up on some of the mitigations strategies. Could you just talk on the cost structure side, to what extent you could bring down pharmacy hours so that as work kind of get to -- capital contributions?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Andy. Greg. Certainly, we've talked this through clearly. And we're prepared, and we have a plan. And certainly, we've looked at the areas where we're ready to adjust SG&A where we can, where we should. All of the above, as you just said, operating hours and others are in our plan. But we feel confident that we can adjust as needed and are prepared to do so.", "Wade Miquelon", "And this is a very important point. Even the worst-case scenario, if us moving forward, living in our world without Express Scripts in it is certainly better than what they were proposing. And we certainly have many things, levers we can pull, cost offsets, et cetera, that I guarantee you that our path forward for shareholders and for employers is better than the alternative, even in the worst-case scenario.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay, and I know you probably -- someone asked about you're pairing this to CVS, but it seems so similar. It is similar, but it sounds like in a way this was a little more shocking and more of a discontinuous kind of, \"Hey, here's our new offer. \" And it's as if wherein CVS, it seems like Caremark -- it seems like maybe the issues have been kind of culminating, maybe came to a head. Is that -- am I reading that right? Is this sort of like more of an out-of-the-blue really discontinuous change in the business relationship and therefore, the profitability in the new business?", "Gregory Wasson", "Mark, Greg, yes. As I've said, we were surprised by the initial proposal we received. We've been working for several months to try to come to a successful agreement with what we thought were fair and reasonable terms and conditions for the value we provide. We haven't been successful, and therefore, we felt that it was necessary to inform our shareholders on this earnings call that where we are and that we're prepared to go on. As Wade said and as I said earlier, that although we are in the business to fill prescriptions, we didn't take this lightly, as I'm sure you wouldn't -- would expect. When we look at the long-term ramifications to our business, it's far worse than the short-term impact would have been, having accepted below-market rates.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Clarify a few things, if I could. One, I think it was Wade before, did you sort of say that this is not going to be resolved? I just want to be clear are you guys still open to negotiations? Or...", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I would say this -- I would say that we're not going to back off our principles and our stand that we deserve fair compensation, market-based compensation for what we do. If that day comes so be it. But if not, we're prepared to move forward.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. So in theory, there could be a deal, it's just a matter of it's got to be closer to your terms.", "Wade Miquelon", "Of course.", "Gregory Wasson", "Tom, this is Greg. Let me add to that. Certainly, as I've said, we're in a business to fill prescriptions. And certainly, if we can reach an agreement some point in time, where our issues that we lay down are accepted, certainly. But I also want to be clear that we are prepared, as I said, to continue to live in a world without Express Scripts. We're prepared. We've got a plan in place to do that.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then this generic versus brand definition, is there -- were they proposing a change versus what you've seen in the past? Or is there some new sensitivity on your part as to why this is an issue?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, the proposals, I said, is redefining what we understand the industry has used for years to define a generic drug. And I feel to  unilaterally defined what constitutes a generic and brand-name drug is not acceptable.", "Wade Miquelon", "I mean, honestly any agreement where one party can define and change levers and things that they want any time they want basically means that they can do any thing they want.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "That's different than the contract you've had in the past, that nuance? Is that nuance different than the contract you've had...", "Gregory Wasson", "We're just talking today, Tom, about the proposal going forward.", "Wade Miquelon", "[indiscernible] our current terms in contracts.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And the last thing, the $5.3 billion that you called out, to what extent would you estimate that there are front-end sales related to that foot traffic?", "Wade Miquelon", "Obviously, front-end sales are in a big correlation to prescriptions. As we've said many times, we're not going to speculate on any of the numbers per se, today.", "Operator", "The next question comes from UBS, Steven Valiquette.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank", "You guys mentioned that you were surprised by the terms offered by Express. I'm just curious just from your end. I mean, what you think is driving the more difficult terms that are being demanded by Express and maybe some of the other PBMs? And also, I mean, you went through with CVS last year, Express this year, is there any color on when your Medco contract might be up for renewal or has it been renewed recently? Those are my 2 questions.", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, I mean, we can't speculate on what's driving. And I would say obviously, if organic volume for them is roughly flat and their gross profit per dollars and EBITDA per script keeps going up, that probably suggests something. But with respect to Medco or others, we're not here to talk about any other party. We have good relationships with hundreds of other plans, and we're going to continue on that. And this is really about Express Scripts.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Meredith Adler of Barclays Capital.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "I have just a related question. What do you think the chances that Express Scripts does what Caremark did in terms of saying, \"No, January 1, you really -- we're going to kick you out in the next 3 weeks\"? Is that something they have the ability to do?", "Gregory Wasson", "Meredith, I'm not going to speculate on what Express Scripts might do. As I said, we've made this decision, and we thought it through, consider all options. And we are prepared to move forward in a world without Express Scripts. So I can't speculate on what they may do, but we're prepared to move forward.", "Wade Miquelon", "Our high road objective of January 1 is just to make sure that there's time for payers and patients to transition, if necessary, so that we don't disrupt them because at the end of the day, we should both take the high road around that.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then another question about -- they've been public about their view on limited network. Obviously, Walgreen in -- not in the network is a big deal. That isn't a simple limited network to put together. But in your conversations with them, when they were talking, was there posturing about own [ph] limited networks to the direction we think the industry should go in?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Meredith. We've read that, and we've heard comments in the industry about restricted networks. First of all, as I said, we've heard loud and clear the past year that employers and health plans absolutely want Walgreens in their network. Frankly, the cost savings from restricting a pharmacy network is really is not substantial enough to reduce access, for most is what we're hearing loud and clear. And finally, health plans and health systems today are really looking beyond pharmacy. They're looking for community pharmacy to help them reduce their overall medical costs while improving access and the quality of care. And I'll tell you, frankly, I believe the days of isolating and focusing on drug spend separate from medical costs are coming to a close. So I think that folks today are looking for help from community pharmacy to attack their entire medical costs, improve access versus just focusing on their pharmacy spend.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Well, I hope Express Scripts is listening to what you're saying.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Guggenheim Securities, John Heinbockel.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "From a long-term perspective, one that just concerns me is that when the generic wave kind of runs its course, that the level of confrontation between you guys and the PBMs would ratchet up. It looks like it's happening to some degree. How do you think about that long-term? If down the road there's less profit coming from generic, will the level of confrontation increase? How do you guys deal with that longer term?", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, John, first of all, as we've said before, I think anyone in healthcare we're always going to be facing reimbursement pressure of some type. I will circle back to the answer and the comment I just made to Meredith earlier. I think the value of community pharmacy going forward, working with forward-looking health plans and health systems that are looking to control their total medical costs, improve access is where we're headed. One of our major initiatives and strategies, as you know, is to transform the role of community pharmacy place in healthcare by expanding our scope of services via pharmacists, nurse practitioners and so forth. And that's when I say I've never had in my time with this company so much interest in what community pharmacy and what we can offer to health plans and health systems across the country.", "Wade Miquelon", "I guess, I would say and I said many times publicly, it's probably broader, this discussion is. We believe, that in a world of all generics and beyond the wave that we have many, many, many ways that we can drive value for our company and value for the people and the patients and the payers that we serve. So I think that there will always be some tension, but I think we're confident that there's enough things that we can do and over time that we have a very strong model.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And second topic, just on SG&A dollars. Maybe describe where you think we are with that. It looks like you're going to come in toward the high end of your range for the year. Do you think we're still on target for 3.5% to 4.5% growth next year? And what's the operating cost environment look like right now in terms of pressure on labor utilities, et cetera?", "Wade Miquelon", "Just a couple of things, number one is we are on track for our target next year of 3.5% to 4.5%. So very confident about that. But the fourth quarter, as you know last year was basically, I'd say, it's an easy comp. To make sure that you kind of on all the numbers, you are running the 2-year specs to really get the 2-year trend. I'd say with respect to cost, I mean, there's some inflationary pressure. But there's also, there's also, I'd say, in other areas, deflationary pressure because of the high unemployment and the economy. So we believe we can definitely manage to our targets.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "As you look out to the generic payback and 2012 and Lipitor and what have you, can you give us any perspective of how you think the reimbursement rate environment is going to evolve in that regard, specifically how reimbursement rates would have then allow you to earn on the incremental generics in 2012?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Greg here. I think that as you said, as we see the generic wave coming, I think, certainly generics are good for all. I think when -- I think, certainly, we're going to continue to see pressures, as I said, from being in the healthcare industry. But at the same time, when you think about a world where virtually every therapeutic category of drug has a generic, payers are going to see a dramatic reduction in costs just from that same wave. So will they be continue to be focused on cost? Yes. But are they going to see and experience big relief coming forward because every category will, in essence, have a generic? Yes, absolutely.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I guess within that as we start to get closer and see the reimbursement rate picture become more clear for 2012 with all these generics, how much of that are the payers sort of requiring goes into their pocket versus how much is able to be left to the benefit of the supply chain? I guess, that's what I'm specifically trying to understand.", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, fair question. I think as I said, payers who are holistically and I believe, trending to holistically looking at how to reduce their total costs are going to look at this in a more balanced and fair way. And frankly, that's what we're seeing. They're realizing that keeping folks adherent and compliant on drugs is much more beneficial than squeezing another few percent on the cost on the drug side itself.", "Operator", "Moving on to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Greg, I know that this would be about time when [ph] CVS was pretty short-lived. But I know at that point, you also talked about going out directly to managed care company as well as employers. Can you maybe just talk about any success you had and the early stages of funding agreements directly with any of those employers, #1? And then #2, yesterday, the state Senate here in New York passed an anti-mandatory mail potential law, which would now allow retailers that are willing to take mail order economics -- they would be allowed to fill that mail order prescriptions in their pharmacies. Can you maybe just give us your thoughts from a Walgreens perspective on that?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, I'll take the first. On going to direct employers, certainly, we have had success there. And we lead with the employers. We lead with our employer solutions product. We also have direct relationships with health plans and employers across the country, and we continue to see more of that. On the state of New York, we applaud that. We absolutely think that payers and employers benefit from having a 90-day retail benefit added to an existing mail benefit. And I think that through proper benefit design and structures, that does make sense for retail to participate.", "Lisa Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Can maybe Wade comment on the economics of that? So if you look today the average mail order contract is  AWP minus 23 or 24. If you have to take the exact same economics, such as the way that the bill is written, is that a profitable script to you on a 90-day basis?", "Wade Miquelon", "Look, I would say that there is no one contract. There is no one rate for mail. And when you factor it all together, it can be all over the map. But the truth is there's a lot of mail most of it is kind of shadow priced-off retail. Being able to do -- we can do a 90-day very cost effectively versus mail providing a discount for the payer, but also providing good economics for us given the benefit of being able to fill it once. So we'll have to look at that. I don't want to give an absolute but I think absolutely, we can be competitive, and we'll just have to see what the actual details are.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from John Baucom of Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Baucom - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "It's John Baucom for Matt Fassler, from Goldman. I know you guys touched on this a little bit, but would you mind just kind of going through the drivers of the underlying or adjusted 6.4% expense growth?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, we can talk a little bit. One thing I do want to clarify, too, is -- I think, it's John's question earlier -- the 3.5% to 4.5% target is kind of our, call it, our cost base. Obviously,  we said today with the Express Scripts, we don't know exactly where this will end, what our sales will be. So we're not going to clarify goals, but we're on track for that. I mean, the key drivers is obviously the same key drivers we've had before. We have a little bit less, to a degree [ph], because of partial quarter in there. We have our new store openings. We have some one-time costs associated with some of the deals that we've announced. But effectively, there's nothing out of the ordinary versus the normal trend.", "Jonathan Baucom - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. So there was no impact from the .com acquisition this quarter? And I know there's a 3% -- $0.03 impact next quarter, would you just remind us how the different line items flow through the P&L on that impact?", "Wade Miquelon", "With respect to the deals?", "Jonathan Baucom - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "The .com, the drugstore.com acquisition.", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I mean it's going to come across a couple of different lines, both in terms of what their actual earnings accretion is et cetera, plus we have some one-time and some expense costs that we're doing to beef up the proposition plus we have some [ph] related cost. So it cuts across all the various lines. It really just flows through it. But you have closing cost transaction fees, and like I said, you have the base P&L of the business.", "Jonathan Baucom - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then on the gross margin side, you talked about the big drivers there. Could you kind of quantify maybe the impact of input cost this quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, we've seen obviously some inflation coming through, though not huge amounts but some inflation. We feel we've been very effective at pricing with it and in front of it. That's our plan to keep pricing. So again, input costs are coming through a little bit. I think that while we do see higher fuel, et cetera, on our transportation we also get some benefit offset because we're very convenient, and so we get it through sales. I think you see it through our traffic as well. But really I think, thus far inflation is coming some but it's been manageable. And for the most part we plan on offsetting it through pricing. We'll stay competitive on that since we have to. But we'll also be smart how we play our whole portfolio and drive things like private label even harder.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "One topic we haven't really touched on is what you're seeing with regards with clinics. Can you just talk about what you're seeing with regards to profitability and also just traffic?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, Deborah. We're feeling good with the retail clinics. As you know and I think I talked last couple of calls, we've got over 300 out there. We've got scale. We now have really been able to look at the model and make some adjustments to the model, which are positive. So I think that such as expanding our scope of services beyond acute care into more screenings, chronic care management and primary care like we've -- we're seeing a different approaches. We're finding different approaches to market and build customer awareness. At the same time, we are hearing more and more, as I said, from health plans and hospital systems as we announced. Health systems are looking to leverage our retail clinics for access and affordable care. So we feel good there. Our employer business, our employer worksite health has the same thing there. We're seeing increased awareness and demand. We just signed the relationship with Ochsner Health, as we talked about. So we are feeling pretty good there, as well as our pharmacy on campus hospital system model. We're seeing a lot of interest from health systems who are looking for us to help them with their discharge process to prevent readmission.", "Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup Inc", "My thoughts have always been that as you continue to build out your relationships with the employers, that it might actually enable you to go directly to them and dis-intermediate, if you will, the PBMs. You're obviously in an interesting situation right now with Express Scripts, and Wal-Mart has been successful on going directly to employers. Can you maybe talk about how the relationships that you're building with employers because it looks that healthcare clinics might allow you to do this?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes. And first and foremost, let me say that we work with all stakeholders in the industry. So we have valued relationships with PBMs that help take our product and services to the marketplace, health plans that take our products or services, health systems, et cetera. But at the same time, you're right. We do have what we believe is a unique and value-added solution for employers to build or provide worksite health on their campuses. With that, we are indeed able to build -- create or build relationships because we create real value, and we believe are influential in a positive way as to how they design their benefits for the best of their employees.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Willoughby", "Greg and Wade, I guess your principles in holding the hard line with Express Scripts should be much more comforting if some of the other major retailers also banded together to reject some of these new terms. I mean I would assume Express is playing hardball with everybody. So how is this anything but Express leveraging what they perceive is overcapacity in the industry?", "Gregory Wasson", "Well, Bob, obviously I can't go there but this is certainly about Walgreens and the proposal that we received, and were surprised by from Express Scripts and the actions we are taking. We do believe that community pharmacy does provide value. We believe we certainly do. We think that payers are beginning to look for community pharmacy to provide services far beyond what others may be. So as I said, this is about us and Express Scripts.", "Wade Miquelon", "And it's also our principle stand is also being fair to the other payers that we work with and the other PBMs and managed care. It's not -- it wouldn't be right to give some super discount below market rate for only one at the expense of the others. We need to be fair to all of them.", "Kermit Crawford", "Bob, this is Kermit. I just like to add, really no other PBM has taken this position to this point.", "Robert Willoughby", "It's interesting. I would view you guys as having a cost advantage in participating in this business. It seems to me other retailers must be agreeing to some similar hard-line types of deals. It just strikes me unusual that they pick out one provider in their entire networks.", "Wade Miquelon", "We can't speak to them. We're very cost effective and very reasonable and very market-based.", "Gregory Wasson", "And Bob, again, let me go back to again this is between us and them. But at the same time, I will say that we have decided to take a leadership position in this industry to transform the role of community pharmacy. And to play a greater role in healthcare. And I think, there is a tremendous opportunity for us to do that. We have tremendous interest from key stakeholders in the healthcare industry for us to play that role. And that's where we're headed. We moving forward into that new world. And as I said, we're prepared and ready to live in a world without Express Scripts.", "Operator", "The next question will come from David Magee of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Two questions, one is when you sort of outline the mix of business that Express had earlier on the call, how would you characterize the profitability of that overall contract relative to other third-party contracts in 2011?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think we said that we believe there are already unacceptable rates, and the proposal is even more unacceptable. So I'll just leave it at that.", "David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay, so sort of below average right now. And then when you make your assumptions regarding the retention of business after this, are you sort of basing that on sort of hard evidence in the past where you've had contract withdrawals from maybe smaller companies?", "Gregory Wasson", "Yes, David, Greg. As I've said in the last year, year and a half, we've heard loud and clear from employers and health plans that they want Walgreens in their network for all the reasons that we stated: the convenience we bring; the 24 hour locations we bring, the services we are offering, the; cost effectiveness that we do bring; when you look at our generic utilization performance, the adherence and compliance; the rate terms and conditions we give. They're looking for is to be in the network.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Three questions for you, on the gross margin, you had a nice bounce back quarter in the gross margin after last quarter. You obviously said front-end and pharmacy were booked up. Can you talk about the sustainability of that over the next couple of quarters? It looks like the comparisons are obviously pretty tough in both of those quarters. Generics like you said, certainly are not going to help. Can you drive a positive gross margin over the next couple of quarters?", "Wade Miquelon", "I'm not really going to comment on the quarter. I would agree that there are tougher compares for various reasons that we outlined. I guess what I would say is we're a bit focused on not building a sandcastle but building a real castle, so over time how do we keep strengthening the foundation in the financials, the gross margin, the SG&A, making that model work, the 100 basis point model and over time, over a period. So I won't speculate on the quarter but I think that we feel that moving ahead, we have a very solid framework, and of course, we're moving into a good generic period, coming 2013, et cetera. So, I'll just leave it at that.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Wade, could you maybe talk about of the drivers of the front-end gross margin. This quarter -- I think, last quarter you had mentioned that it was more flattish. Obviously, it's positive. And then is there -- are there legs to that in and of those benefits as well?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, obviously, right now we're in the midst of kind of finishing out CCR so that brings a fair amount of, cost et cetera. But then over time, we believe, what we're seeing is we're going to have stronger margins and stronger lift resulting from it. We're also doing a better and better job of driving a very healthy mix for us, more beauty products, more OTC products, things like that. Private label, we've done a great job. But we still have a lot of upside, and we're putting a lot of effort in that. So there are definitely drivers over time that we can, I think, keep improving the margin. But again, I think, it's really have to look over the longer haul and keep focusing on 2-year specs.", "Edward Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And just last question for you. I mean, there's been obviously a lot of questions today about Express Scripts. And clearly, it's very -- at least, it seems very similar to what we saw last year with CVS. Can you just remind us how that negotiation progressed last year? And then last year, you started to see some real benefits in the gross margin when that resolution took place. So I know back then, you weren't really willing to talk about it. But is it something -- is there something that could provide similar benefits if it gets resolved in your favor?", "Gregory Wasson", "Ed, Greg. Certainly, I'm not going to comment much on the CVS Caremark other than to say, as we said in our release we were very pleased with the outcome of that issue. And we're working very closely with CVS Caremark today as a result. Again, this is about our relationship with Express Scripts and our desire to reach agreement on terms and conditions that are acceptable for the value we provide.", "Rick Hans", "Folks, that was our final question. As a reminder, the company will report June sales on July 6, and we will report the fourth quarter year-end results on September 27. Until then, thank you for listening, and we look forward to talking with you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference today.

Wasson", "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with a review of our quarter and fiscal year. Second, I'll provide an update on our status with Express Scripts. And finally, I'll discuss our strategies to become America's first choice for health and daily living. Then I'll turn it over to Wade, who will give you more details on our quarterly and full year performance, offer context around Express Scripts and frame the key considerations for fiscal year 2012. ", "Starting with our results today, we had a solid quarter and a strong year as we made substantial progress on our transformation strategy. You saw in our release this morning, we reported record fourth quarter sales of $18 billion, up 6.5% from $16.9 billion a year ago. Excluding the after-tax gain from the sale of WHI, our pharmacy benefit manager, which closed in June, fourth quarter EBIT increased to $832 million. Fourth quarter net earnings were $519 million, and fourth quarter earnings per diluted share increased to $0.57. ", "Our earnings this quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, which included a $434 million of pretax, $273 million after-tax gain or $0.30 per diluted share from the sale of WHI, fourth quarter EBIT was $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter net earnings were $792 million, and fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.87. ", "In addition to the gain from the sale of WHI, both our reported and our adjusted earnings per diluted share included $0.02 of dilution from our acquisition of drugstore.com and $0.01 of restructuring and restructuring-related costs associated with our Rewiring for Growth initiative. ", "Last year's fourth quarter results included the negative impact of $0.04 per diluted share related to the acquisition of Duane Reade and $0.01 per diluted share in Rewiring for Growth costs. As we've previously stated, in fiscal 2012, we expect $0.03 to $0.04 of dilution related to drugstore.com. Now turning to our performance for the fiscal year, we posted record sales of $72.2 billion, up 7.1% from $67.4 billion last year. Excluding the after-tax gain from the sale of WHI, our adjusted fiscal 2011 EBIT was $3.9 billion, up 13.7%, and our adjusted fiscal 2011 earnings per diluted share were $2.64, a 24.5% increase. On a GAAP basis, including the after-tax gain from the sale of WHI, fiscal 2011 EBIT was $4.4 billion, up 26.2%. Net earnings for the year were $2.7 billion, up 29.8%. In fiscal year 2011, earnings per diluted share were $2.94, up 38.7%. And finally, operating cash flow for fiscal 2011 was $3.6 billion versus $3.7 billion in fiscal 2010.", "In the fourth quarter, we grew gross profit dollars at 5.8% or $277 million versus SG&A dollars at 4.8% or $191 million, yielding an $86-million difference. For the full year, the spread between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth was $473 million. The spread reflects the success of our strategies to drive top line growth in our front end and our pharmacy and health and wellness services while carefully managing our costs. ", "Overall, our strong performance and solid results this year demonstrated that we are on the right track in our transformation as we continue to leverage the best store network in America and expand our Pharmacy, Health and Wellness Solutions. And most of all, our results this year demonstrated the value that Walgreens provides every day in communities across our nation. ", "Let me touch on some of the key milestones we achieved in fiscal 2011. On the pharmacy and healthcare side, Walgreens now fills 1 out of every 5 retail prescriptions in America with a record 819 million prescriptions filled, an increase of 5.3% in fiscal 2011. We also administered 6.4 million flu shots during the last flu season as we continued to be the largest provider of flu shots in the country outside of the government. ", "To expand the role we play in healthcare, we established important partnerships with top health systems, including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Ochsner Health System and Louisiana State University to name a few in order to enhance coordinated care to patients. ", "Turning to the daily living side. We refreshed and revitalized our front end, completing our plan launched in 2009 to convert or open 5,500 stores to our customer-centric retailing format, which offers more targeted assortment, better sidelines and new d\u00e9cor packages. Our CCR stores are reporting higher customer satisfaction and improved sales. ", "We've also expanded our product offerings across all of our stores, completing our roll out of beer and wine, adding fresh foods, launching a new format with expanded grocery in our Food Oasis stores and building our Private Brand business, including the August launch of Nice! In addition, we opened or acquired 199 net new drugstores this past year, including a 22,000-square-foot flagship Duane Reade store at 40 Wall Street with a pharmacy powered by Walgreens. We expanded our multi-channel capabilities with the acquisition of drugstore.com, which enables us to reach an additional 3 million online customers, forge relationships with new vendors and partners and add approximately 60,000 health, personal care and beauty products through online offering. ", "In terms of our financial highlights, in addition to record sales and earnings per diluted share, we completed our 3-year Rewiring for Growth cost savings initiatives and exceeded our $1 billion goal. Finally, we announced the largest dividend increase in the history of the company in July and including share repurchases, this year we returned a record $2.4 billion to shareholders. ", "Looking ahead, let me touch on our status with Express Scripts and the opportunities we see. As you know, our contract renewal negotiations have been unsuccessful, and we're planning not to be part of the Express Scripts network as of the first of the year. At the time we made our announcement on the last earnings call, we emphasized that the terms Express Scripts offered us, including rates that were below the industry average cost to provide a prescription, were not in the best interests of our company, our customers, our employees, or our shareholders and we still firmly believe that. We also said we intend to work closely with our partners who are focused on lowering overall healthcare costs and recognize the critical value that community pharmacy can provide. ", "Since then, many of these partners have indeed made clear that they value the choice, cost effectiveness, convenience and service of Walgreens and want to move forward with us. Also patients and employees have made it clear, they want to continue having the choice of Walgreens, maintaining their personal relationship with the pharmacists they've come to trust. This interest of our partners to maintain access to Walgreens community pharmacies has created additional opportunities for us. ", "Finally, during the upcoming open enrollment period, Medicare beneficiaries will be able to choose a plan that best meets their healthcare needs. Many Medicare plans include Walgreens in their pharmacy provider networks, and we expect that beneficiaries will take that into account as they make these important plan decisions.", "The interest in continuing a relationship with Walgreens demonstrates what our data has shown: that employers and plans are not interested in restricted networks for little or no savings and that without Walgreens in the network, their cost could actually go up while at the same time creating unnecessary patient disruption. ", "We know that Walgreens can play a vital role in advancing cost-effective Pharmacy, Health and Wellness Solutions. To make that clear, we recently released a white paper demonstrating the real value of Walgreens to pharmacy benefit networks. In addition to our competitive base pricing, we reduce overall costs for payers in many ways, including our generic convergence and utilization and our 90-Day at Retail program. With 74% generic penetration in Express Scripts' own network, which is 140 basis points better than the average of their network that does not include Walgreens, we produce a savings of around $2 per script. That comes about $180 million in total savings each year to Express Scripts and its clients. ", "Through our leading 90-Day at Retail program, Walgreens promotes 90-day prescriptions for patients on chronic medications, offering 6% to 8% savings compared with 30 day scripts. Allowing patients to receive extended supplies of chronic medications through a 90-Day at Retail benefit in addition to a 90-day mail benefit has been demonstrated to substantially lower cost, increase compliance and improve the overall health of patients. ", "In addition, we helped to reduce overall costs with our broad array of health services including immunizations, adherence programs and health screening and testing services. When you combine all these efforts to save overall costs, price, generic efficiency and 90-day scripts, it's clear why excluding Walgreens is not in the best interest of patients and payers, and why many of our partners want to stay with us. If you haven't already, I invite you to take a look at our The Value of Walgreens white paper on our website. ", "Now let me turn to the 5 key strategies that we are focused on to create even greater value for our customers and patients in this fiscal year and beyond. As we enter fiscal 2012, we continue to refine and strengthen our strategies to become the first choice for health and daily living for customers and patients across the country.", "First, as we complete the refresh of our stores, we're also moving forward to completely redefine the drug store experience, set us apart in our industry and establish Walgreens as a destination for consumers to meet a broad range of health and daily living needs. We're bringing together all the transformation strategies we've developed over the past 3 years to pilot an exciting new concept store for Walgreens. These new pilot formats give us the opportunity to create the physical expression of all the work we've talked about with you over the last several years: a redesigned pharmacy, a new front end with fresh food, expanded beauty and all of our learnings from CCR in one place. ", "Through this year, we've converted or opened 20 of these new concept stores in the Chicago area, and we've been expanding the pilot to Indianapolis. And in New York, at our 40 Wall Street store, we brought together the best of Duane Reade and Walgreens to create a truly unique shopping environment. We've also added Food Oasis stores to provide fresh food in underserved food desert communities and plan to open or convert at least 1,000 more over the next 5 years. ", "With a large existing presence in underserved markets, more than any other retailer today, we are uniquely positioned to address this opportunity. We continue to focus on advancing community pharmacy to play a greater role in healthcare through integration and expanded services. As you know, we've been very successful with our flu shot program, a great example of customers coming to the community pharmacist for broader healthcare services. As a result, we've added more healthcare solutions such as additional immunizations and vaccinations, health tests and screenings and clinical services. We're also playing a more significant role in improving health outcomes for patients by helping to improve adherence, medication management and the use of advanced specialty and infused medications through counseling support and education. ", "With our partnerships with health systems, we're taking the next steps in our communities to coordinate and integrate with national, regional and local health systems and advance the care our patients receive with some of the best physicians and clinicians in healthcare. For more about this, we just issued a second white paper that outlines our expanding scope of traditional pharmacy services, our leadership in home infusion and specialty pharmacy, our partnerships with major hospital systems managing their outpatient pharmacies and the expanding health and wellness services we provide through our Take Care Clinics.", "Next, as we transform the traditional drugstore and advanced community pharmacy, our third key strategy is to deliver an outstanding customer experience through enhanced employee engagement. Studies have shown that there is a direct link between how engaged employees feel at work, the quality of service they provide to their customers and the value delivered to shareholders. To continue to make that equation work, we are strengthening employee engagement by setting new standards, providing additional training and developing strong leadership. ", "We're also focused on expanding across new channels and markets to ensure our customers have access to what they want, when they want and where they want it. Fiscal 2011 was a pivotal year in our expansion of our multi-channel business as we welcomed drugstore.com into the Walgreens family of companies. Our teams are fully engaged and are on track with our integration efforts, and we're looking forward to the innovation and growth that will result from their efforts into fiscal 2012.", "We've also rolled out new services such as Web Pickup, services now available to all of our Chicago stores as well as our San Jose pilot market. And finally, we're reinventing our cost structure through continuous improvement and innovation rather than driving onetime programs designed to generate savings. We're building that cost discipline into our daily business operations and corporate DNA, making it a way of life at Walgreens as we look at SG&A and COGS differently.", "As we close the books on 2011, we're more excited than ever about the plans and initiatives we have underway as we continue the transformation of Walgreens into 2012 and provide even greater value for our customers and our patients. We've built a solid financial foundation that gives us a platform to continue to innovate and transform our business. We've accomplished a great deal this year, and it's thanks to all of our people, their focused effort and tremendous hard work. We're looking forward to 2012 and to continuing to accomplish great things for Walgreens. ", "And finally, we want to thank Dana Green, our recently retired General Counsel for her 37 years of service, and welcome Tom Sabatino, who joined us this month in that role. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg and good morning to everyone. This morning, I'll first review our quarter, then I'll update you on our plan to move forward without being in Express Scripts pharmacy network, including how we frame the potential fiscal 2012 earnings impact of that decision. ", "Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our strong performance on our key financial metrics in what continues to be a challenging economic environment. Following Greg's summary of our financial results, I'll begin with detail regarding comp trends. ", "Our fourth quarter comparable sales and prescription trends have each improved from a year ago with prescription comp sales increasing 4.4%, front-end comps sales increasing 4.6%, total comp sales increasing 4.4% and comparable prescriptions filled increasing 3.4% for the quarter. ", "For the year, our comparable sales trends have improved as well, with prescription sales comp up 3.3%, front-end sales comp up 3.3% and total sales comp up 3.3%. Finally, our RX script comp for the year was up 3.7% versus up 4.5% in fiscal '10, reflecting the slowdown of prescription utilization in the industry year-over-year. For fiscal 2011, we achieved 20% retail pharmacy share, up 50 basis points from fiscal 2010. ", "Looking at our quarterly trends over the past 3 years, our prescription comp, shown in the green bars, increased by 3.4% in the fourth quarter, up from last year's 3.3% despite the slowdown in the industry from 3.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. On a 2-year stack basis, represented by the blue line, comparable prescription increases remained in the 6% to 8% range. And finally, recall the spikes in the 2-year stack's in both the first quarter of 2010 and 2011 was caused by the unusual timing and severity of the 2010 flu season. ", "Our quarterly front-end comp sales were up a robust 4.6% versus an increase of about 1.2% a year ago. The biggest driver continues to be CCR, with over 5,500 stores either converted or opened in the new format to date, which was designed to positively impact the shopper experience and increase traffic and basket. ", "Into more specific categories, beer and wine contributed over 50 basis points to comp this quarter after adding 76 basis points a year ago. We continue to achieve a good mix between traffic and basket with traffic up 1.6% and basket up 3%. Within that basket, we are seeing some inflation and believe our convenience model affords us the ability to pass majority of it through. ", "The 2-year stack shown by the blue line continue to trend up, reaching 5.8% in the quarter after bottoming out in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Compared to the industry, our sales continued to perform well. When comparing our front-end comps to the next 3 largest retail pharmacy competitors, adjusting our comps to their calendars, we outperformed all 3 by a wide margin as shown on this chart. On a 2-year stack basis, we outperformed all 3 by over 300 basis points as well. Like everyone, we continue to see a cautious consumer and a competitive retail environment. This outperformance, we believe, is a reflection of our differentiated strategies coupled with strong execution.", "Turning to margin. Our gross margin as a percent of sales was up 28.2% in the current quarter compared to 28.4% last year. The front-end margin was lower primarily as we were up against a strong prior-year quarter. We believe our strategies are working to drive profitable front-end growth, good balance of mix, pricing and promotion. Overall margin change in the quarter was not impacted by pharmacy, which was flat year-over-year. ", "Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, this quarter, overall margins were cycling a 70-basis point improvement. So for the 2-year period, we achieved a 50-basis point gain. Looking forward, keep in mind that we are cycling an 80-basis point improvement in last year's first quarter, so as we've discussed in recent quarters, additional progress becomes increasingly difficult to achieve. As we frequently remind you, we believe that gross profit dollar growth and increases in traffic and basket rather than gross margin percent are the more relevant measures of our progress and will become increasingly important to consider as we move through the upcoming generic wave. ", "2-year stack SG&A trends improved versus a year ago with 15.8% growth in the fourth quarter of 2011, down from 20.6% last year. Recall that the fourth quarter in 2010, SG&A growth included 550 basis points impact from the acquisition of Duane Reade, which was a major driver of this year's lower SG&A dollar growth. After adjusting for restructuring-related costs associated with the Duane Reade acquisition in 2010 and costs associated with the drugstore.com acquisition in 2011, our 2-year stack SG&A growth showed improvement at 9.8% for the most recent period. ", "Finally, I'm pleased to repeat Greg's comments that we have completed our 3-year Rewiring for Growth initiative, successfully over delivering our $1 billion and one ongoing cost savings versus our 2008 base as reflected in the decline in SG&A dollar growth over the past 3 years. To get to our core SG&A dollar growth, you could see that our reported 4.8% SG&A growth included 70 basis points of operation costs and 30 basis points of transaction costs related to the drugstore.com acquisition. The remaining base SG&A dollar growth was a combination of store openings, inflation and business mix. With respect to our CCR, our SG&A included $84 million of CCR conversion costs in fiscal 2011, up from $45 million in fiscal 2010. ", "This next slide shows our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 8 quarters with the blue line representing fiscal 2010 and the green line representing fiscal 2011 and the red line showing the 2-year stack trend. The primary driver of our higher gross profit dollar growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first 3 quarters of 2011 was the acquisition of Duane Reade. When we cycled the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2011, you can see the slower gross profit dollar growth. As you look at the upcoming first quarter, you should consider the following points: First, the timing and severity of this year's cough, cold and flu season. Currently, the incidence of flu is running about 15% below a year ago. Second, we are cycling 2 years of strong gross profit dollar growth. And third, on a quarterly basis, we will continue to experience volatility resulting from the timing of generic introductions, which we believe will impact us more significantly as the year progresses. ", "And finally, regarding AMP, we are currently analyzing the draft FULs that CMS released last week, which are subject to a comment period and changes are anticipated. We are still awaiting the proposed AMP rule, which will provide direction to manufacturers for calculation on AMP. To date, manufacturers have been providing AMP data based on their interpretation of the Affordable Care Act without regulations. We will be working with states to increase their dispensing fees to more appropriately reflect pharmacy costs to dispense a prescription. And as we previously said, it's still premature to speculate on the ultimate timing and financial impact of AMP.", "We have a similar concept for SG&A dollar growth for the last 8 quarters, with the blue line representing 2010 and the green line representing the fiscal 2011 and the red line showing the 2-year stack trend. As you can see, SG&A dollar growth in the quarter was 4.8% versus 11% a year ago. Last year's SG&A dollar growth rate includes 550 basis points from the impact of the Duane Reade acquisition. Now as you can see from this slide, our first quarter will be our most difficult gross profit dollar comp of the year when we cycle a 9% gross profit dollar growth. Recall that our first quarter in fiscal 2011 was strong performance versus the prior year as well. ", "Taking you through our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $60 million versus $61 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 2.4%, up from 1.7% a year ago. Restructuring costs were $20 million versus $19 million last year. Net interest expense was $15 million down from $18 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 36.7% versus 35.6% last year. Before the year, our effective income tax rate came in at 36.8% versus 38% in fiscal 2010. Average diluted shares outstanding were 911 million versus 965 million a year ago due primarily to our share repurchase program. ", "Cash and cash equivalents were $1.6 billion as of August 31 versus $1.9 billion a year ago. Overall working capital increased by 9.3% versus a year ago, driven primarily by increased inventories and the impact of the WHI divestiture. Finally, as a percent of sales, working capital was up 2.6%. Total FIFO inventory increased by 10% in the quarter versus 6.5% in total sales. The FIFO inventories increased by 7.2% on a per store basis. The increase in per store inventory was primarily in the front-end and related to strategic decisions including inventory we assumed with the acquisition of drugstore.com and the increase in certain categories, which is pain, sleep, cough and cold, where we have been running low due to supply constraints last year. ", "For the year, we invested $1.2 billion in capital expenditures, including approximately $300 million in our new stores and $500 million in existing stores including remodels and store IT. In addition, we invested $100 million in our distribution centers and $300 million in corporate technology and other investments. For the year ended August 31, 2011, we generated $3.6 billion in cash from operations compared to $3.7 billion a year ago, continuing our strong cash flow generation driven by our strong earnings. Cash flow from operations was down slightly from a year ago, due primarily to the impact from working capital. Free cash flow was down as a result of higher capital spending versus 2010 as well as the impact of higher working capital.", "As one of our core capital allocation priorities, we continued to return surplus cash to shareholders, and in the fourth quarter, we returned $759 million including $159 million in dividends and $600 million through share repurchases. As of August 31, 2011, we repurchased $425 million against our new $2 billion authorization. And as you can see, in fiscal 2011, we returned a total of over $2.4 billion to our shareholders. ", "Now let me share our plan to move forward without being in Express Scripts' pharmacy networks. As Greg noted, we're working on a number of Express Scripts customers consistent with the contractual obligations to help them evaluate all of their options to ensure that their members and our patients have continued access to Walgreens in their pharmacy networks. While we cannot comment on any plans or contracts specifically, we're very pleased with the response that we are receiving, and we expect these plans will make announcements when they are ready. ", "While it's still too early to quantify how much of this business we will ultimately retain, I can share with you how we think about the various levers, including retention of total sales and cost savings opportunities and the potential resulting impact on our fiscal 2012 earnings. Because we're not going to speculate on the ultimate retention, we're going to illustrate 3 different retention scenarios among the many possible scenarios to illustrate how we frame the potential financial impacts. ", "Regarding cost savings, we believe that within a range of 25% to 75% retention, with the cost savings plans we have in place, we can offset the anticipated gross profit impact by approximately 50%, including both COGS and SG&A interventions. Applying this framework under scenario A, which depicts 25% retention, the total revenue retained would be approximately $1.3 billion. To frame our cost savings under 25% retention scenario, consider that our COGS pool is nearly $52 billion. So improvement in the supply chain of 1/3 of 1% can generate over $170 million in savings and our SG&A pool is over $16.5 billion. So additional measures here could yield up to $250 million equal to 1.5% of our total SG&A. ", "So again, using this framework under 25% retention scenario, we estimate the impact of financial earnings will be approximately negative $0.21 per diluted share. Using the same framework, we estimate that the impact of 50% retention could be approximately negative $0.14 per share and the impact of 75% retention will be approximately negative $0.07 per share. ", "As I said before, we're not going to speculate at this time on the amount of business we'll ultimately retain, and it may be less than 25% or may be greater than 75%. But I hope this slide helps you dimensionalize the EPS impact that we may be looking at under different scenarios. And of course, on a longer-term basis, we believe additional business will move to networks that have Walgreens in the network. Finally, recall that in light of the planned cost interventions we will implement as a result of our current situation with ESI, we have temporarily suspended our goals for our key financial metrics.", "The upcoming generic wave will benefit many including payers, PBMs, providers and patients. Generic wave will also help to control drug trend increases projected to be in the low-single digits compared to overall healthcare spending projected to grow in the high-single digit. In Walgreens' proposal to Express Scripts, we offered to hold annual average reimbursement cost increases to within an estimated 2% annually over the next 3 years, which compares to a 3.2% annual drug trend increase that Express Scripts reflects in their 2010 drug trend report. In closing, notwithstanding the fragile external environment, our strategies are translating into solid financial results. We continue to leverage our leadership position in the community pharmacy to play a more significant role on the healthcare system as our stores become the first choice in retail health and daily living. We have strategies in place to create new revenue streams. We continue to reinvest in our stores, expand our offerings and invest in new channels and keep an absolute focus and continuous improvements and innovations in our cost structure. And finally, we are committed to creating shareholder value through disciplined financial decisions and a sound capital allocation policy, and we thank you for your support as our shareholders.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Miller of William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "There was a lot discussed there. Wade, in your prepared remarks, you went through kind of quickly the company's objectives to offset the lower gross profits proceeding without Express Scripts. Could you go over that in a little more detail and elaborate basically where would you find the additional savings on the cost of goods and also on SG&A, I guess, given the company has been running leaner the last couple years with the prior objectives.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I guess the first thing I'd say is that we absolutely have plans in place to deliver against the framework that I gave you, both with respect to SG&A and COGS. And as you've seen from the data, we have subsequent pools, about $50 billion of COGS and over $16 billion of SG&A. With respect to any specific detail plans, the levers we'll pull are going to be dependent upon how much business we retain or don't. So I don't want to go into significant detail right now on what those are, but I guess I would just say that rest assured that the plans are in place.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Can I just ask one follow-up then? I know one of the things you're working on is doing more direct imports. Is that a significant part of it or, I mean, can you comment at all on what the bigger buckets would be? It's just not obvious what it would be.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I mean, there's no question that expanding our base for suppliers, including overseas, being more rigorous about our B [ph] processes are all part of that. Also just we're looking at how we run the fundamental supply chain and how we can use different types of partners to help us make more effective is another piece. But again, when you look at the grand scheme of overall costs, we're talking about a very small percent to get back to what we need to offset half of those retention rates.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I think the other side of the same question, which is kind of 2 parted. One is, is it closer to 25%, 75%, 0 or 100%? And also time frame. There's also a theory that even as you may be persuasive in the marketplace, the clock is sort of heading towards the end of the year and are you going to run up to -- are you potentially too close to the end of the year and disruptions, plan changes, how is that potentially impacting timing of potentially going direct with folks? So it's 2 parts. Any more granularity on helping us understand the scope of your conversations. Maybe you can -- for example, when you gave us the Express book of business, for you it's about 71% MCOs and employer groups. I would hope, I would expect, I guess, that, that would be where you would expect to see the most retention. Is it sort of a pro rata situation with the customers, like if you hit the 50% mark, would it be pro rata to the business or would it be more on one group of payers than the others? And again, the second part is one area.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Andy, Greg. As Wade said and as I said, we're not going to speculate on retention. We do feel that we are having positive response from all of our partners. First and foremost, our intent is to work with everyone, all the partners, our patients, their beneficiaries, to try to find solutions that allows them to continue to use Walgreens. And we are having positive response from many. I think regarding the time frame, I think as we get -- as plans and employers begin to get closer to that time, that cut off for the first of the year, I think you'll continue to see more interest and more activity. And certainly, from our point of view, it's really up to the plans and employers to make that public themselves. We certainly respect their desire to do just that, but we believe that the relationship that we have and we're seeing with patients and employees in the market and the value they place on continuing to use their community pharmacist that they've known and trusted for years is powerful, and we feel good that we're moving in the right direction.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Let me just build on this, too. This 25%, 50% and 75% hypothetical scenarios, this is for a 2012 look. So $0.07 to $0.21 was the impact dimensionalized on those 3 scenarios. But make no mistake about it. Whatever happens January 1 and that quarter, we see as being the toughest period because over time, we plan to win back more and more of those plans in the next selling season as they come up. So again, if you think about time frame, this is the initial time frame, but we see that will be the toughest period, and from that point, we're just going to move and build forward.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "And I just wanted to ask a follow-on, Greg, to your answer about partners announcing things up until the first or whenever they feel like it. But in the -- at the back end, don't they have to make a decision sooner than that so that system conversions and other things can occur?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Andy. I think that varies by client and type of client, size of client, and so forth. But certainly, many of them are going to need to be making decisions soon. And again, we're just working with all to try find solutions that help them through this process and feel good about the response we're getting. One thing I would like to say, Andy, this is really not just about Express Scripts. There's a shifting payer landscape. Going forward, payers in general are looking now more holistically to try to figure out how they lower overall health costs and coordinate care. And I think the shift to the individual marketplace away from employer group business over time plays in our favor. I think the shift that there are more payers emerging, health plans, physician groups, health systems all looking for the value that we could help them with. So I think there are going to be emerging payers that we're partnering with. So we absolutely feel good about our strategies and where we're headed, the shifting landscape that we're working with and where we're headed.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital Markets.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I guess 2 things. One, you had mentioned sort of the deal that you had offered Express. Can you give any color as to the details of what they've offered you, or can you give some indication of how far apart you all really are or were? And then just on the cost savings side of things, to the extent you are out of network, curious about given the high fixed cost nature of the business, is Express volume fairly concentrated in some of your stores, or is it sort of a little bit everywhere? I guess I'm sort of struggling to see how easy it is to get that cost savings if it's sort of spread out.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, Tom, Greg. I'll take the first half. Maybe Wade can follow-up with cost. We do think -- as I said, unfortunately the offer and the proposal we received was below the industry cost to fill a prescription and we don't think values what we truly can bring to payers and patients across the country. So we do believe that there are hundreds of other networks out there that we work well with, that are looking for a lot of the services and solutions that we're bringing to the marketplace. That's who we intend to focus on. But unfortunately, as I said, the proposal they had on the table was below the cost to provide a prescription in the industry.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, on cost, all I would say is this. As you know, while in some cases their prescriptions will be basically more concentrated to one store versus another, we're not making this just a store problem or just a pharmacy problem or just a pharmacist problem. We're looking at this holistically across the entire company, making sure that we do everything possible to deliver the right cost savings so that we move forward successfully to a new future. So it's really more about that. It's more about taking a principled stand and looking holistically across the company to make sure that we continue to move on over the long term towards our goals.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "All right. Generally speaking, are some of these cost saving initiatives that you could have in the works, are they things that you could do even if you don't lose the relationship with Express?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Sure. I mean, if there's things that are right to do, we will do it anyway. But we'll continue to look and be as diligent as we have to be.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "And Tom, I would add that certainly, that's the reason we're kind of looking at this based on retention. And as we learn more about retention, we'll pull the right levers that make sense for our company long term. And our value in community pharmacy has been the great locations, our convenient hours, the fact that we have more 24-hour pharmacies than the rest of the industry combined. So we'll look at all those intelligently based on retention.", "Operator", "And next we have Scott Mushkin of Jefferies.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So I know you don't want to tell us exactly who, but has anyone signed a separate deal with you guys yet?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Scott, as we said, we've got to keep the confidentiality of our partners and respect that. So as we said, we're working closely with many, and as they intend to or desire to release that, they will.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I'm not asking for that. I don't want to know the name or anything, but I'm just asking the specific question if anyone actually signed with you yet.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "As I said, we're not going to give information to that detail yet. As I said, we're encouraged by the response we're receiving.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Second question is you guys seem pretty dug in here, so I guess the question comes to mind, is there anything Express can do to change your mind? It seems like you're walking away and maybe they really can't do anything. Or am I misinterpreting your...", "Wade D. Miquelon", "The principle is very simple, right? I mean, one is we believe that we deserve fair value for what we do, but importantly, we don't see any reason to give any PBM a substantially better deal than all the others without having done something to warrant it. So it's pretty much as simple as that. If Express wants to give us fair compensation versus the market versus what we receive with others versus the value we provide, then we'll move forward. But if not, that's not really -- it's not really a productive place for us to be in our business. So...", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Oh, go ahead. Sorry.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No. So it's as simple as that.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And then how do we, as analysts, investors, kind of frame Medco now? I mean, can you maybe talk to that?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, we can't --  I mean, we're not going to comment on the proposed merger. All that we'll say is that it doesn't change things, is that if it were to happen, we would expect the fair compensation we get today with them. And if we weren't to get that, then we wouldn't be in that network either.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And when's your -- when's your contract up with Medco?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We don't talk about any specific contract, but the reality is that we've had a good relationship with them, and we believe we get fair compensation from all the others and that's why we're working with them. But if that were to change, then it wouldn't work for us either, and we'd have to make the same kind of decision.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I'd like to add on to Wade's point. Just to be clear, we wouldn't accept terms similar to what Express Scripts has offered us from any PBM regardless of what happens.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And switching gears just quickly, how many remodels, major remodels, are you expecting to do in FY '12?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, we haven't said specifically of major remodels. Obviously, we plan on -- the next few months here, finishing out CCR. We've got lots of different various pilots underway of different stages. We're seeing great results on those. But with respect to our plans to expand that, we haven't commented on that at this time.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just to follow-up a little bit on the Medco question. I mean, clearly, Medco is a debate that investors have to have here. If the merger does go through, aren't they about the same size as Express in terms of impact? And can you continue to deliver COGS and SG&A savings to kind of offset some of that?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, yes. Greg. As I said, we're not going to comment on the merger, but I'll go back to exactly what I said. It takes -- rates that were proposed by Express Scripts, we won't accept those from anyone. Certainly, we'll begin to look at what we can do to reduce costs and COGS just as we are with Express and make the adjustments needed. The main point is, as I said earlier, we are focused on where healthcare is going, what our partners that are out there working with us are looking for us to provide. We're going to drive these key strategies to play a greater role in community pharmacy and greater healthcare going forward. We will see, we believe, a shift to the individual marketplace. Our strong consumer brand and trust with patients in that market, we believe, provides value and wins. We do believe that we'll see government entities and state entities that are looking for additional solutions to provide to their beneficiaries, especially those in underserved communities, where 45% of our stores are located. So we think there's a lot of value to work with health systems and hospital systems like Ochsner and Northwestern and the others I mentioned across the country to help coordinate care. That is where we are headed. So regardless of what happens and what the landscape looks like, we know where we're headed. People are looking for us to provide that type of value, and that's where we're going.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And in your estimates of $0.07 to $0.21 of potential impact, are you assuming any front-end impact or is that just the prescription loss and the offsetting actions you're going to take there?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, the front-end is in those numbers, and the front-end loss is very, very small. So we've got lots of data on that. We've modeled that many, many times. So it's in those numbers, but it's basically around there.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And what percent of employers do you think could actually go direct with you under their current contracts?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, only they know their contracts, obviously, and so, they have to decide what their options are. But it's not just about within their current contracts. People every few years get a choice to consider whether or not they want to stay with that PBM or not. And so at the end of the day, if people can have Walgreens in their network versus not and have it at a competitive price and value proposition over time people choose that, too. So again, we're working with people to explore all their options, but every customer has different contractual obligations, and we honor those. But they have to let us know what it is they want to consider within their framework.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and Wade, just to get back to the generic wave on the industry themes. You indicated you thought the second half of the wave in 2012 could be better than the first half in terms of margin impact, is that fair to say?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No question. For our fiscal period. Remember our fiscal is starting effectively September 1, but our back half is much stronger for generics than our front half.", "Operator", "And John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities has the next question.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A couple of things. Wherever you are on an economic difference with Express, because obviously, you can put a number to that, whatever that is, is there room, short of wiping out the difference to 0 in your favor, is there room for compromise between those 2 numbers or not really? It's sort of all or nothing from your perspective?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, John, again, without going into the details, again, we're looking for fair reimbursement for the value we provide. And as I said, the proposal we offered was well below the industry average cost to fill, and we're not going to work in that type of environment. We've got too many payers and partners that want more from us, and that's where we're headed.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, we're very, very far apart. And the truth is we also have to make sure we're fair to all of our other partners. So coming to some spot that's not optimal and not fair to everyone else doesn't really work either.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So as a follow-up to that, have you seen -- I guess you have. Have you seen any change in their negotiating posture as this whole Medco thing is played out and it's before the FTC, because I would have thought maybe that would be an impetus to create a little bit of compromise on their part.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "We continue to work with our partners and that's where our focus is, in trying to find solutions for them. And again, to the earlier comment, we're not dug in. If there's a suitable arrangement, we're certainly open. But at this point in time, we're miles apart, like Wade said, and we're working and focusing on helping our partners find solutions.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Getting back on the core business then, if you look at SG&A growth and comparable stores, what do you think that is longer term? Because you've done a very good job bringing that number down probably below what I would think it could be longer term. But what do you think it is longer term, 2% to 3%, or do think it's less than that?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No, what I'd say is prior to this Express Scripts event, we had given basically 3.5% to 4.5% as our ongoing kind of systemic model. And within that, we plan on opening around 200-ish stores, which drives 1.5% to 2%. So you could then basically make an inference somewhere between 1%, 1.5% and 2% is more of a normalized comp store range.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And is that impacted by -- because you talked about wanting to raise service levels, training, et cetera. Can you do 1% to 2% within the context of raising service levels?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, a lot of it's really just about thinking differently and reengineering. We're putting a lot of systems in our stores. Our POS system is one example we've talked about many times that we're rolling out now. Makes it much easier for a cashier to work, much more effective, it gives us much better data integration. But these kind of investments in infrastructure and in our people will then help free up time to do other things to help our customers. And so we have lots of efforts like that underway. But I think that's the bigger idea.", "Operator", "Next we'll move to Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two questions. First of all, can you give us a sense -- and obviously, we don't need the specifics, but the $0.07 to $0.21 of dilution that you framed here, which is helpful, can you compare that to the dilution from accepting the terms that Express is offering?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think I said before that from the offer they proposed us, there was no scenario we could think of, none, that wasn't financially better for us to move on without them. So you can assume that -- your question's answer from that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. Secondly, back to the core business, the front-end margin, you commented, was down in the quarter, and you explained some of that was the comparison. That looked like inventories grew a little bit in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of the front-end merchant environment in this quarter and on a go-forward basis? And what gives you confidence and where you think front-end margins are going?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Eric. As we've said and others have, I think we're still seeing a consumer that's a little wary. Consumer confidence as we know is down. The good thing is we feel we're well-positioned with our convenience and all that we've done over the past year to really provide solutions to that new consumer. We feel good that we are managing pricing promotion well. I think [indiscernible] and Bryan Pugh and our merchants are doing a good job there, indicated by the fact that our gross profit dollars are up, traffic's up, basket's up. We are able to pass on, due to our convenience, some of the inflation we're seeing. But I think we feel pretty good with our position to continue to do well in a challenging economy.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, and I think Greg alluded to it, but I think the key point here is, really, the way we look at our business, both in the daily living as well as in the pharmacy area, is really total gross profit dollars, making sure we drive those and versus less looking at just the margin per se.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "So from within that, just to dig in it a little bit is from a pricing and promotional standpoint, considering a more wary consumer, as you framed it, is there a need to be more aggressive with pricing promotion? Is there any need to give up a little bit of margin to drive the dollars? I'm just trying to figure out how that is evolving.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Eric, as I've always said, the key to retail is swinging doors and managing the pricing promotion to get that done. We feel good that we're managing that. The opportunity that we do have is to continue to drive share in private brand with the launch of Nice! And where we're headed there, we think that's going to be an opportunity for us. So we're going to swing doors and continue to make sure that we're driving traffic and basket but at the same time, drive the profitable items that can help us offset that.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "And I think the big idea here, we're making lots of progress, we've got a long way to go, too, is really just being more relevant to consumers. What we've done across our assortment, what we've done across our d\u00e9cor packages, the new lines we keep in reducing, additional private label, all that is making us much, much more relevant every day. And I think this is the big idea of how we really keep driving bigger basket and more gross profit dollars over time versus just pricing promotion per se.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then just within this, the above trend inventory growth, can you give us any color of what contributed to that and if that has any future profitably ramification?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "You mean the increased trend in inventory?", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Yes.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I would say for the most part, it's somewhat of an anomaly. Again, we talked about last year having some low inventory in some of the key categories. But we continue to have many strategies in place to keep driving inventory down. I think there's still room to go. We haven't put a goal around it, but quarter-to-quarter, there could be an impact. Working capital and total, too, was impacted by the WHI transition a fairly large number, and so we'll be out of that now as we move ahead as well.", "Operator", "Next we'll move to Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple questions on the Express issue. Just in terms of clarifying timing for your guidance, the EPS impact that you gave, is that the 2012 run rate once you get to the level of participation you might anticipate to reach those levels? Or would that be inclusive of a gradual ramp to that level of penetration?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No, that's the fiscal impact. So that would be the fiscal year. So obviously, the impact will be heavier on January 1 than it was in December. But as we go over the next selling season and then we start to cycle, we believe we'll also bring more and more accounts on through different PBMs. And so that starts to offset it and really strengthen our position over time financially.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So you would anticipate that the annual run rate you'd be at by the end of the year if you had, say, 25% retention would be nicely better than the number that you put in your presentation?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, let's put it this way. Those numbers are 2/3 of an annualized impact. But as I said before, once we get to the next selling season and cycle into next December and January, we believe it'll pick up a lot of that business with other parties who value Walgreens and want us in their network.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I would imagine -- a follow-up to that. One consideration that was not in the mix when you first announced this at the time of your last conference call 3 months ago was Medco. And obviously, there's a transaction that we might see go through in the relatively near term. How is that thinking into your strategic consideration given that presumably the 2 companies, once they merged, would be doing business on the same terms?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, look, whether that happens or not is not for us to say. We have no official opinion on it. But what I will say is that our principle and our stand doesn't change at all. We need to be provided and compensated fairly by the people we work with, right? To the extent that, that were to happen and we would keep getting compensated fairly as we do today, I suppose we would work with those people. But if there was some shift or change in line with what Express Scripts has proposed, then we wouldn't. It's really as simple as that.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then finally, just to clarify on your answer to Eric's question, you basically said that the numbers you lay out of doing business without Express would be better for you financially than had you agreed to their terms. I guess the question, is that better in 2012 or better in the long run or both?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Better forever.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And would that be inclusive of 2012 on a standalone basis?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. And more so over time because of our ability to win business back with other parties over time as those contracts renew.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from John Ransom of Raymond James.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just a clarification. Does the retention include or exclude Medicare Part D-wise?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "It would include.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and the second question is the PBM consultant feedback says that a lot of clients are saying that even contract provisions would prohibit them from contracting with you separately. There hasn't been any external evidence that you're getting any traction going direct. What makes -- what can you say to change that perception because we're just not finding any confirmation that your efforts are gaining traction to go around Express?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "As I said earlier, we're working with several partners, and we are having several positive discussions. We feel pretty good with those that we're having. We're not going to release any information on that because of the confidentiality of our folks and the people we're working with. I will say at the same time, as Wade mentioned earlier, this is not just going to be a single-year event. In addition to those that we're working with that we believe we'll be able to work direct with and be able to continue to move forward with, there are folks who have the opportunity either this year or over the next couple years to change PBMs. And as we've said, January 1 would be potentially the toughest time for us, but as we -- but we do think that there are folks who want Walgreens in their network and we'll have many alternatives and choices and ways to do that.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, we know of many, many PBM shifts. But again, for any one of those, it's going to be up to them when they want to announce it. So at the end of the day, this isn't going to be a battle that's won in the newspapers or a battle that's won on conference calls. It's going to be about what customers want and their options and their choice. And over time, we're pretty confident that we'll get back in much of this business with people who value us and see the value proposition we provide.", "John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And is this contract lower than what you're getting paid on your average Medicaid fee per script?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, we don't talk about plan by plan by plan, but just again, the fact that we said that it's below the industry cost to fill, if everybody took this with every plan, there'd probably be no industry. So again, it's just not acceptable versus what others provide and the value provided. So it doesn't work for us.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. Again, if I can just wrap up, this is unfortunate example of a PBM that has forced a network provider to a point where it no longer makes sense for us to participate in that network. And with that, we know where we're headed. We've got plenty of opportunities to work with providers that want all the services we provide, and that's where we're headed.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, the company will report September sales on October 5, and we will report first quarter 2012 earnings on December 21. Until then, thank you for listening, and we look forward to talking with you soon.", "Operator", "And again, that does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Divisional Vice President of Investor Relations, Rick Hans. You may begin.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, President and CEO; and Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and CFO, will update you on the quarter. Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Kermit Crawford, President of Pharmacy, and Mark Wagner, President of Community Management.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our web website at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliation. ", "After the call, this presentation and a podcast will be archived on our website for 12 months.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking information that is based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Please see our latest Form 10-K filing for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. ", "Today, I'll begin with our quarterly results. Second, I'll discuss highlights for the quarter and update our progress on our Well at Walgreens strategy to become America's first choice for health and daily living. And then finally, I'll provide insight into the second half of the year, and I'll turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed analysis.", "Beginning with our results today. As you saw in our release this morning, we posted record second quarter sales of $18.7 billion, up 0.8% from $18.5 billion a year ago. Second quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.78, down 2.5% compared to $0.80 in the year-ago quarter. Despite our lower earnings, cash generation continued to be strong as cash flow from operations for the quarter exceeded $1 billion and free cash flow was $703 million.", "We returned $570 million to shareholders in the quarter, up 23% over the same quarter last year, including $374 million in stock repurchases. ", "Compared to the prior year, the effect of no longer being part of Express Scripts pharmacy network as of January 1, 2012 impacted our results by $0.07 in the quarter and the mild cough cold/flu season impacted net earnings per diluted share by $0.03. This year's results benefited from one extra day versus last year because of leap year.", "As we look further into the results, even with the impact from Express Scripts, the strength in our business fundamentals comes through in our financial highlights. First, our front-end comp was up 1.2% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year and excludes the effect of the leap day. We continued to see momentum in our Daily Living business as a balance promotional approach during the holiday seasons led to profitable sales growth. And as we expected, our convenience and our products and services led to higher comp store front-end sales in the quarter despite our reduced pharmacy volume.", "Secondly, we saw a 31% increase in our volume for our 90-day prescription program. This demonstrates that the true value of our 90-day retail offering is becoming clear: Customers are getting what they want, the convenience to pick up a 90-day supply of the chronic medications at their trusted community pharmacy. At the same time, we're reducing cost to payers and helping to improve medication adherence and compliance, which is good for both patients and payers. ", "And finally, as we discussed, cash flow and cash returned to shareholders continue to be strong.", "As you can see on this slide, our gross profit dollar growth was up $65 million or 1.2%, driven by our strong front end and solid underlying pharmacy performance and despite the exit from Express Scripts pharmacy network and a weak flu season. Importantly, the pharmacy gross profit impact was as we anticipated. ", "As we detailed in last quarter's call, we expect more significant gross profit dollar growth from new generics, including generic Lipitor in the back half of the year. ", "Turning to costs, SG&A dollar growth was $167 million or a 4% increase for the quarter. We also discussed on our last call that we were holding off on our cost reductions in pharmacy in order to retain as many patients as possible and to help ensure a smooth transition for those patients on Express Scripts plans who were forced to transition to new pharmacies. Because of that, our planned SG&A savings from labor reductions will be back-end loaded. SG&A dollar growth also reflects new store growth, continued investment in our strategies and the integration of drugstore.com. Taken it all together, the spread between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was a negative $102 million and recall we think about the spread over a longer period of time, not quarter-to-quarter.", "To generate these solid results, we continued to focus on our 5 key strategies to become America's first choice for health and daily living. I'll begin today with an update on our first strategy, to transform today's traditional drugstore to a health and daily living destination. To date, we have transformed nearly 200 drugstores across the chain to our Well Experience format. These include stores in Chicago and Indianapolis and Duane Reade stores in New York. Add to that our new Well Experience flagships in Chicago, Las Vegas and New York City, and it's clear we're stepping out of the traditional drugstore format to create something completely new and unique. We're combining cutting-edge design with an improved product assortment and developing the right mix of health care, beauty, fresh food and private brand solutions to more closely meet the needs of our communities. Our goal is to create an experience unmatched in the industry and one that is flexible enough to accommodate every community. From a store in an urban food desert to suburban stores to a flagship location on Wall Street and all types in between.", "The response we're gaining from customers, payers, government officials and employees is extremely encouraging. Our most impressive leading indicator is customer delight, the metric we use to measure customer reaction. We've seen a significant jump in the last 6 months in both pharmacy and front end that reflects our enhanced in-store experience and the commitment of our employees.", "And because we're still in the test-and-learn phase, we continue to refine and enhance this Well Experience format to meet the needs of our different markets and demographics. ", "Just as we are transforming the front end of our stores, we are equally focused on advancing the role community pharmacy plays in health care. As part of that commitment, we're excited to be part of the launch of RxAlly, a network of 20,000 pharmacies that aims to improve patient health and reduce overall health care costs through enhanced pharmacist care.", "The launch is the first step toward a performance-based network of pharmacies that is designed to differentiate itself through improvements in health outcomes and other services. Last month, we cemented our relationship with AARP as they selected Walgreens for a 3-year contract to deliver drugstore benefits to their members. ", "We remain the first choice that community pharmacies turn to as we acquired the prescription files and inventory for more than 100 pharmacies in the quarter, including more than 30 Kmart pharmacies. We announced the agreement to acquire BioScrip's 30 community specialty pharmacies and the assets of their centralized specialty and mail service pharmacy business. This acquisition will accelerate our strategy to become -- to bring specialty pharmacy products and services closer to patients at their community pharmacies. We expect to close the transaction in May.", "Our team members also continued to do great work this quarter, signing up more than 700,000 people through our Prescription Savings Club card during our January promotion, which is used by both underinsured patients and those who don't have access to Walgreens. With all this exciting work, we were pleased to be named once again to Fast Company's list of most innovative health care companies. This was the second time in 3 years we've received the honor and is a credit to everyone in the company.", "As we advance our efforts in health care, we're also working to deliver an outstanding customer experience by enhancing our employees' engagement. By strengthening our focus on employee training and leadership development, we're seeing dramatic improvement in service levels in both our pharmacy and Daily Living business. In fact, our customer service data has shown a 440 basis point improvement in overall store customer satisfaction from February 2011 to February 2012 which, we believe, is having a significant positive impact on our comp growth.", "As we continue to refine and enhance the experience we provide, we're also expanding the scope and reach of Walgreens. One way we're doing that is through our multichannel approach. This quarter, we continued to make progress in our integration of drugstore.com and our holiday execution across all of our online shops was extremely promising. As part of that integration, we opened a new e-commerce distribution facility in Edwardsville, Illinois. This 500,000 square foot facility starts shipping orders on February 27 and is expected to improve customer order delivery time by 50%. ", "In addition, in keeping with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, 30% of our Edwardsville team members have a cognitive and physical disability. We expanded Web Pickup beyond Chicago and San Jose with our launch in Indianapolis this quarter. ", "We also made additional improvements to our industry-leading mobile and social media technologies. In mobile, we added new functionality for customers to help them stay on top of their medications and transfer prescriptions in a few easy steps. ", "And finally, we just added the new application on Facebook called Answers, which is a first of its kind interactive portal that gives our 2 million friends access to valuable health information and resources including prescription drugs, disease symptoms, at-home remedies and over-the-counter recommendations.", "We're also consistently looking for new more -- and more efficient innovative ways to run our business. A great example is our next-generation point-of-sale system. The system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use and is powered by the latest technology in wireless capability. We'll complete the rollout by the end of calendar year 2012.", "As we continue to focus on the strategic work that is core to our progress, we're also managing important external factors, particularly the upcoming FTC decision in this year's PBM selling season. ", "On the potential Express Scripts/Medco merger, like all of you, we're waiting for the decision. However, we have a good relationship with Medco and an ongoing contract in place that we intend to honor. We've been talking in recent months with many of Medco's clients, a number of whom are Fortune 500 employers and managed care companies. Those conversations have been very productive and their clients appreciate the convenience and value we bring. ", "In addition, we're looking forward to this year's selling season. We already know from our survey that even the most price-sensitive payers want 5% savings or more and most want 10% to consider us a restricted network without Walgreens. We do not believe those savings are truly attainable. And we feel good about the value we're offering as more and more PBMs, health plans and others approach us to develop unique member services and benefits that can be offered to clients. We've never been this busy this early in a season and every indication is that this will be the most active selling season in recent memory. ", "In conclusion, our business performance in light of Express Scripts has been as we expected and we remain steadfast in our belief that this decision was in the long-term interest of our customers, employees and shareholders. And as our early results support, we expect the short-term impact to lessen over time. ", "I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work this quarter. Based on their efforts and these results, we are confident in our continued progress and focused on executing our strategy to become America's first choice for health and daily living. ", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased with our performance in the quarter reporting record quarterly sales, strong cash flow progress and managing the business through our transition out of Express Scripts pharmacy network, consistent with what we have outlined in prior calls. ", "This morning I'll take you through our quarterly results in more detail, update how we frame the second half of fiscal 2012 and provide some thoughts around the potential impact from the proposed merger between Express Scripts and Medco.", "Let me begin with a review of our comparable store sales trends. Both our front end and our pharmacy trends in the quarter were in line with our expectations, and please note that all comparable store numbers discussed in today's call exclude the benefit of this year's leap day. ", "In our second quarter, total sales were up 0.8% as comp prescription sales decreased 5%. Comp front-end sales increased 1.2% over a strong prior year period. Total comp sales decreased 2.6% and comp prescriptions filled decreased 6.1%. Finally, for the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we achieved 18.7% retail pharmacy share versus 20.1% share a year ago, reflecting the decision to exit the Express Scripts network, partially offset by a gain in share from the balance of the industry.", "Second quarter 2012 comp prescriptions filled decreased by 6.1%, which included a 750 basis point impact related to Express Scripts as well as a 130 basis point impact from a weaker cough/cold and flu season. On a 2-year stacked basis, comp scripts decreased 1.6% versus a 7.9% increase a year ago. ", "To better understand the prescription trends, we have isolated the impact of Express Scripts and cough/cold flu. Adding back the 750 basis point impact from Express Scripts give us an adjusted 1.4% prescription growth rate, which compares favorably to the industry including Walgreens, which grew at 0.9% over the same period. Also adding back the 130 basis point impact from a weaker cough/cold and flu season yields an underlying prescription comp trend or a comp of 2.7%.", "Moving to our front end. We're very pleased with our daily living comp of 1.2%, driven by core strategic categories including strong progress on beauty, beer and wine and convenience and fresh and illustrating a point that we have consistently made, which is that our retail pharmacy business is not a direct driver of the front of our stores. ", "Traffic in the quarter decreased by 0.1% while basket increased by 1.3%, reflecting a good balance between our promotional strategy and our pricing discipline. We enjoyed a strong Christmas and Valentine's Day, with Valentine's Day performance helped by customers seeking convenience given the midweek holiday. While the weak flu season had a negative 0.5% impact on our daily living comp, overall we were pleased with the results, especially in strategic health and wellness categories. ", "Finally our 2-year stack, represented by the blue line, continues to be in the mid-single digits. ", "Compared to our industry, our front-end sales continue to perform well. After adjusting our daily living comp to the next 3 largest retail pharmacy competitors, we outperformed 2 of the 3 in the quarter. And on a 2-year basis, we have outperformed all 3 by at least 200 basis points. ", "Like everyone, we continue to see a cautious consumer and a competitive retail environment, but we believe this out performance is a reflection of our differentiated strategies, our focus on the customer experience and excellent execution in the stores.", "Turning to margin. Our gross margin as a percent of sales was 28.9% in the current quarter compared to 28.8% last year. The overall margins increased due to stronger front-end margins. Pharmacy margins declined slightly, impacted by reimbursement, Specialty Pharmacy mix and a higher LIFO provision, partially offset by the introduction of new generics. ", "Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, this quarter's 10 basis point improvement was against the second quarter a year ago with flat margin. I'd also like to remind you that we believe the better way to look at our business model over time in both Daily living and in pharmacy and health and wellness services is to focus on our gross profit dollar growth. ", "This quarter and for the remainder of calendar year, please keep in mind that the comparability of gross profit dollar growth will be impacted by the loss of prescriptions related to the exiting of Express Scripts network.", "Two-year stacked SG&A trends improved versus a year ago with 12% growth in the second quarter of 2012, down from 13.1% last year. Our SG&A growth in the quarter was impacted by new stores, investments in strategic initiatives and capabilities and noncomparable drugstore.com costs. After adjusting for costs related to the drugstore.com operations and integration, our 2-year stacked SG&A growth improved to 7.4% in the second quarter versus 11.1% a year ago. ", "If you get to our core SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our reported 4% SG&A growth included 80 basis points of integration and operational costs related to the drugstore.com acquisition. The remaining base SG&A dollar growth was a combination of new store openings, inflation and investments in strategic initiatives and capabilities.", "This slide shows our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 6 quarters. Recall the primary driver of our higher gross profit dollar growth in the first 3 quarters of 2011 was the acquisition of Duane Reade. When we cycled the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2011, you can see the slower gross profit dollar growth. In the second quarter, in addition to strong front-end performance, we benefited from the recent launch of generic Lipitor. ", "As you look at the upcoming third and fourth quarters, you should consider the following points: First, we will be impacted by the loss of Express Scripts prescription volume for the balance of the year as well as by the continuing reimbursement pressure and particularly the uncertainty with respect to AMP. Second, gross profit comparisons get easier in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. And last, we expect to benefit from a higher level of new generic introductions in the second half, including expected launches of generic versions of the brands Lexapro, SEROQUEL and PLAVIX.", "Following the similar construct, you could see that SG&A dollar growth was 4% in second quarter of fiscal 2012 versus 8% a year ago. Recall that last year included 430 basis points from the impact of the Duane Reade acquisition. Overall in the second quarter, we were able to offset over 50% of the gross profit dollar impact from our exit from the Express Scripts network through our cost initiatives, which have been heavily focused on SG&A and COGS. ", "As we have stated previously, our highest priority in January and February was to serve our patients and minimize disruption at the store level, and we have just recently adjusted store labor to reflect the changes in prescription volumes. Our confidence remains that with all of our interventions, we can offset half or more of the gross profit dollar loss due to Express Scripts at current retention levels, which are about 15% as of the end of the quarter. Taking into account our planned cost savings and gross initiatives associated with Express Scripts situation, we currently expect the impact for the fiscal year to be about $0.21 per diluted share. ", "And finally, as we stated in our press release, the second quarter impact of Express Scripts was $0.07, which included 2 full months of the impact, as well as some transitions in December.", "Now taking us through our income statement. This quarter included LIFO provision of $72 million versus $56 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 2.5%, up from 2.25% a year ago. We had a $0.01 per diluted share benefit from this year's leap day. Net interest expense was $17 million, down from $18 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% versus 37.8% last year. And average diluted shares outstanding were 875 million versus 928 million a year ago, due primarily to our share repurchase program, which I'll touch on in a bit.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 billion at February 29 versus $2.2 billion a year ago, with reduction largely driven by our commitment to return cash to shareholders and invest in strategic opportunities. Overall working capital increased by 8.4% versus a year ago, primarily driven by lower accounts payable, which was a function of the timing of our payments, largely as a result of significant inventory progress, which will work its way through the balance sheet over time. ", "Accounts receivable increased by 0.5%. And improvement in inventory management, primarily in our supply chain, led to a 3.4% decrease in total inventories. ", "Looking more deeply at inventory, total FIFO inventory decreased by 0.4% in the quarter versus the 0.8% increase in total sales. And FIFO inventories decreased by 2.3% on a per-store basis, again reflecting strong inventory management and a reversing of 3 quarters of increasing in per-store inventory. ", "For the quarter, we invested $304 million in capital projects, bringing our year-to-date capital expenditures to $723 million. And for the year, we now expect capital expenditures of $1.4 billion, reflecting our commitment to continue to invest meaningfully in game-changing technology such as a new POS system and e-commerce distribution center that Greg described, as well as to continue to invest in our existing store base.", "In the quarter ended February 29, 2012, we generated $1 billion in cash from operations, up 13.7% from $808 million a year ago and continuing our strong cash flow trend. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations and that was despite a significant negative associated with the payable timing I just mentioned. ", "Free cash flow in the quarter was $703 million, up 1.9% and year-to-date totals of $1.1 billion.", "As one of our core capital allocation priorities, we continue to return surplus cash to shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned $570 million, including $196 million in dividends and $374 million through share repurchases. For the first 6 months of fiscal 2012, we returned $1.4 billion, including $398 million in dividends and $975 million through share repurchases. Currently, we have approximately $600 million remaining against our current $2 billion share repurchase authorization.", "Let me now turn to a few thoughts regarding our perspective on Express Scripts and Medco merger should the transaction be consummated. Before addressing this potential scenario, I'll start by saying that we respect and have a good relationship with Medco. And today, we feel we have an ongoing contract with Medco that we feel is fair for both parties, good for Medco clients and good for our patients, and we intend to honor our contract under existing terms, which we believe is to the benefit of all parties. ", "As a result, we plan to continue serving all of our patients currently covered under our contract with Medco unless the new company takes an extraordinary action, effectively terminating the existing contract or materially changing the terms or financial arrangement, which we have no indication they would do. And while we believe it serves all parties to honor this existing agreement, our principle of being compensated fairly for the value we provide does not change; merger or no merger. ", "Now it might be helpful if I size our book of businesses with Medco. As shown on this slide, in calendar 2011, we filled approximately 125 million scripts for Medco members. In calendar 2012, as a result of Medco's net change in client, we are on a pace that would result in our filling about 108 million scripts. Taking into account known client migration to other PBMs, including United Healthcare, we estimate that our book of businesses with Medco will be approximately 74 million prescriptions as of January 1, 2013.", "Now this roughly breaks down as follows: 30% managed care organizations; 29% large employers including 18 of the Fortune 50; 17% state and local governments; 15% small employers; and 9% Medicare Part D plan. ", "Medco's client composition is different from the Express book which is highly concentrated, specifically with 2 contracts that account for approximately 50% of the business. Please note that our actual 2013 business with Medco could have further adjustments up or down following the 2012 selling season. ", "Having described our business activity with Medco, let me also share that we've had many conversations with existing Medco clients, assuring them that, first and foremost, we have been happy to serve them and would like to continue to do so. Additionally, we are communicating that if the merger ultimately consummates, we intend to continue to honor the terms of the current agreement we have with Medco and therefore, in theory, there should be no impact to them unless the new company would take an extraordinary action, which again we have no indication at this time that they will do. And in this context, if the merger does occur and the new company were to terminate the agreement or materially change the terms or financial arrangements relating to our network participation, we would work with them to find alternative ways to serve them in accordance with their interests and their contractual rights.", "With respect to this point, we believe that a substantial portion of Medco clients, measured by prescription volume, have contractual options meaning the contracts either have change-of-control provisions; provisions requiring certain named pharmacies versus just the number of access points; the right to direct the contract if necessary; and/or are expiring in the relatively near term. This appears very different than Express Scripts where Express Scripts, by their own public statement, so that only a small handful of customers have the contractual right to include Walgreens in the network and to our knowledge, we've contracted directly with or created other arrangements to continue to serve nearly all of them. ", "Finally, we are hearing clearly from large employers, managed care and early selling season feedback that a network without Walgreens is not gaining traction because there is no compelling value proposition to support it. There are little to no meaningful savings that accrue to the clients and in some cases, it may actually be more costly for patients and payers not to have Walgreens or Duane Reade in their network. ", "Furthermore, the convenience and quality of our stores and the professionalism of our employees is of real importance. Employers and patients get it. This is not about 50,000 dots on a map. It is about real people who have real health and wellness concerns and real relationships with the pharmacies and the pharmacy employees that they choose.", "I'd like to build on that more by speaking to The Value of Walgreens. Similarly, we think about value just in terms of cost. And while cost is important, the other side of what delivers value is the benefit. But let's start with cost. We believe that in addition to offering competitive unit rates, Walgreens also drives costs down in many other ways, including but not limited to, our industry-leading generic dispensing and conversion rates and our discounted 90-Day at Retail offering. ", "To highlight the lack of potential savings, let me again review the math. Even if Walgreens charged $1 more than an average pharmacy on what is an industry average of about $60 per prescription, excluding our 20% market share, to restrict a network would only save a payer $0.20 per prescription or roughly 0.3% if all of the savings were passed on to the client. Moreover, this math does not factor in the significant savings to payers from our industry-leading generic dispensing and conversion rate and our 90-Day at Retail program. Our recent survey findings, which are consistent with other industry surveys, confirm that even the most price-sensitive customers are looking for significant savings, again typically at least 5%, to narrow a network substantially. And in my mind, narrow doesn't necessarily mean without the nation's #1 retail pharmacy.", "We've got an additional value for the benefits of the direct relationship with a pharmacist and the quality and convenience of our stores, which include best-in-industry locations, the highest number of 24-hour stores, the face-to-face relationships with our people and the broad range of additional clinical services and advice that we offer. ", "The big idea here is that managed care companies and employers alike understand that the future of health care is not about looking just at cost per transaction or even at total pharmacy cost in isolation, it's about prevention and improving patient health and doing it in a way that saves on total health care costs. The fact is community pharmacists remain one of the few health care professionals in America who will counsel a patient free of charge without an appointment. ", "We are transforming our customer experience and pharmacy to provide convenient, affordable and quality access to health care. That's what this country needs. That's what our customers are asking for. That's where we are headed.", "In closing, we anticipated that this would be a challenging quarter. In spite of everything, we were pleased. The quarter included record sales, positive front-end comps, good cost management, strong cash flow and significant cash returned to our shareholders. As I have frequently said with respect to our decision to exit the Express Scripts network, January 1 would be our toughest day and then we only move forward from there. Our strategies are sound, and our value proposition is compelling. And we remain confident in our future ability to build our business and create shareholder value.", "We thank all of you for your support. And now, I'll turn it back over to Rick.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask you about the $0.07 on -- from Express Scripts. Did that include any of the costs to service clients, either to help them stay with Walgreens or smooth their transition to a new pharmacy or is that just sort of a pure gross margin number?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No, that's a net all-in, including those specific costs. But effectively, as we said, we offset 50% of gross margin this quarter, primarily through SG&A and COGS, but it's an all-in number.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "You achieved it this quarter or you're expecting to achieve it going forward? I thought this quarter you actually -- the costs were up because -- that's my next question. What is the swing in SG&A that you anticipate by managing down pharmacy hours and other hours and other costs versus sequentially, if you will?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We're looking at it this way; we had about 2 months and 1/3 of a month when we think about the volume impact as part of this number, right, and then 2 months that we had an impact from the gross profit point of view. But we had 50% of that offset through COGS and SG&A. In the future, we're going to have 3 months, but we're going to have a step-up in some of our cost efforts and measures accordingly. So it will be really a balanced impact of Express Scripts through these 3 quarters, $0.07 in each quarter basically.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Andy, just to reiterate, I think the key point is the fact that we still feel the $0.21 impact based on that lower scenario is what we'll see for the year.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "Got you, okay. It clarifies that. I wanted to ask about Medco in the event of the Express Scripts/Medco merger being consummated. I mean in your contract with them, does it allow an out with the change of control? If not, what is the term -- I think we'd all benefit if you could tell us how long your contract is for and -- so that's the contract part. And then secondly, you talked about the book of business going down to 74 million scripts in next year, next calendar year, and do you have -- could you size what percent? I mean it sounds like it's a large number, much higher than Express. But what percent of those contracts or prescriptions do you believe are under contracts or will be under contracts that are flexible enough that would keep Walgreens in the network if the merger is consummated and Express changes how they do business with Walgreens with Medco?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, Andy, maybe Wade and I both tag team on this just to make sure we get all of that. I think certainly on the first part, as far as what's in their specific clauses and contracts, we certainly don't have visibility into those. We do believe from what we've heard in the industry that some do have change in control clauses and everything that Wade went through himself. So that's just based on intelligence, what we're hearing from the field. As far as the terms of the contract, as we said, we got an ongoing contract with Medco that we intend to honor and we don't see any indication that, that would change. As far as the percentage of the business, I'm going to let Wade kind of key in on that one.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I mean it's impossible to predict and I would say clearly, these customers have -- it's a very different situation. They have much more rights at large than the Express customers and they also have had the benefit of time watching this unfold as they look forward when their contracts end and potentially renew. So again, without speculating a number, I would just say that for all the reasons I outlined, the situation is very different and they have a lot more flexibility in rights in aggregate than the Express customers. Again, back to the contract we have with Medco, it's been in place for many years. It continues to move forward, I suppose, until the parties decide at some point that it doesn't.", "Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division", "So essentially, an evergreen contract that either side can walk away from at their whim?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We're never going to talk to any specific contracts with any specific customer or supplier. But I would just say that like I said before, it's been in place for a long time and we both obviously have felt it's fair, good for patients, payers and everyone, and we continue to honor that.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities.", "Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I just want to focus on the Medco slide. When I look at the scripts from calendar 2011 to 2012, you have a decline of 17 million scripts. And when I look at the book of business that Medco is losing for 2012, it seems a little high to me, just taking your national percentage of market share. So can you maybe go into a little more detail about what -- which contracts are really driving that decline?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "You mean the decline from 2011 to 2012?", "Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I understand that 2012, 2013 [indiscernible] your market share, but I'm a little confused about the 2011 to 2012, the drop of 17 million scripts?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well there's been, obviously, many public accounts, scalpers and others out there. I don't want to go into the list of the different clients. But quite frankly, 2012 is pretty easy because now that we're already in March, we can see our actual monthly run rate and reconcile back to those accounts. So 2011 was an actual, 2012 is kind of a current actual rolling forward and then 2013 is just doing the other puts and calls we know like United.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Ann, I guess the main point is we've got a lot of confidence in that number because we've done the internal analysis and based on the book of business and the plans that have been publicly announced, that's the number.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We see every day in our book.", "Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Perfect. And then the $0.21 impact for fiscal 2012, I just want to confirm that's current retention rate in the mid-teens that you've experienced in January and February?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Correct.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. As Wade said, Ann, we hit about 15% at the end of the second quarter and I think it's important to say that we expect that to build. And as plans begin to take action, state of Nebraska as a public reported is changing July 1, so we expect that to build.", "Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "All right. And will you give you any details on the gross profit differential between an Express Scripts and Medco scripts, so we can just...", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, I guess we could basically say that there is no Express contract, so there's really no differential to give. But no, we never talk about any one customer to another. And our objective here is to be fair with all customers and try to treat them all fairly, in the same genre anyway.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "You talked about the restricted networks not gaining traction, and I was wondering how do you know that's not about to happen through the rest of the selling season or later in the year and what visibility do you actually have on that?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, I think -- Mark, good question. We feel pretty confident as far as the intelligence we're getting from the field. I mean we've got people out talking to the benefit consultants. We've got people out talking to clients as well as the other partners that we work with out there. And we just don't see it. What we're more encouraged by, frankly, is the fact that, as I said in the last call, that the other payers that we're working with, whether its PBMs or health plans, are more and more interested in working closely with us and differentiating themselves in the marketplace this selling season because they have Walgreens in versus Walgreens out. The survey that we did that we published last quarter also, I think, is a strong indicator that says that employers would need a 5% to 10% greater savings to even consider a restricted network. So all intelligence that we see, folks that we're working with, we do not any trend.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think especially, again, it's where restricted gets used loosely. Someone might have a restricted network that doesn't include a pharmacy, that doesn't have a share in that market anyway, right? When it comes to excluding the nation's leading pharmacy, for a little or no savings, there's really no evidence that, that has ever taken up noise at this season as well.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. My next question is given there's more than a $0.50 spread in the consensus estimates, high to low for fiscal '12, and given there appears to be decent predictability to the business, based on the constraints of what the lawyers will let you talk about, can you give some general commentary on the second half outlook? The Street's looking for nearly flat EPS, down a little bit. I mean is that a reasonable framework? And same scenario for fiscal '13 is like a $0.60 spread in the analysts' projections?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Look, I mean obviously since we don't give guidance, I can't point to any specific number. I would just come back to overall framework. Prior to the Express Scripts -- prior to exiting their network, we had financial goals and targets. The financial goals that we stated we want to hit over time, we've talked about what the impact of Express Scripts will be to us on a fiscal year basis. They've been laid out by quarter basis, so you kind have to model backwards from there.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. Last question from me is you talked about the EPS benefit growing from generics. Wade, roughly what kind of an EPS lift did that give to the company in the fiscal second quarter? Was that in the range of a $0.05? Could you help us out on sizing the benefit? And then how much greater should we think of that lift in the coming quarters?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We aren't going to outline exactly what it was in Q2, but I'll actually defer to Rick's Heisenberg uncertainty principle of generics, which is the more you try to measure and estimate what they're going to be in the future, the more the number keeps changing all the time because there's lots of variables for suppliers -- like in suppliers, et cetera. So clearly we get a lift in the back half, we said that, but I think it'll be premature to try to put a number around it until we get there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Just one clarification and one sort of follow-up on that last set of questions. I guess just on the clarification, the $0.07 Express hit, what rate is that based off of? Is that your old contract or the terms that you proposed or how would you put that in context?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "That would have been our exiting rate.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe following up on what you were talking about a second ago in terms of your long-term goals. I guess if you add the Express impact and the flu and you take away $0.01 from leap day, maybe your EPS grew 7% or 8% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. How does that sort of compare to what your expectations are over the long term x some of the noise that we've gotten in terms of Express and whatnot?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, I mean, you could certainly do the math that way. We don't adjust that way. We just keep it broad as it is. But what I guess I would say is over the long term, we're still operating over that systemic framework. We believe that we can have industry-leading growth. We can have that robust EPS growth. We can have steadily improving cash flow and ROIC and a good strong balance sheet. So this is -- I would call this a blip in the road on the path to keep focusing on that.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Right. But in terms of robust EPS growth, I don't know, is high single digit the goal? Is it sort of low double digits? Or I guess how do you think about the business x a lot of the noise in the long run?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Tom, this is Greg. Our goals haven't changed. We set out -- there's a plan to win 3 years ago. We want to go back to double-digit EPS, strong return on invested capital and top 2 shareholder return. And that's what we think our strategies will allow us to do. There's 2 ways to look at frankly: The lost business from Express Scripts and frankly we anticipate that we'll continue to be -- to work with Medco and their clients. But there's the opportunity to continue to grow share with those plans are out there that are wanting to work with us and we're very encouraged, as I said earlier, with those that are coming to us and trying to win business this selling season against those that don't have us. Secondly is the austerity and the cost-cutting measures that Wade talked about. We feel confident we're going to be able to do both of those. And we're very confident on our strategies and the ability to return back to those goals.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay, last one. Wade, you mentioned AMP. How are you thinking about that? And what's the latest that you've got there?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I mean, I'll let Kermit answer this. Obviously, there's not a lot to update, but Kermit why don't you...", "Kermit R. Crawford", "Well as you know Tom, right now we're in the comment period on the FUL. There's been some questions around the FUL that basically have been fixed draft out there. So as a industry, I mean we are still continuing to work with CMS to get an AMP that reflects the actual retail community pharmacy purchasing price, and that is our continued goal. So as we continue to work with CMS, it's all about getting AMP right and doing what's right for the community and community pharmacy.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Is there an expectation for a time frame and we'll have maybe some resolution or is it pretty uncertain still?", "Kermit R. Crawford", "No, I think it's still uncertain as to the time of AMP implementation.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions, a couple of follow-ups. First of all, you alluded in your press release to strategic projects impacting SG&A. Any clarity as to what that relates to and what you're working on?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, yes, Matt, we continue to invest, obviously, in a multichannel business. We think that's a big opportunity for us, and some of the things I mentioned on the call would be indicative of that. We continue to invest in our stores. As we said 3 years ago, the reason we decided -- one of the reasons we decided to slow our new store opening growth was to be able to reinvest in our existing store base. We think we've got a heck of a footprint. There's a lot of things that we've done with CCR this past year as a good foundation for us to build upon. So we're continuing to invest in those new stores, those pilots and we'll continue to measure to make sure that's a good use of our capital. I think we're also continuing to invest in our front-end offering, private brand. We're really feeling good about where we're going there. So it's basically our 5 key strategies that we're pretty consistently with -- consistent with is where we're investing.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And sort of related to that, I know there's been some discussion of ultimately launching a loyalty program. Is the cost embedded in current SG&A in any way and any update as to the timing of that kind of effort, please.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, as far as -- I'll take the loyalty launch itself. We feel good with where we're headed. We're still planning for a mid- to late September launch of our loyalty program. As far as the SG&A impact, I'll let Wade kind of address that.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, we've certainly had some costs now we're doing to get obviously like a launch in the timing Greg said without having some upfront investment to get it right. And we haven't that disclosed amount, but that's part of those strategic investments to really set us up for the future.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then finally at some point, the focus will likely shift back to the core business and to retail. You spoke about the Well format stores; you have over 200 of them now. I know some are Walgreens, some are Duane Reade. But can you talk about the economics of conversion, the kind of investment they need to generate, how those stores are comping and what their margins look like versus the rest of the chain?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think all I would say is this is that what we're seeing in those stores from lifts and from profitability and returns is very promising and we're still measuring and analyzing. We look at unit economics. So every store is slightly different, every model slightly different. It's all contextual to what we're trying to achieve. And so obviously, we wouldn't be going down this path if we didn't think that it was financially accretive and good for the customer as well. And again, early results across-the-board are promising, but we continue to refine and look at it to really fine tune our unit economics moving forward.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Scott Mushkin from Jefferies & Company.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So let's assume the Medco and Express merger goes through and I'm just trying to understand what you would think as a material change. I mean if Express slowly tries to move people -- the Medco accounts over to their network, how do we view that and how would you view that and how would you respond?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, Scott, Greg. Certainly, a good question. I'm not going to speculate on what they may or may not do. I think as we said in the call, we've got a good relationship with Medco. We think we have got a great relationship with their clients. We got an ongoing contract that we think makes sense for all to honor, and we intend to do that. As far as what they may do or might do, I think that probably is not worth speculating on. I will say that, as Wade said, like all business, once we see and have an indication of what has actually happened and the terms and conditions and so forth, then we make the adjustments necessary. So bottom line, we look for fair reimbursement for the value we provide and that's what we would expect.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I'm not sure of the exact question. When you say move over their network, I guess what you're saying is the network without being able to access Walgreens because we have no arrangement now with Express Scripts.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Correct. I mean what I'm saying is if they offer the Medco customers the ability to switch over, how do you guys deal with that and how would you respond?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Our customers could always choose that. I mean today, Express Scripts for 10 years, has been trying to sell EN30 and 40 without Walgreens. It's less than 1% of the business, but they have the right to do that. Customers clearly don't like thinking they got bacon and eggs and show up and have cold oatmeal. So the real issue, I think, is whether or not customers want Walgreens and value Walgreens and we believe from what we're hearing, they do.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Scott, as I've said several times, I'm going to remind you, we are in the business of filling scripts and that's what we do. So certainly, that's why we would want to honor that contract and continue to work with those clients. But it has to make good business sense for us and we just decide and determine at the time based on what we see as to how we'd go forward.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So just to summarize, if they had a lot of success, you might have to deal with it, but you don't think necessarily they'll have a lot of success. Is that a good summary?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Customers want to get what they pay for, right? And what we're hearing loud and clear from the customers is they want a broad network and they know there's no material savings. And so in those cases, they're obviously going to have a lot of more rights in Express. What they are by customer remain to be seen. But at the end of the day, customers want to pay for what they want to get.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Scott, here's what we are seeing and do believe that although we are not an Express Scripts network unfortunately, at the same time we are building deeper relationships with all the payers that are out there wanting to work more closely with us. So we can focus on the lack of access to Express Scripts, but the positive is to gain share and the deeper relationships we're building as a result with every other payer that's out there, and that's where we're focused. And we feel good with what we're seeing in the early selling season. And as I said in my early opening remarks, this is one heck of a busy selling season already.", "Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So I want switch gears to SG&A, just to understand when the store level cuts, I think you said they're kicking in maybe March 1. And I think you've outlined lower store hours, reduced staffing and salary cuts. And so I guess what I wanted to know is when will they be fully implemented? And then kind of a corollary here is the SG&A dollar growth rate this quarter, if I adjust some adjustments Wade put up there, but also thinking about the store growth, it looks like the core business x the store growth was kind of flat. And I wondered if that is something you can replicate, so the 2-part SG&A question then I'll yield.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I'll hit it first and I'll kick it over to Kermit and Mark. I think our SG&A growth, you're right, when you exclude the things like drugstores, Walgreens stores, we did have very good progress there and I think a lot of what we're doing across-the-board, not just in stores, but at corporate is continue to find ways to become more efficient and effective all the time, Express or not Express. But I'd say is that before I turn it over here, too, is the efforts we're doing at stores we're trying to match up to do it smart to where the biggest volume impacts have been. This is not peanut butter, and we still intend on having the best service in the business. We still intend on improving our customer satisfaction as we go. But this is really about making sure that we do it smart, again in concert with the volume losses we've seen.", "Kermit R. Crawford", "And Scott, I'd just add we balance our store labor payroll all the time depending on volume. So as our volume fluctuates, so does the way that we balance our store labor.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, maybe, Scott, I'll weigh in. I want to come in and frankly take this opportunity. We probably have employees that are listening in, Mark and Kermit the job they've done, I think our employees have done an incredible job reacting intelligently to the reductions that we are beginning to put in place. And as I've said, the good thing about this is that there is good -- its market-by-market, store-by-store in specific markets and we've got the ability to laser in and dial down store-by-store. But our store employees and store managers out there have just done a terrific job in managing through this. And frankly, they support the long-term decision that we've made and where we're headed.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Couple of things. If you -- if we look at $0.21 earnings impact with 15% retention, so that looks like maybe an incremental $100 million or so of cost-reduction somewhere, cost of goods, SG&A. Generally speaking, where is that coming from?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, those are 2 of the buckets obviously, but the other piece of it is even though almost all of it is costs, we're also seeing -- well, it might not be ESI retention, we might be building scripts or getting top line volume from other customers. So for example, we've seen -- give you a couple of examples here. We've seen other pharmacies that were so overloaded with Express customers, they couldn't handle the volume, they had out of stock, they didn't have supply. So customers that we could have served in the past were going to other pharmacies have now come to Walgreens. And we're kind of seeing that by the day right here as we also link with conversion programs. We also see Medicare Part D. Every day I think it's something like 11,000 people are turning -- go Medicare Part D. And some of those were with Walgreens before then they found out or woke up and they couldn't go to Walgreens and now they turn to the age where they can get Medicare Part D and they're looking for plans that have Walgreens. So there's lots of different buckets like that. But the vast majority is incremental cost efforts, but we are seeing outside of the retention bucket, we're seeing other volume upticks in lots of different areas. It happened slowly, but surely.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "And John, as we said, we held off on store labor, store reduction to make sure we did a good service. But we have been focused corporately and we're certainly looking at projects and making sure that we're focused on those that really move the needle. I think frankly, the positive is we are laser focused on those 5 key strategies and driving what -- and really focused on the projects that would move the needle. So we've been looking at corporate over the last couple of months, so there's been real progress there.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. Secondly, are you doing anything differently with other PBM partners this selling season in terms of how you're working with them, what you're offering them aside from them just selling Walgreen being in the network, anything else that's different than past years to accentuate that? And I guess if you are, it sounds like you're getting good early feedback that that's working?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, John. I think several things. First of all, a lot of them are coming to us, as I said earlier. They're looking at this being one of the few selling seasons where there is true differentiation in the marketplace with a PBM offering. And that being, frankly, that they have the largest retailer in the country in their network or out of their network. That's #1. That's a pretty -- frankly, what we're hearing is that's a pretty easy sell and they're looking forward to that. Then we begin to talk about the fact that we drive high generic utilization. They're looking to work with us on how we can drive that even higher and bring them greater value. Many of them are now really beginning to see the benefit of 90-Day at Retail being added to an existing mail plan. As we've said several times, when a payer or client adds a 90-Day at Retail benefit through existing mail plan, there is anywhere from 7% to 9%, maybe more percent in savings available. So I think they're really beginning to work with us in ways and look for some of the ways that we can help them reduce costs and drive real value.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then finally, if you take a long-term view, do you think -- I mean, clearly reimbursement rates are going to go down secularly. But if you think about a Medco, Express -- so I'm assuming that goes through, which it looks like it is, if you look at that concentration on the PBM side, does that drive quicker reimbursement rate pressure on the retailer over the next year or 2? And do you think that, that leads mostly to consolidation, mostly I guess the smaller guys falling out more quickly. Is that where we're headed?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, I mean, I guess you could -- I don't know if it's going through or not, right, so I hope it will. But I would say that from our point of view, our principle is our principle. We expect to be compensated fairly. Fairly, not just versus our own thinking but versus the market and versus others. And that doesn't change, Medco or no Medco. I think you could make the argument that it could put tremendous pricing pressure on the little guys as they need to pay for the premium of the merger, et cetera. And quite frankly, I think you can see it from our battle. There's large -- we are #1 retailer that a small player is going to have a very difficult time probably holding the line in that scenario.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, but even for the big guys, you would say the pressure gets ratcheted up a little bit or no?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I'm pretty convinced of our value proposition. We're seeing it now in the sales season, we're seeing people just not having Walgreens as a non-starter. There are no material savings and I think people don't want to go through their own network just to spread an intermediary. I think the reality is, though, is that small players are going to have a very difficult time in that environment.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "John, I think we've been in this industry, there's been an ongoing reimbursement pressure for years in this industry and still will be. And I think therefore, as we're focused obviously on costs and making sure that we continue to take costs out, we're also looking -- that's the reason we're driving our strategies: to be able to work with payers and create value in ways other than just a focus on reducing pharmacy costs specifically.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David McGee from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "In the event that Express, Medco does happen, would you care to hazard a guess as to what the retention rate might be given your greater conversations with those clients?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, I think -- I don't think we'll get into that David. I will say if you go back to Wade's chart, we tried to show what we see the book of business being with us January 1, 2013. Hey, frankly, I tell you I believe it would be difficult for Express Scripts and others to continue to sell without Walgreens in their network. We've had, as I said, we've had several conversations with many of the key clients and those clients indicate to us that they really valued having Walgreens in their network.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "And they've got the ability and the means to do that and that's their intention. So I think we remain pretty confident that it's a very different scenario.", "David G. Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "My second question is looking at the impact of Express being $0.21 this fiscal year, is it fair to assume that, that maybe gets cut in half in 2013, so maybe $0.07 in the first quarter and maybe $0.03 in the second quarter?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think either way just to model it is you've got 8 months this year and then 4 months next year, so you lap it, right? So you could build your own models and figure out the sequence and timing on how you lap it. It's not that hard to do.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, the company will report March sales on April 4, and we'll report third quarter 2012 earnings on June 26. Until then, thank you for listening and we look forward to talking with you soon.", "Operator", "That does conclude today's conference.

Welcome to our Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Due to the media commitments as a result of our earlier announcement regarding our investment in Alliance Boots, Greg will not be joining us on the call today. Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will update you on the quarter. Following his prepared remarks, we will be available to take your questions.

Now I'll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, I'll take you through our quarterly results and update key considerations for the final quarter of -- for the quarter of fiscal 2012. Beginning with our results today, we posted third quarter sales of $17.8 billion, down 3.4% from $18.4 billion a year ago. Third quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.62, down 4.9% compared to $0.65 in the year ago quarter. Despite lower earnings, cash generation continued to be strong as cash flow from operations in the quarter was an all-time record of $1.9 billion and free cash flow was $1.5 billion.", "Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, operating cash flow was also a record at $3.7 billion. We returned $371 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $176 million in stock repurchases. Compared to the prior year, the strategic decision to no longer be part of Express Scripts Pharmacy Network as of January 1, 2012 impacted our quarterly results by a net $0.06 per diluted share including cost controls, at a total of $0.15 per diluted share year-to-date.", "This year's quarter was also negatively impacted by $0.01 per diluted share due to the costs related to our previously announced definitive agreement to enter into a strategic transaction and partnership with Alliance Boots, the leading international pharmacy-led health and beauty group, which we announced earlier today. For the year, we continue to expect the full year net impact from exiting the Express Scripts Pharmacy Network to be around $0.21 per diluted share.", "In summary, we were pleased with our financial results, and the quarter including good cost management, record cash flows, solid earnings per share and significant cash returned to our shareholders. As you can see, our gross profit dollar growth was down $140 million or 2.7%, which was in line with our expectations, while SG&A dollar growth decreased by $62 million or 1.6%, reflecting outstanding SG&A control during the quarter.", "As discussed on our last call, as evidenced in our results this quarter, the benefits to our SG&A efforts weight more heavily to the second half of our fiscal year. Taking it all together, the spread between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was negative $78 million.", "Let me now give you more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. As you already know, comparable prescription sales decreased 9.9%; comp front-end sales decreased 0.9% over a strong prior year period; and total comp sales decreased 6.6%, with comp prescriptions filled decreasing 9.1%. Our third quarter 2012 prescription comp of negative 9.1% and on a 2-year stacked basis, comparable scripts decreased 4.5% versus a 7.2% increase a year ago. To better understand our prescription trends, we have isolated the impacts of Express Scripts day fall and cough/cold/flu, adding back the 10.7% negative impact we experienced from exiting the Express Scripts network, to reconcile to an adjusted 1.6% prescription growth rate, which compares favorably to the industry, including Walgreens, which decreased at 0.3% over the same period per IMS.", "Adding back the 40 basis point impact from a weaker cough/cold and flu season, along with a 10 basis point impact for the day fall, adjustment calculates an underlying prescription comp of 2.1%.", "Moving to our front-end, traffic in the quarter decreased by 2.6%, and basket size increased by 1.7%, and the front-end comp decreased by 0.9%. The primary drivers behind these decreases were the impact of Express Scripts and the changes to our pricing promotion strategy, which we continue to believe are directionally right. While we achieved a solid margin benefit from this change, we will continue to balance and find the right trade-offs between sales and profitable growth.", "Turning to margin, our gross margin as a percent of sales was 28.2% in the current quarter compared to 28.1% last year. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of new generics but partially offset by reimbursement, specialty pharmacy mix and a higher LIFO provision. The front-end was positively impacted by convenience and fresh foods, household items and nonprescription drug categories, offset by e-commerce mix.", "Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, it's important to note that this quarter's 10 basis point improvement was against the 50 basis point improvement a year ago, with both front-end and pharmacy cycling strong margins. Finally, this quarter and for the remainder of the calendar year, please keep in mind that the comparability of gross profit dollar growth will be impacted by the loss of prescriptions relating to exiting the Express Scripts network.", "SG&A in the quarter was down $62 million in absolute dollars as cost control this quarter was outstanding. 2-year stacked SG&A trends dramatically improved versus a year ago, with 5.6% growth in the third quarter of 2012, down from 15.8% last year. Recall that last year's 2-year stack included expenses related to the Duane Reade acquisition in 2010, whereas the current year's comparison includes expenses from our drugstore.com acquisition in 2011.", "The current quarter's decrease was primarily a result of lower comparable store expenses, which were partially offset by investments in strategic initiatives and capabilities. With respect to managing our store labor expenses, I want to personally extend a thank you to all of our team members for pulling together during this time of cost reduction.", "After adjusting for costs related to the drugstore.com operations and integration, our 2-year stacked SG&A growth improved 4.2% in the third quarter versus 12.4% a year ago. To get to our core SG&A dollar growth, you could see that our reported SG&A, a decrease of 1.6%, included 60 basis points of integration and operational costs related to the drugstore.com acquisition, resulting in an adjusted SG&A of negative 2.2%. Recall that the drugstore.com transaction closed in June 2011, and that this will be the last quarter where it's a noncomparable event.", "To help frame the fourth quarter, it may be helpful to look at last year's trends. This slide shows our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 7 quarters. You can see that our gross profit dollar growth comparisons become easier in the fourth quarter as we fully cycle out of the non-comparable impact of the Duane Reade acquisition, despite year-on-year negative impact from the our recent BioScrip specialty acquisition. Following the same construct, you can see that SG&A dollar growth decreased 1.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, versus an increase of 7.2% a year ago, as the benefits of cost reduction efforts began to materialize.", "Please note that in the fourth quarter, we face a more challenging SG&A dollar growth comparison of 4.8%, having cycled out of the impact from the drugstore.com acquisition. As you estimate the upcoming fourth quarter, you should consider the following points: We expect the net impact of -$0.006 related to -- -$0.06 related to our decision to exit the Express Scripts network. Gross profit comparisons get easier during the last quarter of the year. We expect to benefit from a higher level of new generic introductions in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, including the third quarter launches of generic versions of Lexapro, SEROQUEL and PLAVIX; we will have some cost associated with the Alliance Boots transaction, the magnitude of which in part will be determined by the actual closing date of the first step.", "Taking you through our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $60 million versus $50 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 2.5%, up from 2.25% a year ago. Net interest expense was $17 million, down from $18 million a year ago, and our effective tax rate was 37.2% versus 35.4% last year, and average diluted shares outstanding were 855 million versus 922 million a year ago, due primarily to our share repurchase program.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion versus $2.7 billion a year ago, with the reduction largely driven by our commitment to return cash to shareholders and invest in strategic opportunities. Overall working capital decreased by 3.9% versus a year ago, primarily due to lower inventory levels, and accounts receivable decreased by 11.7%. And improvements in inventory management both in underlying performance and in quick response to Express Scripts situation led to a 7.3% decrease in total inventories.", "Looking more deeply at inventory, total FIFO inventory decreased by 3.4% in the quarter versus a 3.4% decrease in total sales, and FIFO inventories decreased by 5.6% on a per-store basis, again reflecting strong inventory management.", "During the third quarter, we generated an all-time record of $1.9 billion in cash from operations, up 50.2% from $1.2 billion a year ago and continuing our strong cash flow trends. Year-to-date, we have generated a record $3.7 billion in cash from operations, again helped largely by inventory management. The free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5 billion, up 46.8% and a year-to-date total of $2.6 billion.", "As one of our core capital allocation priorities, we continue to return surplus cash to shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned $371 million, including $195 million in dividends and $176 million through the share repurchase program. For the first 9 months of fiscal 2012, we returned $1.7 billion, including approximately $600 million in dividends and $1.2 billion through share repurchases.", "Given our Alliance Boots transaction announced this morning, we do not anticipate additional share repurchases in the near term.", "This morning, we also announced that the quarterly dividend rate will increase by 22.2% to $0.275 per share, consistent with our previously stated goal of returning cash to shareholders through dividends, with a target dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We are proud to have paid a dividend for 319 straight quarters, more than 79 years, and are now increasing our dividend for the 37th consecutive year.", "Over the past 5 years, Walgreens' annual dividend rate has increased from $0.38 per share to $1.10 per share, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of nearly 24%. Our focus in driving returns to shareholders was reiterated this quarter, through our continuation of a share repurchase program and the increase we provided to our quarterly dividend.", "In closing, we were pleased with our quarter. We had solid margins, exceptional expense management, record cash flow and returned significant cash to shareholders. We continue to move our business forward against all of our key strategies, including our continued investment in our Well Experience pilot stores, expanding the role of community pharmacy services through expanded offerings and enhanced partnerships; driving significant improvements in our cost structure; and most importantly, announcing a truly watershed moment for our company as Walgreens and Alliance Boots together create what will be unquestionably the global leader in the pharmacy-led health and well-being space.", "This transaction offers compelling strategic and financial benefits that will provide significant value to all stakeholders that is being structured in a way which will maximize and ensure success.", "So we thank all of you for your support. And now I'll turn the call over to Rick.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dane Leone from Macquarie.", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "Maybe we can just start with the domestic strategy going forward in light of the transaction with Alliance Boots that you announced. Maybe Wade, you could touch on how much balance sheet flexibility you think you have going forward, the opportunities that you see here domestically. And in light of kind of the focus on BioScrip's and drugstore.com integration; that seems to be going well. Yes, along those lines, any color you can provide is appreciated.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I would say that regardless of this transaction, we're going to continue to drive our strategies, and we've got the flexibility and resources and capital to do that. I think as we said earlier on the call, we actually believe though that this partnership, this marriage, is going to help us not only drive those, but accelerate those. It will allow us to really continue on this journey to become the most relevant retailer in our space, to really own the space of health in daily living and so that doesn't change at all. We continue to believe we've got the nation's largest, most trusted pharmacy. We're on the best corners and we're going to fully drive that experience and increasingly find ways to monetize it and to build deeper relations for customers.", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then maybe more specifically on the domestic strategy. I think that you've done a great job of adjusting the cost structure for the lower volumes in the business as a result of the contract loss with Express Scripts. But I'm just curious going forward, the front store traffic trends have looked like they've deteriorated over the last several months. And we've also seen a kind of a revamp of the Prescription Savings Club, I guess, in the hopes of driving more volume to the door. So how do you think about balancing cost structure, the promos that you're willing to provide for the volumes versus just managing the business to where it is? And also, where do we actually see the front store traffic impact bottom out here because, correct me if I'm mistaken, but was that originally contemplated or is that included in the $0.21 EPS hit from the contract loss with Express Scripts?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, fully contemplated and fully included. I think the step down you've seeing, which is not, by any means, a deterioration, the step down you've seen in part driven because I think we're being much smarter in terms of how we manage our marketing and roto. So we're doing more items that are relevant, with less items that aren't at very hot, discounted prices, so that has changed traffic a bit, but I can tell you the profitability is better as a result. And when we look at our customer satisfaction metrics, when we look at our ability for stores to better deliver the items on promotion that people actually want without out of stocks, et cetera, by all metrics, we're improving the customer experience. So we're driving profitable volume, and I think that's the right move. And we're also moving to a much more blended marketing mix so that we're not going to be completely dependent upon our roto in the future. We're going to touch consumers in multiple ways that are relevant to them and that are financially best for us.", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then one final question for me, just in terms of the long-dated guidance that was given on the call with Alliance Boots, it did imply a decent organic growth rate between the 2 companies, somewhere on the order of 5% CAGR over the next several years. Can you just kind of tease out for us what that means for an expectation for the Walgreens business here in -- domestically versus the contribution from Alliance Boots?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. First, I mean, when we put those goals out, I'm not sure what CAGR you're talking about. Are you talking about top line CAGR?", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "Top line, yes.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, well I think what you have to do is to understand the model is make sure that you get into the generic versus branded mix. So the sales, as you know, both domestically and overseas are a misnomer for value creation. So for example, as you know, our generics are much more profitable in the U.S.; that will create some sales compression, but we fully anticipate to drive robust volumes. Overseas in places like Europe where generics are underpenetrated, they obviously are at a lower cost too, but they're more profitable from a pennies per unit basis in wholesaling, et cetera. And so I think that it's very difficult for you probably to imply, or just to back into what the unit volume growth is we're anticipating.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from UBS.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a quick question for me on the -- for 2013, there still seems to be a lot of feedback I'm getting from investors on question marks around the Medco side of the business. I guess my only question around that is would you plan an additional set of cost cutting initiatives if there were some Medco-related volume that may fall off in 2013? Or are you able to see it more recently, assuming that, that contract stays intact and then therefore, have no other plans for cost cutting, et cetera?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Oh you know, I can only tell you what we know and what we\u2019ve said. I mean, basically, we've said that we've had a contract in place for many, many years. We\u2019re willing to honor it; we want to keep serving those customers. I think Express Scripts has said the same thing. So as of now, we continue to serve those customers, right? And I think we know overwhelmingly from those customers that they really want to have us in the network and intend to fully do that. And so, I think there is very little risk in that regard but I mean, if there was something fully unanticipated that would happen, I would say that as a company, we would be fully prepared to do what was ever necessary and in the best interest of our company and our shareholders.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. So then, I think some of the investor view is that the announcement today with the -- with Alliance Boots may be tied into some sort of Medco view but it sounds like what you're saying, that the answer to that last question is there's really no tie-in whatsoever to anything that you're looking at going forward in relation to Medco in particular. Is that safe to say?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, of course. It would very na\u00efve to assume that this is in some response to our dispute. I mean, the reality is, is we've been working together for almost 1.5 years and working on this for over a year. A company our size is not going to do a transformational transaction of this magnitude unless you're thinking about the strategic fit, the overall financials in the very long haul. I mean, I just think I find it almost silly that people would think that this is reactive. And I can tell you when you look at these 2 companies and our economic interests becoming entwined, all parties are really saying how big could the end gain be, and is this the best and biggest alternative to the long haul? And we believe there's nothing even remotely close to this for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was wondering if you are in a position at all to talk about Boots because I didn't ask to get a chance to ask a question on the last call.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Sure.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Do you have any sense of what Boots' wholesale market share is in Europe? Not [indiscernible] Alliance, really.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "That's a number that's never been stated, but I think as we\u2019ve said, they're the clear leader in Europe and by unit volume, the biggest in the world. And I think, as George said earlier on the call, #1 or #2 in all of their key markets. So I\u2019d just leave it at that. Obviously, there's probably ways for you to back into it and get close, but that's really that's all available at this time.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I was wondering whether -- when you were discussing the price that you were going to purchase Alliance Boots, did you take into account and were they willing to take into account the fact that Europe is struggling right now? That is to say, do you think that you got a relative bargain because of the timing of the acquisition?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, a couple things. Number one is, yes, Europe has some issues, but so does a lot of the world. But I would say as you look at their business, their business is performing very well, has been and still is. So this is not a fire sale; this is a quality asset that's doing very well, even in a tough environment. And actually, in fairness to them, this challenging environment provides a lot of opportunities. In the wholesale market, for example, there's a lot of small players who can get credit in easy times, but if they're not good operators, it's not so easy now, and that provides wonderful growth opportunities. Separately, generics in Europe range from 25% in the south to 50% in the north, versus 75% in the U.S. And as the governments come under pressure, they're increasingly pushing more generics for big savings for the government, which is good for them and good for people, but it's also good for their business because they make more penny profit per generic than they do on branded. But what I would say is that we've fully modeled the value of this company from both an intrinsic value, from a comparative multiple value and also with respect to the gives and gets of both parties. And I think you'll be hard pressed to find a deal of this size where both parties believe they have the kind of value creation for their respective owners as this.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And that segues into another question about what was said on the call. Stefano used the word generics many times, and I couldn't quite tell if he was talking about generic pharmaceuticals as we think of generics, or was he talking about private brands, or was he talking about both? And do you have any sense of kind of the magnitude of those 2 different businesses, generic pharmaceuticals and private brand?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I don't know the specifics on it, but I think he was probably -- if you use the word generics, he was most likely referring to generic drugs because they refer to their private brand own brand, right? So the magnitude is obviously -- I gave perspective that today we joined the generics by over $1 billion combined, which by volume is huge volume because of the relative cost versus branded and that number is growing rapidly and will continue to grow rapidly. Again, I think if you look around the world, there's only one retailer in the world who's ever really been able to play the own brand beauty game well, and has a portfolio that has innovation and new products and that's Boots. I mean, just the fact that they have a relationship with P&G, distributed in 5 countries, ought to tell you everything you ought to know about their capabilities, right? And so there's huge opportunity, and there will be.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, one of the reasons I thought he was talking about own brand as opposed to generic pharmaceuticals because he mentioned about procuring product globally. And do you know whether they are able to source generic pharmaceuticals in places that you historically have not been able to procure them? And what's the regulatory issues there?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, of course. I mean, it's different country by country, but we procure a fair amount offshore in various countries. They procure a lot. So generics are very different from brandeds, where you have -- maybe have a country price and then you have issues of cross-country and quota pricing, generics are much more, like other items where multiple suppliers can do it, and regulations in most countries allow you as long as you meet certain specs or regulations or FDA, whatever to take from anywhere to anywhere. So you can think of that as more of a, I don't want to use the word, but more of how you would think about a typical commodity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you please provide some more color around gross margins this quarter in light of the growth in generics? And I think specialty pharmacy mix is cited as a dragon, and if you could elaborate on the change in mix year-over-year?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I mean, I think we had good growth profit margins as we listed. I think that the only thing on specialty and I think, and actually E-Commerce is not that those margins are eroding; it's that those gross profit margin percentages are lower than others, and those businesses are actually growing very fast. So those are just only mix issues. I'd say, if you look through our business, we feel very good about the kind of gross margin, the gross profit dollars that we're seeing on the pharmacy side. We feel very good about the profitability we're building in the front end and even though we might have sacrificed some traffic, as we get our items, which are more relevant, more meaningful to our equity to consumers, that give fair value for us, that's a trade-off that we\u2019ll continue to balance, but we don't feel is directionally wrong.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. And it just seems on the specialty pharmacy side, that's a key focus for you. I don't know if you had a percentage in terms where you are currently and maybe where you think you can go with that.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I don't know that we've given too much detail on margins but as you know, these drugs can be $1,500 or $2,000, so a big difference in gross margin might be better dollar profit, but again, much lower on a percent basis. But overall, we feel very good about this business. We continue to invest in it, and I think the things that we're doing to create a real multichannel opportunity for people bundled with meaningful offers at a very good value over time are going to keep changing the landscape here as well.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then during the quarter, it also looks like you had extremely tight inventory management. Was there anything new during the quarter in terms of supply chain or anything else that you implemented during the third quarter?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We had a lot of various supply chain initiatives. I think we\u2019re just very focused on it. And what we're making sure is as we reduce inventory that our out of stocks don't go up and that our customer satisfaction goes up. And I think that for the past couple years, we've been able to manage these because it's not about just having inventory, it's about having the right inventory at the right time that people want. And again, we're putting lots of efforts on our supply chain on being more efficient, more effective, but it's all done on what I\u2019ll call a consumer or a demand-driven perspective to make sure that the experience is better as a result. And then we'll continue on that journey for a long time.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then one quick question on the Boots side. What opportunity is there to bring the Boots opticians and some of the other services into Walgreens and Duane Reade here in the U.S.?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think that is one of the opportunities. I can tell you I\u2019ve got a list of many, many opportunities that could be hugely valuable and accretive as well. I mean, we're going to work together and qualify these and pilot the right ones and expand. But that is one opportunity, but there's many, many, many others as well.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, and then last question. I know the loyalty card side of the equation seems like it's going to be changing, and obviously, Boots has an incredible one. How should we think about the rollout there in light of the acquisition?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We're full speed ahead. We've said that we're going to launch a loyalty sometime around September. We believe it's going to be one of the biggest programs, ultimately, in the world of its kind. I think even though we're a bit late in the game, I always make the analogy to some developing markets with landlines and mobile. Late in the game, you can sometimes learn from others and jump to a better end point. I think you're going to see that it links very well with our equity of well and how we're trying to drive that for people's benefits versus just discounting. And one of the things I like about the Boots loyalty program is not only is it large and as you heard has 2/3 of the women in the U.K. signed up, it's a financially smart program, but it's also very emotive. It's just not discounts and points; it's really emotive and gets into gifting and many other things that really create a deep and real connection with consumers and that's where we can really learn as we draw the lines back to where we're going to own this territory of wealth.", "Operator", "And now our final question comes from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Curious on you've talked earlier in the year about your involvement in the selling season and this has been a very active selling season for you. I'm interested in an update on how you see things progressing and then how we're performing relative to the 25% to 75% retention that you outlined at the beginning of the year.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I'll just say this. One is that I think you know where our retention started, and I can tell you, we look at every single day, ever single script versus comp, whatever, and we're building momentum every single day, right? Every day, we're getting back incremental scripts versus what would be a normalized comp and that's going to continue to grow, but we have some periods where maybe it steps up and others where it just slightly drifts up, but we feel very good about that. I would say that everything you said before about the selling season that we believe is still what we believe. The key thing is, is that we're working with lots of our customers, right? Lots of our customers across-the-board, in fact, almost all of them and they're telling us that they really value us in their network; their customers value us in the network. And in many cases, we're working very deep partnerships. But as things ever was I think that we feel our value proposition is very sound. We deliver a very cost effective and very high quality solution with region penetration, other services and hours that really no one else can deliver. And people want that, and people value that. And so we stay the course.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, the company will report June sales on July 5. Until then, thank you for listening, and we look forward to talking to you soon.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to your host, Rick Hans. Please go ahead.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, President and CEO; and Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President, CFO and President International, will update you on the quarter. Also joining us on the call and available for questions are Kermit Crawford, President of Pharmacy; and Mark Wagner, President of Store Operations.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our website at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information. You can find a link to our webcast on our Investor Relations website. After the call, this presentation and the podcast will be archived on our website for 12 months.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements that are based on current market, competitive and regulatory expectations that involve risk and uncertainty.", "Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.", "Please see our latest Form 10-K filing and subsequent Exchange acts filings for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with a review of our results for the quarter. Second, I'll discuss key indicators that show strengthening in our underlying business. And finally, I'll provide an update on our direction and progress on our 3 key strategic growth drivers: delivering a Well Experience, transforming community pharmacy and creating an unprecedented global platform through our Alliance Boots partnership. After that, I'll turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed review of our performance this quarter and key considerations for the rest of fiscal 2013.", "Turning to our overall financial results. In many respects, this quarter was a turning point for us. To look at our business on an apples-to-apples basis, we have a number of nonoperational items to discuss with you this quarter, the most significant of which is the reporting of results from our investment in Alliance Boots on a 1-quarter reporting lag rather than a 1-month lag period.", "While Wade will take you through these accounting impacts in detail later in the call, we want to underscore that we're seeing a strengthening of our core business: first, the increasing pace of return of Express Scripts customers as reflected in the substantial upswing in our comp scripts; second, the improvement in our gross profit margins in the first quarter versus a year ago, primarily due to the impact of generics; third, the significant progress we're making on a number of key initiatives, including our Balance Rewards loyalty program, our flu shot program and other vaccinations and the increased penetration of private brands. Finally, we are pleased with the business performance of our strategic partner, Alliance Boots and are also on track to meet our first year synergy targets with them.", "As we initiated last quarter, we'll present our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. As you saw in our release this morning, we reported first quarter sales of $17.3 billion, down 4.6% from $18.2 billion a year ago. GAAP operating income or EBIT for the quarter was $705 million, down 21.7% compared to $900 million at the same time last year. Adjusted operating income or EBIT for the quarter was $924 million, down 8.1% from just over $1 billion in first quarter 2012. GAAP net earnings for the quarter were $413 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $554 million or $0.63 per diluted share last year. Adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $553 million or $0.58 per diluted share compared to adjusted net earnings of $619 million or $0.71 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.", "One final note. As you saw this morning, we are adopting a 1-quarter reporting lag for investment in Alliance Boots, which resulted in dilution of $0.07 to adjusted EPS in the first quarter compared with an estimated accretion of $0.03 to adjusted EPS had we used the previously announced 1-month lag. This is intended to align the audit requirements for the investment and more efficiently address regulatory and audit considerations. This does not affect the underlying equity income and synergies we anticipate in the first 12 months since August 2, 2012, when we completed our initial 45% investment in Alliance Boots, but it does impact the quarterly and fiscal year timing in which we report the equity income and a portion of the synergies.", "In the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, our gross profit dollar growth was down 0.1% or $5 million from a year ago. SG&A dollar growth increased $194 million or 4.6% compared to a year ago. Gross profit dollar growth after adjusting for the LIFO provision increased $5 million year-over-year. This was a $187 million improvement from the previous quarter. SG&A dollar growth was up $104 million or 2.5% after adjusting for costs related to the USA Drug acquisition and Hurricane Sandy.", "To give you a sense of the impact of the hurricane on our operations, at the peak of the storm, 750 of our drugstores in nearly 15 states experienced service interruptions. As a result of the incredible efforts of our employees, who worked nonstop despite hardships of their own, within a week, the vast majority of those stores were open and serving our customers. I want to thank all of our employees in the affected states for their tremendous dedication to our customers, Walgreens and to each other.", "Now because we are self-insured, we recorded $30 million of expense this quarter for charges related to Hurricane Sandy, which primarily included inventory write-downs and the closure of 2 stores. Additionally, we made meaningful investments in staffing and marketing to support our Balance Rewards launch, Express Scripts win-back and Medicare Part D annual enrollment support. As a result, we narrowed the gap in the quarter between our adjusted gross profit dollar growth and adjusted SG&A dollar growth by $22 million over the previous quarter.", "With these results, we showed improvement in several key areas of our business during the quarter. First, we saw an increase in comparable scripts of 320 basis points relative to the previous quarter and have continued to see meaningful progress so far in December. Second, gross profit margins improved by 130 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter. Third, front-end margins remained firm year-over-year even as we invested in our Balance Rewards loyalty program. Fourth, we saw a year-over-year increase in our gross profit dollar growth in our pharmacy business for the first time since leaving the Express Scripts network on January 1. Finally, as I mentioned, we saw the gap between gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth narrow in the quarter. We believe all these indicators show the strength of underlying business as we begin the new calendar year.", "In the past 3.5 years, and as you know, we've undertaken one of the most significant strategic and operational transformations in our company's history. Today, we have in place 3 major strategic growth drivers that we believe position our company for long-term growth and value creation. First, we are delivering the complete Well Experience by transforming the customer experience across all of our touch points, channels and formats. Our second growth driver is transforming the role a community pharmacy plays in health care by offering unparalleled access to innovative, high-quality, affordable health and wellness services within our communities. And third, we're creating an unprecedented global platform, becoming the first global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise through our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots.", "Through the quarter, we continued to take meaningful steps to advance each of these strategic growth drivers, and let me give you some of those highlights. As we roll out Well Experience, we're stepping out of the traditional drugstore format, giving the customer a whole new experience from leading-edge design, enhanced assortment and multichannel options, all intended to maximize customer delight. We're pleased with the performance in these stores and the response we're getting from customers.", "In fact, in our Chicago and Indianapolis stores, customer delight, the metric we use to determine satisfaction, is running above our expectations and goals in the most recent monthly survey. We now have more than 400 Well Experience stores in communities around the country, as we've brought the new format into Arizona and Florida. In addition, we opened our newest flagship stores this quarter in the Bucktown neighborhood of Chicago and on Sunset and Vine in Hollywood, California, our 8,000th store.", "We also build on the momentum of our loyalty program launch. Through 3 months, we're extremely pleased with our progress. We now have a new kind of currency in place that will help drive our front-end business. To date, more than 45 million people have signed up for Balance Rewards, and nearly 60% of Daily Living sales were on the card. Millions of members have collected enough points to treat themselves for free rewards, and more than 2.5 million people have already redeemed points. Finally, nearly 80% of members surveyed have told us, they're delighted with the simplicity of the program, how easy it is to sign up and use in stores, online and with their mobile phones.", "We also continue to expand our product offerings across all of our stores with expanded grocery items and fresh food selections. We've enhanced our beauty departments with an array of niche and prestige brands not found in traditional drugstores and continued to roll out upscale-look boutiques in specific markets across the country. We're also seeing significant momentum in our private brands. We've invested heavily in our own brands, including Walgreens, Delish, Nice! and many more, and year-over-year private brand penetration in our front-end sales improved 200 basis points to 22%. In my 32 years, I've never seen our store managers as excited as they are now about our private brand offering.", "Turning to our second growth driver: transforming the role that community pharmacy plays in health care. We continue to focus on bringing convenient, affordable health care solutions to our communities across the country. As you know, a solid proof point that America values the additional services offered by a community pharmacy has been our leading -- industry-leading flu shot program. Through the end of the quarter, we provided more than 5 million flu shots, exceeding last year's level, with strong demand to date in December. We are right in the midst of this year's cough and cold, flu season, and the Centers for Disease Control is projecting the worst flu season in 10 years. We're moving beyond flu shots into adult, child and travel vaccinations and are very pleased with our performance, as we posted a year-over-year improvement in the first quarter of more than 100%.", "While we participate in almost all Medicare Part D plans, we were better positioned for this year's open enrollment period, which ended last week, because Walgreens has been chosen as a preferred provider for 3 of the top 5 Medicare Part D health plans: United Health, Humana and Coventry. These preferred arrangements help seniors who are our existing Medicare patients with lower copays and give patients who transfer their prescriptions to Walgreens the same opportunities to lower their medication cost.", "As we grow our core business, we also look for opportunities to participate in industry consolidation and file buys to transform the role we play in health care. In the quarter, we announced the purchase of a significant ownership stake in the parent company of Cystic Fibrosis Services, a specialty pharmacy that provides medications and treatment support for the cystic fibrosis community. We also continue to co-locate our Take Care nurse practitioners together with our pharmacy teams in many of our stores to expand our services even further to acute and primary care, health care screenings and beyond.", "As I've shown, our comparable prescriptions are up 320 basis points this quarter compared to the previous quarter. This upswing continued a trend that began in mid-September when we, once again, began participating in Express Scripts' retail pharmacy network. We believe this chart validates that customers value our convenience, service and the pharmacists they've known and trusted as we've been gaining momentum on our script comp month after month.", "And as expected, customers are returning to Walgreens from every competitor. We are winning customers back from different competitors at about the same ratio that they left last year. That says, to us, that having a choice of pharmacy does matter, and when customers have a choice, many of them are selecting Walgreens.", "That leads to our third strategic growth driver: creating an unprecedented global platform through our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots. We're making steady progress in executing this partnership. We realigned our organization to accelerate our strategies in support of our partnership with Alliance Boots. Both companies were successful in completing important financing transactions. We closed a $4 billion public debt offering, getting attractive rates across all of our maturities, and Alliance Boots recently completed a highly successful amend-and-extend transaction of its current debt portfolio, which significantly increases future flexibility. Both transactions reflect the strong support from public and private debt markets.", "In this quarter, we also closed on the establishment of a new joint venture company, Walgreens Boots Alliance Development, based in Berne, Switzerland with key talent in place. In addition, we've established the synergy streams and have begun to see results, putting us on track to meet our first year synergy targets. Currently, 6 teams of employees from both companies are hard at work to capture the revenue and savings opportunities we've committed to, exploring opportunities in procurement, merchandising and the sharing of best practices across our networks. As part of that effort, our merchandising team added the popular Boots' No7 to our beauty product line, debuting it at our Hollywood flagship opening with very good early results. We look forward to sharing more details with all of you at our analyst day in mid-February in London.", "In closing, as I said when I began this morning, 3.5 years ago, we launched an unprecedented strategic and operational transformation of Walgreens. Today, we have the wind at our backs as we head into a new calendar year. Customers from plans and Express Scripts network are returning to our pharmacies. We have successfully launched our Balance Rewards program, with 45 million people signed up. We've executed our promotion strategy to balance our approach to driving sales and margin.", "We now have more than 400 Well Experience stores, bringing a new experience to our customers with our flagships providing a halo effect in the major markets across the country. Our reinvigorated private brands, led by Nice! and Delish, are creating brand loyalty and increasing margins for our Daily Living business. We continue to lead industry consolidation with strategic acquisitions from Duane Reade and drugstore.com to USA Drug and assets of BioScrip.", "We are positioned to become the first global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise with a supply chain unmatched in the industry. With Walgreens and Alliance Boots, we are bringing together 2 iconic brands to create something new and unique in the industry that will be difficult, if not impossible, to match.", "So finally, I want to thank our 240,000 employees who worked hard this year and helped position us for a very exciting future. Thank you. Happy holidays, and let me turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on this call. This morning, I'll take you through our quarterly results, as well as update you on our investment in Alliance Boots.", "As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.43 per diluted share based on 951 million shares. Recall last quarter, we began reporting results on an adjusted basis in addition to a GAAP basis. This chart illustrates the walk to adjusted EPS for the quarter. The LIFO provision was $0.04 per share; acquisition-related amortization was $0.06 per share; and finally, the special items totaling $0.05 per share, with $0.03 related to Hurricane Sandy and $0.02 related to the USA Drug acquisition and subsequent closure of some overlapping stores.", "The sum of these yields an adjusted EPS of $0.58 per diluted share for the quarter. As Greg mentioned, we have decided to move to a 1-quarter accounting lag for the Alliance Boots investment. The adjusted EPS of $0.58 per share reflects $0.07 dilution related to the Alliance Boots investment compared to what would have been an estimated adjusted EPS accretion of $0.03 in the quarter had we reported using our previously announced 1-month lag. The dilution, driven by the 1-quarter lag versus a 1-month lag, occurs because we incurred 3 months of interest expense and 3 months of share dilution but we only record equity income for the single month of August, which is also typically one of Alliance Boots' weakest months in what is a fairly seasonal business.", "Before I get into full details of Walgreens' core business, let me take a minute to first give you a deeper explanation of why we adopted a 1-quarter lag for Alliance Boots and review the reporting calendar to give you a clear picture of the impact of the lag reporting and what you can expect going forward. After much thoughtful consideration, the reason we made the decision to have a 1-quarter lag is we believe that this is the most practical way to meet the various and complicated regulatory audit and business concerns. While this does delay some visibility into the Alliance Boots' business, and understandably, you were seeking that, one benefit would be that investors will ultimately have a comparable quarterly actual period with Alliance Boots on a lag basis.", "I realize that based upon our previous disclosure, you came into the meeting today assuming that we'd report on a 1-month lag basis, and therefore, it is important that we give you more perspective on the change and its impact. With the 1-month lag, we would have reported equity income for the months of August, September and October in the quarter, whereas, with the 1-quarter lag, we only report equity income for August. And as mentioned, under both scenarios, the quarter reflects 3 months of the dilutive effect of the incremental shares and debt interest associated with the transaction.", "This means that in our fiscal second quarter, we will report equity income from Alliance Boots for the months of September, October and November. It is important to note that this accounting change does not, in any way, alter the underlying performance of their business, which is performing in line with our expectations. During our upcoming analyst day in London on February 13, we intend to go into much more detail on Alliance Boots, how to think about the strategies and performance of each of their businesses and give you detail as to what you can expect with respect to ongoing reporting metrics.", "Along that line of thinking, we have included in the appendix a reconciliation of the $4 million of equity GAAP income we recognized in the quarter. It's important to note that for the month of August, Alliance Boots had net income of $52 million in U.S. dollar terms under IFRS, but multiple IFRS to U.S. GAAP conversion items, as well as intangible asset amortization and deal-related inventory step-up, which is transitional by nature, takes that to $4 million.", "What this means with respect to our revised accretion expectations is outlined in this chart. As discussed earlier, we had $0.07 of adjusted dilution during our first quarter. In the second quarter, we expect to have adjusted accretion of $0.04 to $0.06 per diluted share. In the third quarter, we expect adjusted accretion of $0.12 to $0.13 per diluted share. The higher accretion in the third quarter is due to the fact that we will be reporting the expected equity income for the months of December, January and February for Alliance Boots, which are typically very strong months, given the holiday seasonality. And in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted accretion of $0.09 to $0.10 per diluted share. For the fiscal year, we expect the new adjusted accretion to be $0.18 to $0.22, which means we expect accretion of $0.25 to $0.29 over the balance of the fiscal year.", "It may be helpful to reconcile these new adjusted accretion numbers with respect to our original fiscal year '13 accretion estimates of $0.23 to $0.27. At the time of the announcement, we noted that the 45% periodic Alliance Boots income available to equity holders was subject to GAAP adjustments, foreign exchange translations and basis difference amortization. Our current estimate of the IFRS-to-GAAP adjustments for fiscal year 2013 are a negative $0.06, foreign exchange translations are 0 and the amortization add-back is $0.11.", "As outlined, adopting a 1-quarter lag had a negative $0.10 impact in the first quarter and the fiscal year relative to a 1-month lag, yielding a new adjusted fiscal year '13 accretion range of $0.18 to $0.22. Again, these estimates do not include amortization expense or onetime transaction costs and reflect the company's current estimates of IFRS-to-GAAP conversion and foreign exchange translations. All estimates assume no M&A or strategic transactions. We are anticipating that in the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal year 2013 we will have approximately $0.04 of special items associated with the transaction, such as advisory fees, fees associated with legal entity establishment, expatriate moves and key dedicated resources.", "Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. As you already know, comparable scripts in the quarter were impacted by the loss of Express Scripts business. Comparable prescription sales decreased 11.3%. Comparable front-end sales decreased 2%, and total comp sales decreased 8%. Comparable prescriptions filled decreased 4.8%, noting that comp prescription sales were down to a much greater degree, primarily due to the increased introductions of new generics.", "This slide illustrates the impact on comparable store script numbers for the previous 3 quarters when we were not part of Express Scripts network versus the prior year. The comp store scripts were down 4.8% in the first quarter, which was a sequential improvement of 320 basis points over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, which was down 8%. And this reflects our continued progress of winning back Express Scripts customers.", "Moving to our front end. Traffic in the quarter decreased by 4.2%, while basket size increased by 2.2% and the front-end comp decreased by 2%. The primary drivers behind these decreases were the impact of Express Scripts and the move to rebalance our overall promotional spending strategy, which we continue to believe is appropriate. We achieved stable margins in a very promotional environment, and we will continue to work to strike the right optimal balance between sales and profitable growth, especially as our Balance Rewards loyalty program and membership starts to hit critical mass and creates a whole new lever to help find an optimal balance between loyal customer sales and margins.", "Turning to margin. Our FIFO gross margin was 29.8% in the current quarter compared to 28.4% last year, a 140-basis-point improvement. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of the introduction of new generics, and the increase was partially offset by reimbursement and specialty pharmacy mix. The front end was positively impacted by OTC drug, personal care, convenience and fresh food categories, offset by loyalty investments and e-commerce mix, which is a solid contributor to gross profit dollars but at a lower margin than the balance of the business.", "Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends. It's important to note that this quarter's 140-basis-point improvement was against a 40-basis-point decrease a year ago. While the front end margin was flat, it also reflects the fact that the company made meaningful investments in the Balance Rewards program.", "This slide illustrates our 2-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last 9 quarters, and the next slide shows the trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stacked adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago, with 7.4% growth in the first quarter of 2013, down from 11.7% last year. To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our reported SG&A dollar growth of 4.6% included 30 basis points of Walgreens' amortization, 30 basis points of Alliance Boots' onetime costs, 90 basis points of Hurricane Sandy costs and 60 basis points from the USA Drug transaction expense, primarily inventory and store write-offs. This resulted in an adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 2.5%. This SG&A dollar growth rate includes 60 basis points of non-comp operating expense for the USA Drug and 90 basis points of expense related to staffing and marketing to win back Express Scripts customers, sign up new Balance Rewards members and to help enroll seniors in Medicare Part D programs.", "This next slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 9 quarters on a GAAP basis, and it shows the trend on adjusted basis.", "Here the adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased from a negative 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to a positive 0.1% in the first quarter of 2013. The trend in the adjusted gross profit dollar growth data shows the benefit of returning Express Scripts customers combined with an increase in the mix of generic drugs, which we believe is a good indicator of the underlying momentum in our business.", "Following the same construct, this slide shows the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past 9 quarters on a GAAP basis, and the next slide shows this on adjusted basis. As I discussed in the SG&A walk earlier, the adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 2.5%, an increase from the roughly negative 1% to negative 2% adjusted SG&A dollar growth in the second half of fiscal 2012, but still lower than our SG&A dollar growth in the first half of 2012. Again, as I mentioned, we have several strategic initiatives and investments in SG&A in the quarter, and we believe that this will pay off nicely as we move forward.", "Focusing on our income statement for a moment. This quarter included a LIFO provision of $55 million versus $45 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 2.5%, up from 2% a year ago. Net interest expense was $37 million, including the impact of the Alliance Boots acquisition, up from $17 million a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 38.2% versus 37.2% last year, primarily due to discrete items and a onetime state rate true-up.", "Average diluted shares outstanding were 951 million shares versus 885 million shares last year, and this change is due to a combination of share repurchases in the interim, as well as the impact of the 83.4 million shares issued due to the Alliance Boots investment. Going forward, we expect our share count to be about 950 million shares on a diluted basis.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion at November 30 versus $1.1 billion a year ago. Overall working capital decreased by 12.8% versus a year ago. And accounts receivable decreased by 12.5%, while accounts payable increased nearly 1%. Inventories were down year-over-year, but have increased sequentially as we added back pharmacy inventory due to returning customers. Inventories were also impacted by USA Drug acquisition inventory and the inventory related to the timing of some front-end resets. On inventory, total FIFO inventory decreased by 0.9% in the quarter versus a 4.6% decrease in total sales. And FIFO inventories decreased by 4% on a per-store basis.", "During the first quarter, we generated $601 million in cash from operations versus $809 million a year ago. Free cash flow in the quarter was $265 million versus $390 million a year ago. Change in cash is in part reflective of the inventory changes I mentioned, which, again, were driven by many of the impacts I've outlined before. Despite temporary working capital fluctuations, we are very focused on cash and feel that we will continue to show strong cash results over time. Also keep in mind that we raised our dividend over 22% this year to $0.275 per share for the quarter.", "Now let me transition to our fiscal year 2016 goals for the combined Walgreens and Alliance Boots business. We continue to believe that this partnership will reward our stakeholders and as Greg said, will deliver significant synergies, enhance mutual capabilities and change strategic landscape in the U.S., Europe and other geographies around the world. The business performance objectives are meeting our expectations and are on track to meet our first year synergy targets as well.", "Now I remain highly confident in the strength of our 2 businesses as we set out to change the paradigm in our industry, with a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing platform that will meaningfully differentiate us and create significant value. In that context, we affirm our combined stated goals for fiscal year 2016 of $130 billion of revenue; $9 billion to $9.5 billion of adjusted operating income or $8.5 billion to $9 billion on a U.S. GAAP basis; combined synergy goal of $1 billion, with a fiscal year '13 target of $100 million to $150 million; $8 billion of operating cash flow; and a combined net debt of $11 billion or less.", "In closing, we believe this quarter marks a key inflection point. While it included some important reporting changes, the key takeaway is that our underlying business trends showed improvement and we remain optimistic about our prospects for the rest of the fiscal year, aided by a significant tailwind as we begin cycling the anniversary of our Express Scripts network departure.", "We are making progress across all of our key strategies and have embarked on a watershed journey with Alliance Boots. With combined retail stores and distribution touch points of more than 180,000 in 26 countries, I believe we are well positioned to lead our industry as the world's largest and most innovative player in our space. And together, we are well positioned for growth and uniquely positioned to leverage our mutual capabilities and assets for our customers and suppliers. We remain confident in our ability to execute with excellence and reward our stakeholders.", "So now with that, I'll turn it back over to Rick.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So a couple of things. Let me start. Wade or Greg, do you -- is there any operational performance numbers you can share on Alliance Boots, whether it be top line growth comps, EBIT growth, whatever for the last few months? Just to get a sense of what the operational performance looks like.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, John. I'll let Wade kind of cover what he [indiscernible].", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I mean, I guess, what I would say is, like I said, we're on track with respect to their business performance and also, with respect to the synergies. If I was to give some perspective on an IFRS basis, which as IFRS are not audited, their -- for the first 4 months, August through November, their trading profit is exceeding 10%, and underlying profit for the year is even better than that. So that's, again, an IFRS basis. But if you want color on those 4 months, in a tough year climate, they continue to perform very, very well. Obviously, the southern countries are more challenging than northern Europe, but in aggregate, they're doing a very good job. And I think on analyst day, we'll be able to peel into their business to a much greater degree.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then secondly, so again I'll put this into -- they're both really the same question. If you think about Balance Rewards and then front-end traffic and ticket, do you think Balance Rewards, based on your pilot, that, that will move the dial on average basket size first? And then when does it move the dial -- how many more months, would you think, before it moves the dial on basket size? And then secondly, I assume, you would think that's going to happen, so there is not a plan to become more promotional early in '13, if those numbers don't step up. I guess, you assume that they will, right?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes. John, good questions. And as I've said several times, the key to retail is trying to balance price and promotion in the right way. And we do think, obviously, that strategic shift in our promotional activity was due to having a Balance Rewards program that we knew we were going to be launching. So certainly, with our 45 million folks, we do believe -- I would agree with you, I think we'll probably begin to see basket increase first. I think with the way our program is designed, certainly, as more and more people gain points as they are doing and then begin to redeem them on rewards, especially during this holiday season, I think we'll see momentum in that being recognized as a real currency. That should indeed help drive sales next year, as well as traffic. At the same time, the good thing as well, as I pointed out, we're really driving our private brand penetration. We're up a couple of hundred basis points, as I said. The good thing there is that gives us some added margin that we can intelligently reinvest into the business, if needed. So we're going to continue to manage price and promotion intelligently. And we think we have, certainly, the advantage of Balance Rewards as it catches on to help us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Miller from William Blair.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "On the SG&A spend, can you provide a little more perspective about what has changed? I think with the trend down last year and then up 2% or 3% excluding the onetime items you called out, I think you said around 90 basis points of investment, which would still have that up 1% to 2%. So were there some expenses that kicked out of last year into this year or beyond those investments, what has changed here?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, look, I think if you look at longer trend, the 1-year and then the 2-year stacked trends, I think actually we feel pretty good. I mean, obviously, SG&A isn't something that you manage quarter-to-quarter, you manage strategically. And again, when you look at kind of the not just adjusted but the kind of the comparable basis being up 1%, we felt pretty good about. And these investments we've made in terms of loyalty sign-ups, in terms of Express Scripts win-back and in terms of the Part D programs, in particular, where we are preferred player, we believe are very, very good investments and will play out very nicely as we come into the new year.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "On generics, in the past wave with Zocor and Zoloft, I remember the company had around 25% EPS growth. And then past that exclusivity period, the earnings went flat. Can you just tell us how the contracts have changed for you? I mean, are we going to see a similar type of step-down for Walgreens after this generic wave? Or how have you changed the contract structures?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We have obviously hundreds of contracts, and they're all different. But as kind of a general rule of thumb, I think we've been very thoughtful about making sure that, in general, we're not going after feast or famine but sustainable profitability, which means in the front end, you might leave a little bit on the table but over a longer term, we think we have a very stable business with very strong margins. So I think that's a general direction that we've headed. Again, each contract is different, but I think that we feel that not only through this generic wave but post the wave, we're going to have a very solid business and very good margins we can work with.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And then related to that, Wade, the reimbursement, you did indicate, was down a little bit with reimbursement in specialty. Is that -- was that negative impact in the quarter different materially than you had seen in prior quarters? Or should we...", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No, I would say...", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Reimbursement in '13?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Reimbursement was negligible, really. So in general, we had a good uptick from generics. We do have some specialty mix. And then we -- well, a little bit from 90-day. But again, 90-day in aggregate is good incremental dollars for us and strategically right on target.", "Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And then with all these contracts that you've had and the negotiations, I mean, is there anything to call out in terms of potential changes going forward?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "No, I think we feel like we're in a very good place. I think that we have as much stability in our commercial book as we've said that we felt for a long period of time. We feel that we have a good ecosystem. We're being treated fairly by our payers and having them being treated fairly versus each other. So I think we're in a good spot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Deborah Weinswig from Citi.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So you talked about being the worst flu season in 10 years, can you talk about how you might be able to capitalize on that?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, I guess, we have to careful how we couch that, Deborah. But yes, certainly, we think, as we've been seeing, I think our flu shots remain strong, probably actually a second burst that we typically maybe wouldn't have seen but also cough and cold. We're seeing front-end categories that you would expect that are strong. We're also obviously seeing some prescription lift. So I think that when you're in the prescription business, you certainly -- you can capitalize on that. So I think we feel pretty good with this being, as the CDC said, the worst flu season in 10 years.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then you talked about this being a very promotional environment. Are you seeing that just from the drug stores? Or is it broader than that?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, I think we're seeing it probably throughout different channels by different players. But certainly, we're focused on what we think is the right thing to do for our business. But we're going to -- as I said, I think we're well positioned with the fact that we have 50 -- nearly -- we have about 45 million people on the Balance Rewards card, which is really just beginning to drive some momentum for us now that people understand the value of that currency. But it's kind of scattered by channel, by player.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And obviously, you have a very unique e-commerce approach, with not only Walgreens.com, but also drugstore.com. Can you talk about how you might be able to utilize that to get across maybe a differentiated, let's just say, value message?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, we're really excited with what Zon [ph] and our team are doing in e-com and mobile commerce, with building an omni channel solution. And as we've said, I think the value of our convenient brick-and-mortar locations, with convenient omni channel solution, positions us to do quite well going forward. Our e-com business continues to grow in line with the industry, and we continue to add additional items. The drugstore.com acquisition gave us -- extended our long tail, which gives us additional SKUs beyond what we carry in the store. Some of the -- some actually -- and interesting, some of the Alliance Boots products that we carry on beauty.com were some of our top items during the holiday season, so we think we -- there is an opportunity to bring even more of Alliance Boots expertise and product lines in our online offering.", "Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then, last question. Would you say that the sign-ups on the Balance Rewards are exceeding your expectations? And how are you measuring ROI?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Wade?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I mean we have a whole marketing mix model we look at. And in part, this isn't necessarily incremental spend. It's a different way of going to market. So we've been shifting from what was typically almost completely roto-dependent to now, I'd say, a much more balanced approach, with not only roto, but also multichannel efforts, what we're doing on the Web, what we're doing with loyalty, what we're doing on our equity, kind of revision campaign. So we think that, over time, that it's -- our use of funds, if you will, is much better in this new balanced approach. And again, as Greg said, as we build critical mass with loyalty, we now have 60% of our sales coming through, but where the real magic starts to happen is we start to build the redemption, where people can redeem and feel that there's real value in that redemption. That becomes a powerful engine, and we're just now starting to reach that point where those numbers are starting to grow.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I would like to first try to dig a little bit deeper into Express recovery and the pace that you're seeing. Obviously, some of your competitors have indicated that they're holding on. Your November numbers did, in fact, show some improvement, and you said some good things about December. So what's your expectation of the pace of recovery? And any numbers you'd be willing to share about what you think you're getting now or what you might ultimately recapture?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Well, Matt, first, as we said, we are pleased with the progress we're making. We're on track with what our expectation was at this point in time. You can see that, as we said, and suggested that you track our monthly comps and the progress we've made this past month -- or this past quarter. I think we're continuing to see and expect what we have forecast throughout next year. We think we can regain significant portion of these customers over time.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Second question, if I could. You spoke about some of the puts and takes on loyalty. You have 45 million members, some incremental SG&A and a little bit of hit to gross margin. How do you think about the economics of the loyalty program? At what point do you expect to see peak pressure from the rollout of this program? And when do the economics start to become more attractive for you?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "A couple of things. In the short term, you have a bit of kind of the accounting nuances, as you get points it tends to impact gross margin. As people redeem, it tends to impact sales. And then over time, depending on how much breakage there is or isn't, that alters. But in general, we feel that even thus far with the investment, we've been able to maintain an overall strong profitability in the front end. As I said, the real magic starts to come through as we start to move towards critical mass of redemption. We're just getting to that point, but that's where we believe we can really move a bigger customer basket size and incent the most loyal. And so I guess, what I'd say is I think the team has done an outstanding job of not only executing and enrolling people but also really mitigating what in general can be a tremendous upfront cost. And so for the most part, we've been able to glide through that, and longer term, this, we believe, becomes a very accretive vehicle as well as something that differentiates us.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Matt, I would go back to something Wade said earlier on an earlier question. This -- I want to remind everyone, this was a strategic shift in our promotional strategy plan over a year ago when we knew we were going to launch the Balance Rewards program. And certainly, with the advent of digital media, the decrease in paper -- in print media and the fact that we now have 45 million people with the Balance Rewards program, it gives us the ability to more surgically and efficiently use marketing dollars. And we're really having a good reception from our vendors, our partners, who are looking at this as a more efficient way to spend their dollars.", "Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And understanding that this is successful overall, in all the ways you just said, do the economics get better from here? Or does the pressure, such as it is, will linger for a little while until this program matures a bit?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Year by year by year, economics get better, so that doesn't mean necessarily in the next 30 days or whatever, there's a turning point. But I think the important thing is that we've done the upfront investment in systems. We've been able to do the heavy investment, enrolling a significant amount of people, and I think the real magic starts to happen as you get enough people with enough points that they can really redeem for things that are meaningful, and that's where we start to drive the [indiscernible]. So -- but year by year by year, it just gets better for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "I guess I just had a few quick ones, hopefully. On Part D, you mentioned that you're the top few plans as preferred provider. Can you give us any perspective on the sort of market share that preferred providers typically would see or what your expectations are as a result of being in those plans?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, Tom, I can't really give color for the plans. I think I can say obviously, 3 of those are, obviously, 3 of the bigger plans in the program. I think we're just excited that they chose us as a preferred partner for all the value and the services we bring. And certainly, this enrollment period, we spent a lot of time trying to help seniors understand how Walgreens being preferred in a Part D plan was a benefit to them. And we think that these 3 plans would probably be some of the top winners in the program, and we're positioned well with them. I think the data will come from the plans probably toward the end of January, but we think they're 3 of the top plans. We think they'll probably be highly successful. We're delighted to be a preferred provider with them.", "Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And Wade, just to follow up on the generics, is it the right interpretation that you described the exclusivity period to be exceptionally good and it sounds like, over time, maybe the way you're contracting, the benefits won't be as skewed upfront. Is that sort of the idea? And if so, is there any way to think about fiscal or calendar '13 versus fiscal or calendar '12 in terms of the impact of generics?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I mean, I think others have said that kind of the fiscal '13 is better than '12, and that's directionally true for us. I think that the general idea though is we've been working, in general, to have kind of more of what I would call corridors so that, again, it's not a game of how much you can make in the first couple of months, but it's really about sustainability of the economics. And so we feel very good about that. But I think, as I've said before, this is not a company to invest in just because of a generic wave, I think we're doing lots of things, some that over time are big and meaningful and much more sustainable than that as well. I think that's -- that's, I think, good. But I think that we've taken a very pragmatic approach on our contracting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Greg and Wade, could you maybe help us reconcile comments related to the ESI recapture versus what we're hearing from some of the other chain drugstores? You seem to be happy with the way things are progressing. They seem to be talking about very high retention rates. The scripts that you're getting back so far, are -- is it the case that they may be coming from other channels other than chain drug? Just trying to understand how we get 2 different stories.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Ed. Ed, maybe I'll start. And I know Wade's jumping to get in there as well, but I guess I'll start. We're certainly feeling good with where we are. We're on track. As I said, you can see it in our comp numbers up, so certainly, somebody is losing some share. With that said, that's one of the reasons we try to fill the pie chart up because I think that pie chart shows that, frankly, that they're coming from every player, it doesn't matter who you are and at the rate of what we lost them at. So bottom line is we feel good with our comps. We feel good with our win-back, and I can't help you with that disconnect but -- other than the fact that we feel good with where we are.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, historically been on networks before, so we have quite a bit of experience of the rate we win back and ramp in. I think we continue to improve, as we would expect, quite nicely. So there's nothing that suggests thus far that this is going to be any different. I know people have maybe made predictions of what they think the end state of retention will be. But I guess, I would say that no one can really predict that. It's impossible to predict, but with respect to the trends that we're on now versus what we've seen historically, we're very optimistic.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then...", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Win-back percentage is from the transfer file, so it is what it is. But I think that we know the percentage that were transferred out, and we've shown the percentage that are transferred back in, and it's -- in general, it seems to be pretty much the same percentages, which, again, tells us that people want to come back. The ones that want to come back to their pharmacy, want to come back and value it.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then on Alliance Boots, if I take the number that you, I guess, would have earned this quarter if you didn't have the issue with the lag versus what you're going to make the next 3 quarters, it seems like that maybe the accretion guidance went up, although I think there might be a timing issue in here. So when we think about the accretion for the full year with Alliance Boots and what it would have been if we had the full year without the lag issue, did you raise it or is it the same? So I'm trying understand.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "It's pretty much the same, Ed. Remember when we gave the original guidance, we didn't know what the amortization component would be or the IFRS-to-GAAP adjustment. There's really no way to know that until you're very deep in the midst of it. So what we try to do is reconcile the $0.23, $0.27 to where we are today with those 2 adjustments in the lag. And effectively, we would have been higher than $0.23, $0.27, but that would have been with other adjustments that were unknowable at the time. But pretty much, we're exactly on track. And again, the impact of the lag is effectively $0.10, and that's -- versus the 1 month. It would be even greater if it was versus a 0 month.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And Wade, could you maybe do us a favor, and as we think about when you report adjusted EPS going forward, what numbers are you going to be excluding from that? Obviously, it's LIFO and stuff, but what about the amortization step-up, the GAAP adjustments? I don't know exactly what's going to be excluded and what's not.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "From Alliance Boots, the numbers that would get adjusted will be as apples-to-apples as ours as we can possibly do. So it will be FIFO to FIFO because that's our adjusted basis, the amortization they have of things like brands and customer relationships, things that don't decay are added back and then any truly special items, but it will be on a GAAP basis. So again, the numbers I quoted earlier in terms of their progress are IFRS. But when we report it in our numbers, we'll make our IFRS-to-GAAP adjustments, and the numbers you'll see for Alliance Boots will be as apples-to-apples as we can for our adjusted numbers on a U.S. GAAP basis.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just last question for you on tax rate, Alliance Boots and taxes. The minority interest from Alliance Boots, is it pretax or after tax? And then, your tax rate this quarter seemed a little high. Was there something impacting that? And how is that tax rate going to look, going forward?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Just let me, rough, rule of thumb, the equity income, I believe, that you see there is kind of the after-tax effect, which is kind of circa 20% tax rate. There may be a little bit of a tick-up on things for [indiscernible]. But in general, our rate will be fairly close to their rate and the equity income. So it really depends, are there any items that would have [indiscernible] impact. But in general, these should be fairly small, so call it circa 20%, 21% is the effective tax rate you'll see coming through.", "Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So the minority interest is already after tax and we should use your normal tax rate for below the line, is that right?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes. You won't tax it again. There'll be a little bit of a [indiscernible] but it won't come in an after-tax rate plus the U.S tax rate.", "Operator", "And that concludes the Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Rick Hans for further remarks.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. As a reminder, the company will report December sales on January 4, host our annual shareholders meeting in Chicago on January 9, and we will report second quarter 2013 results on March 26. Until then, thank you for listening, and happy holidays.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference.

Wasson", "Thank you, Rick. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today I'll begin with a review of the highlights of our results for the quarter, then I will touch on our announcement earlier today on the Walgreens and Alliance Boots strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen and how that carries forward one of our three key strategic growth drivers to create an unprecedented global platform through our Alliance Boots partnership. After that I will turn the call over to Wade for more information on our performance this quarter and details of the Walgreens, Alliance Boots, and AmerisourceBergen announcement.", "Turning to our overall financial results, we\u2019re pleased to report a solid quarter with adjusted earnings of $0.96 per diluted share and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.79. With that performance were a number of highlights; first, we had operating cash flow for the second quarter of $1.2 billion and free cash flow coming in at $953 million.", "Second, our Balance Rewards program continues to show a strong response from our customers with more than 60 million customers enrolled. Third, the Alliance Boots business and synergies are on track with our expectations with accretion to our adjusted EPS of $0.05.", "Finally, this morning\u2019s announcement of our strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen demonstrates how we continue to move forward on our strategy to create a global network for pharmacy lead health and well-being with Alliance Boots.", "With those highlight, let me recap our financial results this quarter, as we began doing in the fourth quarter of last year, we\u2019ll present our results both in GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. We reported first quarter sales of $18.6 billion virtually identical to the same quarter a year ago, remember that this quarter includes one less day due to last years leap date, and sales also continue to be impacted by the growth in lower cost generic drugs which are for bottom line.", "GAAP operating income or EBIT for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 10% from $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income or EBIT for the quarter was nearly $1.4 billion, up 12.9% from just over $1.2 billion in the second quarter 2012. GAAP net earnings for the quarter were up by 10.7% from $683 million or $0.78 per diluted share last year, the $756 million or $0.79 per diluted share this year.", "The non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for this quarter were $915 million or $0.96 per diluted share compared to adjusted net earnings of $776 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.", "As I mentioned in January, we came into this year with a number of tailwinds and we capitalized on these positive trends in the second quarter. That's especially true in pharmacy which continues to be on the up swing, like Wade Miquelon will review some of these tailwinds.", "For the multiyear contract with Express Scripts, we saw an increasing percentage of those patients returning to us this quarter. Walgreens is now a preferred drugstore for Medicare Part D plans giving these numbers a financial benefit when they chose Walgreens over our competitors. Our reinvigorated private brands led by nice, delish, and well at Walgreens are driving margin and receiving great feedback from our store managers, while they continue to build momentum with customers.", "In this month we were cycling last year's change in our promotional strategy that moved us away from predominantly print promotions, instead we are leveraging digital media and our new Balance Rewards loyalty program launched last September.", "From a global viewpoint, our Alliance Boots strategic partnership is now firmly in place and we\u2019re already realizing benefits from our procurement joint venture. And now with this morning\u2019s early announcement with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, we're taking another step forward in establishing an unprecedented and efficient global pharmacy led health and well-being network and achieving our vision of becoming the first choice in health and daily living for everyone in America and beyond.", "Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A, in the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our gross profit dollar growth increased 4% or $218 million from a year ago. SG&A dollar growth increased $213 million or 5% compared to a year ago.", "On a non-GAAP basis, gross profit dollar growth after adjusting for the LIFO provision, increased $218 million or 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in generic prescriptions while front-end margins also increased slightly.", "SG&A dollar growth was up $178 million or 4.2% after adjusting for the Alliance Boots transaction costs, other acquisition related amortization and the USA Drug acquisition related cost.", "Through the quarter, we continued to make steady progress and executing on the three major strategic drivers we put in place in 2012 to position our Company for long-term growth and value creation. On creating a well experience, this week we\u2019re opening our newest flagship store in Washington DC, followed by a flagship in the Empire State Building later this month and one in Boston next month. These locations are raising the Walgreen\u2019s brand in important markets as we continue to drive innovation across our store network.", "On transforming community pharmacy among other steps we recently formed accountable care organization, part of the national healthcare reform with three leading physician teams in Texas, Florida and New Jersey, and this morning\u2019s announcement with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen was a significant step forward and our third growth driver establishing an efficient global platform.", "Our new strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen has three main components; a distribution agreement, strategic collaboration and equity alignment. Let me touch on each and then Wade will provide more details. First, our distribution agreement is a long-term tenure contract, it offers expanded service levels and more frequent deliveries and it offers improved economics through a number of operational efficiencies and better rates.", "The second component, the strategic collaboration gives the supply chain and its procurement benefits, new opportunities for customer and so far our collaborations and for domestic and international growth.", "Finally, the equity piece of the agreement is designed to align our common interest and allow us to participate in a joint value creation.", "Let me sum up by saying, we are very pleased with the way customers, patients, and partners are responding to our efforts to help people get stay and live well. We see this in our response in the response to balance rewards, our vaccination and immunization program, our health and wellness initiatives, our innovations and partnerships, and the excitement we continue to generate in our well experienced format.", "With our partnership with Alliance Boots performing well and producing the expected synergies and a new strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen we announced today, we believe Walgreens is truly on its way to be the first choice in health and daily living for everyone in America and beyond.", "Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, I will take you through our quarterly results as well as build on Greg\u2019s comments regarding today\u2019s announced future relationship between Walgreens, Alliance Boots, AmerisourceBergen. I will also provide greater detail on the 10-year agreement as well as further perspective and why we are confident this relationship unlocks significant opportunities for our company and provide value to our shareholders.", "Starting with the quarterly results; as Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.79 per diluted share based on 953 million shares. This chart illustrates the walk from GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS for the quarter. The LIFO provision was $0.05 per share. The acquisition related amortization was $0.08 and the Alliance Boots adjusted earnings tax add back was $0.04 for total of $0.12 per share, and finally the special items column had a Net Zero impact on adjusted earnings per share because of the $0.01 of acquisition related costs, and they were offset by a $0.01 gain related to the client retention extra proceeds from the sale of our PBM in 2011, some of these yields and adjusted EPS $0.96 per diluted share for the quarter.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that the quarter this year had one less day than the quarter last year which included leap days February 29. Adjusting for leap day adjusted earnings per share increased over 10% in the quarter rather than the 9.1% that Greg noted.", "Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. Keep in mind that our comp store reported on a 28 day basis. Comparable prescription sales decreased 1.2%, comparable front-end sales decreased 1.6%, total comp sales decreased 1.4%, and non-prescription sale increased 5.7% versus a negative 6.1% script comp a year ago. We also note that comparable prescription sales were negative versus the positive scrip comps primarily due to the increase introductions of new generics year-over-year.", "This slide illustrates the trend of prescription comps for the last 14 quarters that clearly shows the impact on comp stores script numbers in the prior fourth quarters were not part of the Express Scripts networks. As you now Express Scripts customers started returning to our pharmacies in the first quarter.", "The comp store scripts increased 5.7% in the second quarter, please note that the script comps also included a 1.9% positive impact from a higher incidence of flu this quarter versus a year ago.", "Next slide shows the trend in Front-end comps for the last 14 quarters. The primary drivers behind the trend in the last four quarter were the impacted the move to rebalance our overall add and emotional spending strategy and the impact of Express Scripts. Our goal of (inaudible) balance between sales and profitable growth using our promotional strategy, as well as our unique Balance Rewards loyalty program. This gives us an additional lever to help find this balance between loyal customer sales and margins.", "We are pleased to achieve stable margins in the front-end despite a very promotional environment. On a 28 day basis, traffic in the quarter decreased by 4.4%, basket size increased by 2.8%, and the front-end decreased by 1.6%. Keep in mind, we will have to change an overall promotional spend strategy this month, that should help improve the recent comp trend. March comps will also be positively impacted by the ships in Easter from April 8 last year to March 31 this year.", "Turning to margin, our FIFO gross margin was 30.5% in the current quarter compared with 29.3% last year a 120 basis points improvement. The overall margin was primarily helped my pharmacy, but the front-end also contributed. Pharmacy margins were positively impacted by generics, front-end margins were positively impacted by OTC drugs, personal care and household products, but these benefits were partially offset by the increase in points accruing as we ramp up our loyalty program. Front-end margins were also negatively impacted by the e-commerce mix effects.", "Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, it is important to note this quarter's 120 basis point improvement builds on 20 basis point increase a year ago, and the improvement this quarter is similar to last year, both quarters a testament to the benefit of generics introductions this fiscal year. Front-end benefit to margin did move from neutral to positive sequentially, and also note the 4% improvement in FIFO gross profit dollar growth, which is much better than the 0.1% growth last quarter, and a 1.5% growth in the quarter a year ago.", "This illustrates our two year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters. The next slide shows the trend on an adjusted basis. Three year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago to 7.9% growth in the second quarter of 2013, down from the 11.6% last year.", "To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, we could see there are reported SG&A dollar growth and 5% included 30 basis points of Walgreens amortization and 50 basis points of acquisition related costs, which result in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 4.2%. This illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past ten quarters on a GAAP basis.", "And the next slide shows the trend on an adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased from a positive 0.1% in the first quarter to a positive 4% in the second quarter. The trend in adjusted gross profit dollar growth data shows a benefit from members of Express Scripts plans returning to our stores, combined with an increase in the mix of generic drugs.", "While on the same construct this slide shows the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past 10 quarters on a GAAP basis. and the next slide shows them on an adjusted basis. As I discussed in the SG&A walk earlier, the adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 4.2%, an increase from the 2.5% adjusted SG&A dollar growth reported in the first quarter.", "Keep in mind that the adjusted SG&A dollar growth rate of 4.2% also includes a few other non-comparable expenses as the operating expense related to the USA Drug acquisition and further expenses to sign up Balance Rewards numbers among other items as well.", "Focusing on our income statement for a moment, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $72 million, the same amount as the year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 2.75%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $23 million, including the impact of the Alliance Boots acquisition and interest and income associated with delayed payments by a state Medicaid payer.", "Our effective tax rate was 36.6% versus 37.3% last year. and average diluted shares outstanding were 953 million shares versus 875 million shares last year and again, this increases primarily due to shares issued for the Alliance Boots investments.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion at February 28 versus $1.1 billion a year ago. Overall, working capital decreased by 5.4% versus a year ago; accounts receivable decreased by 1.1% while accounts payable increased by 4.4% and inventories decreased 1.3%. Total FIFO inventory increased by 2.5% in the quarter versus a negligible percent increase in total sales. FIFO inventories on a per store basis were flat.", "During the second quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations versus $1 billion a year ago. Cash flow in the quarter benefitted from the timing of $300 million employee profit share and contribution, which occurred in February last year that occurred in March this year. Free cash flow in the quarter was $953 million versus $753 million a year ago. And keep in mind; we also raised the dividend over 22% this year, $0.275 per share per quarter.", "Let me now transition to our accretion for the quarter as a result of the partnership with Alliance Boots. Second quarter accretion was $0.05 per share in line with $0.04 to $0.06 range we forecasted last quarter. We are reconfirming our estimates throughout the $0.30 per share in the third quarter and now into $0.10 for the fourth quarter.", "The next slide illustrates the synergy dollars, the amortization adjustments and the equity earnings that comprise $0.05 of accretion. As shown, we have realized $25 million before tax and synergies during the second quarter and $15 million after tax. We expect synergies to ramp during the second half of our fiscal year and we remain comfortable with our $100 million to $150 million combined synergy goal for fiscal \u201813.", "Amortization adjustments amounted to $23 for the deal amortization and $12 million for the brand amortization. After tax Alliance Boots equity earnings were $85 million for the second quarter on a GAAP basis. Adjusted basis, the income from affiliate was $120 million as noted here and the incremental after-tax, interest expense to Walgreens was $13 million after the cost to share dilution; the accretion equaled $0.05 in the second quarter.", "Now let me take a few minutes to speak about our announcements this morning regarding the strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen. I would like to fully express my enthusiasm for this agreement and what it means with respect to the various opportunities that it brings us.", "As Greg outlined earlier, this relationship has three components; distribution agreement, strategic collaboration, and equity alignment. Let me first describe the detailed structure of the agreement. First and foremost, Walgreens is committing to a 10 year comprehensive pharmacy distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen. The strategic collaboration with allow broad international reach and significant knowledge sharing opportunities to create efficiencies and design programs to improve access to pharmaceuticals or healthcare providers or life. So aligning interest in strengthening the long-term relationship was underlined, we together have been granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen.", "We are getting this right, but not the obligation to purchase up to 7% of this fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen in the open market. We have established a joint venture with Alliance Boots that we intend to fund over time, there will be an efficient vehicle to purchase and hold these shares.", "In addition, AmerisourceBergen has granted to Walgreens and Alliance Boots equity warrants exercisable for 16% in the aggregate of the fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen.", "First launch representing 8% of the fully diluted equity of AmerisourceBergen and strike price of $51.50; it will be exercisable for six months period beginning in March 2016. The second reward had a strike price of $53.50 it will be exercisable for six month period beginning in March 2017.", "Walgreen\u2019s and Alliance Boots had agreed not to acquire additional equity of AmerisourceBergen under the terms of the standstill agreement. But Walgreens executive will be appointed to AmerisourceBergen's board upon Walgreens and Alliance Boots together acquiring a 5% equity stake. But Alliance Boots executive will be appointed upon exercise in full of the first one. These new board fleets will add to AmerisourceBergen\u2019s current nine member board.", "The 10 year comprehensive distribution agreement will be positive to earnings and cash flow from operations. The agreement is market based and is expected to be modestly accretive in fiscal year \u201814 adjusted earnings. The working capital was negotiated to essentially have a neutral impact to both parties, specifically the reduction in inventory days at Walgreens, will largely be offset by the decrease in accounts payable days over time.", "The operational benefits for Walgreens will include enhanced supply chain with daily delivery. Synergies will also contribute to earnings and cash flow from operations in fiscal \u201914 and they are expected to build in subsequent years. Likewise the equity investment will drive dividend income in fiscal year \u201914 and beyond.", "To summarize, the financial benefits for both Walgreens and Alliance Boots to begin in the first year are improved commercial agreement rates, synergies and dividend income that arrives from the investment. Beginning in year three, the Walgreens and Alliance Boots JV also expect an incremental financial benefit from the equity income. As we stated in our announcement this transaction is structured to enable all three organizations, to work together on programs to improve service levels and efficiencies and benefit from available synergies.", "To wrap up the day, I would like to revisit our fiscal year 2016 goals for the combined Walgreens, Alliance Boots equity. We are not changing our goals. We want to clarify that the agreement we announced today to provide operating income, synergies, and operating cash flow benefit is accretive to our prior plans. We continue to believe that this partnership will reward our stakeholders who will deliver significant synergies and have mutual capabilities and change strategic landscape in the U.S., Europe and other geographies around the world.", "The business performance objectives are meeting our expectations and are on track to meet our first year synergy target. And now the new strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen, we are well positioned as leaders in the rapidly changing global healthcare environment.", "In that context, we had reaffirmed our combined stated goals for fiscal 2016 of $130 billion of revenue, $9.5 billion of adjusted operating income or $8.5 billion to $9 billion on a U.S. GAAP basis. The combined synergy goal of $1 billion with a $100 million to $150 million in fiscal year \u201813 combined synergy goals, $8 billion of operating cash flow and given the strong cash flow trends at both Walgreens and Alliance Boots, we believe that with a 7% investment in AmerisourceBergen, we still need to combine net debt goal of $11 billion or less.", "In summary, we are on a journey, a journey to alter the global landscape in pharmacy led health and well-being and create significant shareholder value along the way. With our partners, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, the opportunity before us are limitless and combined capabilities are unmatched.", "Thank you and we appreciate your interest in our company. And with that, I will turn the microphone back over to Rick.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of United Bank of Switzerland. Your line is open.", "Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 United Bank of Switzerland", "All right, thanks, good morning. Hey, just a question on the gross margin, once again looks pretty strong in this quarter. And obviously there is some seasonalities that kind of jump from the holiday related quarters to the non-holidays. I\u2019m just curious, I know you don\u2019t like to give guidance, but to the extent, you\u2019ve kind of shifted from LIFO to FIFO gross margins. Should we assume the same sort of seasonal progression of gross margins on a FIFO basis that we kind of saw previously on LIFO, just any sort of general color along those lines will kind of help? Thanks.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah. I mean, we\u2019ve got couple of things, one is, we are very focused on margin, I think in the front-end even though we\u2019ve had combined profits. I think we\u2019ve been able to do very good job of improving profitable mix. On pharmacy, you\u2019re seeing some of the benefit of generics, but also I\u2019d say a real focus I think at the end of the day, we will keep looking to improve margin opportunities, but really again I focus on our gross profit dollar growth versus our SG&A dollar growth and being able to continue to widen that spread. And I think you see now for the first time since the Express Script\u2019s dispute. It was actually crossed back over into positive territory and I expect that momentum to build.", "Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 United Bank of Switzerland", "Okay, in that previous guidance you gave a line that is kind of unchanged on a FIFO basis versus what you gave on a LIFO basis previously. Is that just to confirm that, is that correct?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah, so, I mean obviously LIFO to FIFO you never really know until you get the various price increases and things that flows through. I think LIFO was very indicative though over the way we do run our business.", "Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 United Bank of Switzerland", "Okay.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Again I think, with all the things I mentioned we should be able to have nice solid gross profit margin or SG&A dollar growth.", "Steven J. Valiquette \u2013 United Bank of Switzerland", "Okay, thanks. And congrats on the ABC deal as well. Thanks.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Thanks. We appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "Just a couple of things on the Amerisource deal, your comment about working capital, is that neutral to the system or neutral to you?", "Greg D. Wasson", "", "It\u2019s relatively neutral to the system and to us, but over time working together we should both be able to get additional efficiencies and drive additional days of inventory out of it. So, I think there is probably upside results as we work together. But it\u2019s relatively neutral to the system and it\u2019s been balanced, so it is relatively to both parties with some exceptions at the initial startup phase.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "Okay. And then the idea is modestly accretive in \u201814, is that including some one-time cost and then how do you think that generally ramps up in 2015?", "Greg D. Wasson", "There should be very modest one-time costs, so by and largely accretive and modestly accretive including those. But the key thing here is, we\u2019re going to have \u2013 today if I really have three distributors and when we think about it, we\u2019ve had AmerisourceBergen, we take cardinal event ourselves. We\u2019re streamlining all of that into one and generic volume is very, very significant and so that will be faced in overtime. And as we face that in and get that up to speed, that\u2019s were there is additional opportunities, significant opportunities for both party.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "All right. And then lastly, when we look at the front-end and script count as well, if you look at \u2013 February was it look like it was somewhat impacted by macro both the pharmacy and front-end, maybe your take on that as we kind of got into this year with payroll tax and what have you and did you still think in terms of getting positive on traffic at the front-end that\u2019s still likely to be laagered relative to average tick I assume. Do you think we will see positive traffic by the end of the fiscal year?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah John, Greg. Yeah, I would I guess agree with your comments to begin with the stories of macro trends in February and certainly in March as we said, we got an early Easter, so we probably know more by the time we come through April, but as far as the front-end certainly as Wade said, we are focused on shifting that promotional strategy from (inaudible) to some of the new media opportunities. And I think we\u2019re working to balance both traffic and basket size. I think certainly we want to have both \u2013 as I said we are lapping to change in that new strategy beginning actually last month, but we are focused now on really reinvesting some of that margins that we are picking up from a private brand from our Balance Rewards program to focus on traffic.", "So we want a little more balance going forward and we think we should be able to achieve that. Whether that\u2019s in the fiscal year or not, we don\u2019t want to give guidance, but we think we can achieve that.", "John E. Heinbockel \u2013 Guggenheim Securities", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Matthew J. Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "", "Thanks a lot and good morning. A couple of questions, first of all, if you think about the cadence of Express reclination, talk about all the progressing relative to your planning, given that you\u2019re almost through the first 90 day cycle of the calendar year, what kind of build you think you might see beyond the calendar first quarter.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah, Matt again we kind of focus on comps versus just the Express Scripts, but I think we\u2019re good about our comps and the win back we\u2019re seeing. I think that it certainly is to the earlier call, the macro environment February is tightened up a little bit post Boots events, but I think we feel very good with where we are, we\u2019re on track, and we feel good about our pharmacy comps going forward.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "", "Apart from being able to, we continue to win back that business which we are, we also feel very good about the ability to keep growing this proportionally our share of Part D, we were \u2013 go ahead I\u2019m sorry, Matt.", "Matthew J. Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "", "No you just go ahead Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think we\u2019re just seeing very nice gains, we are expecting those continue to grow throughout the year as people switch into a preferred plan with Walgreens.", "Matthew J. Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood, just a quick follow-up question on the Amerisource deal, if you think about the investments you make down the road, what were the cash needs to be able to fund those, and what\u2019s your expectation for how you pay for it.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well over the next immediate period we have the ability to purchase up to 7% and that will be at the market price, so that will be whatever it will be. As I said before though the fact that both Walgreens and Alliance Boots we have been exceeding our cash flow targets, and we believe that we will over that period be able to continue to exceed, and in fact still be on track with $11 billion net debt or better even with that investment the warrants will be a separate investment, when you got the strike prices, and you\u2019ve got the time and again we have the right to purchase those, but not the obligation so if we go down the road here we can reassess what makes sense at that time.", "Matthew J. Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So most likely, cash on hand and incremental free cash flow or would you see, it\u2019s going back to the debt markets to the bank line to fund this at all?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I think we can do it internally, at least for the first piece 7%?", "Matthew J. Fassler \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co.", "Good morning. Two questions for you, first of all, Greg you\u2019ve commented a little bit, of the evolving front-end and certainly I understand what you\u2019ve done over the last year, but curious how the front-end strategy is evolving with regards to promotions also curious in terms of the new store format, what the strategy is in terms of what we made out broadly, obviously we\u2019ve had a change in merchandise leadership or going through that right now. But give us an update of how all of those debts are evolving?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah, Eric. Maybe, I\u2019ll start with your last one first. As far as the change in the leadership, certainly our strategy has not changed, will not change. We feel very good with our well experienced format as you referred to; we\u2019re in over 400 stores. We\u2019re certainly still in pilot learn and enhance, but we feel good with, how we\u2019re going forward with that the customer response, which is kind of the leading indicator is very good, which tells us that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.", "There are a lot of things that we feel very good about, they\u2019re working well. There are some things we want to continue to tweak, but I think you\u2019ll see that continue to evolve and expand. as far as our front-end, I think we feel very good with the adjustments and the opportunities that we have, Eric, as I said before, a shift from primarily print, advertising and a lot of spend in that area to leverage and utilize more digital media in our Balance Rewards program, that\u2019s a big strategic shift. We actually feel good as far as how we move. But there is opportunity to look at ways to reinvest on that margin that we have, to make sure that we continue to focus on driving traffic and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I think the luxury we have is the fact that our private brand strategy is doing extremely well, which is obviously delivering margin that we generally invest.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co.", "And then secondly with the ABC deal this morning, obviously you\u2019ve got a lot going on with Boots especially with on the purchasing side, and I am just curious how you\u2019re going to balance the effort with ABC along with combining those two businesses. It seems you put a lot on your plate especially within purchasing before we think of these other things. Can you talk a little bit about the bandwidth to execute on what becomes sort of a growing list of things to get accomplished?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah, I think it is a fair question. In fact that we believe that actually it will become easier for us as Wade said, we\u2019re actually moving from three to (inaudible) down to one, but I think when we look at certainly our three key objectives, I think we have a real focus in the organization in driving those three key objectives. I think secondly with our partnership with Alliance Boots, and where we are and being on track with that, we feel good there.", "I think when we began to explore our strategic opportunities for our US supply chain with our exploration of our contract we looked at a lot of different options. And frankly this was the most compelling strategic and financial option that we had. And with AmerisourceBergen\u2019s expertise, Alliance Boots\u2019 expertise, we actually think it can enhance our supply chains and frankly simplify and ease some of the work that we\u2019ve been doing in the past with self distributing.", "And so we have also established our JVs and our collaborative efforts in bringing them into the fold as a partner that is really, I would argue was not more work, it\u2019s just going to complement and augment what we are already doing.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Co.", "Thank you.", "Greg D.

LLC", "Of the transaction with AmerisourceBergen and how this works for the Boots side of things, and then if you are shifting to more generic sourcing, doesn\u2019t this kind of get entangled with that synergy target that you have laid out? And it sounds like your goals here are not incremental to or they are incremental to the synergy targets you have given us, maybe explain how that interaction works for the generics?", "Greg D. Wasson", "They are incremental and with respect to the international collaboration, efficiency work for example, our JV and our employees there will be working with AmerisourceBergen people, and again we expect incremental benefits for both us and for them and our benefits will be spilt with our partners; Alliance Boots and separately on the other global work. the Alliance Boots folks are working with them to identify various opportunities, whether it would be expansion of specialty overseas, [3PO], free wholesaling and others and we fee there is a lot of opportunities overtime, and as those get more firmed up, I am sure we will share more details.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And just on a separate topic, how do you expect the script gains from the preferred Part D networks to really start to build as the year progresses, and how much were they on the quarter for script volume?", "Greg D. Wasson", "We haven\u2019t dissected the quarter, but we did see nice gains in January as people switched into plans where Wallgreens isn\u2019t preferred, and what we usually see, we saw the year prior is that throughout the year as Part D people are made aware the benefits they can get by going to a preferred pharmacy within that network. We tend to see gains all year long as well. I have to mention the 12,000 people a day which are entering into Part D and getting into a plan, and hopefully disproportionately into a plan that has Wallgreens and/or is preferred by us.", "Mark Wiltamuth \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co.

Your line is open.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, I\u2019m trying to understand sort of the mechanics of the relationship with AmerisourceBergen, are they going to take over operating your distribution centers, will those distribution centers ever support their independent or other customers I mean, are you really merging the two supply chain networks or is it not going to be like that?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Reflectively they may be like some of our generic distribution assets, but they will get the large benefits by integrating broadly into their supply chain, a lot of our distribution centers have a generic distribution upon in our front-end components, so we\u2019ve got actually lots of volumes still there, and a lot of opportunities to reallocate resources, but broadly they will be taking this volume into their system to get the full scale and efficiencies, and be able to deliver three lines of business task versus just one prior or three lines from three different distributors to include ourselves as one.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "It sounds like they were very anxious to do this business, obviously there were many, many layers and pieces to the benefits of this, it\u2019s all very interesting, and just talking about the most supply chain contract, it seems like because you have been shipping generic drugs on your own trucks for your shipping front-end products, isn\u2019t it just less efficient for them to be the one that ships that product.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Well Meredith it\u2019s Greg, keep in mind that they deliver daily, which is obviously it improves the service level that we have in our sources we go direct in most cases once a week, I think that the opportunity, think about it this way, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen are experts in pharmaceutical supply chain distribution. We\u2019re very good at it, but the combination of what they both do to improve our supply chain, take that off of our hand and improve our service levels is really the opportunity that we\u2019re excited about.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "And it\u2019s they can probably do \u2013 rather than do brand deliveries and separate from our generic deliveries, they can tolerate brand generic and on specialty into one shipment, which has lots of positive implications for us and lot of efficiencies and aggregate for every one.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right.

Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "I have a question for you related to this along with the original synergy target with Alliance Boots; I think it was kind of ask maybe, kind of different way still kind of unclear to me, practically how does this impact the cap share of the generic procurement synergy that you actually talked about. I\u2019ve asked that question because you had control, I guess in the past right over your own generic purchasing, you\u2019re going to combine that with Alliance Boots, and it\u2019s clear as to how you benefit from that scale. But I think you\u2019re transferring that control to a more synergy\u2019s program, it\u2019s just unclear to me, how all this is going to work and how it flows through into the income statement of the companies.", "Wade D.

And we do see that these benefits are going to be incremental the components for us, but also incremental to them. And so again, we will maintain control on this, a lot of those benefits on our side will flow through our JV structure, which then gets split, and then cycles a little bit because of the 45% ownership that we have in Alliance Boots, but at the end of the day, we will see that this will bring incremental value for us and clearly incremental value to AmerisourceBergen as well.", "Greg D.

Miquelon", "Well, there is upside to the synergy target. Commercial agreement is very separate. The commercial agreement stands on its own.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Compared to a distribution agreement and we feel that it\u2019s a good agreement and better than we have today for a lots of reasons not only costs but will be service level, the deliveries it\u2019s also a market fair and good deal for AmerisourceBergen. And again by having going from effectively three distributes to one, it provides opportunities for both parties to gain. But this agreement is really separate from that.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just one other question for you; on SG&A, this quarter a little bit higher than we thought it was going to be. If we and you have been talking in the past, Wade about looking at your stacks, so if we think about to your stack today and we carried out forward to the second half. It looks like you could see SG&A dollars up like 9% plus. So I guess the first question is that, right, the right way to think about it. And then secondly, if that is right, can you still grow gross profit dollars faster than that in the back half?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yeah. A couple of things; one is our SG&A this quarter had some, outside of what we can call adjusted have some anomalies. We had some further investments in loyalty, we had some from M&A which adds SG&A on top of that from a growth point of view, but sheer gross profit as well and then there was actually some other one-time items there we didn\u2019t call out, so we actually felt pretty good about our SG&A this quarter. I think the thing to look at is, the SG&A versus gross profit dollar growth, which both, gross profit dollar becomes easier in the back-end too. So it\u2019s that spread separately, our sustainable model has always been to have kind of organic SG&A growth of 3.5% to 4.5% on any period, 1.5% to 2% that\u2019s driven by new stores. And I think on a two-year stack basis over time, that models will still be as relevant as the one before.", "Edward J. Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Thanks, Ed.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thanks and good morning.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Good morning, Andy.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Good morning too. Kind of piggyback on Meredith\u2019s question, just logistically, over time with the AmerisourceBergen contract, is there still going to be some cross-docking of branded drugs or are they going to basically over time be going to Walgreen stores directly on a daily basis?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Yeah. Andy, let me go on to the stores on a daily basis, that\u2019s a big part of the opportunity as the improved service levels frankly and over time, I think also as Wade mentioned, certainly if there\u2019s opportunity to leverage some of the space that we have in the DC, that\u2019s committed to pharmacy warehousing. It also frees up capacity with our existing distribution centers for our front-end products as well. But yeah, we\u2019ll be leveraging their ability to come to the stores on a daily basis.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And the second part of that question is, daily delivery really from my view, can really increase your in-stack rates particularly around specialty drugs. So can you discuss what the long-term, as more of the pharmaceutical market and the value of the pharmaceutical market moves to specialty drugs? Is that sort of the underlying or part of the underlying reason for this agreement long-term strategically?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Loved that question, Andy, yes. I think that the opportunity to leverage that daily delivery for all medications, but even in particular high cost specialty medications. So that patient\u2019s can access their trusted community pharmacists as they have known for years to pick up a special message, a huge opportunity. One of the things that really excites me, intrigues me is obviously of the wholesalers in the U.S., AmerisourceBergen absolutely elites in specialty sector. So we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to work together to provide new and innovative solutions for specialty. The other thing that\u2019s intriguing with AmerisourceBergen is their focus on health systems and in patient\u2019s meds in fact, as you know, we\u2019re working a lot of major health systems without patient pharmacy as well. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunities along those lines, Andy.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. And just lastly, shifting to the kind of the Balance Rewards program and the membership strong numbers, what can you talk about usage rates and other trending versus expectations and just a color around that, it\u2019s a very ambitious program, not just for Walgreens but I think what we\u2019ve seen in the country?", "Greg D. Wasson", "", "Yeah. I mean I think we\u2019ve been, I guess it\u2019s really been a heavy ramp up base with more than 60 million members in very large, let\u2019s say majority of our sales now on the card, it\u2019s really that investment phases, as they are long, the magic now comes with redemption. And that we have a critical math that people signed up or a critical math of purchases, people are getting significant number of points that they can use. It becomes about redemption turning now to delay. And that\u2019s what I think, Greg, we\u2019re running the online promotion. But to some extent to we\u2019re also exiting the build phase on loyalty. And that\u2019s why we see that as a win going forward.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yeah, Andy, Wade in here, I think of this as obviously a new currency that it takes a while for people to understand the value of that and as they build points and then begin to redeem them, they begin to understand the value of that currency especially in the economic climate like we have today. And that\u2019s where we are beginning to see gaining momentum and we feel will really help us with the traffic in the front-end as we go forward.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Okay. I mean because a lot of the behavior you\u2019re trying to get is lot towards like accumulate the points as to get, people to buy a certain product, and that is a different kind of modality I think than a typical loyalty card. And so that\u2019s what I was asking, is that on trend or the CPG partners getting what they want out of that, whether it\u2019s trail of a new product, or that\u2019s what I was asking may be, shed some light.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Again like anything obviously there is some learning and start-ups that what I would say is that the loyalty card holders are \u2013 the feedback is very, very positive in terms of the program and increasing the ability to understand it. So I think we feel that we\u2019re in a very good spot there. As we continue to tweak and refine in terms of what will motivate people, how do we make the CPG dollars, and others, and money go as far as possible. In fact there are some refining and tweaks but I think directionally we are on a good track and we know where we\u2019re going to take this over time.", "Greg D. Wasson", "And specifically to your question, Andy, we\u2019re encouraged by the basket size unless that we\u2019re seeing with lot of the floating numbers.", "Andrew P. Wolf \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets", "Thank you.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, thanks very much. And good morning.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Good morning.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I just had two quick questions. First, just wondering Wade, was there any benefit in the quarter to gross margin from your purchasing synergies now that you have the purchasing alliance with Alliance Boots?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, there is about $25 million of total combined synergies of which the purchasing piece was a big piece right, and of course without all the nuance detail on the form because of our JV and because of our present ownership whatever, it\u2019s a little complex in terms of how it flows right back to the company. So yes, there was, again, we have $100 million to $150 million run rate this quarter. Again, I guess that was sort of $25 million, that\u2019s building very quickly. So we expect a very nice pickup here in the back half. In part, because there is the P&L timing, when we get the cash benefit, it\u2019s different from some of those that actually flows through our inventory and through our accounting.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then my second question has to do with ACA, as we start thinking about exchanges and calendar 2014 and we think about relationships with exchanges. Can you talk about how you anticipate those will be set up to you? Will the rates be the same as we see in commercial markets? So therefore, if you have a relationship with a large managed care entity it will just get the increase in that volume. It would be my first question. And then secondly, what are your thoughts and anticipation around Medicaid, whether it\u2019s fee-for-service Medicaid or direct Medicaid increases and what that will do for reinvestment as we start thinking about 2014?", "Greg D. Wasson", "Lisa, I think a lot of that certainly is unknown at this time, although we\u2019re beginning to see things take shape. I believe that the first half it\u2019s really community pharmacy has and we\u2019re certainly looking forward to do as to help people understand, educate and navigate to help the government locate folks who are eligible. I think secondly as far as participation in networks, I think you\u2019ll see all the above. I think you\u2019ll see some preferred networks like you are with Medicaid Part D. Then certainly we want to leverage our existing relationships with to participate. Medicaid, I think with the expansion in Medicaid, we\u2019re interesting to see how states respond. I think in fact see maybe \u2013 potentially you may see more move into managed plans. But there again, I think we intend to work with them in whatever way or former fashion they\u2019re looking to go forward with its preferred opportunity or not, at least one (inaudible) at the ACA it\u2019s even though a lot of it\u2019s unknown, it\u2019s kind of unfolding before eyes. I think there\u2019s really two positive dynamics embedded in it for us as a community pharmacy.", "Number one is the fact that similar to Medicare Part D, individuals want to go where they want to go, and so when there is a dynamics that allows people to choose what they want, we typically more times in that are able to be a provider to people that want to go to Walgreen.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Greg D. Wasson", "That\u2019s a good dynamic. I think the second thing is by the nature of this overtime, we\u2019ll be looking to reduce the overall cost of healthcare for the patients and community pharmacy, being more generic utilization, be it for preventing things that we can do on the front line, screenings, compensations, a variety of things, we will deliver for that. So we can \u2013 we will expect to be fairly compensated for what we do because the levers that we can pull to reduce the overall cost of that are significant well beyond just the cost of the drug.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Secondly\u2026.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Kelly, I think both the plans and the government understands that finding, educating this population to help them find plans that work for them is going to be even more difficult than the seniors.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And in\u2026", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Okay, go ahead.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Am I also correct though Wade and Greg in thinking about this that you have leverageable fixed cost today that you probably have excess capacity in most of your stores, but this should be all of this increase in volumes, there shouldn\u2019t be a lot of incremental cost on your side to bring these on, and therefore if the pharmacy of choices is Walgreens that you\u2019re going to see this increase in volumes without a lot of increase in cost of finding the patients and ringing them on the doors, is that the right way to think about it?", "Greg D. Wasson", "", "I think to some degree that\u2019s true, I thought you\u2019re going to say, are we looking into variable pricing, and the answer is no but yeah, for sure, some will be incremental, but also there will also be some shipments of those from mid and small employers maybe others that chose to go in different way and push people to exchanges and from that managed points by zero some gains.", "Lisa C. Gill \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. I appreciate the comments.", "Greg D. Wasson", "Thanks Lisa.", "Operator", "That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Rick Hans for any closing statements.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was the final question. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder the company will report March sales on Wednesday, April 03.

Welcome to our third quarter conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, our president and CEO; and Wade Miquelon, executive vice president, CFO and president, international will discuss the quarter. Also joining us on the call are Kermit Crawford, president of pharmacy, and Mark Wagner, president of store operations.", "As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our website at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information.

Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today I\u2019ll begin with the highlights of our results for the quarter. Second, I\u2019ll update the steps we\u2019re taking to improve our daily living business, expand our role in the changing healthcare system, and advance our long term strategic growth drivers. Then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wade for a more in-depth look at our results and key considerations for the remainder of the year.", "We recognize our business has become more complex, with a number of moving parts, and we do want to help you get to the underlying performance of our business as we remain confident in our long term strategic direction. Starting with our financial results, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.85 and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.65.", "In the quarter, along with Alliance Boots, we announced a strategic long term relationship with AmerisourceBergen, one of the largest pharmaceutical supply chain companies in America. Through this relationship, we have formed a collaborative, integrated wholesale retail model here in the U.S., with a 10-year comprehensive primary distribution agreement for our branded and generic products.", "Combined with our partnership with Alliance Boots, Europe\u2019s leading fully integrated wholesale retail model, we are now best positioned to drive efficiency and innovation throughout the entire pharmaceutical supply chain, harnessing the benefits of global sourcing and making it easier for manufacturers to bring products to market and providing patients with better access to healthcare.", "Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, with $1.1 billion in free cash flow, which is one of our strongest quarters for both. Earlier this month, we launched the Boots No 7 men\u2019s product line in more than 5,000 stores across the country. We\u2019ve already introduced with great success the No 7 women\u2019s skincare line and other Boots products in four of our flagship locations, with more expansion planned.", "And finally, our joint synergy program with Alliance Boots is meeting our expectations. We\u2019re on track to deliver $125 million to $150 million in combined synergies, compared to our previous target of $100 million to $150 million.", "Now let me walk through our quarterly results on a GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted basis. Sales came in at $18.3 billion, up 3.2%, from the same quarter a year ago. GAAP operating income for the quarter was $991 million, up 13.5% from $873 million for the same period last year.", "Non-GAAP adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 22.9% from just over $1 billion in third quarter 2012. GAAP net earnings for the quarter were up 16.2%, from $537 million, or $0.62 per diluted share last year to $624 million, or $0.65 per diluted share.", "The non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for this quarter were a record $812 million, or $0.85 per diluted share compared to adjusted net earnings of $628 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.", "Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars, in the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, our gross profit dollar growth increased 4.1%, or $208 million from a year ago. SG&A dollar growth increased 5.3%, or $221 million, compared to a year ago.", "Now, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased $268 million, or 5.3% year over year. Non-GAAP adjusted SG&A dollar growth was up $182 million, or 4.5%. During the quarter, the rate of growth in adjusted FIFO gross profit dollars exceeded adjusted SG&A dollar growth by 80 basis points. You can see this was the first positive spread in six quarters, and we\u2019re pleased that this is moving in the right direction.", "Now let me update our progress on the three key strategic growth drivers we put in place last year to position our company for long term growth and value creation. First, on creating a well experience, while we\u2019re seeing several positive indicators in our daily living business, such as increases in customer delight, basket size, and gross margins, our front-end sales and traffic are still not up to our expectations.", "There are certainly factors that affected our results this quarter. As with other retailers, the weather had a negative impact on seasonal sales in the third quarter. We also continue to face a soft economy, especially in our lower income communities, where our stores, on a comp basis, are performing on average below our stores in middle or higher income neighborhoods.", "That said, we\u2019re taking steps to balance our investment in sales and margins. We\u2019re focused on a clear three-point plan. First, we\u2019re making further adjustments to our pricing and promotions, implementing a number of meaningful changes to our weekly ad. As you know, we began those changes in mid-May, and you\u2019ll see more throughout the fourth quarter.", "We\u2019re applying what we\u2019re learning from our Balanced Rewards program to ensure we have the items that are most relevant to our customers, in both assortment and price, to meet their daily living needs.", "Second, we\u2019re focused on maximizing the value of our Balanced Rewards program. With 75 million people signed up, we\u2019re turning our focus from enrollment to redemption and rewards. For example, as shoppers earn points, we\u2019re highlighting the dollar value of points earned in both our stores and in our circulars.", "Third, we\u2019re enhancing our store segmentation to better meet the local needs and preferences of our communities, whether they\u2019re in the intercity, suburbs, or rural communities. We\u2019re customizing our advertising circular according to individual community needs, especially in the hardest-hit communities where our customers are working hard to stretch their paychecks. We\u2019re also working to ensure we have the right products and targeted promotions in our communities across the country.", "I can assure you that improving our front end is a high priority, and I am confident that the team\u2019s plans will strengthen performance and drive profitable growth over time. And in fact, we\u2019re beginning to see just that. We reported a positive front-end comp this quarter, with progress over the previous quarter. We\u2019re also beginning to see sequential improvements in market share over recent periods.", "Finally, our flagship locations continue to give us a platform for innovation and to showcase the best of our brand. This quarter we opened flagships stores in the Empire State Building in New York City; Washington, DC; Boston; and San Francisco, bringing our total to 10 across the country.", "Now, turning to our second strategic growth driver, transforming the role of community pharmacy, here we\u2019re beginning to hit on all cylinders. Our script comp for the quarter was 7.1%, compared to 5.7% in the second quarter. We gained 80 basis points in market share, from 18.4% to 19.2%. 90-day prescriptions continue to grow, increasing 19% year over year, while IMS continue to report slowing growth of mail.", "All this comes in an environment where physician visits are down 2.7% year over year in May, according to JPMorgan\u2019s monthly tracker, and this follows year over year declines February through April.", "With that said, we\u2019re positioned extremely well to continue driving market share and profitable growth. First, we now have long term contracts with predictable rates in place with many of the major commercial payers in the market.", "Second, we\u2019re capitalizing on our preferred position in Med D plans. Our increase in Medicare Part D volume has exceeded the market every month since January. And with 10,000 people turning 65 every day, and signing up for coverage, we have tremendous opportunity to continue growing our volume over time.", "Third, with healthcare reform moving forward, Walgreens, with our 8,000 locations and 70,000 healthcare professionals, is increasingly well-positioned to meet the growing demand for convenient, affordable, non-emergency care.", "During this quarter, we announced that most of our more than 370 Take Care clinics now offer an expanded scope of healthcare services. These new services include diagnosis, treatment, and management for hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and asthma, as well as additional preventative health services.", "We\u2019re also moving forward with expanded plans to play a central role in emerging care models such as Accountable Care organizations. With our leading role in 3 ACOs, and our strategy to service many others, patients, providers, and payers are recognizing the value of community pharmacy as part of the solution to meet the triple aim of improving the patient experience, driving better health outcomes, and lowering overall healthcare costs.", "Regarding our third strategic growth driver, establishing an efficient global platform, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with our strategic partnerships with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, which collectively are creating an unmatched global pharmacy supply chain.", "First, on AmerisourceBergen, our teams are on track to ensure a smooth transition of our branded goods distribution on September 1, and the transition of generics over the next 12 months. With these relationships, we\u2019re piloting new delivery models with our stores to optimize frequency and putting in place new inventory management processes and metrics to improve local assortments.", "Second, as I mentioned, we\u2019re meeting our expectations for Alliance Boots synergies. We\u2019re on course to deliver $125 million to $150 million in combined first year synergies. Alliance Boots contributed $0.10 per diluted share to our adjusted results this quarter, and we expect the contribution to be $0.08 per diluted share to fourth quarter adjusted results.", "Finally, we\u2019re pleased with Alliance Boots\u2019 performance in their fiscal 2013. As I am sure you saw, trading profit was up 7.4% in constant currency, underlying profit after tax was up 12.7%, cash generated from operations was UK1.6 billion, and they reduced their net borrowings by UK1.1 billion.", "So summing up, we have worked hard over the past year to crystalize our strategies and ensure we have the growth drivers in place to support long term value creation for Walgreens and our shareholders. We\u2019re now focused on the execution that will propel both day to day performance in the short term and the growth we expect over the next two to three years.", "Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I will take you through our quarterly results, as well as update you on our investment in Alliance Boots. As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.65 per diluted share, based on 959 million shares.", "This GAAP EPS bridge to the adjusted EPS of $0.85 for the quarter is illustrated by this chart, with a LIFO provision of $0.08 per share; acquisition-related items of $0.12 per share, consisting of $0.05 of acquisition-related amortization costs, $0.02 of acquisition-related cost, and $0.05 of Alliance Boots step one related tax deferral.", "Special items netted to zero cents per share, with $0.05 related to the DEA settlement, offset by the $0.05 related to the warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen. As you can see, the settlement with the DEA we announced earlier this month is treated as a special item. This settlement reflects the final reserve accrual as well as some tax impacts related to the terms of the final settlement.", "Looking back on the first two quarters of fiscal 2013, prior accruals related to this matter had an adverse impact of around $0.03 per share in Q2 and certain litigation matters, including an accrual related to the DEA matter, and had a positive net impact of around $0.02 per share in Q1. These items are reflected in both our reported GAAP and adjusted earnings in the first two quarters, and were not treated as special items.", "Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 2%. Comp front-end sales increased 0.4%. Total comp sales increased 1.4%, and comp prescriptions filled increased to 7.1%, versus a script comp of negative 9.1% in the year ago period.", "With respect to our front end, in the third quarter the front end comp increased 0.4%, and traffic decreased by 3.9%, while basket size increased by 4.4%. We see stable front end margins in the challenging promotional environment. As Greg discussed prior, moving forward, we are increasing our ads and promotional focus concurrent with other initiatives intended to increase store traffic. Still, we will continue to work to strike the optimum balance between sales and profitable growth, as our underlying front end business continues to make progress.", "Looking at comp store script numbers, our retail comp scripts were up 7.1%. This continues to reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business, our win back of express scripts customers, and our continued progress in winning new Medicare Part D customers.", "Turning now to margin, our FIFO gross margin was 29.2% in the current quarter, compared to 28.6% last year, a 60 basis point improvement. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of the ongoing impact from generics, and the increase is partially offset by market reimbursement pressure and the continued growth of our 90-day retail program.", "The front end was positively impacted by candy, non-prescription drugs, and personal care categories, which is partially offset by costs associated with points earned from the Balanced Rewards program.", "Taking a look at our longer term FIFO gross margin trends, this quarter\u2019s 60 basis point improvement was up against a 30 basis point increase a year ago. The continuing generic wave, which temporarily peaked last quarter, was the primary driver of margin lift in this quarter.", "Moving forward, we expect margins to be negatively impacted by a trough in the generic wave, expected to continue until the latter half of fiscal year 2014, when we expect to experience another peak in the wave, albeit smaller than the fiscal year \u201913 peak. And again, as I mentioned, the front end was slightly positive for the quarter.", "Margins may also be impacted as we become more directed with our new promotion and pricing initiatives to drive traffic and front end comps. As I will illustrate in a few minutes, and as we have stated on many occasions, we are more focused in driving gross profit dollar growth than margin growth.", "This chart illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters. Now let\u2019s review the trends on an adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago, with 2.3% growth in the third quarter of 2013, down from 5.1% last year. This is certainly the lowest two-year stack we have had in recent history.", "To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our reported SG&A dollar growth was 5.3%, which included 60 basis points for the DEA legal settlement and 20 basis points of acquisition-related costs. Backing these out resulted in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 4.5%.", "Showed here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past seven quarters, on a GAAP basis, and the follow-on slide shows the trends on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, the adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 4.5% year over year increase versus the 2.2% decrease in the third quarter of fiscal 2012.", "Looking at adjusted SG&A dollar growth on a two-year stack basis, as you can see, there was a 560 basis point sequential step down from the second quarter of 2013. We are pleased with the SG&A dollar growth in the quarter, especially given the very tough compare in the year ago period, when we were not an express scripts pharmacy network.", "Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past seven quarters on a GAAP basis. Adjusted gross profit daily growth increase from positive 4% in the second quarter of 2013 to a positive 5.3% in the third quarter of 2013. The positive trend in domestic gross profit dollar growth is the result of the underlying strength of the business, combined with the generic drug benefit.", "On a two-year stack basis, gross profit dollar growth stepped down sequentially as we lapped a 2.5% decrease from the prior year\u2019s third quarter when we were out of the express scripts network. Also recall the second quarter benefited from stronger generic [wave] and an unusually strong flu season.", "Looking more broadly at our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $120 million versus $50 million a year ago, driven primarily by significantly higher prescription drug inflation in the quarter. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 3.5%, up from 2.5% a year ago.", "Net interest expense was $50 million, up from $17 million a year ago, and the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the $4 billion note issued in association with the Alliance Boots transaction. But it also includes the $7 million noncash expense through a fair market value adjustment to the company\u2019s outstanding interest rate swaps.", "Our effective tax rate was 38.7%, versus 37.2% last year, primarily due to the nondeductible nature of the DEA settlement. Average diluted shares outstanding were 959 million shares, versus 865 million shares last year.", "The change is due to a combination of the impact of the 83.4 million shares issued due to the Alliance Boots investment and the impact of a higher stock price in the money options counted in diluted shares. This options impact increased our diluted share count sequentially by 5.6 million shares in the third quarter.", "In order to give some perspective on Q4, please note the following: We expect the LIFO provision in the fourth quarter to be approximately $85 million. We expect net interest expense to be $57 million to $60 million, including the negative impact of $16 million from a noncash fair market value adjustment to the company\u2019s outstanding interest rate swap.", "Based on the swap accounting treatment we put in place in 2009, when we first swapped our $1.3 billion in notes to floating, we are now reserving the positive accounting impact that has gradually offset interest expense over the past four years. We are very pleased with our hedging strategy, as the floating swaps on our $1.3 billion notes have generated over $100 million in pretax cash savings since 2009.", "Going forward, our true cash interest expense will benefit from our plan repayment of $1.3 billion in notes in August. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 38%, and note our adjusted rate is anticipated to be better due to both the DEA impact as well as the adjustments for Alliance Boots benefit not captured by our effective GAAP rate.", "And finally, we expect diluted shares outstanding to remain around 950 million shares, but as mentioned, it is subject to the impact of changes in our share price. And lastly, please keep in mind that we provide monthly sales on third business day of each month, so we kindly ask that you remember to update your models for actual sales at the end of each quarter.", "Cash and cash equivalents were $3 billion in the third quarter, versus $2 billion a year ago. $1.3 billion of this cash is earmarked to retire outstanding debt due in August 2013. Net working capital decreased by 2% versus a year ago. Accounts receivable increased by 5.4%, while accounts payable increased 2.2%. And LIFO inventories were down 1.8% and FIFO inventories were up 2.9% year over year versus the sales growth of 3.2%.", "During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations, versus $1.9 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion versus $1.5 billion a year ago, and roughly $300 million of this year over year difference was driven by the timing shift in our annual profit share plan payment. As a company, I think you can see we remain very focused on cash flow.", "Let me transition now to our accretion to adjusted EPS for the quarter as a result of our partnership with Alliance Boots. The third quarter accretion was $0.10 per share, which fell $0.02 to $0.03 short of the $0.12 to $0.13 range we forecasted last quarter.", "To be clear, we are very pleased with both the operational performance of Alliance Boots and the combined synergies we are achieving. As noted, this shortfall is due to a number of non-fundamental factors, primarily the greater than expected impact of IFRS to GAAP conversions.", "We now expect the accretion for the fourth quarter to be about $0.08 per share, which is less than our prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share, with the primary difference driven by the foreign currency translation impact of a slightly weakened pound relative to the dollar in our initial forecast. Consequently, we now estimate the adjusted EPS accretion for the year to be $0.16 rather than the previous estimate of $0.18 to $0.22, primarily for the reasons I just outlined.", "Shifting to our quarterly Alliance Boots accretion [unintelligible], as shown, we realized $28 million before tax and synergies during the third quarter and $25 million after tax. Amortization adjustments amounted to $3 million for the deal amortization and $15 million for brand amortization. After tax, Alliance Boots equity earnings were $131 million for the third quarter on a GAAP basis.", "On an adjusted basis, the income from the Alliance Boots investment was $147 million, as noted, and the incremental after tax interest expense to Walgreens was $13 million. After the impact of share dilution, the accretion equaled $0.10 in the third quarter.", "I\u2019d like to close by reviewing our fiscal [2016] goals: $130 billion of combined revenue, $8.5 billion to $9 billion of combined operating income, $9 billion to $9.5 billion of combined adjusted operating income, $8 billion of combined operating cash flow, a total synergy goal of $1 billion, and $11 billion of combined net debt, all by 2016.", "When analyzing 2016 revenue, adjusted operating income, and cash flow goals, and netting the impact of our stated combined synergy goal of $1 billion, combined CAGRs from the base year of 2012 through our goal year of 2016 would need to be 5% for revenue, 9% for adjusted operating income, and 4% for cash flow in order to reach our goals.", "To the extend we end up exceeding or falling short of our combined synergy goals, CAGR required to meet our 2016 goals will be impacted accordingly. With respect to synergies, we are off to a good start on our 2016 goals, and as we noted earlier, we are nearly in the range of combined synergies for the fiscal year 2013 to $125 million to $150 million, from the previous range of $100 million to $150 million.", "Each of the six primary synergy work streams are producing results, and we are confident we are on the right track to now meet our fiscal year 2014 synergy objectives. Also recall that Alliance Boots retired $1.7 billion in debt in their fiscal year ended March 2013, exceeding their goal of $1 billion.", "As I mentioned earlier, we are planning to retire $1.3 billion in Walgreens debt in August. As we progress, once a year, on a quarterly earnings call, we plan on going into a deeper dive on our 2016 goals, with respect to our progress, our risks, and the opportunities across each of these measures.", "We remain confident with respect to our strategic long term relationship with AmerisourceBergen as well, and our core work streams are progressing and are on track. In addition to the planned domestic supply, sourcing, and international opportunities and benefits, we continue to identify areas where all three partners can work together to build on capabilities and competencies.", "Now, in closing, let me share a few final thoughts. I realize that in the past few years, we\u2019ve made several strategic and transformational moves that at times make our company more than challenging to model. Having said that, I\u2019d like to talk a bit about how we think about our business.", "At a strategic level, we have continued to refine our journey across three key planks and several related initiatives that we expect to greatly enhance our customer experience, allow us to participate profitably and more broadly in the challenging healthcare landscape, and let us fully leveraged efficiency and scale all the while.", "The groundbreaking and transformational partnerships enhance these strategies, and we believe will enable us to unlock significant value and competitive advantage. Still, I believe we are just scratching the surface of what we can do working together longer term across both the supply chain as well as across geographies.", "Now it all comes down to executing with excellence, as we effectively balance both the long and short term. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some ups and downs along the way, but we remain very confident in our long term strategies and prospects.", "I want to thank you again for your kind attention and support, and now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "I just had a couple of questions on the generic side. Wade, I heard you talk about the $125 million to $150 million of synergies. Can you talk about where you are in this new JV purchasing as far as contracting with the manufacturers and how much of the synergies are coming from that side?", "And then secondly, I think Greg, you talked about market pressure and reimbursement, but on the other hand, you also talked about long term contracts. Where are you seeing the market pressure on reimbursement today? Is that coming from Medicaid? Is it coming from the commercial market? How should we think about that?", "Wade Miquelon ", "I guess the JV first. The JV is up and fully running and operating. We have our two presidents, Jeff Berkowitz and John [Donovan] [ph], who are working one of the key workstreams that\u2019s residing there, our generics. And we\u2019re off to a very good start.", "Without giving information that we consider too competitively sensitive, what I would say is that given the scope and breadth of what we\u2019re doing together, I think we\u2019re working with most of the key manufacturers already, in terms of understanding how we can bring volume benefit to better long term planning and create, I\u2019d say, a real win-win.", "I think that win-win comes, again, because of the size, the scale, and the breadth of the business that we can do with all the key partners that want to partner with us. But we\u2019re off to a good start. It is a significant part of our early synergies, and as I said before, we expect it to be a significant part of the going ones as well. And Greg, I\u2019ll let you comment on\u2026", "Greg Wasson ", "Yeah, on the market pressure on reimbursement. I guess I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one segment. I think we\u2019re seeing reasonable reimbursement pressure and focus from any payer, whether it\u2019s government, commercial, on controlling costs. I think certainly as some states move from state Medicaid to managed Medicaid, you certainly see some movement there.", "But when we look at those commercial arrangements, as we have in the past, we look at the individual plan, and we look at all the variables, whether it\u2019s days of supply, generic utilization rate, and we make our decisions. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one area that we would call out. I think we\u2019re just seeing continues as expected focus on healthcare costs from all payers.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan ", "And Greg, just to follow up on that really quickly, on Medicaid, if we think about the initial impact of the Affordable Care Act, we would expect it\u2019s primarily going to come from Medicaid expansion. Can you talk about, if that\u2019s primarily where it comes from, do you have excess capacity in your stores today so that even if the reimbursement rate is a little bit lower with Medicaid, that you\u2019re going to be able to lever that incremental volume and it should be still a positive as we move into calendar \u201914 for Walgreens?", "Greg Wasson ", "Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d really take it down to the variable labor perspective, but I think with movement from growing Medicaid, whether it\u2019s managed or state, again, I think we look at that as we have any commercial arrangement. In some of those, it depends on the market share and the state that we\u2019re in.", "It depends on, as I said earlier, a lot of these, with more and more folks coming into a Medicaid population that are conducive to, say, 90-day supplies of chronic medications, there\u2019s opportunities for us to work with states in ways we haven\u2019t in the past. There\u2019s ways to work with them to drive adherence.", "So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really whether we have the capacity to make it work. I think it\u2019s really focusing on the reimbursement, the value we bring, to begin with.", "Wade Miquelon ", "Lisa, just one last thing I\u2019d say is bundling the two together, apart from making sure we have the most effective cost buying structure, with respect to things that are happening that we\u2019re doing, like driving 90-day, which I think you can see is really accelerating in terms of some of the automation that\u2019s happening with respect to our stores, and streamlining of the process as well in things like e-prescribe. We\u2019ll continue to find ways to be more efficient and effective on all aspects of cost, which will allow us to play more broadly in the expansion of healthcare and beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets ", "First question was just sort of on the front end. You mentioned some of the pricing and promotional strategies that you\u2019re sort of adjusting. Can you remind us what you\u2019re doing there in terms of the impact we should see, that you had mentioned on the call, sort of gross profit dollars versus gross profit margins?", "Greg Wasson ", "Certainly we\u2019re focused, as we\u2019ve said several times, on gross profit dollars versus margin. And I think what we\u2019re beginning to do, and we talked a little bit probably on the last call, is trying to strike the right balance between price and promotion.", "I think as we talked about, we made a strategic shift when we rolled out our Balanced Rewards program to shift some of our promotional effort and focus from our roto, primary our print circular, to more digital and balanced rewards. I think that absolutely was the right strategic move for us to make.", "Along the way, I think we\u2019ve probably got a little less promotional on that Sunday circular. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re really focused, based on some of the data that we\u2019re getting insights from our Balanced Rewards program, to make sure we\u2019ve got the right items at the right price in that circular to drive comp and traffic.", "This is something you want to tweak that dial ever so slightly, and we feel that we\u2019re making the right adjustments, and we\u2019re beginning to gain some momentum. We want to continue to do that in our Sunday circular and utilize our Balanced Rewards program to continue to move that in the right direction.", "Tom Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets ", "My other question was on the pharmacy side, with respect to specialty. Not so much in the quarter, but obviously all we hear from payers out there is troubles with the specialty trend that are only going to get worse over time. So can you just update us on your latest initiative on the specialty side? So your growth expectations and maybe some of the unique things that you think you\u2019re doing in the marketplace in that area?", "Greg Wasson ", "Great question. I think we have a great position to begin to provide more value to both patients, payers, and pharmaceutical companies as we go forward. We think our differentiating model allows us to focus on what we call specialty retail to make sure the patients are indeed eligible to pick up and receive specialty medications from the retail pharmacists that they\u2019ve been using for years. AmerisourceBergen, the relationship we have with daily deliveries, will help us drive that even greater. We have a central facility that will allow us to either mail to stores or mail directly to the patient\u2019s home based on where they\u2019d like it. We\u2019re really driving sophistication there.", "And finally, our infusion business, we think, is truly a differentiator for us, because as more payers look for a single solution for the pipeline of drugs that are coming out that are either going to be injectable or infused, we think that looking for a one-stop solution that we can offer will help us win in the marketplace.", "Last thing I\u2019d say is Jeff Berkowitz and our team is focused on bringing solutions to the pharmaceutical partners we have, are really working with them in ways to help them launch and drive the value that they\u2019re looking for with their specialty products.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ", "Two things. Greg, when we think about getting the front end traffic back, digging into that a little deeper, how confident are you? Traffic is fairly negative, you obviously don\u2019t want to do 12 packs of Coke for $2, because that really doesn\u2019t accomplish that much. How confident are you that you can do that in a relatively - get back closer to flat in a relatively quick period of time without hurting gross unnecessarily? Do you think it\u2019s kind of a trial here, maybe you go a little too far, hit gross a little bit, and then have to bring it back? Or do you think you can manage it in a more consistent way than that?", "Greg Wasson ", "It\u2019s a great question, and as I\u2019ve said several times, it\u2019s the balance of retail, right? I think our approach, as I said, is going to be a prudent approach to investing where it makes sense in order to get the results. We\u2019re looking for traffic and comp, we\u2019re focused on gross profit dollars, as I said. And I think the adjustments we begin to make, and with our circular in mid-May, as I said, we\u2019re beginning to make progress. I want to continue to take the approach we\u2019re talking about.", "I\u2019m extremely confident that we will continue to make progress and gain momentum in that trend for several reasons. I think our folks are doing the right things with the circular. They\u2019re making the right adjustments.", "As I said, we have a lot of insights now a year in, on the Balanced Rewards, which helps us do a better job of understanding what should we be putting on the front page, the back page, of that circular, at what price, to be able to drive profitable sales? And then also, with 75 million members now enrolled in Balanced Rewards, the insight we have, we\u2019re able to now strategically drive promotions through Balanced Rewards to drive traffic and sales as well.", "And then the third point is - and it\u2019s interesting, I think we have, as you know, a lot of our stores are located in underserved or lower income communities. And one of the things that we have done extremely well in the past, and what we want to enhance, is making sure that we\u2019re tailoring our merchandising mix or price or promotion to those stores.", "All those are in motion. I think we\u2019ve got a great plan, great team, and it\u2019s all about executing. And I\u2019m confident we can do that.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ", "And then secondly, if you look at SG&A run rate, up 4.5% adjusted, you\u2019ve got a lot of the ESRX business back. Are we sort of steady state now? Whatever you were going to add back is added back, and that\u2019s sort of a steady state run rate going forward? Or is there more head to head back?", "Wade Miquelon ", "No, I think I\u2019d say that, because you\u2019re cycling sort of an unusual base period, it looks choppy, but in terms of how we run our business, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty steady state. And we run algorithms every day to understand the incremental line scripts, etc., that we have, and how to tweak labor up or down accordingly. Also, in terms of cycle of express scripts, you know, we have things like a little beefier profit sharing and things like that that are in the underlying base, that are just structural, and the right thing to do. But that gets washed through.", "But I think we\u2019re seeing, in our two year stack right now, I would say really just a lot of great effort and focus on SG&A control. And that\u2019s not going to change. I think moving forward, to be effective and hit our goals, and anyone to be successful, is going to have to have [unintelligible] focused on winning the customer, but also on the cost side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald", "I wanted to ask about your front end performance as well. I think there\u2019s been some mention in the past that there was maybe a more margin driven promotional strategy from last year, which it looks like you\u2019ve fully cycled at this point. So just based on the loyalty card and the high level of enrollment that you have now with the Balanced Rewards card, when do you expect to start getting the customer insights through the loyalty card that would have the effect of increasing customer traffic and higher average ticket?", "Greg Wasson ", "As I said on the earlier question, I think the good thing is we\u2019re getting those insights now. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about having 75 million people already enrolled, and the reason now we begin to not only drive enrollment, but focus on the effectiveness of that program. The insights that we\u2019re getting are frankly just incredible, and will allow us to get more efficiency out of our marketing dollars and our promotional dollars.", "So we\u2019re getting those insights and the data now, to help us continue to drive traffic in a prudent and reasonable way.", "[Mark Wagner]", "Just a couple of factoids. Already about 60% and growing of our purchases made in store are now with the card. We\u2019re seeing a significantly bigger basket of those that have a card versus all others. Now the [unintelligible] as we move forward, longitudinally, to make their baskets bigger than they were prior, and that\u2019s the work to be done.", "So I think as Greg said, in the end, the magic comes from redemption, and building critical mass, critical points, and being able to use that as a lever so people really understand the currency and the value of it is the next phase that we\u2019re just now moving into.", "Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald ", "And just as a related question, I\u2019m assuming that there\u2019s some derivative impact on front end due to the legacy issues with express scripts. So do you think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we\u2019re going to see some improvement in front end when you anniversary the new express scripts agreement in a couple of months?", "[Mark Wagner]", "Yeah, I think as we\u2019ve also said before, every day we\u2019re kind of moving forward and getting more and more express scripts customers back. I think that trend is going to continue. And so I think those two [unintelligible] hand in hand as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ", "Just a little more detail if we could about the components of the change in the Alliance Boots accretion. I know you spoke about the IFRS and then FX. Any way to sort of desegregate those impacts and quantify them?", "Greg Wasson ", "I\u2019m sorry, could you clarify the question?", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ", "If you think about the reduction in the guidance for Alliance Boots, if you could quantify how much is attributed to each of the drivers that you identified?", "Greg Wasson ", "It\u2019s roughly $0.02 in this quarter, thereabouts, which is just IFRS to GAAP conversions. And again, a lot of, until you really get into it and understand things, like how the leases actually work, their retirement programs, etc., you just don\u2019t know until you get into it. So that\u2019s $0.02 in the quarter, and next quarter is roughly about $0.01 of currency. Again, I think it\u2019s about a 152 versus a 158 in the pound. But I think you\u2019ve seen from their annual results that they\u2019ve had, all things considered, in a tough environment, a very successful year. And trading profit and underlying profit are really two measures that they\u2019re focused on.", "Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ", "And just one other follow up, kind of a high-level strategic question. I know we\u2019ve spoken about the Balanced Rewards program already. If you think about the net economic impacts since launch, and when you would expect the program to start to deliver earnings benefits in aggregate, is there any way to kind of identify the timing, if you could simplify it down to that level?", "[Mark Wagner]", "I guess I\u2019d put it this way, because you never really know until you get there, but we were in pretty heavy investment phase last year, not only from the systems, but also in terms of just the employee finance, between 100 and 200 people per store per day, and the effort that takes. And all the while people start building points, but until they actually have enough to redeem, you can\u2019t really use it as a lever. It\u2019s more of just kind of an investment from that point of view.", "We\u2019ve now got critical mass of people enrolled, critical mass of points. We also have critical mass of what I would call data analytics and insights. So I think as we move forward here, we just get progressively better.", "I\u2019d also say that the way we executed it, which was, as I like to say, we put teeth into it by making sure to get our discounts or promotions you need to have the card. In effect, it\u2019s sort of a two-tier pricing system which allows us to generate incremental funds to invest even more heavily in the people that are truly our most valuable and most loyal customers.", "And so economically, I\u2019d say from that point of view, it\u2019s a positive, but I think really the real heart of it kind of starts about now.", "Greg Wasson ", "I think there\u2019s two ways to look at Balanced Rewards. The insights and the data that we are capturing now with the 75 million people is helping us make adjustments that drive even more relevancy with our circular, with the way we merchandise our stores, etc. We\u2019re beginning to use that data now.", "The second part would be as consumers begin to understand the value of the currency and the points, then we begin to get the traffic and the basket and the trips that we want to begin to see out of it. So we\u2019re already beginning to use a lot of the data and the insights to drive decisions across the entire business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "I wondered if you guys could extrapolate maybe more on some of the comments you talked about relative to generics. I think in general there\u2019s a belief that we\u2019ve got a better uptick next year in terms of flow through. The comment that you made in terms of being back in \u201914, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s your fiscal year versus the calendar. So maybe talk a bit about how that differential works and sort of where you\u2019re focused in terms of what\u2019s going to be a bigger contributor from a category perspective or maybe from a specific launch perspective.", "Kermit Crawford", "What I would tell you is that as we look at our fiscal year, our second quarter, our generics peaked in our fiscal year. Certainly we are going to see a trough in the third and fourth quarter as Greg said. But we anticipate a comeback in Q4. We have said in the past that \u201913 would be better than \u201912. We consistently are saying \u201913 better than \u201912, and somewhat a little bit better than \u201914.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group ", "Maybe just on the traffic piece again, I don\u2019t mean to beat a dead horse, but if you look at the components of it in terms of the declines, if you look at it in terms of what you\u2019ve strategic done to improve margins, and what percentage impact you think that\u2019s had versus just kind of the impact of the express lag or anything else going on in the business, is there any way even qualitatively you can kind of compartmentalize how you would think about that metric just so we can kind of assume, as we start lapping it, what traffic could look like on the upswing?", "Wade Miquelon ", "I\u2019ll give you kind of a rough feel. This will be probably close, but not perfect. It\u2019s hard to understand exactly what\u2019s happening, but if you think about that 400 basis point traffic step down we\u2019ve had over the past year, which is now starting to improve, I\u2019d say that a couple of things happened.", "Number one, the express scripts, approximately between 50 and 100 basis points of traffic. As you know, it\u2019s not one for one, they\u2019re separate trips. But that\u2019s kind of the range that we have seen. And so as the customers come back, we see some benefit, but it\u2019s in proportion to that.", "The second thing is the promotional shift we had, which I think was for the right reasons, to keep moving money into more strategic marketing mix, like loyalty, equity building campaigns, probably was around 200-250 points. And again, from a profit point of view, I think the team did a great job of holding margin, but it wasn\u2019t as many hot items at cost or below, but we did see that shift.", "And the last piece is roughly 100 basis points of traffic from cigarettes. And I\u2019d say the primary driver there was we saw $15,000 to $20,000 stores introduce cigarettes. We haven\u2019t seen outside the cigarette category much hit if any at all versus any of our competitors, in the other categories, but I would say that from a traffic driver, we did see something there. So that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019d break it down.", "Greg Wasson ", "And the fourth would be weather related economic, and certainly around that. But I think Wade did a great job of breaking it down.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group ", "And maybe just one last one. You guys have obviously done a lot of interesting strategic things in this phase, for the last 12 to 24 months. Now, with the relationship with Alliance Boots and Amerisource, it seems like the synergy flows through, you guys are actually executing well there. How do you figure out where the synergies get allocated in terms of is this an Alliance Boots synergy? Is this something that Amerisource gets to keep? Is it a corporate lag synergy? How do you sort of figure out what goes into what bucket, just big picture?", "Wade Miquelon ", "With respect to Alliance Boots, we both have our baseline projections of what we think we do otherwise independently. As we work together and drive synergies, effectively we, for the most part, split them.", "And because we have a 45% ownership stake in them, it means that we get our half less their 45, which is 72.5. It\u2019s probably not perfect plus or minus where it goes, but in the end, because we\u2019re ultimately planning on becoming one company, it\u2019s not worth arguing about as much as making sure we maximize them, because in the end it will all go into the same place.", "I think it\u2019s a little more complex with AmerisourceBergen, because we are a small investor, and we plan to just be a partner versus anything grander. So we really have to make sure that we have mechanisms to understand each year not only what is the synergy, but we also have mechanisms in terms of how we equitably share those based upon agreements that we have.", "So we haven\u2019t talked any more about that, but I\u2019d say that they\u2019re a little bit different in the two constructs. But I think that we have pretty good models for understanding what we would do on our own, if not in partner with someone else. And that, for all cases, is using the baseline.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "First, around the sustainability of this improvement in the SG&A stack, you\u2019ve cycled the Balanced Rewards investments [unintelligible]. Was that something that was as meaningful to helping the SG&A improvement? So that would obviously carry forward, right?", "Wade Miquelon ", "We haven\u2019t called out what we did in terms of investing in systems for Balanced Rewards and also for people. I would say it wasn\u2019t not meaningful, but it wasn\u2019t unusually meaningful either. I think the key thing is just if you think back to last September, and all that was going on, not only were we trying to sign up 100 to 200 people a day in loyalty, we were welcoming express scripts customers back. We had all of our competitors that were launching promotional campaigns to try to keep them. This was all in the context of lower overall investment in promotion activity.", "So I think the thing to watch for is, as Greg said, as we sharpen our focus, make incremental investments, where it makes sense to do so, seeing how we round the horn and what that looks like.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "By using the word investment, I meant hard costs going through SG&A. Let\u2019s say programming costs that you couldn\u2019t capitalize. I think you have, at least qualitatively, said that that was\u2026", "Wade Miquelon ", "There was some of that, but I think the bigger thing, as we alluded to a few quarters ago, is we had some SG&A that was attributed to loyalty sign ups, attributed to express welcome backs, and also to Med D signups. There was still a lot going on at the same time, and that really was important, but in some ways a distraction from taking care of the core customer every day.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "The other part on the SG&A, was there anything unusual in some of the major line items that can kind of swing quarter to quarter? You know, sometimes you hear the healthcare costs or worker\u2019s comp was particularly good or bad. Was there anything like that this quarter?", "Wade Miquelon ", "You know, there\u2019s tons of moving parts under the hood in the way they get treated, but I would say there were no anomalies in this quarter really. I think what you pretty much see is our performance exactly kind of as it was. And as I said before, it\u2019s kind of more normalized out now the way we run our business, even in the phase period, and then two periods ago, have anomalies in them.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "Okay, so moving on to gross margin, at least versus my expectations, that\u2019s where things came up wide. And then sequentially, just looking at your FIFO gross margin, the expansion was about half of last quarter\u2019s. And I\u2019ll give you three buckets: Generics, was the sequential contribution less so in generics? Was it you started ramping up promotions? Or was it also just the flu was so profitable? How would you think about sequentially having less gross margin expansion?", "Wade Miquelon ", "You know, there\u2019s probably a little bit of generics. I think you\u2019re right. The flu was a big boost in the prior quarter. But there\u2019s also a lot of other things going on under the hood that you won\u2019t see at the surface. For example, the extent that our pharmacy business outpaced our front end. Our front end has a higher gross margin on average. You get mix effects in that regard. You also have other mix effects from business like specialty that have very little margin, but have had a lot of inflation and therefore to some extent growth.", "So I think the key thing is the way we really run our business. The business model is to try to maximize gross profit dollars. And in the end, even with generics ever increasing, our margins probably over time look good, but if we can\u2019t keep the gross profit dollar engine going, that\u2019s not going to help us. So again, I think there\u2019s just a lot of static. I think you probably hit on some of them, but there are mix effects and other things that can make a difference quarter to quarter too.  ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "And just on the promotional posture of how the company\u2019s going to market, clearly the press release stated that that\u2019s going to increase. Was part of that increase during the quarter? Or is that all post quarter? The increase in promotionality.", "Wade Miquelon ", "[crosstalk] back half of May, we started to make some of the tweaks and modifications. Those will continue. Again, we\u2019re going to be smart about what we do. And we\u2019re a lot smarter now that we have a lot of loyalty data we didn\u2019t have prior.", "Greg Wasson ", "With the lead time in circulars, it\u2019s mid-May by the time [unintelligible] adjustments.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "And just lastly, on this Alliance Boots trend, on expectations, so it\u2019s $0.03 of currency. How much is the [unintelligible] in the IFRS to GAAP?", "Wade Miquelon ", "This quarter we were about $0.02 versus the bottom of our range, and that was really IFRS to GAAP adjustments. So it was really no change in how they view their performance, only a change in terms of, as we get into the methodology and the differences in IFRS and GAAP, knowing those. And the $0.01 of currency we\u2019re predicting for the next quarter. And because there\u2019s a three-month lag, we know a lot about next quarter already. There\u2019s still [unintelligible], and so there can be some final adjustments in IFRS and GAAP. But for the most part, things like currency are baked in, so we know that. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re calling that out.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "So in the current quarter, was there any operational [miss] from Alliance Boots?", "Wade Miquelon ", "No, the current quarter they were pretty much right on path. And I think if you look at their equity income reported, it\u2019s probably pretty close to what we\u2019ve seen on aggregate with what most of the people here on the phone have modeled.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "But it looks like, given the range for your fiscal year, why is there $0.04? If you had explained $0.03, and you had given a $0.02 to $0.06 range for the year, it sounds like you think Boots could either be a penny above plan, or $0.02 below?", "Wade Miquelon ", "No, we\u2019re predicting, I think, $0.08 for the next quarter, and we just said that prior we had thought it would be a little higher than that. And the primary driver of difference is foreign exchange. If you look at this quarter, a couple of things. We don\u2019t obviously manage to consensus. We manage to our internal target.", "And I would say if we look there, probably the front end was the key thing that we were working against from our original projections. But if I look kind of externally, I think a couple of things are happening. One is our tax rate is a bit different than was assumed by many, and there\u2019s a lot of complexity in that tax rate this quarter.", "Second thing is share count. Again, I think there was probably 7 or 8 million shares, or 6 million shares, associated with options. Which sounds like a small number, but it actually does move the needle on an EPS basis.  ", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "So there\u2019s going to be a $0.02 currency hit, based on current currency rates, to your prior expect for the current quarter? Is that right?", "Wade Miquelon ", "In the current quarter we just put out, there\u2019s $0.02 difference, and that was primarily almost all IFRS to GAAP adjustments. For the next quarter, Q4, it would be about a penny, which is all currency. And because we have a three month lag, we effectively already know what the currency will be in three months.", "Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets ", "So for the quarter we\u2019re in, and I guess Boots is reporting on a lag, so you already know how that ended, how was that quarter operationally? Was there a miss? According to this report, the quarter that you\u2019ll be reporting, the Q4 quarter that you\u2019re reporting, I think Boots already concluded, because they\u2019re reporting with a lag, did that meet expectations?", "Wade Miquelon ", "We know a lot, but if we told you, we\u2019d have to kill you. Until we get to next quarter, we can\u2019t divulge that. I think what you did see is as you saw the last fiscal year, for Alliance Boots. So hopefully you have confidence that they\u2019ve run their business very effectively in a very challenging time. I don\u2019t expect that that would change any time soon.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Zach [unintelligible] - Morgan Stanley ", "Hi, this is Zach [unintelligible] for Ricky Goldwasser. I want to ask first real quick about your gross margin progression going forward. I know you\u2019ve talked in quite a bit of detail about some of the headwinds being generics and 90 days at retail and Balanced Rewards. Can you talk about any of the tailwinds that we might be seeing, or that you can talk about at a high level, other than synergies from the Alliance Boots deal?", "Greg Wasson ", "Yeah, I think the tailwinds that we have frankly are the price and promotion, and the adjustments we\u2019re putting into the front end. I think we\u2019ll continue to see more and more people coming in from Medicare Part D plans that we\u2019ve put in place.", "I think with healthcare reform, as we talked about, and millions of people coming in gaining insurance coverage, we\u2019ll begin as a company to benefit from that. I think certainly as we continue to gain strength, certainly with the consumer, I think we\u2019ll see lift in our discretionary categories, which is where we\u2019d see probably the biggest impact.", "So thanks for the question. We do think we have ample tailwinds. We\u2019re really focused on what\u2019s currently in front of us, but we think longer term, and even short term, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity behind us.", "Zach [unintelligible] - Morgan Stanley ", "And then within the quarter you received regulatory approval to start buying shares of ABC. Can you comment on if you\u2019ve started on that, or what your thoughts on that are?", "Greg Wasson ", "We are in the market. We are buying, and beyond that, I can\u2019t say much more.", "Rick Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question.

Today, I\u2019ll begin with highlights of our fourth quarter and fiscal year, next I\u2019ll discuss the substantial progress we made in advancing our three key strategic growth drivers, and finally, I\u2019ll take a look ahead to fiscal 2014.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed financial review of the quarter, our full-year performance and the coming year.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We\u2019re pleased with our solid performance as we posted record adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.73 generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow and a record $785 million in free cash flow. We paid off $1.3 billion of senior notes upon maturity consistent with our debt reduction plan.", "In addition to our strong financial performance, we also made significant strategic gains in the quarter. We introduced Smart90 Walgreens, our 90-day prescription drug program with Express Scripts. The program gets customers the option to receive their maintenance medications through Walgreens retail pharmacy or Express Scripts home delivery. We also announced our agreement to acquire certain assets of Kerr Drug in early September including their 76 retail drug stores in specialty pharmacy business.", "Kerr and its associates will be a great addition to our family of companies. Also in September, we launched another innovation in pharmacies healthcare as we announced our long-term partnership with Theranos to provide new less invasive lab testing services to customers of Walgreen\u2019s. The service is currently available at our Palo Alto, California store and we have plans to expand later this year.", "And finally, we successfully transitioned on September 1, the distribution of our branded pharmaceuticals to AmerisourceBergen executing seamlessly to begin our 10-year strategic relationship. Fiscal 2013 was a year of major strategic progress as we advanced the transformation of our company for long-term sustainable growth and value creation.", "As you know, we worked hard throughout the year to improve our performance in our daily living business and we continue to see growth and strong results in pharmacy and health and wellness. That performance across our business resulted in a record annual sales of $72.2 billion and record annual adjusted earnings per share of $3.12.", "We continue to make progress in our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots achieving $154 million in combined net synergies exceeding our previous estimates of the year of $125 million to $150 million.", "We generated $4.3 billion in operating cash flow and a record $3.1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed more than $1 billion in dividends this year to our shareholders increasing the dividends for the 38th consecutive year. We filled a record 821 million prescriptions for fiscal 2013, representing a retail prescription market share of 19.1% for the year.", "In addition, we made substantial progress on a number of our key initiatives. We launched our Balance Rewards program last September. The program has now become the fastest growing loyalty program in the world with more than 85 million people enrolled to date.", "Alliance Boots has nearly 20 years experience running the leading UK loyalty program and our partnership with them gives us the benefit of their experience, which we will leverage as we continue to enhance our program.", "And finally, with our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots and our long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen, our three companies are best positioned to create a pharmaceutical supply chain unmatched in the world.", "Now I\u2019ll take you through the high level results for the quarter. As always we will be presenting numbers on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. As you saw on our release this morning, we reported fourth quarter sales of $17.9 billion, up 5.1% from $17.1 billion a year ago.", "GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1 billion, up 75.3% from $586 million last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 31.6% from $838 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.39 last year, up 75.9%. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.73, up 15.9% from $0.63 in the same quarter last year. GAAP and adjusted earnings per diluted share both include a positive $0.03 per share net impact from certain litigation matters.", "Turning to our performance for the fiscal year, sales were $72.2 billion compared to $71.6 billion last year, up 0.8%. GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 13.7% from $3.5 billion in fiscal 2012. Adjusted operating income for the year was $4.7 billion compared to $4.1 billion in 2012, up 14.1%. Our full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.56, up 5.7% from $2.42 last year. And on an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share were $3.12, up 6.5% compared to $2.93 last year.", "Looking at our gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth on a GAAP basis, this quarter the spread was $319 million. On an adjusted basis, the spread was $156 million. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased in the quarter by $216 million or 4.3%, we also continued our strong focus on cost control as adjusted SG&A dollar growth rose $60 million or 1.5% in the quarter, which included a 1.1 percentage point net benefit from certain litigation matters.", "Our continued focus on our strategic growth drivers through the quarter in the fiscal year generated results across our business. We continue to create a Well Experience, introducing new products and formats and making other investments in our daily living business. The ongoing innovation in pharmacy and health and wellness continue to change the relationship we have with customers, patients and payers and uplift our market share. And we strengthened ties with our partners Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, bringing us closer to becoming the first global pharmacy led health and well-being enterprise.", "As we create a Well Experience, we are transforming the customer experience across all of our touch points, channels and formats. So we discussed with you at our Analyst Day. We continue to focus in four areas, improving customer value, providing innovative products and services, developing a systematic globalized offering, and designing the most relevant network and formats. Today, I\u2019ll discuss some of the progress we\u2019ve made this year.", "We finished the fiscal year with more than 500 Well Experience stores across the nation, breaking out the traditional drugstore format with cutting-edge design, new assortments and an integrated healthcare offering. We also now have 12 flagships, the ultimate Well Experience store.", "We opened six new flags in fiscal 2017, including in Washington D.C., Boston and San Francisco. In duty, we launched the Boots No7 Women\u2019s Skincare line at the grand opening over 8,000 stores at our Los Angeles flagship. No7 products and Boots Botanic skincare line are now available online and in select flagship locations. In addition, we are rolling out both lines to the Phoenix market by the end of the year.", "We also introduced the Boots No7 men\u2019s product line in stores across the country this summer, as well as two other high profile UK beauty lines, Indeed Laboratories skincare and Mark Hill Hair Care. Our private brands are also giving customers a reason to come to Walgreens. We invested significantly this year in our product lines like Walgreens, Delish, Nice! and Well Beginnings, introducing 400 new items in the fourth quarter and increasing our private brand penetration in our front-end sales by 90 basis points year-over-year to 22.3% this quarter.", "In addition to these strategic initiatives last quarter, we implemented a three point plan to balance our investment in sales and margins in our daily living business to drive profitable growth.", "First, we made adjustments through our promotional investments with particular focus on our weekly ad. Second, we worked to maximize the value of our Balance Rewards program highlighting redemption, rewards and dollar value of points earned in both our stores and our circular. And third, we began enhancing our store segmentation to ensure we meet the local needs and preferences of our communities.", "The result of that plan was our front-end comp increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year, showing growth in every month beginning in May. Traffic also improved through the past two quarters compared to last year. And in addition, while final numbers for the month are not available, we have seen further improvement in our comp sales and traffic data in September. Final numbers for the month will be available in our normal monthly sales release on Thursday.", "Turning to our strategy to transform the role of Community Pharmacy, we are making good progress across their business in core pharmacy, the enterprise, specialty pharmacy and health and wellness. We\u2019re advancing our work across these three businesses by providing even more comprehensive care to our customers and patients, developing a differentiated experience that our competitors can easily match and we\u2019re becoming a strategic partner of choice.", "We\u2019ve made significant progress in our pharmacy and health and wellness businesses here and I\u2019ll take you through a few of the highlights. With the win back of Express Scripts patients beginning last September in the successful extension of other major pharmacy relationships, we now have greater predictability on rates in our commercial book of business meeting our principle for fair value for the services we provide.", "Through our preferred relationship with top Medicare Part D plans, we improved our market share with an important customer segment Older Americans, our Medicare Part D share grew by 120 basis points this fiscal year outpacing the industry. As a result we\u2019ve also increased overall retail pharmacy market share to 19.1% for the year, we rebranded our nearly 400 Take Care clinics as healthcare clinics at Walgreens and expanded the services we offer.", "We added chronic care assessment treatment management to our preventative and acute offering. We also continue to build on our successful immunization program a foundation of our effort to transform community pharmacy. We administered more than 8.5 million total vaccines in fiscal 2013 compared to $6.7 million in the prior year. We remain the only chain pharmacy providing all 17 CDC recommended vaccines in every state where we can provide them and the largest retail provider of flu vaccines in the country. And to improve the experience we offer specialty customers, we launched an alliance this year with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to offer industry leading pharmacy services to patients through CF Services especially pharmacy that provides medication and treatment support to the cystic fibrosis community.", "We\u2019re also improving support to specialty patients by providing more access to limited distribution drugs for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions treated by specialty drugs. The specialty pipeline is robust and this year we gained access to 21 new limited distribution drugs, we\u2019re making them available across our unique collection of enterprise specialty assets, which includes central, retail, health system and community pharmacies.", "And finally our well transitioned program which provides Medication Therapy Management support to patients in the hospital and through their discharge was recently endorsed by the American Hospital Associations for improving medication inherence and reducing hospital readmissions.", "Script comp for pharmacy shows the momentum in our performance throughout the year. In the fourth quarter prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew by 7.1% over the same period last year. Looking at the results over two years, which Wade will show you in his section, our script comp improved from the third to the fourth quarter.", "We also saw solid progress this year on the work to establish a global platform. With this growth driver, we are focused on designing a winning global organization, optimize in the global supply chain, expanding our own brand portfolio, leveraging the best practices, capabilities, and the innovation in pursuing new market opportunities.", "We launched our joint venture in Bern, Switzerland this year and thanks for the work of our joint teams achieved $154 million in combined net synergies for the fiscal year. Our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen is also making an impact. They began the daily deliveries of our branded drugs to our stores chain wide as of September 1.", "In addition, we purchased $224 million of AmerisourceBergen stock as of August 31. Finally, we announced that Alex Gourlay, the Chief Executive of the Health & Beauty Division for Alliance Boots is joining our company. He will serve as Executive Vice President, the President of Customer Experience and Daily Living beginning today. It\u2019s great to have Alex come to Walgreens, he brings tremendous depth and experience from Boots in the health and beauty business, and we are looking forward to his leadership of our Daily Living division.", "Fiscal 2013 was a year of solid progress, looking ahead the fiscal 2014 we have real momentum, yet more work to do. While we\u2019re still operating in a challenging environment, we will continue to focus on execution in our core daily living and pharmacy, and health and wellness businesses. We\u2019re comfortable with the adjustments we\u2019re making in our promotional investments in daily living, driving both sales and margins to advance profitable growth. With our momentum, we\u2019re now turning our attention to flu season and the holidays our busiest season.", "In pharmacy, health and wellness, we continue to be a preferred provider for Medicare Part D and we\u2019re working closely with our key partners to ensure our customers can take advantage of lower co-pays and more access to services this season. With both our Smart90 Wallgreens offering and our Theranos launch of lab testing, we have new products in the marketplace that will help lower cost for our customers and improve their health outcomes supporting our purpose to help people get, stay and live well.", "On our global platform, we expect to accelerate the contributions from our strategic partnerships with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen through fiscal 2014. Wade will update you on the financial contributions we expect in both relationships.", "In closing, we are confident we have the right strategic growth drivers in place to continue to transform today\u2019s challenges and opportunities to deliver exceptional value and build toward our future as a global pharmacy led health and well-being enterprise.", "In addition, to executing on our three key strategic growth drivers, we also remain steadfast in managing ongoing reimbursement pressure and are constantly looking for ways to streamline our cost structure to prepare our company for our global future. We\u2019re setting our priorities against our strategies to ensure we can continue to grow in an increasingly competitive marketplace.", "And finally, today I want to thank our 248,000 employees for their commitment and dedication. They are the driving force behind so much of what we talked about on these calls, the experience we offer our customers and the services we deliver, and they deserve much of the credit for our results.", "Thank you. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thank you joining us on the call. This morning I\u2019ll take you through our quarterly results as well as update you on our investments and partnerships with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen.", "As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.69 per diluted share, based on 957 million shares. GAAP EPS translates to an adjusted EPS of $0.73 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. In most quarters, we add back the LIFO charge, but in this quarter, the LIFO benefit of $0.01 per share is negative in the GAAP adjusted walk, which I\u2019ll explain shortly.", "Acquisition related items were $0.10 per share, consisting of $0.04 of acquisition related amortization costs, $0.01 of acquisition related costs, $0.04 from Alliance Boots related tax and $0.01 of Alliance Boots related amortization.", "Finally, special items were a net reduction of $0.05 per share. As noted there was a $0.01 per share in costs associated with the Company\u2019s charge in prescription drug wholesalers, which was more than offset by the positive impact of $0.06 related to warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen.", "In the quarter, GAAP and adjusted EPS both included a positive $0.03 per share, net impact from certain litigation matters. Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 6.4%. Comp front-end sales increased 1.6% and total comparable store sales increased 4.6%. Comp prescription still increased 7.1% versus script comp of a negative 8% in the year ago period. Recall, the year ago quarter was negatively impacted by our exit from the Express Scripts network.", "In the fourth quarter, the front-end comp increased 1.6% and traffic decreased by 1.9%, while the basket size increased by a 3.6%. As Greg discussed, our front-end is now turned positive on both the one and two-year stack basis, primarily due to the momentum of our strategies and our new promotional decisions designed to balance traffic, basket and profitability.", "Looking at comparable stores script numbers, our retail scripts were up 7.1%. This continues to reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business, return of Express Scripts customers have continued progress in winning new Medicare Part D customers.", "With respect to margin, our FIFO gross margin was 28.9% in the current quarter, compared to 29.1% last year, a 20 basis point decline. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of the ongoing margin benefit from generics that was partially offset by market reimbursement pressure and continued growth of our 90-day, a retail program.", "The front-end margin was negatively impacted by increased promotional investment, but we are pleased with the results we are seeing in improved traffic and front-end comp in a challenging consumer environment.", "Taking a look at our longer-term FIFO gross margin trends, this quarter\u2019s 20 basis point decline was up against a 60 basis point increase a year ago. The pharmacy margin was positive in the quarter, but was more than offset by the negative change in the front-end margin.", "Moving forward, front-end margin will continue to be impacted by our new promotional adjustments until we cycle these changes in the latter half of fiscal 2014.", "This next chart illustrates the impact that new generic drug introductions have on our monthly prescription sales comps. You can see that the generic impact on comp prescription sales was greatest in the first quarter of the fiscal year reaching a negative 9% versus the generic impact in the most recent quarter of approximately negative 2%. The highlighted quarter showed that the number of new generic drug introductions have slowed versus a year ago.", "In our experience, the margin change resulting from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lagged to the impact of generic sales changes. That is the strongest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after generic impact on prescription sales and it\u2019s most inflationary and conversely the weakest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after the generic impact on prescription sales is the least deflationary.", "Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past eight quarters on a GAAP basis. And next slide shows the trends on adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth slowed slightly from a positive 5.3% in the third quarter of 2013 to positive a 4.3% in the fourth quarter. Likewise on a two-year stacked basis, gross profit dollar growth stepped down sequentially, as we allowed the 3.2% decrease from the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, when we\u2019re out of Express Scripts network.", "Some of the slowing in the one and two-year gross profit dollar growth stacks can also be attributed to the slowing generic impact I just described as well as the continued strong adoption of our various 90 day retail programs.", "As Greg said, we made solid SG&A progress in the quarter. To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our GAAP SG&A dollar growth was 0.9% which included 0.1% for Walgreen\u2019s acquisition related amortization and a 0.3 percentage point related to the company\u2019s change in prescription drug wholesalers, as well as a benefit of 1 percentage point from below our SG&A expense for the acquisition related costs.", "Netting these items resulted in an adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 1.5% in the quarter. GAAP and adjusted SG&A dollar growth both include a benefit of 1.1 percentage points from the net impact of certain litigation matters.", "Showing here the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past eight quarters on a GAAP basis and the follow on slide shows a similar trend on adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, the adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 1.5% year-over-year increase versus the 1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.", "Looking at adjusted SG&A dollar growth on a two-year stacked basis as you can see there was 180 basis point sequential steps down from the third quarter of 2013. We are very pleased with the SG&A dollar growth in the quarter and we continue to be very focused on continuing to drive efficiencies across all aspects of our business. This chart illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.", "Now let\u2019s review the two-year stack trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago with 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from 3.4% last year. During the quarter, the rate of growth and adjusted FIFO gross profit dollars exceeded adjusted SG&A dollar growth by 280 basis points. As you can see this is second consecutive quarter with a positive spread and we are very pleased this is moving in the right direction. Excluding the impact of net litigations, our spread was 170 basis points, meaningfully above our ongoing fiscal year objective of 100 basis points.", "Turning to other aspects of our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO benefit of $8 billion versus the provision charge of a $132 million a year ago. Significant change in LIFO was primarily driven by unusually high branded drug inflation in the year ago quarter and lower than anticipated prescription branded drug level inventory as we initiated our transition to AmerisourceBergen. Our LIFO rate for the year was 2.67% down from 3.3% a year ago.", "Net interest expense for the quarter was $55 million, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the $4 billion note issuance associated with the Alliance Boots transaction and also includes a $16 million negative impact from a non-cash fair market value adjustment to our interest rates swaps associated with a $1.3 billion notes that were repaid in August.", "Our effective tax rate was 35.4% versus 35.8% last year. Average diluted shares outstanding were 957 million shares versus 895 million shares last year. And as a reminder, the change is primarily due to the rolling impact of the 83.4 million shares issued for the Alliance Boots investment and to a lesser extent, the impact of a higher stock price in the money options, which accounted in diluted shares. In Q1 2014, you can expect a diluted share count of approximately 960 million shares from exchanges in the current share price. You can also expect interest expense of approximately $35 million.", "On a go forward basis, Walgreen\u2019s tax rate is expected to be about 37.5%, excluding the various impacts associated with Alliance Boots partnership. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter versus $1.3 billion a year ago. Accounts receivable increased by 21.5%, primarily due to the return of Express Scripts prescriptions, while accounts payable increased 5.7%. LIFO inventories were down 2.6%, and FIFO inventories were up 0.6% year-over-year versus the sales growth of 0.8%.", "Overall, net working capital decreased by 0.6% versus a year ago and we are pleased given our strong focus in this area. During the fourth quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations versus $768 million a year ago. And free cash flow in the quarter was a record $785 million versus $320 million a year ago. As a Company, we remain very focused on cash flow.", "Returning cash to shareholders remains a key initiative for Walgreens as evidenced by the 20.2% year-over-year increase in dividend per share distribution to shareholders in fiscal year 2013. As previously announced, in fiscal 2014, shareholders will receive a 14.5% increase in their dividends per share. And our goal remains the dividend payout ratio in the range of 30% to 35%.", "Our capital allocation policy has four primary components, beginning with continued investment in our key strategies. In addition to returning cash to shareholders via dividends, we are also focused on delivering our 2016 goals, which includes a combined net debt level of $11 billion grounded on the basis of a very solid cash flow generation.", "During the past year, Walgreens repaid $1.3 billion of debt while Alliance Boots reduce their net borrowings by $1.8 billion. We also invested $224 million to purchase AmerisourceBergen stock in the quarter at an average of $56.55 per share. As a reminder, we are not currently repurchasing Walgreen shares.", "As we have stated on previous occasions, we deal with the fair amount of quarterly variability in our business including seasonality, reimbursement rate changes, generic wave trends, food trends, and changes in macroeconomic conditions among others.", "Looking forward let me give you some general thought on fiscal 2014 by quarter. We expect Q1 2014 will face the headwind of a relatively slowdown in the introduction new generic drugs, but will be helped by an easier compare to a year ago because Q1 2013 adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of issued shares and interest associated with the Alliance Boots transaction without any meaningful synergy or equity income benefits due to three months reporting lag.", "Q2 2014 faces the challenging comparison as Q2 2013 benefited from one of the strongest flu seasons in the last 12 years and also benefited from our peak in the pharmacy margins during that recent generic wave. In addition, keep in mind that plan changes with rate adjustments typically occur in January and last year, the high rate of reduction of new generics moderated the impact of those adjustments. This year however, we anticipate a very low rate of introduction of new generics in the second quarter.", "Generic rates together [ph] helped us in the later half of fiscal 2014 and our synergies should ramp throughout the year. Lastly, our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen is expected to be modestly accretive from a distribution perspective in fiscal 2014 as a four generic distribution cut over benefits are expected to be realized in the more meaningful way in fiscal year 2015.", "Shifting to our quarterly Alliance Boots accretion walk as shown, we realized $56 million before tax and synergies during the fourth quarter and $33 million after-tax. Amortization adjustments amounted to $8 million for deal amortization and $11 million for brand amortization. After-tax Alliance Boots equity earnings were $90 million for the fourth quarter on adjusted basis.", "The non-adjusted basis, the income from our Alliance Boots investment was $109 million. And the incremental after-tax interest expense to Walgreens was $14 million. After the impact of share dilution, the accretion equaled $0.08 in the fourth quarter.", "Looking forward, we estimated the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2014 to be approximately $0.05 based on our current estimates of IFRS to GAAP conversions and foreign exchange rates, and moving forward, we will provide our attrition estimates on the call for each quarter in advance.", "We estimate the combined synergies for fiscal year 2014 to be in the $350 million to $400 million range. We are very pleased with both the operational performance of Alliance Boots and the combined synergies we are achieving and we feel we\u2019re just scratching the surface of things that we can do together in the coming years.", "I\u2019d like to close now by reminding you of our fiscal 2016 goals. A $130 billion of combined revenue, $8.5 billion to $9 billion of combined operating income, $9 billion to $9.5 billion of combined adjusted LIFO operating income, $8 billion of combined operating cash flow, total synergy goal of $1 billion.", "As I mentioned earlier, $11 billion of combined net debt again by the end of fiscal of 2016. Later this fiscal, we will review the components of the relevant measures with respect to our progress mix and opportunities across each of these measures.", "And now in closing, let me just share a few final thoughts. This quarter reflects progress against many of our key focus metrics, such as accelerated top line growth, solid cost management and record free cash flow.", "We also had many other meaningful proof points with respect to our long-term strategies such as strong Alliance Boots results and above goal synergy delivery, a successful start to our AmerisourceBergen partnership and a continued evolution of our healthcare strategy, which had its core leverages, our best-in-class nationwide retail footprint in more than 70,000 healthcare professionals.", "I feel strongly that we are only at the very beginning at the next leg of our Company\u2019s journey, a journey that started over 110 years ago, a journey that can put us at the epicenter of delivering better healthcare outcomes in the U.S. and abroad with everyday living a little bit better and change the paradigm of how we work with large global suppliers in ever and increasingly changing world to create value for them, for Walgreens and most importantly for the customers that we serve. I\u2019m sure that there will always be challenges along the way and we\u2019re very appreciative of the stakeholders who have taken a long view.", "In that vein, I believe the mega trends we face, lend themselves to our unique assets and capabilities, related our strategies are differentiated and sound, and executed well to create significant value for shareholders; In short, its hours to win.", "Thank you again for your kind attention and support and now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick.", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. You may begin.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah. Good morning guys.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Hi, Ed.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Could we start with the gross margin? I\u2019m little bit confused on the FIFO gross margin down 20 basis points, pharmacy up, front-end down slightly. But I guess I don\u2019t really understand how the front-end margin maybe as not down more or pharmacy not down given the total company down 20 basis points, because front-end just not it\u2019s only 35% of sales or so, right? And it\u2019s only down slightly. Now if you could maybe just help us reconcile exactly what\u2019s going on there?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yeah, I\u2019ll start and Wade can give some actual dollars. But as far as, as we said directionally pharmacy was up obviously with the help of the generics that we had for this past quarter offset obviously by ongoing reimbursement ratio, but also with our 90 day drive that we have.", "One of the focuses as we have is to continue to give customers what they\u2019re looking for and as our chronic medications in 90 day economies are retail. So that\u2019s an impact is working the other direction certainly in pharmacy, but we think it\u2019s a right thing to do long-term.", "As far as a front-end, as we\u2019ve said we think we are making good intelligent investments in price and promotion. I feel like we are getting steady momentum back into the front-end of the business and we\u2019ll continue to make sure that we do that going forward. But as we said, we always plan to make some investments to the front-end, that\u2019s exactly what we are doing.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Are you happy with the comparable gross profit dollar growth in the front-end, how does that look and how has that changed. Did you start investing in the promotions?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yeah, I think we had solid gross profit dollar increase and then when you compared to the SG&A dollar growth and we\u2019ve said all along there goals to have a 100 basis points spread between the two over the long haul and I think with the performance that we\u2019ve turned in this quarter, we\u2019re pleased with the way both of those worked in Unison.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yeah, I just to kind of restart, I really think that we really look at it from a gross profit dollar basis as you know, and I think we are really finding a good balance with some good momentum we have in growth right now with also managing the margin wisely, so.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Wade, you gave some color on 2014, which is definitely helpful. I just had a couple of follow-ups on that. Given the fact that you have some tougher comparisons next year with the flu early on, less of a generic benefit, does gross profit dollar growth slow from here over the next few quarters?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well, we don\u2019t give obviously, specifics on that kind of detail. But I think that fundamentally we feel very good about our business going forward. I think we just want to provide some color that quarter-to-quarter, there can be some lumps, some up, some down. But in aggregate, we feel good about our growth of our gross profit dollars and the managed SG&A as well.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And on the SG&A side, you\u2019ve done a lot of good stuff from a cost control perspective. How much of that do you think, you can carry forward into 2014, is there still opportunity there?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "And I think we can always be better everyday forever and that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re working hard at is to really put continuous improvement and continuous focus on driving efficiencies and effectiveness in every aspect of our business, so I\u2019d say, yes.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And Alliance Boots equity income, first quarter you didn\u2019t have it, seasonally how did that business look in the first quarter?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "The first quarter is by far the toughest quarter of the year seasonally. So that\u2019s again we guided sort of roughly $0.05 accretion for the first quarter. It\u2019s summer period, not holiday period, so both in the wholesale and the retail business, it\u2019s a low seasonal point.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just one last question for you all, sort of modeling, but there has been a lot of talk sort of like, I think amongst investors about what the real tax rate is that we should be using on the synergies, any color there?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I guess what I\u2019d say is we\u2019ll do some work to try to figure how we can provide more clarity and guidance as we go forward. I think obviously, the rate that I gave today looking forward was kind of the Walgreen standalone rate, Alliance Boots has different rates. So we have to use a blend for that and then of course, the work we\u2019re doing together in synergy, and other things a bit more complex. But we\u2019ll do some work to see how we can provide better understanding as we move ahead.", "Edward Kelly \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you.", "Kermit R. Crawford", "Thanks, Ed.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays. You may begin.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering as long as we were talking a little bit about the investments you\u2019re making in the front-end comp, are you making the investments that you expected to make and are you getting more response that you expected to get.", "And can you talk a little bit about how you think that plays out in full-year 2014? You only started this I think in May, this increased promotion. So do you think that last till May of 2014 or do you think that it\u2019s something you\u2019ll be doing for longer until the frequent shopper program really the huge traction?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Meredith, I feel good about the investments that we have made and are making. And as I said, that\u2019s a balance between the right amount of investment and to drive the right amount of performance. But I think that we\u2019ve done a very good job in being surgical, using the data that we\u2019re getting from our Balance Rewards program that help us understand how to strengthen the Sunday circular, as well as begin to use individual programs, Balance Rewards to drive traffic and basket.", "So I think I would say, yes that we are seeing the expectations that we had with the investment we made. Going forward, I think we will continue to try to drive the improved performance. And I think what we feel good about that we\u2019re going to be able to have at our \u2013 to be able to use would be the increase in information we get balance reward and the data that we have from the program. Not only to make even better decisions on what we promote and what pricing, but also more and more individual marketing programs through the Balance Reward program itself.", "As I said, the other thing that\u2019s needed with ALEC, here now working with our team would be able to begin to bring some of the best practices from their program and to our Balance Rewards program. So I would, I think it\u2019s going to be as I\u2019ve said before like a locomotive, this isn\u2019t a jet aircraft, we\u2019re going to continue to just gain steam and try to continue to gain momentum and feel confident about it.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay. And then I have a much more technical question maybe for Wade. And maybe you\u2019ve answered this in the slides although you went through the slides quickly. You have other income and is that the warrants with a fair market value of the warrants and there is a number in one of your schedules at the end of the press release that has $62 million as opposed to whatever $43 million, $44 million for the other income, I don\u2019t understand what the difference is?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "That is the fair market value of the warrant.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "And why is that a different number than what you had in that schedule?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yeah, that\u2019s an AB share as well, that\u2019s the difference. Recall the warrants are split. I mean effectively we Walgreens has 50% of those warrants and AB effectively has 50% of those warrants.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "And could you just explain how that shows up in the numbers here. Is that because it goes into your share of AB?", "Kermit R. Crawford", "Yeah, we can work it off-line, but that\u2019s effectively right. And so these have basically been for purpose of adjusted earnings, then we\u2019ve acted out.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.", "Okay. And then, I guess I just have one more question about the gross margin. Could you talk again, I know you, Greg you talked about, so the expectation for generics next year, but are we saying that most of the benefit of generics for next year comes really towards the tail end of fiscal 2014?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "That\u2019s right.", "Kermit R. Crawford", "Yeah, it is Meredith, I think, and in fact, if you think \u2013 if you, the graph that we showed, it showed the volume certainly last year shows what we\u2019re up against. But then as far as first and second quarter, they\u2019re like worsen in the second half, we\u2019ll see a lift again.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "But we\u2019re also against an easier compared to back half, but we\u2019re up against the tougher compared to first half.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then I guess, one more question about SG&A. You have done a pretty good job of managing expenses. Could you just talk about whether there is any one initiative or a group of initiatives that you\u2019d point to that had been helpful in slowing the growth of SG&A?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I think our folks in the field, Mark Wagner and Kermit and team has done a tremendous job in really making sure that they are ensuring that our SG&A and our labor in the stores, and our expense match the volume as we bring it back. I think our store people have done a tremendous job of becoming more efficient. We\u2019ll really focus Meredith, on trying to take more and more tasks out of the stores; sort of we can free our folks that are in the stores up more to spend time with customers.", "So I would give probably 80%, 90% of the credit to our folks in the field. With that, for our folks in corporate, we have really this year, I think done a tremendous job in getting focus on the key projects and initiatives that will move the needle for us going forward in a big way and stop doing a lot of things that will not.", "And then it combined those and I think we feel very good with the focus we have, any ongoing focus we will keep.", "Meredith Adler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thanks, Meredith.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. You may begin?", "Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask you about the ramp of synergies, they are going to see you\u2019re calling for $350 million to $400 million in fiscal 2014. On the generic procurement side specifically, I was wondering if you guys could comment on whether or not the re-contracting with your generic manufacturers\u2019 kind of where you are in that process, is that close to complete. And then as it relates to that, how should we be thinking about the ramp on the generic procurement side specifically?", "Is that something you expect within the overall bucket of synergies to come in a little bit faster or is that kind of pacing along with the other synergy areas of synergies?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yeah, couple of things there is one obviously, since we exceeded our goal this year, it hit $154 million and we effectively started at zero. That means by the end of the year you have to be close to $300 million. And so we continue to ramp that, that\u2019s why we get the objectives and the goals for next year that we have pretty good visibility on.", "With respect to generics, our team who\u2019s leading it, Jeff Berkowitz and John Donovan made a tremendous amount of progress. I think we\u2019re not going to get too much detail on it, because I think it\u2019s work that\u2019s probably making this happening as we speak. But I would say that I think they are working with likely specifics to find really win-win relationships where we can bring a lot more business combined with the players and help them and they can help us. And so we are very confident that we are going to create lot of value there over time, but I\u2019ll just leave it at that.", "Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then I guess just to clarify Wade, the 350 to 400 synergies that does not includes any additional generic procurement benefits from AmerisourceBergen\u2019s purchasing or does it?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "This business is really, primarily, this is just us and Alliance Boots. And again there is six work streams that which generics we\u2019ve always said it\u2019s the biggest one, but all the work streams are now creating value.", "Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Any sense you can give us just as far as timing, I know it\u2019s still little bit earlier on in the process than where you are with AB. But any sense you can give us and when you might be in a position to share an additional synergy number related to AmerisourceBergen?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Perhaps maybe in future calls I will talk a little bit more. Really right now that the core focus AmerisourceBergen as Greg has said, we\u2019ve now basically moved all the branded drugs into the AmerisourceBergen distribution network and that\u2019s going fantastic.", "And now over the next 9 to 12 months, we\u2019ll be moving on to generics and it will be comp further out, but perhaps we\u2019ll get in that later?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Bob, I will say that I happen to be in Bern last week or two weeks ago with Stephanie Hattenschweiler and Steve Collis and the team, and I\u2019d tell you there is a lot of confidence and a lot of energy with that team. So we feel good going forward with what that team is going to be able to deliver.", "Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That\u2019s great. And if I could just sneak one more in on the front-end, obviously promotional activity seem to be a big focus. Currently, I know you talked about the more targeted promotional programs and it sounds like you obviously have had a negative impact in this quarter and you are expecting that to continue in the front half of fiscal 2014 if I heard you correctly. I was just wondering if you could give us any order of magnitude as we think about the cadence into 1Q and 2Q, is it more or less negative than what we saw on the gross profit margin in this quarter. Anything directionally there will be really helpful? Thanks.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I don\u2019t know if we give actual numbers Bob, but I will say, I think the investment the team is making in over the past several months that\u2019s beginning to drive the momentum. I would say that, we\u2019re pretty much right on as far as the order of magnitude that we need to continue to invest to drive that steady momentum. So I wouldn\u2019t see any probably more aggressive investment. I think we\u2019ll just continue to take it quarter-by-quarter and make the right investments. But I feel good with the level of investment we are make on, I think that could continue to drive the momentum we\u2019re looking forward in front-end of the business.", "How could they get other balancing the promotional strategy is just one small component what the teams are doing driving the Well Experience, improving our own brand portfolio more relevant localized tailored format. There is a lot of great work going on that\u2019s very structural and long term in nature, our customer satisfaction keeps growing. So I think this is the bigger store story of why we feel confident as we move forward here.", "Robert P. Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.", "It makes sense. Thanks so much.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Wade, what is the after \u2013 what\u2019s the inventory run rate we could expect with ABC now controlling more of the flow here. Should it drop meaningfully?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "The run rate of what, I\u2019m sorry Bob?", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Your inventory?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well with our inventory I mean effectively we produced substantial inventory all of our branded effectively in the cutover, but it\u2019s part of the agreement we\u2019ve also increased our days payable. So the working capital balances out to fair degree, it just ends up on different lines.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And that kind of continue current run rate spend overall for working capital?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Yes, I would say that\u2019s a pretty good assumption.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just another question in terms of the real estate that you own for your stores that metric was always kind of 19%, 20%, where does that stand now?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "It\u2019s still about that, historically that was both for how we want to balance our balance sheet as well as there are just some areas where it\u2019s more advantageous to own than it is to do a structured lease agreement. But I think we\u2019ll probably be about that zone moving forward.", "Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thanks, Bob.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Hi, good morning.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Good morning.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "You mentioned that you heard about $300 million of run rate at the end of fiscal year 2013. So when you think about your synergy guidance for 2014 of $350 million to $400 million, what is the exit run rate that you\u2019re expecting to achieve?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "The exit run rate is that?", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, the exit run rate for 2014?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I mean it will be obviously higher than the higher end of that limit, but we haven\u2019t give an exact guidance because we are going to give rise to the following here, so it will be higher than $400 million.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right, but should we think about it as $500 million to $600 million range? I guess it all depends on the magnitude of the ramp up.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, I mean there is moving parts right so if I gave you exact number it would probably be plus or minus wrong, but I think we feel confident that year by year by year we can keep delivering incremental synergies on these extremes and we are also increasingly finding new areas that we can focus on, now we drive cost efficiencies but just take capabilities and drive top line benefit as well.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And can you share with us, when you think about Alliance Boots for fiscal year 2014, any color on what\u2019s the top line and EBIT growth that we should expect from AB? And understanding that there is some seasonality as we\u2019ve seen in fiscal year 2013, but just like overall for the year?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "I guess we\u2019re not going to comment on their business anymore than we feel that they are obviously performing very strong in a challenging environment. I think you saw this is the last year, delivered strong numbers I think that they feel, the wholesale business continued to do well in challenging environment as well as their retail business and being able to drive profitable meaningful growth.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on the SG&A, I mean obviously I think in response to an earlier question, you said \u2013 that you think that you continue to improve SG&A spend going forward, but growth initiative on SG&A on an adjusted basis were about 2.6%, so really significantly below can affect your long-term steady state guidance of 3.5% to 4.5%. So as we think about our model for fiscal year 2014, should we stick with the 3.5% to 4.5% or are you now at a new base line of growth?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "I guess it\u2019s right to say is that I just kind, I\u2019d revert back to that objective we have that 100 basis point or more spread over time on SG&A gross profit dollar growth. There are also an SG&A, there is lots of lumps that happen quarter-to-quarter and even fiscal-to-fiscal, I guess the key takeaway is we are very focused, as Greg said on really prioritizing the organization around the things that really matter. We\u2019re really looking at everything to see does it create value, things like indirect spend, things that we buy that we don\u2019t re-sell do we need it., we does it cost optimizer, is it efficient.", "So again I think it\u2019s really more of that ratio that\u2019s important, because even that number that you alluded to, the 2.6% also include things like USA drug. So it\u2019s not really even a true organic number, which has been better than that and these things can change that metric over time as well.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So we should obviously include Kerr as we think about your SG&A growth for next year?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, right for sure. Yes.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, okay. And can you give us a ballpark of what that dollar number would be?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "In terms of year-on-year growth or\u2026?", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Again, I guess I\u2019d just say that that objective for us is to make that spread or beat it consistently most of the time\u2026", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "And Kerr has 76 stores, so that alone isn\u2019t going really I guess change materially our base SG&A.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And lastly on the third party network, it contributes to your growth last year. Are you looking to add new partnership, new network partnership on Part D this coming year?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Kermit you want to address that?", "Kermit R. Crawford", "Ricky in this year as we were last year in January, we started to have relationship that are preferred with our Medicare Part D providers. We are excited about the opportunity that we saw our market share grow in this, as Greg said this is very valuable Older American. So next year you\u2019ll see us with the same partnership that we\u2019ve looked at in the past.", "It\u2019s a part of our and if you think about our overall strategy is being a better strategic partner. There is a number of examples out there, where we\u2019re beginning to see this not only with the Medicare Part D plan, but also with our SmartD 90 plan with Express Scripts, where we see that customer will have a choice to get their 90 day at retail at a Walgreen or through Express Scripts home delivery. So this strategic partnership is the part of our overall corporate initiative to continue to work with partners.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then finally in October 1, open enrollment is starting today. Can you just share with us your thoughts as to how you\u2019re seeing ACA is going to impact your business over the next 12 months?", "Kermit R. Crawford", "Yes. Well, go ahead Greg.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Well the enrollment period starts today we certainly have our pharmacist and all of our people prepared to ask questions as members or those who are affected or impacted coming to our stores. From an ACA perspective, we certainly know there is going to be an increase in a number of people that get insurance.", "We\u2019re not speculating on what that number is but overall we would anticipate benefiting from that in a number of ways not only from our script volume, but when you think about healthcare clinics. We have over 300 healthcare clinics that will provide not only preventative, but minor acute as well as chronic care.", "We\u2019ve also been involved in partnerships around the ACOs, where people are looking to have manage the entire benefit and under this exchange benefit design it\u2019s a benefit design of both medical and drug. So we think we are going to play a key role in that as people take advantage of the pharmacy benefit and drive their overall lower medical cost.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Ricky it\u2019s Greg. I would just say I think we\u2019re looking at it certainly for all those reasons it is more of a long-term benefit for us. For all the reasons have been expressed it\u2019s a tougher audience diverse audience to bring into the program and make aware of.", "But so next year is going to be hard to tell but certainly from a long-term we think it will be a benefit for us for all the reasons Kermit explained.", "Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette of UBS. You may begin.", "Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS", "Hi, thanks. Good morning Greg and Wade. So I guess first is in relation to all that discussion on the adjusted gross profit dollar growth, is there any preliminary view on the change in LIFO provision and what that might be for FY 2014?", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, I mean in terms of the rate or?", "Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS", "Yes. But just kind of thinking about I mean if you\u2019re going to have fewer generic launches and brand inflation remaining strong I would think you could have a fairly good size LIFO charge overall in FY 2014. So I just want to make sure I am sort thinking about that right way? And also does the ABC shifting change the way that you are LIFO inventory might flow.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "The ABC thing absolutely does change obviously, because it\u2019s a different arrangement now and they are managing the bulk of the inventory. I would say I don\u2019t think we see the rate being materially different than it has been over the past couple of years on average, but there are a lot of moving parts with that especially when you move from such dollar branded to having generics and then as we transition generics over time that will change yet again. So I think maybe as we go forward into the next quarter we can provide some clarity, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything material versus history.", "Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then also we\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions recently on what your tax rate may go down to once you get into your FY 2016, you also have a lot of guidance for that year but tax rate not being one of them but if we do assume that steps with Alliance Boots is completed. I guess the question is could there be a material step down in the tax rate on your income statement once we get into FY 2016 versus where the tax rate is currently?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Very simplistically the kind of blend our rates and their rates on the relative businesses although there are things like sub Part S and other things which can move it off of that number depending upon how is the structure, but I think that if we want to model it simply you could probably use the blended rates and be close.", "Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Well, I think there has been some discussion at even some of your U.S. operations if it gets off-short in some way that even your overall tax rates it could go down even lower than what that blended rate would be. So we can just discuss that more off-line if you want, but that\u2019s something coming up a lot recently just\u2026?", "Wade D. Miquelon", "We have no plans for that, I mean really it\u2019s managing our businesses as effectively we can the way they are.", "Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS", "Yes.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Fairly with some changes.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Yes, Steve none at all.", "Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS", "Okay, all right. Great, thanks.", "Wade D. Miquelon", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rick Hans for closing remarks.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, we will report September sales this Thursday and until then, thank you for listening. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Rick Hans, you may begin.", "Rick Hans ", "Thank you, Nicole and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call 2014. Today, Greg Wasson, President and CEO; and Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President, CFO and President International, will discuss the results for the quarter. Also joining us on the call, and available for questions are Kermit Crawford, President of Pharmacy; and Mark Wagner, President of Store Operations; and Alex Gourlay, President of Customer Experience and Daily Living.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I will begin with a review of our financial performance. Next, I'll discuss our performance against our three strategic growth drivers and finally I'll look ahead to how we\u2019re preparing our company as we head towards fiscal 2015.", " ", "And then I will turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed financial review of the quarter and the fiscal year. ", "This quarter was marked by a solid top line growth in performance. We achieved record quarterly sales and record second-quarter prescriptions filled in spite of continued headwinds from slower generic drug introductions and severe weather. ", "For the quarter, sales were $19.6 billion, up 5.1% from $18.6 billion a year ago, driven in part by 4.3% increase in comp store sales. GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 4.9% from $1.2 billion last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, down 4.3% from $1.4 billion in second-quarter 2013. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.78 in the second quarter compared to $0.79 last year, down 1.3%. Second quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.91, down 5.2% from $0.96 in the same quarter last year. And finally we generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion in the second quarter and free cash flow of $877 million.", "Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars. In the second quarter on a GAAP basis, our gross profit dollars increased 0.8% or $43 million from a year ago. SG&A dollars increased 1.6% or $72 million compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 0.4% or $22 million compared to a 4% increase in the same quarter last year. This difference resulted from several key factors. The shift in the generic wave from a peak in introductions in the first quarter last year to a trough this year, continued to have a negative impact, the impact which moderated somewhat from the first quarter is expected to continue to moderate in the third quarter and turn positive in the fourth quarter. ", "A weak flu season compared to last year resulted in fewer cough, cold and flu related prescriptions, and lower sales of over-the-counter products compared to the same period last year. And we also maintained meaningful promotional investments in our daily living business in the quarter. ", "While we did see some pressure on our gross profit dollar growth, we were able to balance that with on-going cost discipline. In a quarter with a record sales and an increase in comp store sales, our adjusted SG&A dollars increased by only 1.7% or $76 million compared to the same quarter last year. ", "Want to give credit to our leadership team in the stores who are using their resources efficiently to serve our customers. In our estimation adjusted gross profit dollar growth would have been about the same as our adjusted SG&A dollar growth if we had not had the impact from severe winter weather.", "In the quarter, we also made progress on our three strategic growth drivers, creating a Well Experience, advancing the role of community pharmacy, and establishing an efficient global platform. Today I will provide more details on that progress. ", "In our Well Experience growth driver, we saw the on-going impact of a value conscious consumer, while unseasonably cold temperatures which I mentioned earlier further affected our sales. In response, we continued to invest in promotions, increasing front-end comp sales by 2%. We also continued to roll out our Well Experience stores reaching a total of 628 across the country. We realized market share gains across the majority of Nielsen tracked categories in our daily living business. And in addition, average basket size increased 3.4% in the quarter as customers continued to consolidate trips. ", "This quarter we successfully reached a milestone for enrolment in our Balance Rewards program topping 100 million in enrolees. With almost 80 million active members we now have the largest retail loyalty program in the industry. ", "We're also are leveraging our customer insights from Balance Rewards to evolve our value proposition and simplify promotions to help both our stores and our customers. ", "On our Well Experience rollout we're pleased with our progress to date. We continue to refine or store formats to integrate healthcare, provide an elevated beauty experience, and also deliver exceptional seasonal and consumable convenience to meet customers\u2019 needs.", "Also this quarter, we expanded and enhanced our beauty offering, introducing Boots No7 in New York City. We completed the rollout to 10 stores in February and plan to reach 150 stores in the city. Our New York City expansion follows or successful launch of Boots No 7 and other boots brands in our Arizona market and our flagship stores across the country. ", "Finally we continue to bring together our world class digital capabilities to complement our convenient store locations and leverage our omni-channel context to delight customers. Today nine million customers touch the Walgreens' brand every day at our stores over the web or through mobile channels making Walgreens a true omni-channel provider.", "In our Pharmacy, Health and Wellness business, our script comp was up 2.2% in the quarter. Our retail pharmacy market share increased to 19% for the quarter, up 20 basis points year over year and we filled a record 214 million prescriptions, up 2.8% from the same period last year. We also continue to grow our 90 day retail program. According to IMS in the second quarter, the 90 day retail market grew 15% year over year while the mail market declined 10%. Also our 90 day at retail volumes in the second quarter increased by 17% over the prior year, from perspective our 90 day at retail business alone is as large as one third of the total mail industry and mail market industry.", "We believe this validates the consumer\u2019s value, the ability to receive a 90 day supply at retail from the trusted community pharmacist and the payers are increasingly seeing the value and adding a retail benefit to the mail offering. ", "In addition, we had a strong season for immunizations with a total of 8.6 million vaccines administered through the first half of the fiscal year. That\u2019s an increase of 11% over the same period last year. While that increase was mainly on the strength of a strong flu shot season, we also continued to build our non-flu immunization business. For example, today we are the number one retail provider of Zostavax, a vaccine for shingles. ", "And finally, we continue to see some impact to margin from the on-going negative effect related to generics and the volume drop-off of controlled pain medications which we referenced last quarter.", "Looking ahead, our Medicare Part D program is accelerating our momentum in pharmacy. In the quarter, our Med D volume was up year over year with significant growth in new customers on top of strong performance in fiscal \u201913. Our Part D market share for the quarter increased 80 basis points compared to the same period last year. ", "As we move forward, we are well positioned to win with senior customers as a preferred provider in four of the top national plans giving older Americans more plan choices which offer them lower co-pays for their prescription.", "Also as you know, we are tightly integrated in our healthcare clinics with our pharmacies in hundreds of locations. We are experiencing growing interest from customers in value convenient affordable high quality healthcare services and from payers who view Walgreens as an emerging health alternative care model and an important part of the patients care daily regime. To help meet this growing demand, we have a goal to add nearly 100 new healthcare clinic locations in calendar 2014 on top of our 400 current retail clinics. And we will continue to expand our network to develop a comprehensive national footprint.", "Our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots contributed $0.08 per diluted share to Walgreens' second quarter 2014 adjusted results. Combined synergies for the first half of fiscal 2014 were approximately $236 million. We now expect to exceed our second year combined synergy target and are now estimating $375 million to $425 million in the second quarter combined synergies.", "We estimate that the accretion from Alliance Boots in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 will be an adjusted $0.13 to $0.14 per diluted share. And we purchased approximately 10.5 million shares of AmerisourceBergen stock as of February 28th and we own approximately 4.5% of the company. ", "We continue to make good progress on our global initiatives. We are pleased with the performance of our global procurement organization. With the introduction of AmerisourceBergen, we believe we will be the largest purchaser of pharmaceuticals worldwide. More importantly we are working with manufacturers transparently and collaboratively to help drive sustainable growth in the U.S. and Europe.", "Manufacturers have told us they appreciate our approach. We think this sets us apart from others in the market, benefits our organizations over the long haul and positions us and our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners extremely well for both short term and long term sustainable value creation. ", "In addition, after successfully transitioning our branded drugs to AmerisourceBergen last fall, we began our generic transition this January and are making excellent progress. We're on track to complete the work by September 1st.", "At part of the company\u2019s efforts to optimize our cost structure and assets, we\u2019re also taking a closer look at our store network. As we mentioned in our press release this morning, between now and August, we intent to close 76 stores spread across the country importantly, overall this year including store closings, we expect to expand our store base by approximately 55 to 75 locations in fiscal 2014. ", "We looked at several factors in deciding which stores to close. We address the impact of increased density from our own stores, the impact of real estate positioning within the market and material changes to a store\u2019s trade area. In total, this represents a very small portion less than 1% of our 8,200 plus store base. As we position for future growth and markets and communities continue to change, we want to optimize our store footprint and make sure our stores remain on the best corners in America. ", "I also want to note that because most of these stores are located near another Walgreens, we will be reassigning a majority of our team members. The store optimization is expected to result in more than $40 million to $50 million and additional annual EBIT beginning at fiscal 2015, representing an estimated $0.02 to $0.03 in adjusted diluted earnings per share as well as estimated charges of $240 million to $280 million, substantially all of which is expected to be recognized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal \u201814. Keep in mind that we plan to exclude these charges from our adjusted EPS calculation. ", "As we head into the second half of the fiscal year, we are well positioned to create value and accelerate long-term growth. We expect to continue to make meaningful investments in our frontend to drive the right balance in sales and margins. We're also focused on our important programs in pharmacy, health and wellness such as Medicare Part D, immunizations and healthcare clinics that will continue to improve volume and expand access to convenient high quality affordable healthcare services. With these areas of focus, we will capitalize on the convergence of our two dynamic industries, retail and healthcare and continue to meet the changing demands of our customers, partners and payers. That coupled with the commitment to excellence and execution that has always defined Walgreens, I am excited about the future of our company.", "And finally, I'd like to thank our team members who did such a great job serving our customers through a very difficult winter. Across the country, they ensured our customers had convenient access to the essential products, emergency supplies and the necessary prescriptions they needed through this harsh winter. ", "And now I'll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I will take you through our quarterly results as well as update you on our Alliance Boots strategic partnership and our AmerisourceBergen relationship. As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.78 per diluted share based on nearly 964 million shares. GAAP EPS walks to an adjusted EPS of $0.91 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. A LIFO provision of $0.04, acquisition related items were $0.12 per share consisting of $0.06 of acquisition related amortization costs, $0.01 of acquisition related cost and $0.05 from Alliance Boots related tax. ", "Finally, the special items were a net $0.03 per share due to combined impact of the warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens and Alliance Boots with the Alliance Boots impact reported on a three month lag basis. ", "Let me now review our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 5.8%. Comp frontend sales increased 2% and total comp store sales increased 4.3%. Comp prescription sales increased 2.2% versus a script comp of 4.3% in the year ago period. ", "In the second quarter, the frontend comp increased 2%, complement to this comp are traffic which decreased by 1.4% and basket size which increased by 3.4%. As Greg touched upon earlier, our frontend was impacted by the tough cough cold flu compare and a severe weather versus the prior year. Looking forward, please keep in mind that the March frontend comp sales will begin to be negatively impacted by the Easter shift this year versus last year. And recall Easter fell on March 31st last year and falls on April 20th this year. As always, we will provide the combined March-April comp on May 5th to give you a better understanding of our underlying sales for these two months. ", "Looking at comparable store script numbers, our retail scripts were up 2.2%. In spite of the tough cough cold flu compare; this performance reflects the fundamentals of our underlying business, the return of Express Scripts customers and our on-going progress in winning new Medicare Part D customers. It's also worth noting that the two-year stack on script comps has risen back to levels last reached prior to the Express Scripts dispute. ", "With respect to margin, our adjusted gross margin reflects our FIFO inventory was 29.1% in the current quarter compared to 30.5% last year, a 140 basis point decline. While we always experience some level of reimbursement pressure, the most significant factor affecting the pharmacy margin was dramatically slower rate of new generic introductions year-over-year. ", "The frontend margin was negatively impacted by increased promotional investment designed to drive traffic and sales, partially offsetting these margin headwinds is the fact that purchasing synergies positively impacted both the frontend and the pharmacy margins. ", "Taking a look at our adjusted gross margin trends, this quarter\u2019s 140 basis point decrease was versus a 120 basis point increase a year ago. In essence, the benefit of the generic wave last year [reversed itself] [ph] this year. We expect this impact to continue to moderate in the third and fourth quarter and become a tailwind to some degree in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201814. Now keep in mind that the timing of the introduction of some generic drugs remains a question mark. For instance, as most of you know the launch of generic diversions of Diovan and Nexium may be delayed, which would result in their benefit being pushed out from our second half of fiscal 2014 into fiscal year \u201815.", "Moving forward the front end margin will continue to be impacted by our promotional investments until we cycle these changes beginning this summer. As we demonstrated and discussed the last two quarters, this graph illustrates the impact that new generic drug introductions have had on our monthly prescription sales comps. The highlighted quarters illustrate that the number of new generic drug introductions have slowed dramatically versus a year ago. And you can see that the generic impact on comp prescription sales was about a negative 6% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, versus the generic impact of negative 1.3% in the most recent quarter.", "In our experience the margin change resulted from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lag to the impact of generic sales changes. That is, the strongest positive effect on margins typically occurs shortly after the generic impact on prescription sales is the most deflationary. That period occurred in the year ago quarter. As you can see, the tough year-over-year generic impact margin comparisons dissipate in the later half fiscal 2014 given the generic impact on pharmacy sales comps is expected to increase in that period.", "Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 10 quarters on a GAAP basis. And the next slide shows the trends on an adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth slowed to 0.4% from 4% in the year ago period as a result of the headwinds we described for you in the first quarter including generic wave shift, the front end investment and the impact of weaker cough cold flu.", "For the quarter, GAAP SG&A dollar growth was 1.6% to which we add back 0.1 percentage point for the acquisition related cost resulting in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 1.7%.", "Shown here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past 10 quarters on a GAAP basis and the following slide shows a similar trend on adjusted basis. The adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 1.7% year-over-year increase versus the 4.2% increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Included in this SG&A dollar growth rate was approximately 50 basis points or $23 million of incremental weather related expenses mostly snow removal.", "This next chart illustrates our two year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.", "Now let\u2019s review the two year stacked trends on adjusted basis. Two year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago by 200 basis points. With a two year stack of 5.9% growth in the second quarter of 2014 down from 7.9% last year and about half the rate of growth of 11.6% two years ago. ", "During the quarter, the rate of growth and adjusted gross profit dollars trailed to adjusted SG&A dollar growth by 130 basis points. As you can see gross profit dollar growth decelerated year-over-year, which reflects the incremental headwinds we encountered.", "Turning to a few other components of our income statement, this quarter included LIFO provision of $51 million versus a provision or charge of $72 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the quarter was 2.5% down slightly from 2.75% a year ago. Net interest expense for the quarter was $37 million versus $23 million from a year ago. Now recall that the quarter a year ago benefited from the receipt of $19 million of interest income generated by late pharmacy reimbursement payments.", "We expect interest expense of approximately $40 million in the third quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding were 964 million shares versus 953 million shares last year. And the change is primarily due to the impact of a higher stock price on a number of in the money options which are counted as diluted shares. ", "In third quarter, we expect a diluted share count of approximately 965 million shares subject to changes in the current share price. Our blended effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.9% versus 36.6% last year. The difference is primarily attributed to foreign sourced income taxed at lower rate partially offset by increases to estimated permit differences between booked and tax income.", "On a go forward basis, Walgreens' tax rate is expected to be about 37.5% and Alliance Boots tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. ", "Accounts receivable increased by 11.8% primarily due to increased business including the return of Express Scripts network prescriptions and while accounts payable increased 2.3%. LIFO inventories were down 0.6% and FIFO inventories were up 2% year-over-year versus sales growth of approximately 5.1%. We expect inventory levels to come down in the back half of the year as we realized greater efficiencies due to daily delivery and complete the full generic distribution transition to AmerisourceBergen. Overall, net working capital increased by 2.9% versus a year ago. ", "During the second quarter we generated approximately $1.1 billion in cash from operations versus $1.2 billion in the year ago period. The free cash flow in the quarter was $877 million versus $953 million a year ago.", "The next slide shows our correlated accretion from Alliance Boots which was as Greg said, $0.08 per share for the quarter versus our forecast of $0.07 to $0.08 per share. And you can you find a more detailed walk included in the appendix to this presentation on our investor relations website. ", "Combined net synergies for the quarter totalled $129 million and for the first half of the year have totalled $236 million. As Greg noted, because we\u2019re running ahead of our original estimate of $350 million to $400 million of combined synergies for the year, we are now raising the range of our estimate to $375 million to $425 million. ", "Looking forward, we estimate the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 to be $0.13 to $0.14 per share based on our current estimate of IFRS to GAAP conversion and foreign exchange rates and moving forward, we plan to continue to provide our accretion estimate one quarter in advance. ", "Similar to last quarter, we have reviewed our fiscal year 2016 goals internally and performance to date with respect to four of our five goals remains on track with or slightly ahead of our expectations and these four goals are sales of $130 billion including Alliance Boots share of associates and joint venture sales, synergies of $1 billion, operating cash flow of $8 billion and net debt of $11 billion. ", "As stated in our last call, our adjusted operating income goal of $99.5 billion is currently tracking below the CAGR required to meet this goal and below our initial exceptions. We continue to recognize that there are risks to achieving this goal, however we remain focused on delivering it and as I also stated we have identified a range of further opportunities including benefits from our AmerisourceBergen relationship, incremental Alliance Boots synergies, business expansion and new initiatives and cost savings, which can all help mitigate these risks. ", "The asset optimization program that Greg described highlights our focus on efficiencies while the increase in our fiscal year \u201914 synergy estimate demonstrates that we\u2019re driving additional synergies with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen. ", "In closing, we believe our strategies for long term are sound and should further differentiate us versus competition and create value for our stakeholders. When recapping the current state of our business, there are many indicators that give us confidence in our future. As Greg said, we\u2019ve been growing share of the competitive U.S. daily living and retail pharmacy businesses. And we continue on our Well Experience journey and we are focused on continuing this front end momentum and also focused on possibly impacting margin overtime fee and mix and promotional and supply chain efficiencies. ", "Our Pharmacy business is well positioned in patient segments such as acute needs, Part D customers and acute chronic conditions and we continue to drive real efficiencies in both our pharmacy operations and in procurement. ", "We also have a significant opportunity to participate in and influence the healthcare market more broadly, via our asset in healthcare professional breadth. Through our various healthcare partnerships and initiatives, we\u2019re in a path to do exactly that. ", "Now lastly, we continue to be very pleased with our Alliance Boots partnership and AmerisourceBergen relationship. On the Alliance Boots sides, their business remains resilient in a European environment that remain challenging. The continued strong cash flow and deleveraging focus has also been very positive. Our combined synergies have continued to track it behind of our estimates and we\u2019re learning from each other every day and our step to join operational and financial planning is going well. Our AmerisourceBergen relationship thus far has also met our expectations with the distribution in our joint synergy efforts progressing right on plan. We also continue to identify additional ways that all three partners can work together to create value and change the paradigm in various areas of our business. ", "In short, we believe we\u2019re just scratching the surface in what we can ultimately create as a global pharmacy lead health and wellbeing enterprise. But in my humble opinion we are off to a terrific start. ", "And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Rick. ", "Rick Hans", "", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "", "Thanks very much and good morning and thanks for all the details. I guess just a couple of quick follow up questions. The first would just be around the global procurement impact in timing. Greg, you talked about the number being better as far as synergies going up to 375 to 425. But you didn\u2019t necessarily update the billion dollars overall. Should we be thinking about that billion dollar number as like being more of a contributor to the overall 16 number?", "Greg Wasson ", "", "Yes. Good morning Lisa. We feel confident upping the number for this year to 375 to 425 based on what we\u2019re seeing. We still feel confident a billion dollars and aren\u2019t ready to make any comments on that. We -- longer term we still feel confident that there are opportunities that we are identifying but at this point in time we feel confident that we\u2019d get to that billion dollars in 16. ", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "And you made some comments about the Affordable Care Act. Yesterday there was some comments that perhaps now Florida is looking at expanding Medicaid. Can you just update us on anything you\u2019ve seeing thus far around the ACA volume and then maybe any expectations for an increase in the back half of the year?", "Greg Wasson ", "Yes. We saw that announcement and we think obviously as we\u2019ve said, as enrolment grows, it\u2019s going to be a positive for the businesses as you would expect with prescription business and people getting coverage they have not had coverage. Some of those maybe cash customers that we\u2019re getting prescriptions that may not be a complete new prescription customer but we think there will be an additive benefit to more and more people getting coverage. ", "Yes, it\u2019s still early to tell, as far as the number of people that are coming on board, I think there is some positive signs over the last month or so that more and more people are getting coverage. I may turn it over it over to Kermit. Kermit if you got any additional colours if you\u2019re seeing?", "Kermit Crawford", "Yes, I think, Lisa I think the other thing to add is that we continue to work with many of the new customers, new patients during the transition period. We\u2019ve announced that we will continue to do that through April. We\u2019re also working with many of our health plan partners on educating many of the new potential enrolees. So we think the bulk of the volume will continue to be in the open networks and as we see more and more of the open network business, we think that will be good for us.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "And so is it fair to say that you would expect maybe -- hopefully you'll see that in the back half, in the next couple of quarters in your fiscal year or do you think that\u2019s going to be more of a fiscal \u201915 event?", "Kermit Crawford", "I think as we\u2019ve seen a slow enrolment period, but I think we\u2019ll see that gradually increase over the next couple of quarters and into next year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks for the questions. I want to start on the gross margin trend. I know you guys mentioned that you expected negative generic comp experienced in the front half to ease as we move into the back half. And I understand you guys don\u2019t give specific guidance but, can you maybe just help us think about the components of the gross margin trend in the back half, maybe for instance relative to the year-over-year declines that we\u2019ve seen in 1Q and 2Q? Any sense you can give us on what we should be looking for on the year-over-year trend into the back half?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I mean, I would just say just there is a couple of factors, the big one obviously is the timing of new generic introductions and so we start to move in a phase for those comps now. Again, the exact date of these can never be perfectly predicted so you have in general the information that we have but that makes a very substantive difference. ", "Again, we\u2019re starting to cycle the front investments that we made that were quite substantial to get back to more of a normalized rebalancing mix and so over the next quarter or two we\u2019ll move into that cycling. And then even things like flu [I think too is] [ph] going to have some mix effect and so we\u2019ll start to both cycle that and get into more of a normalized period. So these things will kind of all come when then come, but directionally especially when you also look to stacks for compare, they tend to even out over time, and I think we\u2019re moving into that phase.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Great and then just going back to the synergies, I know originally you guys were calling for this to be a little bit less than what we saw last quarter clearly not the case, realized more synergies in 2Q than 1Q. And then looking at the full year even though you did increase it, it does look like the back half would actually be on track to produce less than what we saw in the front half, so just any more specifics or commentary you can give us around the drivers of synergies and maybe what\u2019s causing some of the cadence in this fiscal year at least?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I think we feel very good where we are but I would also say that for the people they are in the trenches working, these people like Jeff and John, these - some of the deals that we work, you never can predict exactly when they\u2019re going to hit and for what period they will accrue to, but separately I would say that every day we have multiple streams working very hard to identify new synergies to work - negotiate new synergies. And so again while we feel very good on the glide path and even a long term as Greg suggested these things are going to require hard work each and every quarter, every quarter going forward and we just don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves there.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "So then it\u2019s not something that\u2019s necessarily linear clearly based on the guidance that you guys put out for the back half?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s linear or not but I'll say they can be choppy along the way, because sometimes you get a step up for something that we do, but other times we identify a new source of synergies and start working there. It\u2019s just there is a lot to moving parts underneath the hood, but directionally we feel we have the right momentum towards our goal.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions, first on the SG&A spend, I mean, this is the second quarter where you\u2019ve grown SG&A at well below your 3.5 to 4.5 organic target. So if you can talk a little bit more in detail about the cost control, is this kind of like a new level going forward? And also how much of it is being driven by distribution efficiencies from the ABC relationships? And when does that normalize if it does?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, Ricky maybe I\u2019ll take the high level and then let Wade get in a little more detail. I think -- as I said, I think we\u2019re feeling good with what the stores are doing and efficiency that Mark and team have really driven through the stores. I think we\u2019ll continue to see the stores doing a nice job in balancing payroll according to volume. I think a lot of the corporate initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place regarding really looking at core initiatives and core programs and projects, we feel good that we\u2019re making a progress there and that should continue. I don\u2019t think frankly that you should be -- in fact a lot of efficiencies yet from the AmerisourceBergen transition although we will -- we do expect to see that going forward, but we\u2019re still in the process of transitioning the generic distribution from our distribution centres to theirs that\u2019s early on, so there is not a lot of that built in. We certainly do expect there would be opportunities going forward with it. Wade anything to add?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I think we\u2019re just aggressively attacking all costs, so we have had a couple of very, I think, strong quarters versus to what we had prior in our sustainable growth model. We\u2019ll continue to attack all costs and make sure that we focus all resources on the core strategies that will drive values. So I hesitate to lay into any kind of guidance on that, but as Greg said also that the big distribution benefit for us really comes at the end of this fiscal and into next fiscal, when we have all of our generic volume which is just smaller dollar piece about 80% of the unit volume fully consolidated in their systems. And I think that\u2019s also when they see the benefit too, as once we get the full integration of branded generics so that will be a next year event by and large.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "And what - if you can share with us, what percent of your generic volumes is now distributed via ABC?", "Wade Miquelon", "We haven\u2019t given that number, Ricky, although making good progress and we intend to be completed by the end of the fiscal year and we are on track to meet that date for sure. ", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then secondly on the tax rate, I know the tax rate in the quarter was below historical levels and Wade you touched upon that, but just to clarify, should we expect in the next quarter then, a higher tax to go up, or is there any change on how you account for the AB equity earnings, how you are accounting taxes for that?", "Wade Miquelon", "No, I think you can expect probably going forward a rate similar to what you saw in this quarter. It\u2019s again if I think it\u2019s really complex to kind of track the rate through this based upon our joint venture, their business and our business. But I think that you will see something markedly different from what you saw in this period.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wildermuth of Jefferies, your line is now open.", "Mark Wildermuth - Jefferies", "I wanted to get some insights on the Alliance Boots number. The reported income from Alliance Boots of 194 million was much higher than a lot of us were expecting. What was in that number? Was there anything unusual in that? And what do you think the core operating earnings growth for Alliance Boots is running at right now?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, the big thing in the number for IFRS purposes is the warrant income from ABC, and they have a lag, so it was actually gain in this period for them. And without the lag for us, the stock pulled back a little bit. It was a slight loss. But that was the big thing in the IFRS number, and again for our purposes, for GAAP we reversed that out. There is always some nuances back and forth. With respect to the overall business, I\u2019m not going to provide any kind of guidance on it going forward, but they are going to be reporting their numbers for the full-year in May. And so closing at the end of March, in the next week or two, so I think we\u2019ll be able to get a lot more color on their business probably. And that should probably be very helpful.", "Mark Wildermuth - Jefferies", "Okay, and the difference between that 194, that was in the reported numbers, and the 100 million that you had in the slides that were kind of tax affected. Is that just a ticking up that gain that you were talking about?", "Wade Miquelon", "It was primarily the warrants, I don\u2019t have the full rec, but that will be the main event. But we can get you the specific details on that.", "Mark Wildermuth - Jefferies", "Okay, and then, on the weather impact I guess there were some commentary on SG&A impact from removing snow and so forth, but what do you think the total weather impact was in the quarter?", "Wade Miquelon", "As Greg has said, our gross profit SG&A spread would have been basically equal, having not had it. So you can deduct about 20 couple million, 22 million for snow removal, 25 million and then a balance up to 60 million, so 35 million or so for gross profit impact. I mean that was built through historic closures where we had substantial store closure days and a little bit of traffic too.", "Mark Wildermuth - Jefferies", "Okay, so 22 million plus a 35 million.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, about that, say 60 in total.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland. Your line is now open.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", " ", "Good morning. Two things, first one, in terms of merchandising changes with Alex involved in with Beauty; I am curious if you can give us an update of where that is going in terms of an opportunity to further expand Beauty? What you are doing in terms of adding product, adding space, adding labor and then also the opportunity to expand brands to further drive share opportunities from that area?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, good morning Eric. I have got Alec here, so I'll lead off, and maybe I will let Alec weigh in a little bit, but you know as I said, we do think we have an opportunity to build bigger in Beauty. We feel good with our pilot rollout of the Boots brands in Arizona as I said. I think we've been in that since last fall. We're seeing some pretty good results, not only in with the brands specifically, but in the total category itself, which is encouraging. We intend as I said the rollout, in New York City next, we think that\u2019s a good metropolitan market to introduce the brand in a very special way. And we're going to do it right. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good there. I guess maybe I will -- Alec, I will let you kind of weigh in there with your thoughts.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Eric, thanks Greg. As Greg said, we are pleased with our progress so far. I have seen really positive response from some of our customers who are already shopping for Beauty in Walgreens and doing more shopping for Beauty in Walgreens particularly developing some categories. The bed is absolutely right, [indiscernible] it\u2019s not just the way the product, it's about the customer care that runs a product. And if we are not consistently both in Phoenix and in the 10 stores that we have upgraded in New York. So I might [indiscernible] if you want to have look out and you square example in New York City, Empire State Building in New York City. They are both on the ground and we'll have a 150 growing by the end of this fiscal year, and I am feeling good. That\u2019s certainly encouraging Walgreen shoppers to shop a bit more in Beauty already and it is not just Number 7, it\u2019s the Boots brands and beyond that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Just a follow on, as you think about the future opportunity to gain share perhaps never getting to where Boots is in the UK but moving in that direction, how important is the ability to gain access to brands that you don\u2019t have today national brands or prestige brands, how critical is that or how far can you get without those?", "Alex Gourlay", "We believe we can go quite a long way without them. Again the history in Boots, the premiums brands have only been in Boots for about 15-20 years and Boots have a very beauty business and mask and we call it [indiscernible] which is mid-market brands before then. So we are feeling pretty good about being able to expand with both premium brands and obviously as we go forward into the future we attract customers to think more about the experience of beauty instead of Walgreens, we believe that some of the premium brands may be interested in joining us in Walgreens but I strongly don\u2019t know at all, and we think we can get quite a long way on that road without the support of premium brands.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Thanks and then just one other if I could, the store closings is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, curious about the timing on that and thinking on that and then also if there is a larger opportunity to manage the SG&A or corporate opportunity within the business as you look at combining the organizations?", "Alex Gourlay", "Well, Eric, maybe I\u2019ll lead off and get Wade and even Mark Wagner if he wants to weigh in. Keep in mind that when we talked earlier in the year about our enterprise optimization program to really set ourselves up for the global the international entity we\u2019re about to become, we really want to make sure we\u2019re positioned to ready roll for that and we\u2019ve been doing some good stuff corporately as we talked about to position ourselves and then the next thing we want to look at some of the assets, we took a real hard look trade area by trade area at our store locations something to your point we really -- we\u2019ve done in the past but not with a real focused effort. Good news is frankly we\u2019ve got a lot of great locations out there and we've only really stumbled on about the 75 or so that we\u2019re talking about. A lot of that is due to -- some of that is due to us. We put in may be an extra store in the trade area and probably what we should have and we\u2019ve done step in so forth.", "But with that may be I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark a little bit as far as he went through -- he led that exercise to look at our store base and I think maybe he\u2019ll add a little colour.", "Mark Wagner", "Yes, hello Eric. Yes, we looked at really with two lenses, one with a strategic lens, one with a financial lens and kind of loosen the Prado philosophy 80% of the closings are really and some of our denser markets, some of our big growth states that where we were the biggest competitor in these trade areas. Some of the other challenges we had in the trade areas where they changed over time due to pattern changes, overpasses, underpasses you name it, that really made our store real estate sights not as competitive or out-positioned in most cases.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.", "Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. First one I want to talk about is free cash flow, looks like it\u2019s running about half of last year\u2019s levels and want to get your thoughts as we go forward and we get to next year when we\u2019re going to close the acquisition and what impact does this trend continues that will have?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I would just say that this year both operating and free cash flow look a little bit lumpy just because we\u2019ve got this major transition with AmerisourceBergen, the timing of the brand move, the timing of generic move, they are really selling us contract for how we think about inventory versus payables. But this is really going to work its way through the system because at the end of the year we anticipate that we\u2019ll have what will be the targeted levels for this type of transition. So I guess what I would just say is I don\u2019t think anything is unusual this year in operating or free cash versus prior year and that slight changes working capital slight changes and whatever.", "So as we look forward, I guess 2016 we still are very -- remain very confident Eric, in our combined cash goal of $8 billion in operating and very strong free cash flow. And again I think what you saw last quarter was very low but it\u2019s really just because of this transitional effect in this quarter was more normalized but the next couple of quarters we should be kind of even out for the entire year as we complete the full transition.", "Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research", "So we should think of free cash flow kind of similar to the levels we saw last year is that how you would -- it\u2019s lumpy but it\u2019s going to be about the same?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, well, I mean the real [indiscernible] it\u2019s just for us operating less the capital but it\u2019s not substantially different, you\u2019ve got our guidance for what we planned on capital spending and you could do the math yourselves there, so.", "Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research", "Then my second question goes, I think you guys said you had 628 well stores, I wonder if you can give us any and maybe you\u2019ve done this before, but any kind of as you convert stores to the Well Experience, what the sales list looks like, what\u2019s the profit list and then how many more are you expecting this year [indiscernible] and that would be great.", "Greg Wasson", "Scott we haven\u2019t really given out colour on actual performance. I can say that as we\u2019ve been working on this for the last three years, it\u2019s gone to crawl walk run and we want to make sure that the investment we\u2019re putting in, we\u2019re getting the right return. We feel pretty good. There is still some areas that we\u2019re tweaking to make sure that we can continue to put the pedal to the metal, one of the things we\u2019ve done is the good thing is, is we now have a pretty good idea of the various components with the Well Experience format and what\u2019s working, what still needs some work and the good thing is you will begin to see the various components within the Well Experience format show up throughout the chain in a much quicker way than we would have been if we just continued to roll-out the entire format or try to get the entire format right. So, bottom line, we feel good about it. There are still areas where we want to tweak and get the returns on that added content and product so forth, but there is lot of the areas that are modular that we can begin to roll-out throughout the chain. Alec you want to add any colour there?", "Alex Gourlay", "", "Yes, thanks Greg. The other thing I will say is that the success of the Balance Reward Card in terms of 180 million active customers and 100 million people signed up, has given us real-time data about how people are using our stores, and really that data is helping us to design as Greg has said even better assortments going forward. So, I think the design has been really appreciated by customers, the feedback in terms of the brand perception is good, in terms of moving on the brand perception to a more differentiated space than normal drugstore channel which exactly what the team is out to do a few years ago. And the data from the Balance Reward Card is now allowing us to build better assortments for our customers. So, I think we'll accelerate from this point based on that data and based on what the customers are telling us right now in terms of their perception of the Walgreens brand within it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Company", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. May be if I could just follow-up on that question Alec, in terms of the data for Balance Rewards, how much has that data been really analysed and how much is it already been acted upon or is this something you are still kind of calling the data and really kind of crunching it to really understand sort of the behaviour of your shoppers?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, I think it\u2019s a bit of all three. I mean I think some of it is really well understood and we're using already to simplify some of the things we're doing particularly in the promotional strategy and some of it we'll understand in terms of building assortments as said already. And I know from experience of being with us that there is a lot more we can do with this data over time but a strong team they are really a good team and are working closely with our association partners across in Alliance Boots and I think this will give us a lot of momentum going forward. So, I think all three to be honest for very good reasons.", "Greg Wasson", "", "I would weigh in on that as well, I think -- I would say we're really kind of in the infancy of the insights that we are beginning to gather from, having launched nearly a 180 million active members a year ago. So, there is a lot of excitement from the merchants let me tell you about the data and the insights are beginning to have.", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Company", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a question for Wade, if I look at the cash flow statement, am I correct, I think you didn\u2019t really repurchase any shares in the quarter? And how should we think about that maybe for the balance of the year? Thanks.", "Wade Miquelon", "", "No, we didn\u2019t repurchase any shares. I think as we have said before, our allocation policy was to get us through step two very strong balance sheet position prior to reconsidering any buybacks. We have been buying, as you could call, to see some AmerisourceBergen stock and the number at the end of the quarter was 1.5%, 1.6%. ", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Company", "Okay, great. And then maybe if I can just sneak one last question in, on the -- you touched on sort of the stores that are closing and so our net stores are what 55-75 for the year opening, how should we think about store expansions as we go forward? You might have touched on that, I am sorry if I missed it.", "Wade Miquelon", "", "We don\u2019t think that our kind of rate of annualized growth that we've talked is going to be different. Again in the grand scheme of things, these seven, six stores are less than 1% of our total and many of them have, circumstances have changed over many years. But on a go forward basis, we will see the same kind of cadence we've had had in the past few years.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I'd say one of the things that we have, we do feel good about with the opening of at a slower rate, although still plenty of New York store growth year-over-year, we are really finding some great locations and that\u2019s what we want to do. We want to A plus locations now and open at that same rate going forward. We still have several geographies out there that we can expand in, and fine great locations.", "Operator", "Thank you. I am showing we have time for few more analyst questions. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "", "Hey Greg. So, two things, how do you think about tobacco? How much of an opportunity is that near-term right as CVS exits, is it a liability long-term? And then to your partners HMOs, PBMs, customers, do they care whether you sell it or not?", "Greg Wasson", "", "Morning, John. Let me start with kind of where we're focused and what we're focused on is to help encourage our customers to make healthy choices and not only with just with cigarettes but with daily habits and that\u2019s just kind of our walk with Well and some of the things we're doing are designed to do. That includes helping people quit. And I think that CVS, as said, that two most important factors that help someone quit smoking as a healthcare professional as well as nicotine replacement therapy and some stats that maybe you may have or may not have but back in the 60s, 70s we're better than half of this population smoked today it's down to about 18%, it's been 18% for a period of time. Those folks 60 some percent of them want to quit, 45% last year tried to quit. We think we are well positioned to help folks change their behaviour who want to quit. So our pharmacists are geared up and we really want to begin to help change behaviour. So that\u2019s our area folks.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "So I mean it sounds like you are going to stick with it unless it\u2019s mandated like in San Fran, that you can\u2019t sell it.", "Greg Wasson", "Well, as I said we\u2019re going to help people change behaviour, we\u2019re going to help them quit and I don\u2019t think there is any one better than retail pharmacy where the pharmacists and smoking cessation products that can help people change your behaviour and help them quit.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "And then for Alex while we have him -- obviously Beauty Number 7, that\u2019s pretty obvious how that can help Walgreen. What are some of the less obvious things you can bring from Boots? Like one of the things that\u2019s always intrigued me is migrating Pink Friday to the U.S. What are some of the things you\u2019ve looked at that can be impactful to Walgreen U.S. that may have flown below the radar screen?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes John I think Pink Friday which as you know was a [indiscernible] in the UK, Walgreens already has a really seasonal business, and particularly it seemed a last minute I guess destination for many Americans and that\u2019s exactly what Boots does as well. So we think we can really join together and improve certainly the Beauty ranges in Walgreens. And surly through brings supports across both Boots and Walgreens by Kmart but even better for customers. So seasonal is definitely one area. And I think also the second point would be the fantastic Walgreens brand. At our Walgreens healthcare brand is the number one healthcare brand from a consumer healthcare point of view. And again working closely together to being new innovative products both to the U.S. and to the UK market where Boots is primarily based is another big opportunity in this relationship on the consumer and the front end.", "Greg Wasson", "John may be I\u2019ll add because Alex is humble, he won\u2019t say this. But I think one of the things that we\u2019re bringing as well and he is helping with is the understanding of how their Boots loyalty program was successful and help drive a lot of the success that they had moving into beauty and other areas within the UK, and I think the knowledge that we\u2019ll bring in with our 80 million active members now to continue to improve our loyalty program is going to be a big opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "", "Good morning guys and thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping we could maybe wrap up with two topics that have become more top of mind with investors recently. The first is around a longer term view of leverage at the company. You obviously historically have been operating with a lot of leverage at all. Alliance Boots has, right? And I think the question is as you go forward as a combined company generating a ton of free cash flow, would it make sense to operate possibly with a lot more leverage than where you are today to unlock cash through either share repo or additional deals. So your thought on that first would be helpful.", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, I guess a couple of things as obviously I think when you look at our business you need to look through to the leases and the lease is back on the overall balance sheet which is significant. We like where we are in investment grade and I think it\u2019s been important for us to stay investment grade, we\u2019re in that investment grade zone. We should be over time I think, we've decided over time as we go. But I guess what I would say yes we are, we do believe we\u2019ll generate a lot of free cash flow, have a lot of options. But at this point we\u2019re really focused on getting through to step two with the structure, with the ratings, with the overall metrics that we\u2019ve had, at that point I am sure that we\u2019ll look broadly in for instance all of our options as a company to say what\u2019s the best capital allocation process going forward, and where the best value creating ideas returning back to shareholders or is it investing back on the business. Glad to say it's a little bit premature to have that discussion right now.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "The second question which, the answer is going to be similar but, it\u2019s on the notion of tax inversion because there\u2019s been a lot of speculation amongst investors about the opportunity here. Could you maybe just talk about what the issues may be for a company like Walgreens and potentially doing something like this and whether it\u2019s something that you would be open to considering?", "Greg Wasson", "", "It\u2019s Greg, maybe I\u2019d start with just retreating what I said, I think not on last earnings call, the one before that we have no plans to do so to do so, to do an inversion or redomicile the company. I think what we are focused on frankly is spending the time with our Board and on diligent and so forth to make sure that we put our board and our shareholders into position to make the right decision on step two. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. But just to reiterate as I said on last call we have no plans to do an inversion.", "Operator", "Thank you. I am showing no further questions. At this time I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Mr. Rick Hans for any closing remarks.", "Rick Hans", "", "Folks, that was our final question, thank you for joining us today. As a reminder we will report March sales on April 3rd. And until then, thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to introduce your host for today's conference call Mr. Rick Hans, Divisional VP of IR. You may begin sir.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 conference call. Today, Greg Wasson, President and CEO; and Wade Miquelon, Executive Vice President, CFO and President International, will discuss the results for the quarter. Also joining us on the call, and available for questions are Kermit Crawford, President of Pharmacy; and Mark Wagner, President of Store Operations; and Alex Gourlay, President of Customer Experience and Daily Living.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and I would direct you to our website at investor.walgreens.com for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our call. Before we get to today\u2019s financial results, I\u2019d like to begin with a few comments on the proposed second step in our transaction with Alliance Boots.", "Our Management Team and Board are making significant progress evaluating the proposed transaction determining the timing and structure, the combined management team, additional synergy and cost reduction initiatives and potential changes to our future capital structure. We will be in a position to hold an investor call once key decisions on these major issues have been made, which is expect to occur by late July or early August.", "Now I\u2019ll turn to our third quarter financial results. Today I\u2019ll begin with a review of the quarter. Next I\u2019ll discuss the key factors affecting our financial performance, and finally I\u2019ll provide more detail on our strategies and overall progress and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed financial review.", "In the quarter, we continue to see improving top line growth with increased daily living sales and strong performance in both prescriptions filled and our pharmacy market share. For the quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, up 5.9% from $18.3 billion a year-ago. GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1 billion, up 3.5% from $991 million last year.", "Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 4.5$% from $1.2 billion in third quarter of 2013. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.75 in the third quarter compared to $0.65 last year; up 15.4%.Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.91, up 7.1% from $0.85 in the same quarter last year.", "Our results this quarter benefited from a lower GAAP effective income tax rate. The lower rate of 31.5% compared with 38.7% last year resulted from increased foreign income taxed at a lower rate, favorable audit settlements, certain nondeductible expenses last year and other discrete events.", "Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit dollars increased 4.2% or $218 million from a year-ago. SG&A dollars increased 4.3% or $189 million compared to a year-ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 2.6% or $139 million compared to a 5.3% increase in the same quarter last year. This difference primarily resulted from decline in pharmacy gross margin, which we will discuss in detail later in the call.", "On adjusted SG&A dollars increased by 2.9% or $121 million compared to the same quarter last year. We remain focused on cost disciplined to offset a negative effect to our gross profit dollar growth. We will be accelerating our optimization efforts, taking additional steps to lower our expenses company wide.", "I appointed a key member of my executive team to lead this effort. We\u2019ve been making tremendous progress in identifying opportunities when combined with additional synergies and cost reduction initiatives that are part of step two and the completion of the strategic transaction with Alliance Boots, we expect to drive sustainable efficiencies and value for the combined enterprise.", "In the quarter, we continue to focus on our three strategic growth drivers, create a well experience, advance the role of community pharmacy, and establish an efficient global platform. Today I will provide more detail on those strategies.", "Performance and our well experienced growth driver has continued to improve, giving us even greater confidence in the significant potential of our daily living business. Our front-end comp increased 2.2% in the third quarter. And when you look at the two-year stack, our performance is the best it\u2019s been in eight quarters. Average basket size grew 2.9% as customers consolidate -- continued to consolidate trips.", "In addition, front-end margin improved in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. To drive margins, gains, we improved our product mix with a strategy to advance our health and beauty categories. We are also delivering great efficiencies in our promotional investment with our Balance Rewards program.", "At the end of May, we had 81 million active Balance Rewards members, allowing us to reach more customers with our offers. We received solid response rates on our personalized point offers. We\u2019ve integrated our award winning Paperless Coupons into our program and have nearly 1.5 million people enrolled in our Balance Rewards for healthy choices program.", "Also in the quarter, while we continued our program to optimize our store footprint, we opened our converted 24 well experienced stores, reaching a total of 642 across the country. To further engage our beauty customers, we extended the reach of Boots brands. We launched Boots No7 and more than 300 stores across the chain primarily in our Phoenix and New York markets.", "In New York, one of the countries most important beauty markets, we currently have Boots brands and more than 125 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores with a goal of 183. From New York, we will begin our launch across the United States. As we prepare for that expansion, results were coming in from Phoenix, our most mature market for Boots No7 and its clear our new beauty experience is elevating our performance. Boots No7 is the number one skin care brand sold in all of our Phoenix stores and baskets with boots items are bigger than the average beauty basket.", "In addition, 80% of our beauty customers tell us their beauty experience is improving. We are not only seeing better performance in our stores No7, it\u2019s also the number one beauty brand on walgreens.com.", "Finally, our focus on extraordinary customer care is paying off. Our customer delight score increased 230 basis points this quarter and is at an all-time high for the Company. Pharmacy delight is also at its highest level ever, up 270 basis points this quarter over last year. This performance is a credit to our store leaders and our team members who are demonstrating their commitment to our customers with every transaction.", "In our Pharmacy and Health and Wellness business, our script comp was up 4.1% in the quarter. Our retail pharmacy market share increased to 19% from the quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year and we filled 218 million prescriptions, up 4.5% from the same period last year.", "To drive our performance, we\u2019ve been making deliberate strategic decisions to win with high value seniors through preferred relationships with Medicare part D plans by growing 90-day at retail and expanding vaccines and other preventative care services. These decisions continue to drive results in the quarter, contributing to strong top line growth. We saw solid growth in prescriptions filled for part D patients with an increase of 11.6% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year.", "Part D market share increased 60 basis points this May compared to the same month last year and overall 90-day volume was up 15%. Our 90-day retail product is competing effectively with mail giving customers a choice to receive their chronic medications at their pharmacy.", "As you know 90-day at retail is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day fills, but we believe this strategy will have a long-term positive impact on gross profit dollar and EBIT growth for our Pharmacy business as we grow our share of maintenance meds.", "Turning to headwinds faced in the industry, we\u2019ve seen an increase in reimbursement pressure as well as a shift from historical patterns of deflation in generic drug cost to inflation. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen cost increases on a subset of generic drugs and in some cases these increases have been significant. Both reimbursement pressure and generic inflation are having an adverse effect on margin.", "In addition, this quarter on a year-over-year basis, there was a slow down in generic introductions, although the impact continues to moderate as we move through the second half of the calendar year. To address the pressure on our gross margin, we\u2019re focused on our contracting strategy to account for increasing drug cost. We are aggressively working to increase efficiencies and providing high quality and cost effective pharmacy services that reduce total pharmacy costs.", "With our global procurement organization in Bern, Switzerland, we also are well positioned to offset the impact. Along with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, our three companies are the largest purchaser of pharmaceuticals worldwide. Together we\u2019re working closely and collaboratively with manufacturers to drive sustainable growth both here, in the U.S and in Europe.", "Our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots contributed $0.15 per diluted share to Walgreens third quarter 2014 adjusted results. Combined synergies for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 were approximately $367 million. We now expect to exceed our second year combined synergy target and are now estimating $400 million to $450 million in the second year of combined synergies.", "We estimate that accretion from Alliance Boots in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 will be an adjusted $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share. As I said at the top of the call, there are a number of opportunities we continue to work on as we move toward consideration by the Board of Directors of the second step of our strategic transaction with Alliance Boots.", "Stefano and I are pleased with our progress to realize our joint vision for exercising step two of our strategic transaction. We are working through complex issues and we\u2019re taking the appropriate time to come to the right resolutions for the combined enterprise.", "One final note, as a result of the many step two considerations and current business performance, the Company is withdrawing its fiscal year 2016 goals that were previously announced in 2012. The Company expects to provide a new set of goals and metrics for the proposed combined enterprise for fiscal 2016 and we will communicate those to you on our call, which we expect to hold in late July or early August.", "Let me speak directly to two of the prior goals regarding our adjusted operating income goal of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. On previous calls we noted we were tracking below the CAGR required to meet the goal. We now no longer expect to reach that goal on our combined synergy goals I noted earlier. We are tracking ahead of that goal and we expect to exceed the $1 billion amount by the end of fiscal 2016.", "As noted above, some of the opportunities we\u2019re pursuing are below the operating line, the income line on the income statement and decisions about those will be reflected in our new goals and metrics. Two years ago, we announced our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots, an opportunity to bring together two companies with iconic brands.", "We\u2019ve made tremendous progress over the past two years, bringing to life our vision for a global pharmacy led health and well-being enterprise that can address the needs of a challenging healthcare market, improve service delivery and health outcomes. With the addition of our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen, we\u2019re creating a truly powerful combination of retail and wholesale leaders that can better serve customers in the U.S and around the world.", "Now we\u2019re focused on making the decisions necessary for the combined enterprise in preparation for step two. We\u2019ve work to do; we\u2019re intent on getting that work done right for the benefit of our enterprise, our team members, customers and shareholders. We look forward to sharing our decisions with you later this summer.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Wade.", "Wade Miquelon", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I will take you through our quarterly results as well as update you on our Alliance Boots strategic partnership and our AmerisourceBergen relationship.", "As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.75 per diluted share based on nearly 968 million shares. GAAP EPS walks to an adjusted EPS of $0.91 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. A LIFO provision of $0.03, acquisition related items were $0.13 per share consisting of $0.06 of acquisition related amortization costs, $0.01 of acquisition related cost and $0.06 from Alliance Boots related tax.", "Finally, the special items had no net impact due to the positive $0.07 impact of the warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens and Alliance Boots with the Alliance Boots impact reported on a three month lag basis, offset by the negative $0.07 impact of store closures and other asset optimization costs.", "Let me now review our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 6.3%. Comp front-end sales increased 2.2% and total comp store sales increased 4.8%. Comp prescriptions filled increased 4.1% versus a script comp of 7.1% in the year-ago period.", "The components of the 2.2% front-end comp traffic which decreased by 0.7% and basket size which increased by 2.9%. We are pleased with the trends in the one and two year stack comps over the past few quarters.", "Moving to comp store script numbers, our retail scripts were up 4.1%. This performance reflects the fundamentals of our underlying business, the ongoing progress and winning new Medicare Part D customers and increase of 90-day at retail scripts and return of Express Scripts customers. The two-year stack on script comp has improved dramatically in the last two years.", "With respect to margin, our adjusted gross margin reflecting FIFO inventory was 28.3% in the current quarter compared to 29.2% last year, a 90 basis point decline. The primary drivers of the pharmacy margin decrease were increasing third-party reimbursement pressure, particularly due to a few contract step downs, increases in Medicare Part D mix including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail, fewer generic drug introductions versus the year-ago and pronounced generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs as well as the mix from specialty drugs.", "Purchasing synergies in the pharmacy and front-end did partially offset this margin pressure. Front-end margin increased in the quarter, benefiting from mix and promotional adjustments, and we still expect the rate of generic drug introductions to increase in the fourth quarter to the point that it should not be a drag on margin year-over-year. On net, we expect the negative factors impacting pharmacy margin will more than offset generic introductions and front-end margin benefit next quarter on a year-over-year basis.", "Taking a look at our adjusted gross margin trends, this quarter\u2019s 90 basis point decrease versus a 50 basis point increase a year-ago. Based on our strategies and plans, we do expect the front-end margin to continue to improve over the long-term. As we demonstrated and discussed in the last few quarters, this graph illustrate the impact of new generic drug introductions had on our monthly prescription sales comps.", "The highlighted quarters illustrate the number of new generic drug introductions remain slower than a year-ago. And you can see that the generic impact on a comp prescription sales was about a negative 4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 versus a generic impact of negative 1.4% in the most recent quarter.", "In our experience, the margin change resulted from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lagged to the impact of generic sales changes. And that is the strongest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after the generic impact on prescription sales is the most deflationary.", "The tough year-over-year generic impact margin comparison has continued to dissipate throughout fiscal year 2014 and expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2014, given the increase in generic impact on pharmacy sales comps expected in that period. This trend however continues to be negatively impacted by the delay of a few large volume drugs like generic forms of Nexium and Diovan.", "Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 11 quarters on a GAAP basis. And the next slide shows this trend on adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased to 2.6% versus 5.3% in the year-ago period. Gross profit dollar growth was positively impacted by the comps in both the pharmacy and the front-end and further helped by a margin expansion on the front-end.", "On the pharmacy side, gross profit dollar growth was negatively impacted by the same issues impacting pharmacy margin, which I described a moment ago. But despite these headwinds and the benefit of synergies, adjusted gross profit dollars grew faster than the average 1% growth rate in the first half of the year.", "For the quarter, GAAP SG&A dollar growth was 4.3%. We then deduct 2.3% per store closures and other optimization costs and 0.1% for Walgreens amortization cost, and add back 0.3 percentage point for the acquisition related cost and 0.7% for the DEA legal settlement. This walk yields an adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 2.9% for the quarter.", "Shown here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past 11 quarters on a GAAP basis and the follow on slide shows a similar trend on an adjusted basis. The adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 2.9% year-over-year increase versus the 4.5% increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.", "Keep in mind that last year\u2019s fourth quarter GAAP and adjusted net earnings include a $0.03 per diluted share in net gains from certain litigation matters. This net litigation gain reduced SG&A dollar growth by 0.9% last year and will be a factor in the SG&A dollar growth comparison year-over-year in the fourth quarter.", "This next chart illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.", "Now let\u2019s review the two-year stacked trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends increased versus a year-ago by 510 basis points. With a two-year stack of 7.4% growth in the third quarter of 2014, up from 2.3% last year. The two-year stack from a year-ago included a period when we were out of Express Scripts network in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.", "SG&A grew at a negative 2.2% in that period as we responded to the lower volumes in the pharmacy. Likewise a two-year stack SG&A dollar growth will be difficult to lap for the next two quarters is shown by the fourth quarter two-year stack of 0.5% and the first quarter two-year stack of 2.9%.", "Turning to a few other components of our income statement, this quarter included LIFO provision of $41 million versus a provision or charge of $120 million a year-ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the quarter was 2.25%, down from 3.5% a year-ago. Net interest expense for the quarter was $35 million versus $50 million from a year-ago.", "We expect interest expense of approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding were 968 million shares versus 959 million shares last year. And the change is primarily due to the impact of a higher stock price on a number of in the money options which are counted in diluted shares.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect diluted share count of approximately 968 million shares subject to changes in the current share price. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.5% versus 38.7% last year. And the difference is primarily attributable to additional foreign income tax taxed at a lower rate and net benefit per changes in uncertain tax provisions as well as a lower permanent difference between book and tax income.", "For the fourth quarter, we estimate our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 36%, and we expect a similar increase in our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.", "Accounts receivable increased by 25.3% primarily due to higher vendor funding receivables from the Bern JV and AmerisourceBergen for brand and generic rebates along with the higher receivables generated by higher third-party pharmacy sales. Accounts payable decreased 6.5% and LIFO inventories decreased 6.4% in conjunction with our new agreement in terms of the AmerisourceBergen as more of the generic pharmacy distribution transitions to them. Overall, net working capital increased by 9.8% versus a year-ago.", "During the second quarter we generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations versus $1.4 billion in the year-ago period. And free cash flow in the quarter was $1 billion versus $1.1 billion a year-ago.", "The next slide shows our correlated accretion from Alliance Boots which was $0.15 per share for the quarter versus our forecast of $0.13 to $0.14 per share with the out performance primarily related to incremental procurement synergies. You can find a more detailed walk included in the appendix to this presentation on our Investor Relations Web site.", "Combined net synergies for the quarter totaled $131 million and for the first three quarters of the year totaled $367 million. And as Greg noted, because we\u2019re running ahead of our previous estimate of $375 million to $425 million of combined synergies for the year, we\u2019re raising the estimated to $400 million to $450 million.", "Looking forward, we estimate the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 to be $0.67 per share based on our current estimate of IFRS to GAAP conversion and foreign exchange rates versus $0.08 in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted accretion is expected to be slightly lower than the year-ago period for Alliance Boots primarily driven by the timing of recognition of certain tax matters.", "Additionally, we\u2019re assessing whether the fair value of one of the Alliance Boots wholesale reporting units is below its current value for U.S GAAP purposes. Our share of the goodwill from this reporting unit is approximately $195 million. We plan to finalize this assessment prior to filing our Form 10-Q, any impact will be reflected in our fourth quarter financial statements and we\u2019d expect to exclude any impact from adjusted earnings.", "Since I usually end with commentary on the fiscal year 2016 goals, let me reiterate the comments made in the press release and by Greg regarding these goals. As a result of the many step two considerations in current business performance, we\u2019re withdrawing the fiscal year 2016 goals that were previously announced in 2012.", "As Greg mentioned, we\u2019re evaluating the proposed transaction including the potential timing and structure and combine management team, continued synergy and cost reduction initiatives and potential changes to our future capital structure, all through the lens of what is in the best interest of our shareholders long-term.", "Once key decisions have been made on the above matters, Walgreens anticipate to being in a position to hold an Investor Call, which is expected to occur by late July or early August. Many of the areas under consideration are interdependent and so we believe that the prudent course is to share the scope of our decisions and related financial objectives and metrics together all the time.", "In summary, our strategies remain sound in the fundamentals of our business and particularly with respect to top line growth has continued to strengthen. While we have gross profit reimbursement pressure in the traditional pharmacy as mentioned, we also have significant opportunities to drive additional cost efficiency and also turn the front-end of our business into a very meaningful profit pillar.", "Our Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen partnerships also continue to go well and we\u2019re beginning to move beyond the cost only synergy phase to one where we\u2019re starting to share and exploit organizational capabilities to strengthen our core business and find new labors to create value for shareholders.", "With respect to our merger with Alliance Boots, we realize that our investors have been patiently awaiting additional information about step 2. I can assure you that we have been using the time to evaluate all aspects of the transaction with the best long-term interests of our company and shareholders in mind. And now with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to, Rick.", "Rick Hans", "Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.", "George Hill - Deutsche Bank", "I appreciate you taking the question. I guess maybe we will start first with the 2016 guidance. It seems like that you guys aren't going to come in in-line with the original expected range. But I don't think most investors had kind of expected you to hit the numbers given current business performance. Is there any color you can give us with respect to how far off that range you think you are?", "Greg Wasson", "George, Greg, so yes I think as we had said we\u2019re in the last couple of quarters we weren\u2019t tracking on the CAGR that we required to hit that adjusted 30\u2019s number and certainly with our current performance in some of the lines we talked about on the call that\u2019s impacting pharmacy, we didn\u2019t think that it was achievable. Now that, that meeting was, we\u2019re still not working on a whole host of things to try to continue to drive value. I think the main point, and I\u2019ll let Wade kind of take it from there as a fact that, four to six weeks we do have a lot of moving parts. We are going to be looking at different goals of metrics both above that line and below the line and we want to really get focused on those. So, Wade you want to add a little color?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I think that\u2019s right. I think we\u2019re still aggressively driving all the [ph] [above] opportunities, but as Greg said we have opportunities below the line as well in terms of how we think about structure or cap structure, refinancing in the like and so we\u2019re making sure at this point in time that we look at every thing kind of interdependently as a web of choices and we maximize value as best we can.", "George Hill - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, that's helpful. And then Wade, maybe a quick follow-up. I recognize that you guys are planning to do a call I guess in a little over a month from this point now. Is there any more color you can give us on what the puts and takes the -- kind of the company is considering as it evaluates Step 2?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I think both Greg and I kind of listed them, but I would say everything, anything that can create value so we\u2019re looking at apart from again kind of the organizational operational structure, we\u2019re looking at more to the ideal cost structure moving forward. We\u2019re looking at what's the ideal way to structure the transaction from a legal point of view. We\u2019re looking at what's the best balance of the cap structures we think about the amount of cash this company can generate in a combined form. We\u2019re looking at again the best way to refinance the transaction as we move forward. So, I would say that everything or anything what related to the big measures and again I think we\u2019re going to make sure that we land down in a place that\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders long-term.", "Greg Wasson", "And George I would add, and I think the main point is all those that Wade just rattled are interdependent, and therefore we want to make sure that we thought through them all and that\u2019s the reason we thought kind of late July we\u2019d just have a lot more visibility on how all those connect and drive value together.", "George Hill - Deutsche Bank", "That\u2019s very helpful. And then I\u2019ll ask one quickly and I\u2019ll drop off. In the press release you highlighted a focused -- increased focus on internal cost and reducing internal costs. Is there anyway to ballpark that opportunity for us, I guess kind of as we think about the next 12 to 18 months?", "Greg Wasson", "Well we\u2019re working on accelerating up the optimization efforts across the entire organization. George we\u2019ve actually identified and actually realized a lot of opportunity. Current the challenges unfortunately some of the pressure we\u2019ve seen on pharmacy margin has eaten some of that up, that\u2019s the reason I have elected a key executive begin to look for and identify new opportunities. The good news is, is we\u2019re finding opportunities. We\u2019re now in the process of trying to figure out how to get at it. What are the plans, the processes, several or some of those maybe require some restructuring or not. So we\u2019re in the process of doing that. The other thing is that, we\u2019ve been four to six weeks away from the real work that Wade and team are doing around the combined merger. We definitely, we see to reduce cost as the entity comes together. So, again we want to kind of put all that together and come to you with as much as we possibly can in that call that\u2019s coming up in four to six weeks.", "George Hill - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. We\u2019ll wait for that. Thanks guys.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.", "Greg Wasson", "Hi, John.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "Greg, I guess looking at the big picture, when you think about the US pharmacy or drug retail business, you and all your peers, do you think is that business not going to be as profitable going forward as maybe you thought because of reimbursement pressure, government involvement, etc.? Do you think it's a secular issue? And then if that's true or remotely true, the things you think about on the cost side, are they really more strategic i.e. supply chain, what do we need to do with that long term in how we staff our stores? Is it really very secular and strategic or you think, no, it's just a period we are going through and it requires more tactical stuff?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, John on the first part, no, I don\u2019t necessarily think that we should assume that the US business cannot continue to grow on profitability. I think the work that Alex and Mark and team are doing on the front end of the business, we think we have -- we think we actually have tremendous opportunity to grow EBIT and operating margin on the front end of the business. We are beginning to getting more confidence in just that, and I think that is obviously going to help us with the overall business. I think in the pharmacy business the good thing is, is that we\u2019re growing top line for the first time consistently in a long time with some of those strategic decisions I\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019re absolutely winning in a Part D space. We\u2019re growing 90 day customers and so forth. We do have obviously the pharmacy margin pressure that we talked about. But I think Kermit and team and he can maybe allude a little bit about how we think will go at that. We think we -- we think with our contracting strategy going forward, with the generic inflation that we\u2019re seeing versus historical deflation we're going to start taking that in consideration in our contracting. He\u2019s going at cost of fill reduction with a vengeance and I think with Bern, and Jeff Berkowitz and John out in Bern, we\u2019re positioned better than anyone to be able to get at comp. As far as the cost opportunities, I think there\u2019s a little of both. I think that there\u2019s opportunity to get at cost to your point that\u2019s more maybe cyclical, but I think structurally we\u2019re going after -- we\u2019re going after the business from a structural point of view, everything from supply chain, everything from how we supervise and manage stores, everything from looking at our store footprint as we never have in the past and as we indicated on the last call. So we\u2019re really taking a step back and looking at the entire enterprise from a structural perspective.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "And is there, what's going on in Bern, how much opportunity is there to accelerate those efforts to offset the margin pressure you\u2019re seeing today? Is there enough flexibility to do that or not really to play around with that?", "Greg Wasson", "I think there\u2019s opportunity. Yes, I think Jeff and team have their pedal on the metal and their foot on the accelerator as far as trying to find to deliver additional opportunities. And yes, I\u2019m optimistic that there\u2019s additional opportunity in Bern.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay. Thank you.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meredith Adler with Barclays.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Good morning, this is Meredith Adler and I\u2019ve got questions from Eric Percher as well. I guess I would like to start by asking about talking with payers about the fact that you have generic inflation. How much work do you have to do to change the terms of the contracts? I mean if it was branded drugs, I think the inflation would be dealt with automatically but not so with generics. What kind of discussions are you having and how hard do you think it will be to get this adjusted?", "Wade Miquelon", "Well, I\u2019d say that it's a fairly complex topic, but there\u2019s lots of different levers. One is, I think that we\u2019re going to be -- we\u2019re not going to be very tolerant of long-term partnership with people that are opportunistic. I think number two is, we do have contracts which over time need to reflect the market, but then there\u2019s also indexes that those contracts are based on and some of those are sometimes maybe late in reflecting the realities of the market place, but over time we believe that those will catch up as well and therefore that will flow through. So, there are many different levers to go at it and we\u2019re working all of them. But I do think that it will roll through as we go through. So, I don\u2019t know Kermit, if you want to comment on it.", "Kermit Crawford", "Yes, Meredith maybe I\u2019d add to that, that sort of this past year we have seen a shift from historical patterns of deflation in the generic drug cost which we have planned for into one that is inflation and it is negatively impacting our margin. But I wouldn\u2019t say it's all around the drug inflation. I mean we\u2019ve certainly had some increase in our third party reimbursement pressures. We have had fewer brand-to-generic drug conversions compared to a year ago. And so as we think about our contracting strategy it certainly will account for these increases in the drug cost. But there are other things we\u2019re doing as well. Greg had mentioned we\u2019re aggressively looking at our cost of fill around improving efficiencies in our cost of fill sometimes like technology where our customers are refilling their prescriptions through digital and mobile technology, through automation that is making us more efficient in selling prescriptions, through centralization that is reducing labor in the stores but as the same time increasing our customer service level. And I also do believe that our joint venture with Alliance Boots, we\u2019re well positioned to provide some offset to this increase in drug pricing. So, I think over time you\u2019ll see the market adjust through market efficiencies, through supply and demand.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "And then, I guess I have a question, I mean I would have said that some of these pressures have been there for a while. Was there\u2019s something in particular that really made you feel that you needed to start addressing both aspects of cost structure, the way you fill scripts and becoming more efficient. Is there something particular that drove that now?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, Meredith as I would say, I am three-bucket for a person. I would say that we have, bucket one, we have made strategic decisions that I believe are absolutely the right thing for the company to do long-term which is to grow our share of high value senior patients with preferred positions already planned, convert 30 day supply of the chronic medications to 90 days, those, that\u2019s helping us win share, but it's also impacting margin as those preferred positions have a little more aggressive rates with them and obviously 90 day supplies a little more -- have little less margin of 30 day fill. So bucket two would be there are reimbursement pressures that are on going step down to some of the contracts year-over-year, but there\u2019s also consolidation going on in the industry and there\u2019s been some signification step downs in consolidation. And third would be in fact as Kermit alluded to, we are seeing inflation versus deflation in some of those contracts we\u2019ll have to make up for. So I think with that all those together, as I said we\u2019ve got to get at one trying to make sure that we account for that both in our purchasing of Bern, our contracting with payers, but the same time get after a cost structure to offset. But I do think the opportunity for us to continue to grow share and win in the senior market is encouraging because we\u2019re starting to see real growth.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then I guess just a final question on expenses. How, the -- some of what you sounded like you\u2019re going to do is going to be taking cost out of the operations and how you run the stores, and I\u2019d assume some of it is just more looking at the overhead structure. How much opportunity do you think there is in either place to lower -- generally lower cost?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, I think we still have opportunity in both, and again I think it's looking at how we support stores, the businesses we have, the projects we have, the way we run projects, so forth in corporate. So all of the above we have opportunity. I don\u2019t know Wade if you want to add anything?", "Wade Miquelon", "No, I think that the way we\u2019re going at it is to really look closely across the major processes that drive cost versus in silos or in small buckets and I think that I guess one of the examples currently it's just the entire cost of fill process and how we think about in 90 day and how we think about ePrescribe and how we think about working with payers differently to drive really radical improvements in those processes and therefore cost. So I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in both, but I think that it's looking at it more systemically going after the big prices, the way we\u2019re going to get the bit cost out, Kermit.", "Kermit Crawford", "Mark, Alex anybody want to add. Mark.", "Mark Wagner", "Yes, Meredith this is Mark. I think we -- part of like looking at the cost structure was what I talked about on the last quarter call was the store optimization and shutting down some of the unprofitable stores or stores that weren\u2019t really strategically positioned. But there\u2019s a lot of opportunity dealing with any operation of the store in terms of one, making the right investments in the stores in terms of labor, but then pulling out where it doesn\u2019t make sense. I think there\u2019s other ways to manage the cost that\u2019s on a property side that the team is taking a look at and have really engineered through the stuff, through the last six months into the stores. I think that there is always opportunity to reexamine the cost structure and to pull out what's not necessary or to reestablish what really adds value and not.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. I wish you guys luck.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks, Meredith.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "Yes, hi good morning and thank you for taking my question. Greg, there's a lot of discussion around inversions especially in the healthcare world. In couple of times on this call both you and Wade highlighted the below-the-line benefits, so can you just give us a sense of what kind of like is your most updated perspective on the prospect of inversion?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, Ricky I think as I said we\u2019re certainly analyzing all the moving parts that will lead us to certainly our decision on the timing the structure of step 2 and so it's difficult to kind of break those apart and talk more of a piecemeal. I'll say as we had said that we\u2019re looking at all and everything. We\u2019re looking at everything from what the timing, best timing would be, what the capital structure should be, what our tax structure or what the structure could do to as far as our effective tax rate. So, and that\u2019s complex stuff I guess is what I would say Ricky as we work through this. We are working around the clock to try to understand all the above so that we\u2019re able to make the right decision for the company. And again that\u2019s why we need a little more time to be able to bring all this together. But I would say that we\u2019re looking at everything. It is complex and it's all interdependent and that\u2019s why we want to come forth with a call where we can give as much as we possibly can at late July early August.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then I mean obviously the -- on the expense side and kind of like the margins, trends have been sluggish for some time now. I guess the question is, have you kind of like not been as, I would say proactive about kind of like, and I know you have done some but maybe you have not been as proactive as you could about managing the margin, because you are kind of like looking now at the combination and looking at things and doing holistic, it's kind of like trying to understand what could have been done already versus kind of like the opportunity going forward.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, Ricky I\u2019ll start off maybe my peers can weigh in. I would say that historically we\u2019ve done I think an admirable job on controlling on SG&A into your stack. Now with that said, we need to do more. And I also think that frankly we have cut a lot in the last six months to a year unfortunately some of that\u2019s got absorbed in the increased pharmacy margin pressure that we\u2019ve seen. With that said, we\u2019re continuing to identify additional opportunity. So, I wouldn\u2019t want you to read into the fact that we have not been getting after it. Now with that said, we also think that as we look at the current Walgreen business and opportunities in addition with the merger of the two that there are going to be even greater opportunities in different ways of looking at that. So, we\u2019re absolutely focused on the core business. We have made significant reductions, some of that\u2019s been absorbed as I said because the pressure of the margin we\u2019re identifying additional opportunities and we\u2019re going to combine those with every other opportunities we have at Step 2.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And one final one because you did mention the re-pricing and then to Meredith -- just to follow-up on Meredith's question, can you remind us when is your contract with Express Scripts is up for renewal?", "Greg Wasson", "We don\u2019t give that out. They were both to multi-year contract Ricky, but we don\u2019t -- and the reason is, for competitive reasons we don\u2019t -- obviously we don\u2019t want to be disadvantaged.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks, Ricky.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes, that color on the complex issue, I think it\u2019s definitely helpful for people. So, I will just leave that alone. But I guess, Greg, since you mentioned you are a three-bucket guy, I guess just a quick three-bucket question for you on the gross margins. Since you did mention the pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the generic price inflation and fewer launches, just curious which of those buckets had the biggest impact in the quarter? And then also just to be clear, did the generic price inflation in particular did that definitely increase in the May quarter specifically versus the trends you saw back in the February quarter? So, I definitely want to hone in on that generic price inflation specifically.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes. Thanks Steve for putting in three buckets for me. Yes, I think and I\u2019ll let Kermit maybe weigh in. I think certainly generic inflation kind of runs through a lot of this, and meaning that it shows up in the contracts obviously we\u2019re -- certainly we were thinking about the deflation and now seeing some inflation. We\u2019re also just -- obviously just playing cogs. We\u2019re certainly doing everything we can do at Bern to offset that. But I think in the order of magnitude I think probably generic inflation is specifically more -- probably more important because it was -- we didn\u2019t quite anticipate it. A lot of the other strategic decisions we certainly anticipated. We know exactly what our contract arrangements with some of the commercial plans are. We know what our Part D preferred positions cost this as far as gross margin. This was really kind of snuck up I think on the industry and us, and now I do think as I said I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t think of anyone that\u2019s better positioned than us to offset this because of what we\u2019re doing at Bern. But I would say inflation. Kermit, you want to add.", "Kermit Crawford", "Steve, I would add that generic inflation was higher than we expected compared to the normal deflation that we planned for and we saw the full impact of that in the third quarter versus the second quarter. But I\u2019d also add our growing 90 day share and our market share of Medicare Part D. I mean both of those as Greg mentioned earlier we are growing market share. Both of those margins have been hurt in the near term. Because of that and the expectation in both 90 day and in our mix of the Medicare Part D is greater than we had anticipated this quarter. So, I think when you look at a combination of the impact of our reimbursement pressure we\u2019ve not been able to fully offset that due to a lack of new generics as well as the generic inflation versus deflation.", "Steven Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, got it. Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.", "David Larsen - Leerink Swann & Company", "Hi. With respect to the reimbursement pressure, aren't the generic rates typically set at a max price, and aren't those fixed so that the pressure is really the cost of the generic at the higher inflated rate and the difference between that and the fixed mac price or do those prices actually shift around or are they fixed? Thanks.", "Greg Wasson", "So, every contract is different. But you\u2019re right, it's kind of a general abstraction that\u2019s more or less true, but the thing is that I guess the key thing I alluded to earlier is that the indexes that those are based on don\u2019t always immediately reflect the changes in that inflation, and so that\u2019s the disconnect. But again I think we\u2019re working this from many different angles.", "David Larsen - Leerink Swann & Company", "Okay, great. And then, how were volumes relative to your own expectations? Did you see any flow from newly enrolled members through the public exchanges?", "Greg Wasson", "David, it's still very early to tail around ACA. I mean obviously publicly they have announced 8 million people have joined the ACA. We certainly feel like we\u2019re getting our share of that 8 million people, but certainly some of those folks were former cash paying customers that are now in the exchange. They were former customers at other forms of coverage that are now in the exchange. So, I think it's still early on around ACA where we\u2019re seeing growth in our core business. I mean Wade talked about gaining back customers from our ESI customers. But primarily when we look at this business our core business Med D 90-day return of ESI, low ACA is all growing our underlying business.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I guess I just would say across the board both in the front end and the pharmacy I think we\u2019ve got real growth momentum. And I think what's also encouraging is that our customer satisfaction metrics continue to strengthen. That\u2019s very fundamental and important for the long-term.", "David Larsen - Leerink Swann & Company", "Great. And then just one more quick one; any thoughts around specialty, is that a positive driver or longer term and any impact from Hep-C? Thanks.", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, it's certainly a positive driver long-term. David, as you know it does impact the margin. Wade mentioned earlier in our speech and, but we\u2019re seeing positive growth in our specialty business.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think one of the things David that we\u2019re excited about and again I think it's the work that Jeff Berkowitz and team in Bern are doing combined with Mike Ellis and Kermit\u2019s group that\u2019s running our specialty group there with a central and retail model. We\u2019re gaining access to limited distribution drugs. In fact, I think we\u2019ve gained access to every one of the last 14 or 15 launches of limited distribution drugs. I think that\u2019s reflective of the fact the good work that Jeff and team are doing with our pharma partners who are looking for special services as well as what Kermit and team are doing with the services we provide both centrally and at retail. So to me that\u2019s a solid proof of point that we are making progress and winning in specialty space.", "David Larsen - Leerink Swann & Company", "Thanks very much.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Not to keep going back to this topic, but just on the gross profit margin in the quarter, I guess what the concern is in the last couple of quarters is you guys are pacing very nicely on the procurement synergies. If I look at this quarter it looks like $89 million to Walgreen\u2019s. But if I back that out assuming most of that is clearly from purchasing the gross margin rate looked like it was somewhere in the 27% to 28% range, clearly below where I think the company has been historically. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of context relative to history of where these pressures are and is it something that is more transient in such that as we move past them we will start to really realize the benefit of the procurement synergies?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I\u2019ll just take it. I mean look, there are some conscious choices we made as Greg said. So for example, driving 90 day and also being aggressive about Part D, and I think those are the kind of opportunities though based upon how they are set up structurally and the volume over time that we can cost optimize on the other side to make sure that it's beneficial and accretive. But that\u2019s a conscious choice. I think there\u2019s things that we will cycle. So for example as I talked about just the pace of new generics and the timing of that and we\u2019ve been very explicit with that, but I do think there\u2019s just and there are some new things. And we also have contractual step downs but of course there\u2019s things like brand inflation and generics and whatever that compensate. I think the real thing that\u2019s probably different is what we\u2019ve seen in the inflation generics and how we handle that. But at the end of the day I guess what I would say and as an aggregate we\u2019re focused on gross dollar -- gross profit dollar growth. And again both those choices are what we can control, and then what in the short-term we can\u2019t. But over the long-term we have to address. That\u2019s really I think the focus and in terms of how we drive the business.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "So I guess just to be clear, that you wouldn't characterize any of these pressures as some kind of structural change in the business that you didn't contemplate say a year and a half, two years ago when you embarked on the AB transaction?", "Wade Miquelon", "I think the thing that -- I think Greg said that the thing that probably wasn\u2019t fully anticipated probably was just what we\u2019ve seen in some inflation on drugs, and it's a fairly narrow subset but some pretty hefty increases. And those contracts historically have been under the assumption that there is net deflation. But like I said I think there\u2019s many ways that we can attack this, and I can assure you that we\u2019re going after it from all angles. And I do think though that again I think that if we can drive market share growth, if we can drive better customer satisfaction, if we can optimize our cost accordingly, and if we can tack this issue on all fronts I think we\u2019re as well positioned as anybody to be successful.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And I guess just my follow-up changing subjects a bit, just around ABC obviously now being part of the purchasing platform, it sounds like you\u2019re getting the incremental benefit from their volume. Are you looking at opportunities of bringing any of other companies into the joint venture to further enhance that scale? Are there ongoing conversations that you could highlight in the marketplace?", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes, I think certainly right now we\u2019re focused on maximize and optimize, I mean the synergies that we can achieve through the three of us with AB and ABC, and I think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity there to continue to realize before we\u2019d begin to really discuss maybe other partners.", "Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. All right. Thanks.", "Wade Miquelon", "Yes. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much and good morning. Greg, I heard you made a comment around regaining or Wade made the comment around regaining some scripts for Express Scripts. And you talked about 90 day as well on the growth of that. Are you seeing the scripts that you are regaining are through the Smart90 Program? Can you maybe just update us on how that program has gone thus far with Express Scripts?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start and let Kermit jump in. When I\u2019m talking about the growth in 90 day, Lisa it's 90 day in general across the entire market place which excites me because I think as I said we launched it, we realized it was going to impact margin because of the fills, but at the same time we have seen male level off, we have seen customers who want to get 90 day supplies. There are few many pharmacists that continue to grow, so therefore I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do for the consumer. Smart90 is a subset of that, and I do think we have been working with Express Scripts customer-by-customer somewhat unique. Those that are looking for a Smart90 solution is, the good thing is Express Scripts has an opportunity to present that. And Kermit, I think we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with that.", "Kermit Crawford", "When you compare to that, that Smart90 is just hitting the market now and right now it wouldn\u2019t be a significant contributor to our overall 90 day retail. I mean, a lot of the 90 day retail has been driven by the increase in market share of our preferred networks under Medicare Part D.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. And I know you have already talked a lot about the reimbursement buckets, etc. and around generics, but the one thing that I am still a little bit confused about is just you should be one of the largest global generic purchasers. Is it that the timing of Bern hasn't kicked in yet? Because I am just, if we go back and we look at Rite Aid last week, they talked about the fact that their relationship with Tussin hasn't kicked in yet and therefore that's why they\u2019re feeling this pressure. Given the fact that you\u2019re already starting to see some of the synergies I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s happening around procurement and the timing aspect of how you are buying from Bern?", "Greg Wasson", "Yes. Lisa, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s been delayed. I think Bern, we\u2019re pleased with and we\u2019re out of the gates pretty quickly and on track. I think it\u2019s a subset of molecules that have kind of popped up in this inflationary environment that we\u2019re -- that caught I think the entire industry a little off guar. I\u2019d say ourselves as well. We\u2019re now all over with the combined Walgreen team with Bern team focused on those molecules. I do think that and there is a lot of moving parts there as Wade alluded to earlier, that the cost increase, the -- the corresponding AWP is not keeping up with the cost increases. There is a whole lot of things that we\u2019re looking at. But I will say back to kind of the structural issue, I think the good thing is we\u2019re aware of it, we\u2019re on it. We know how to go at it and we -- and I think we\u2019re well positioned as anyone to get after. But it did -- it was something that we didn\u2019t expect. We are working through it and I think we\u2019re well positioned to cover it and correct for it.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "And as we talked about gross margins, it sounds like most of this was on the healthcare pharmacy side in the quarter, but I was just wondering if Mark or Alex had any comments around promotional activity and what you\u2019re seeing on that side of your retail business?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes. Hi, its Alec here Lisa. We are feeling pretty good about progress in the front-end margin. We increased it quarter-on-quarter through more promotional efficiencies, really making sure that we reward our best customers are using the data from the Loyalty Card. So some of that is promotional market that would be more efficient and more targeted and we\u2019re feeling pretty confident we can keep that going into the long-term.", "Lisa Gill - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Hi. I wanted to start off with Alliance Boots. We did get results out of Alliance Boots more recently and I was hoping, could you just provide a little bit color on their performance, how they\u2019re faring versus relative to what you thought and how much of the shortfall to EBIT in \u201916 is the Walgreens business versus the Alliance Boots business, any color there I think would be helpful?", "Greg Wasson", "Maybe I\u2019ll start Ed, and let Wade fill in. I think obviously still a challenging environment in some of the countries throughout Europe. I think as I\u2019ve said, Stefano and his team pretty solid team, they\u2019re managing through that. I think -- but they\u2019re indeed had some challenges in some areas of the business. I do think when you look at their business compared to the markets whether it\u2019s the retail business, boots business or the wholesale business and compare them to the market, to their competitors. They\u2019re actually winning against the rest of the market and therefore that\u2019s encouraging, they\u2019re growing share. But as we\u2019ve had some softness in parts of our business that we\u2019re correcting for, they\u2019ve had softness in parts of their business that they\u2019re working to correct for.", "Wade Miquelon", "I think -- I guess I would just augment it and say I think they\u2019ve also done some great work below the line, so both in terms of some of the tax efficiency work they\u2019ve done in terms of driving very aggressive cash flow which has helped them to lever and as you know they refinanced a while back. Also we have a strong pound situation, which is also very favorable too, so I think on that we feel very good about their business and again they\u2019ve a couple of challenging markets they\u2019re in, but they\u2019re positioned well for the long-term and I think on a cash flow base and after tax basis, the business had made up a lot of ground there. So we feel good.", "Greg Wasson", "And then I do think as we\u2019ve said, certainly we weren\u2019t on hitting the CAGR, to hit our adjusted earnings we had and their CAGR -- their EBIT CAGR has not been -- is below their original plan, but they\u2019re doing a lot of things to try to offset that and correct for it.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "And just one follow-up on your 2016 commentary. Are you optimistic that the below-the-line considerations may potentially offset the shortfall on the EBIT or even more than offset the shortfall on the EBIT as you sort of think about 2016?", "Greg Wasson", "Hey Ed, I will jump and let Wade -- I would be -- I\u2019m hesitant to go there. I think as I said, we just had too many moving parts right now that we\u2019re working through. There is potential obviously and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking through from all of those how they come together. But I think give us the four to six weeks and we will be able to give -- we have a lot more clarity on how this is coming together and be able to give you a lot more information at that time.", "Wade Miquelon", "And there is lot opportunity, but I think the key is making the right choice, so they all interplay with each other for the best long-term value creation for shareholders and we\u2019re looking at everything.", "Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Greg Wasson", "Thanks, Ed.", "Rick Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. As a reminder, the Company will report June sales on July 3rd. Have a Happy 4th of July. Until then, thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Rick Hans. Please go ahead sir.", "Rick J.

Please see our latest Form 10-K filing and subsequent Exchange Act filings for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg.", "Gregory D. Wasson", "Thank you Rick, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on our call. I will keep my remarks relatively short today. I will review the results from the quarter, provide an update on our progress towards the completion of the second step of our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots, and offer some final thoughts before I turn the call over to Tim for a detailed financial review. ", "We had a solid first quarter across both our pharmacy and retail products businesses with a strong holiday season and good cost control across the enterprise. In fact our stores year-over-year sales growth exceeded the overall retail market heading into the holiday season which positions us well as we close out the calendar year. So I want to congratulate our teams for their success. ", "For the full quarter, sales were a record $19.6 billion, up 6.7% from $18.3 billion a year ago. GAAP operating income for the quarter was $991 million up 7.1% from $924 million last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.14 billion up 3.5% from $1.1 billion in the first quarter 2014.", "GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.85 in the first quarter compared to $0.72 last year up 18.1%. First quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.81 up 12.5% from $0.72 in the same quarter last year. In terms of our front end, our retail products performance while our customer traffic in comparable stores edged down 2.7%, we were pleased that basket size was 4.2% resulting in total comparable sales for our retail products being up 1.5%, relative to the year ago quarter. ", "As for pharmacy, we were also pleased that prescription sales grew 9% or 8.1% in comparable stores as our retail market share increased 10 basis points from a year ago to 19%. As we finish out the holiday selling season in the next few days we are also very focused on completing the work necessary to close our transaction with Alliance Boots. ", "In November we secured financing to close the transaction as well as refinance the majority of Alliance Boots outstanding debt. We also issued our definitive proxy statement in preparation for our special shareholders meeting in New York on December 29th. We are currently on track to finalize the merger ahead of our original schedule. As we announced this morning we now expect to close the transaction on December 31st subject to shareholder approval. ", "This is truly an extraordinary milestone in a strategic journey we began six years ago to position orderings for new generation of growth and value creation. Wrapping up let me touch on the journey we began six years ago. A journey that included transforming the front end of our drug stores, advancing the role community pharmacy plays in healthcare, and is culminated by taking Walgreens global, creating the first pharmacy led health and wellbeing enterprise. As I have said before, bringing these two iconic brands together will be difficult if not impossible to replicate. ", "It has been my privilege to lead us to this point, to have had the opportunity to bring Walgreens to the world and Alliance Boots to America. I wish Jim, Stefano, and the rest of this very talented leadership team all the best as they now bring our vision to life through Walgreens Boots Alliance. From everything I know and everything I have learned at this company over the past 35 years, I am completely confident that combination of Walgreens and Alliance Boots will truly change the face of global pharmacy, retail, and wholesale. ", "And I am even more confident that the best days for our company are still ahead. And that's a tribute to the hard work and commitment of over 350,000 women and men of both Walgreen and Alliance Boots who have made this great journey in future possible. On a personal note, I would like to thank everyone on this call and many others for your thoughtful insight into our business. I have appreciated your work, thoughts, and comments over the years. I also want to wish all of you a very happy and healthy holiday season. With that thank you and I will now be stepping off and turning the remainder of the call including the Q&A over to Tim. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. I want to cover two topics today. First, to provide greater detail on our first quarter performance and second, to share some thoughts on our expectations post to closing of the deal with Alliance Boots. ", "As Greg mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results as they came largely in line with our expectations and got us off to a good start to fiscal 2015. Our adjusted EPS of $0.81 reflects the execution of our strategy with strong revenue growth and solid expense management for the quarter. ", "Let me begin with the discussion of total revenue which increased 6.7% year-over-year. This was due in part to strong comparable store script growth of 4.1% which is built on a solid base of 5.5% growth in the same quarter last year. To help drive that performance we continued our focus on winning and gaining share with high value seniors through preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans. ", "On Balance, this business carries lower margins than the rest of our script business but remains quite attractive as it drives incremental revenue and gross profit dollars. This strategy contributed to our overall retail pharmacy share increasing this quarter as we grew scripts by 10 basis points more than the rest of the retail industry according to IMS data. ", "We are also pleased with the progress we are making in driving our front end, our retail products comp. For the quarter we reported a 1.5% comp growth building off a strong 2.4% comp in the same quarter last year. Our strategy is working. This is evidenced by margin and basket size being up while traffic is down slightly. Our main focus remains to drive profitable growth and thereby achieving the right balance between sales and margins. ", "Let me now talk a little more about the retail products margin. This marked the third quarter in a row with year-over-year improvement in retail products gross margin which indicates that our strategy is beginning to pay dividends. Let me remind you of the key elements of our strategy. First, to focus on enhancing our mix towards more upscale retail products to drive higher margins. Second, to drive supply chain efficiencies by removing excess costs and thereby improving overall store productivity. And third, to leverage our Balance rewards loyalty program to derive valuable insights that will allow us to better target our promotional investments. ", "And now I will shift to our pharmacy segment which continued to face margin pressure due to third party reimbursement pressure from contract step downs, ongoing generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs at a similar rate to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, and finally increased mix of specialty drugs. Partially offsetting these pharmacy margin decreases were the positive effects of a step up in the introduction of new generics this quarter and purchasing synergies generated by our joint purchasing group. ", "For the quarter the margin weakness in the pharmacy segment was only partially offset by improvement in the retail product segment. On Balance this resulted in overall adjusted gross margin being down 120 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%. As we look forward, we expect the negative factors impacting pharmacy margin to intensify in the second quarter as the impact from a meaningful step down in Medicare Part D rates begins January 1st. ", "While we view margin percent as an important metric to help assess the overall health of our business on a long-term basis, we remain focused on leveraging our largely fixed cost structure by driving gross profit dollars in the near-term. Our focus is for gross profit dollar growth rate to exceed SG&A dollar growth by greater than 100 basis points. During the quarter on a GAAP basis our gross profit grew $144 million outpacing SG&A change of $77 million and thereby contributing $67 million to operating income. ", "On an adjusted basis, gross profit dollars increased by $133 million while SG&A dollars increased by $72 million year-over-year contributing $61 million to operating income. This resulted in the spread of positive 90 basis points which is an improvement from the 50 basis points positive variance we saw last quarter. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased 2.6% this quarter despite the pharmacy pressures we are currently experiencing. ", "We remain focused on mitigating the impact of these negative factors through a number of mechanisms including leveraging our buying group to secure better costs for drugs, incorporating inflation protection in payer contracts as they come up for renewal, and continuing to help align appropriate industry reimbursement levels. Additionally we expect our retail products initiatives to continue to further drive gross profit dollar growth. ", "Adjusted SG&A dollars increased by 1.7% for the quarter. We are quite pleased with our expense management during Q1. And with the pressures we are experiencing on our pharmacy margins, we have become even more focused on cost control such as lowering our cost to fill to help create a more sustainable profitability. ", "As we communicated previously, we have identified and remain on track to achieve the $1 billion in cost savings reflected in our fiscal year 2016 goals. While there will naturally be some incremental variable cost as we continue to aggressively grow our business, we expect these will be mitigated by our cost savings program. We are looking to identify further cost savings opportunities and will update you after that review is complete. ", "Combined net synergies for the quarter totaled $140 million and adjusted EPS accretion from our investment in Alliance Boots was $0.11 for the quarter. Both of these were in line with our expectations. Please remember, last year's adjusted accretion received $0.07 tax benefit from the UK tax law change while this year's included $0.02 benefit from a onetime gain on an acquisition. ", "The progress we are making with synergies is slightly ahead of schedule. It is still early but we believe there is upside to our original $650 million goal for the fiscal year and we will provide more detail on our second quarter earnings call. ", "Now let me walk you through our adjusted EPS. The GAAP earnings of $0.85 per share reconciles to an adjusted earnings of a positive $0.81 per share for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. The net adjustment of $0.04 includes the removal of the following. A LIFO provision of $0.03 per share, $0.13 per share of acquisition related items which consisted of $0.06 of acquisition related amortization cost, $0.02 of acquisition related costs, $0.04 from Alliance Boots related tax, and $0.01 from interest associated with Walgreens Boots Alliance debt issuance. ", "And finally a net impact of $0.20 for special items comprised of $0.02 per share negative impact from cost related to the corporate and store optimization costs, $0.10 per share negative impact from fair value adjustments on currency hedges, $0.09 positive impact related to the partial release of a tax valuation allowance, and $0.23 positive impact of the warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The Alliance Boots impact was reported on a three months lag basis. ", "Moving on to our balance sheet, I would like to share a couple of words on primary working capital which I define as accounts receivable plus inventories minus accounts payable. Accounts receivable increased $850 million. Our third party receivables are in very good shape down approximately $40 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher vendor funding receivables from the joint venture and rebates for AmerisourceBergen. ", "LIFO inventories decreased $1.2 billion. About two thirds of this improvement came from pharmacy inventory reduction in conjunction with the terms of our agreement with AmerisourceBergen. The remainder with retail products inventory reduction due to our initiatives to improve store level supply chain efficiencies. And accounts payable increased $400 million largely due to reclassifying due from vendors up to the receivables line as I just mentioned. ", "Overall networking capital decreased by $700 million or 13.8% versus a year ago which helped drive solid cash flow performance for the quarter. We generated approximately $1 billion in cash from operations versus $133 million in the year ago period. Recall the cash flow in last year's quarter was adversely impacted by the timing of payments related to the AmerisourceBergen transaction. ", "Free cash flow was $696 million versus a negative $231 million in the prior year period. We are pleased with the cash generation during the first quarter due partly to the working capital improvement I just mentioned as well as improved earnings. In addition to the $500 million in shares we bought back in fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we bought another $500 million worth this quarter. The number of diluted shares decreased by approximately $12 million from last quarter, I am sorry, 12 million from last quarter. ", "Now let's talk about the rest of the fiscal 2015. We do understand that you will not have a reliable base on which to build your fiscal 2015 estimates so we will provide additional information after we have had a chance to review our plans with Walgreens Boots Alliance Board. As you can appreciate, there are a lot of unusual factors that will impact results in the second quarter. Some of these are still being developed therefore we are not prepared to quantify our expectations at this time. ", "In the meantime let me give you some key factors for you to consider in your models. Subject to shareholder approval, we are expecting to close the deal with Alliance Boots on December 31st of this year. We will eliminate the three months reporting lag. Interest expense is expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million per quarter, this factors in the recent financing with a blended rate of approximately 3.2%. We will add 144.3 million incremental shares as partial consideration for the acquisition. Walgreens Boots Alliance fiscal year end will be August 31st and remember that our future earnings will be impacted by exchange rate movements most notably in the pound sterling and to a lesser extent the Euro. ", "Moving on to fiscal year 2016, many of you have asked my thoughts on our outlined goals and now that I have been here for nearly five months, I have had enough time to make a thorough assessment. Based on everything I have reviewed and learned, I am comfortable that the fiscal year 2016 goals and their associated assumptions are reasonable and reflective of the markets. I am confident that we have initiatives and resources in place to address the controllable elements that drive the adjusted EPS range. For those variables that are beyond our control, we have also identified actions that can help mitigate any unforeseen pressures. All goals involve risks and opportunities and we know that we must continue to execute in order to deliver on them. ", "I would now like to provide a few thoughts around our financial reporting and communications going forward. With regard to WBA, we are working diligently to develop the appropriate metrics and measures to help you better understand our business fundamentals. To that end, we will breakout the performance of the new company into three reporting segments; retail pharmacy USA which will include Walgreens and [indiscernible], retail pharmacy international which has pharmacy led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, and pharmaceutical wholesale which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand in 12 countries. ", "We plan to share more details at an upcoming Analyst Day in New York that we will host in the months after closing the deal. We will provide you more specifics on this event as we finalize our plans. ", "Rick J. Hans", "Thank you Tim. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. When we get to your questions please limit yourself to one question. Thank you. ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ", "Edward Kelly", "Hi good morning guys. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Hi Ed, how are you?", "Edward Kelly", "Good, so Tim a question for you on looking forward on gross profit dollar growth. You hinted at increased pressures coming up for the remainder of the year. My question for you is, we saw about 2.6% increase in gross profit dollars this quarter, how do you expect to cater [ph] into that to look like over the next few quarters, it does sound like that would deteriorate over the second quarter? And then from an SG&A standpoint is there opportunity there where you still believe that you will be able to drive better gross profit dollar growth versus SG&A growth over the next few quarters? ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Sure Ed, so let me just talk about the pressure that we are experiencing from a gross margin standpoint. I mean there is ongoing pressure from generic inflation. Some of the impact that we had in the fourth quarter was mitigated a little bit through some improvement in average wholesale price and the related impact on the growths etc. Certainly we have generated some additional synergies and from our joint venture buying group in Switzerland. And then as we\u2019ve pointed out, that we do expect a step down in reimbursement levels associated with the Med Part D that\u2019s already contracted in. ", "So on a going forward basis we do expect continued pressure and maybe a little bit additional pressure going into the second quarter and thereafter. We\u2019ll continue to I mean expect that we\u2019ll see some improvement in the average wholesale price which helps reimbursements, will continue to generate the synergies we can to mitigate that on a ongoing basis, and I will remind you that there is lots of speculation about the wisdom of taking on the Med Part D contracts. I will tell you that incrementally it is very attractive business. ", "Now clearly I mean there is a negative impact on overall margin percentage and even dollars relative to last year. But had we not undertaken that it would had a serious impact on both our revenues and our overall margins. So I mean in the end of the day it was a good thing for us to take that and generate some continuous to keep an attractive customer base coming to work to our stores and doing business with us. ", "We\u2019ve talked about a billion dollar cost reduction program, we made some good progress on that in the first quarter of this year as is evidenced by our results. We continue to execute against that and I would expect that largely to offset a big piece of the margin pressure that we continue to experience. ", "Edward Kelly", "Great, thank you. Happy holidays guys. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Thank you very much Ed. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities your line if open. ", "John Heinbockel", "Thanks. Two related things, I guess for Tim, do you think -- could third quarter reimbursement pressure be greater than the second just because of the three months? And then secondly for Alex, how are you guarding against all of this cost removal adversely impacting service levels in the stores. You are taking out an awful lot and you certainly don\u2019t want to trample on service aspects in the stores?", "Timothy R. McLevish ", "Yes, I mean the second quarter obviously we have to step down to Med D, so we\u2019ll have some pressure there. I wouldn\u2019t expect further pressure from there, there isn\u2019t a natural step down in the third quarter on Med D. We\u2019ll have to see how the generic inflation plays out but overtime we kind of eat into a little bit of that as the reimbursements get some support with improvement in NAWP, etc. So I don\u2019t expect a material -- more pressure in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. ", "Let me before I turn it over to Alex to respond, I just want to say one thing, our cost reduction effort certainly at some point has to take cost out of the store level. But that\u2019s the reverse order in which we are focusing on it. We are starting at the corporate level and working our way down to the supply chain and we\u2019re making best effort to mitigate any impact it may have on delivering service to our customers. And in fact some of the things we are doing is taking work load off of our store managers and their store employees to enable them to better focus on customers. With that let me turn over to Alex to comment. ", "Alexander W. Gourlay", "Thanks Tim. Hi John, it is Alex here. Yes, Tim\u2019s right I think the best example we can give you is the inventory adoption across the business. Tim said it was 1.2 billion in the quarter, 400 millionish in the front end. That just suggests lot of work load in the stores so that means that our people in the stores are able to spend more time focusing on customers and making sure they can actually get the right product on the store and on the shelf at the right time. I am feeling pretty good about program so we are just seeing cost naturally on reducing working capital and making us more efficient. ", "So that\u2019s a great example of one of the efforts in terms of cost reduction. We are really focused on workload in the corporate office and really important stores. We are really focused on giving our customers great care so we can make sure they come back time and again. We think these two things are completely compatible and that is what we are focused on. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Let me comment on one other piece. You noted the mix of impact on the front end on our retail products business. Traffic was down a little bit, margin was up and basket size was up. A big piece of that was elimination of questionable promotions from last year. But again as we endeavor t upgrade the quality of our product on the front end, improve the margin percentage, and illuminate some of those unprofitable promotions it actually takes a fair amount of work out of the store. So rather than hang lots of hang tags of discounts and so forth, our store employees are much better positioned to be supporting and providing service to our customers. ", "John Heinbockel", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citigroup, your line is open.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great, thank you and good morning. I believe in mid November you released this filing with some internal targets, particularly an EPS target of $3.40 in fiscal 2015. I am wondering if you could frame the results today which were very good as well as commentary that you are ahead of the 650 million in synergies this year and the closing data with that target as it relates to the internal target? ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Alvin I want to remind you that what you read in the -- in our proxy statement was a piece of information provided to the bankers to enable them to generate fairness opinion on the transaction. And we haven\u2019t confirmed that information but I will simply tell you this that the results of the first quarter are largely aligned with our expectation for the year. I mean it is kind of where we had anticipated the first quarter coming in and it is aligned with our projections for the year. ", "Alvin Concepcion", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa Gill", "Thanks very much. Tim, I think that when you talked about reimbursement pressure one of the things you talked about was specialty. Obviously a lot of new specialty drugs coming to market. Can you talk about the difference in the margin for a specialty product versus some of the other brand and generic products? And secondly as you think about your specialty pharmacy business for Walgreens, what do you see as some of the opportunities as we move into 2015?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "So, we regard specialty as a very important and strategic business. It carries some characteristics which create some distortions to some of the metrics as you might look at them but at the end of the day its attractive business and it is our strategy to continue to grow that business. These numbers aren\u2019t going to be perfect and precise because they are averages but how I think about the specialty business, as you are talking about very expensive prescription drugs. They tend to carry prices up to 30 times what our average prescription would carry. They carry gross profit perhaps 10 times what our average gross profit would be across the rest of our portfolio. ", "So net, net that means that our margin percentage is going to be considerably less and it will put downward pressure on that margin percentage. However, generating margins of 10x of what our average is with modestly more SG&A to support it means a very attractive business for us. Again it may distort the ratios but it is very attractive and it generates very attractive dollar margins to support our business and operating profit. ", "I would also look to see the next test is kind of what is the return on investment on it but the -- on average probably the required inventory to support that is actually less than the average because typically we don\u2019t carry those prescriptions in the pharmacies or in our warehouses. It is just in our case now or AmerisourceBergen or upstream in the channels so, we aren\u2019t carrying the inventory to support it. So it is attractive business on almost every level even though it creates some distortion in some of the ratios. ", "Lisa Gill", "And then Tim as you think about specialty, anything about infusion. There has been some news reports that you are looking to divest your infusion business. CBS recently has bought an infusion business, can you maybe just discuss why you don\u2019t see that as part of the offering around specialty?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "We don\u2019t comment on speculation or rumors in the marketplace that we have never confirmed any of those rumors. ", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. I appreciate it, thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Your line is open. ", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Tim, one of the items that\u2019s been talked about in the past is your occupancy cost is little higher then you\u2019d like it to be, could you give us some read on how many of the stores will be rolling off of their leases and you could start to work down on that occupancy cost or any other plans you have to kind of work the occupancy cost down? ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Yes, I mean on Balance, we\u2019ve employed over the years of strategy to have the best corner or location in any geography and with an intent that it would generate more traffic and more revenue and obviously more margins and more profits. In some cases that worked, in some cases it didn\u2019t but on Balance it left us with an occupancy cost both in terms of rent or lease cost and another occupancy as part of the strategy to avoid better service and try to drive higher traffic and revenues, etc. ", "So in some cases we find there are many cases on Balance, the average when we look at it relative to our primary competitor, our occupancy cost and store costs are higher. We are doing lots of things to manage down all aspects of that overall cost structure including taking a hard look at those stores. Obviously we have a vast array of different terms remaining on leases. They tend to be 10 plus year leases and some of them are well into their lifecycle. But I can't say that we would have an appreciable impact short term on just waiting for those leases to naturally roll. We are taking the opportunity to go in where we can to renegotiate leases and then in some cases it's attractive for a land lord to do that. And we\u2019re looking at a variety of things but it is not a short-term quick fix solution. But it is all part of our cost savings initiatives that we have talked about. ", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Do you think you need a smaller store format moving forward or is it just getting away from these key locations where you were just paying too much rent?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "I mean it covers the spectrum. I\u2019ll let Alex talk about it but in some locations we would benefit by a smaller format store then in some cases that we are well served by having the size and scale what we have. Alex?", "Alexander W. Gourlay", "Hi Mark, it is Alex here. We fill every single store more or less same size. It was build around the pharmacy business and it was a fantastic strategy as Tim said. So clearly when I was looking at it from a retail point of view, -- one of the options we are looking at in terms of how do we make more use of the asset. So, it\u2019s a combination of as Tim said, rent with options overtime potentially so some space moves overtime. Also had to make even better use of the asset by having the right offer in that locality for the customers who are actually based around that store. These are all strategies that we are now deploying. ", "Timothy R. McLevish ", "I mean as we have built the fleet, as Alex mentioned we tend to use kind of a cookie cut approach. So if you look at most of our stores they are quite similar in appearance and size and scale, etc. As we go forward we will probably adapt that format a little bit more to the market conditions and so forth. And we are doing everything we can for the existing fleet where the size doesn\u2019t fit optimally to the market to adjust as I talked about earlier.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank, your line is open. ", "George Hill", "Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions. Tim, you started talking about cost reductions and starting at the corporate level as opposed to the store level, is there any way for you to quantify for us kind of what is the corporate cost opportunity and how we should think about that?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Yes, I am sorry George but I don\u2019t want to go in to specifics on where it is at. I mean we\u2019ve identified, have the overall program. I\u2019ve also commented not quantified but commented that we will look harder at our cost structure and in all likelihood considering market conditions and considering the opportunity we\u2019ll go more aggressively at our cost reduction program. We haven\u2019t finalized that, we haven\u2019t communicated to our Board but as soon as we do we\u2019ll get back to be on it. But we are going to go after all cost or wherever there is opportunity and I prefer to start with those that are away from the customer, the furthest away from the customer. ", "George Hill", "Okay and then just maybe a real quick follow up, you highlighted the kind of Med D contracting terms, can you give us any more color on kind of the companies assumptions on kind of volumes and share gains in that space given how your setup in the preferred networks and lot of your preferred network partners looks like they are in a position to take share this selling season, I guess any further color you can give us on the change in reimbursement expectation versus the change in volume would be very helpful, thanks?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Yes, I mean on Balance we\u2019re some underwater on the incremental share and the incremental scripts that we\u2019ve picked up relative to the step down in those that we already had. So if we had assumed that we could keep all of the existing scripts at the old prices we are deriving, it wasn\u2019t very attractive for us to enter into this contract. But the likelihood that somebody else would pick it up and would take that business away from us was quite high and it was better for us to continue to participate with a little bit somewhat lower margins on the existing business that we are doing. And we have picked up some incremental customers and prescriptions. But I can't quantify exactly what that is. On Balance though I would say it resulted in a step down in margins from the prior year. ", "George Hill", "And so volumes for 2015 expectations?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Just need a -- there is not much on volume being ready. We\u2019re feeling pretty good about the market just now. The market is growing quite well, we have seen more life come into the market through the various initiatives of the government. But we are well prepared for January peak when a lot of people present scripts in the market for the first time to the new pharmacy. So we have a big focus on not on that we are feeling good about how well prepared we are in the market and the market looks solid as you have seen from other as well in this period. ", "George Hill", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research, your line is open. ", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Good morning Eric. ", "Eric Bosshard", "Good morning. I am curious as you look forward thinking about the pharmacy gross margin, what your strategy is in terms of reimbursement rates. I think historically there was a focus on getting strong reimbursement for filling scripts at Walgreen store. I understand what\u2019s going out to Med D but thinking about the impacted influence of preferred and more narrow networks relative to the scale of your store network what is your strategy in terms of trying to defend or define reimbursement in your pharmacy relative to the trend in the market?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "It is Alex here, hi. You got to play in the market so as always -- we\u2019ve always been in the market, we\u2019ve always tried to compete in the market and give payers good value in the market. And that\u2019s what we are doing right now. Again the market has changed as we said before and we are working closely with the payers to make sure that we give them good volume. So that would be the intend going forward. The good thing we have that we didn\u2019t have before is that we have got the ability to leave these global buying -- so again as time goes forward we are feeling good about where the organization is and on the extra, again extra scale it is giving us. So again we are a big chain, we got global buying power and we should and will compete. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "And I would also, I mean we\u2019ve talked about the generic inflation that we have experienced over the last year. And some of that is catching up as the average wholesale price gets adjusted more to appropriate levels. The other thing that we are doing is as contracts -- our reimbursement contracts expire and we renew them, we are ensuring that we have inflation protection built into those and we are having good success in doing so. ", "Eric Bosshard", "And just a follow up if I could on, Alex I understand your comment on working closely with suppliers and doing a better job even on buying, Tim your comments earlier of upside to the 650 million this year and looking forward, the understanding I want to get into a ton of specifics but the source of optimism and upside is this more on the purchasing side or on the non-customer face and expense side where is the bigger incremental opportunity you are seeing for 2015 and beyond? ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Really it\u2019s on both sides Eric. It\u2019s in the generics a little modestly on the branded but big piece of it also is in the goods not for resale as we point out. But just by sheer magnitude of the opportunities, it more comes from the purchasing of generics. Under this head we are making good progress and we are on pace if not a little bit ahead on the target for the year. And as we flush that out going into second quarter I would expect us to update you on that and perhaps we\u2019ll see it pretty clear to providing a even better number. ", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Looks like we have time for one last question from Mark Miller of William Blair. Your line is open. ", "Mark Miller", "Hi, good morning everyone. ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Hi Mark.", "Mark Miller", "Hi, could you give us some perspective on the performance of Alliance Boots sales trends organically and so I\u2019d be looking for just any color you can give us on the retail comps and also the wholesale business as you bring in that business consolidating it into 2015?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Yes, I mean we do as you know bring in our 45% share of Alliance Boots but until we close on the transaction we can\u2019t as a private company and we are not at liberty to share specifics of their performance results or growth. They do report periodically quarterly some information on their -- I guess annually on their website but they don\u2019t share detailed information and again we are not at liberty to share. ", "Mark Miller", "Then I have an accounting question so, we are seeing the Boots -- the numbers for AB up through August, what\u2019s going to happen to the results from September to December and are there any unusual expenses that get passed through that time period?", "Timothy R. McLevish", "I mentioned earlier that when we close on 12/31 the transaction it will be obviously be a 100% owned and it will be consolidated into the WBA totals. We are removing the lag as we report on a going forward basis but we\u2019ll restate to remove that lag and it will be all be adjusted from a historical perspective. ", "Mark Miller", "Okay, but that period September to December, those numbers actually will they pull through the P&L vent or I mean are there any expenses that are in that period that are unusual? ", "Timothy R. McLevish", "Yes, I mean I can\u2019t talk specifically about expenses that they\u2019re incurring. Anything that you would have seen in ours will be reflected but you will see when we do restate for the first quarter of 2015 after we do consolidate, close the deal and consolidate any expenses, any unusual expenses that they might incur in that quarter will be reflected in our consolidated number. So you will have the visibility to them. ", "Mark Miller", "Okay, alright, thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks.", "Rick J. Hans", "Ladies and gentlemen that was our final question. Thank you for joining us today. Lastly on a personal note I believe all of you probably know I am planning on retiring as of the end of the month. It\u2019s been my honor and pleasure to work with Walgreen\u2019s over the past 27 years and with all of you over last 15 years as the Head of Investor Relations. While many great accomplishments have been achieved at this company over this time period, I believe the best is yet to come. Thanks for wonderful memories on behalf of Walgreens let me one last time wish you all happy holidays. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

You have the floor, sir.", "Gerald Gradwell - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Special Projects", "Thank you, Andrew. Good morning or afternoon, wherever you may be, to everyone. Welcome to our fiscal year-end 2015 and fourth quarter earnings call. Today, Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer, will take you through our results in greater detail.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fiscal 2015 full-year earnings call. So, this is an exciting time for us. Not only are we today announcing the first full-year results as a fully combined company, but also, as you would have seen, we are announcing the acquisition of Rite Aid in a transaction that will significantly accelerate our plan to expand our presence in the U.S. With this acquisition, we are accelerating a long-term objective that we knew we needed to address to strengthen our presence and coverage nationally across the U.S. I have to say that we have reached an agreement with Rite Aid that reflect what we believe to be very fair terms, which will allow us to unlock real value from the transaction.", "The addition of Rite Aid will accelerate our strategy by completing our network, providing a larger and more comprehensive portfolio, with which we can deploy our knowledge and skill, and creating a more comprehensive and stronger platform for the development of our brand presence and the future growth of our business. Clearly, there is still a lot to be done to complete the transaction with Rite Aid. Our team has done a lot of work on this and we will work closely with the regulator to bring the transaction to a conclusion as soon as possible. George will give you more details about our agreement to acquire Rite Aid in a few moments, but first let me review the progress we have made in the past year in our work to transform our businesses and drive growth across the company.", "When I spoke to you in July, I referred to the extraordinary amount of work that has been going on inside the company to establish the processes and systems on which to build a more responsible patient development (4:35) business. This is critical for what is today a rapidly changing business environment with new and different dynamics than those that the company has historically been used to.", "In all of our markets we face tough challenges, either from competitors or from governments' relentless drive to manage healthcare costs. That said, I do not believe anyone on this call would not say the same things of their business. Our job is, as it has well been and will continue to be to identify, address, and if we can lead the market to efficiently scale insight and innovation. Of course, with the completion of our transaction to form a Walgreens Boots Alliance in general (5:28), and the subsequent executive and management changes, it has taken us a little time to come to grips with the business. And, as part of this, we have been actively working to strengthen and simplify our management reporting structure and system, to ensure that we can build a reliable and accurate picture of our group and understand our strengths and weaknesses.", "We have had to spend some time restructuring and refocusing a number of parts of the business and a number of areas of management. In some areas, we have found it necessary to bring in people and skills from outside the group, recognizing that for our U.S. business to dovetail management reporting to what is an extensive international network requires something different in terms of systems and expertise than running a U.S. based domestic business. Internationally, our management has had to take some time to understand how they are impacted by the shift in the nature of our business that is inevitable, given the scale of our U.S. business. The practical and cultural issues that these changes have raised are complex, but have been helped in part by the relationships and connections we began to forge in the year before the initial announcement of our deal and since the final completion.", "An amazing amount has been achieved within the company, but we remain very much at the beginning of our journey. Alex and his team have been working hard to ensure we are operating an efficient and effective network, optimized as far as possible to the needs of the communities that it serves. They have made a lot of progress, but there is a lot more things to do. I also understand the demand and potential for a more unique (7:37) using the Boots products as a base is now beyond the trial stage and is beginning to rollout in a managed way across the network. We are restructuring the front end of our stores to set us on the right path of future growth, even if, as anticipated, this is the short-term cost of some sales. However, this short-term impact is compensated for by the improved margins that this restructuring has delivered.", "We are also continuing to innovate in new channels to stay relevant and continue to prove the strength of our brand in the digital world (8:20), every bit as much as in the physical one. I would be doing a great disservice to many people outside the U.S., if I did not mention their outstanding efforts as well that has resulted in solid performance from our International Retail Pharmacy and International Wholesale businesses.", "So, the fourth quarter results have been strong, and the year as a whole has been good for us. We are confident that our synergy program is on track to deliver at least $1 billion in 2016, and as we have said, we are well into the process of reviewing, restructuring and refocusing our people to deliver on our plan for many years to come, reinvigorating and differentiating our business across every market we operate in. That said, after the completion of our formal synergy programs resulting from the Walgreens and Alliance Boots transaction, we will expect to reverse toward (9:29) consider a more normalized economic growth profile of the business in 2017 and beyond. Overall, therefore, this is an exciting and busy time, and although I am never satisfied with what we have achieved, as I believe in general that we can and should always reach for more. I am also realistic and acknowledge the work that has been done, and recognize that this has been a good year for the company.", "I will now hand you over to George to talk through the results and give you a bit more detail on our agreement with Rite Aid. I will come back to you after that. George, please.", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon for those listening in Europe. Today, I'll start by taking you through the highlights of our fiscal year ended 2015 full year and fourth quarter results. I will then give you some insights into the performance of our three divisions, before updating you on the progress that we've made in our synergy cost-saving programs. I will conclude by providing some details on the Rite Aid agreement before taking you through our guidance for fiscal year 2016.", "I will begin by reminding you that our fiscal year 2015 results are not directly comparable to fiscal 2014. This is primarily due to three key elements associated with completing the second step of our transaction on December 31, 2014. Firstly, we eliminated the three-month reporting lag for Alliance Boots and re-classed prior-year results with no lag. Secondly, segmental reporting from January 1, 2015 includes the allocation of synergy benefits including WBAD combined corporate costs. And lastly, fiscal 2015 results include equity earnings from Alliance Boots for the four months of September to December 2014 and full consolidation of Alliance Boots earnings for the eight months from January to August 2015.", "I'm proud of our achievements and accomplishments in fiscal 2015. Closing our transaction, delivering strong financial performance, and reporting the combined results for WBA required great teamwork across the organization.", "Looking now at our overall performance for the year; net sales for fiscal year 2015 were $103.4 billion. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $4.7 billion. Net interest expense $605 million. The tax rate was 19.9% and net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance was $4.2 billion, or $4.00 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, our operating income was $6.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2014. The key factors which drove our fiscal 2015 results were the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations combined with growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment.", "Adjusted net interest expense for the year was $464 million, reflecting increased level of debt associated with the second step of the Alliance Boots transaction. Adjusted tax rate was 27.8%. This was lower than we were expecting, due to business mix and certain discrete items that benefited us, primarily in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance fiscal 2015 of $4.1 billion, equating to $3.88 per diluted share.", "So now I will quickly take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fiscal year. The GAAP earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance for fiscal year 2015 of $4.00 per diluted share reconciles to adjusted earnings of $3.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.12 per share reflects additions, $0.17 of LIFO provision cost in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.35 of restructuring related costs, that's from our cost optimization and store closure program, and a net favorable $0.02 transaction and acquisition-related items from executing step two of the merger with Alliance Boots. These additions were more than offset by removal of a $0.54 gain on our warrant to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares and an additional net$0.12 gain for special items. A detailed reconciliation of all component items is included as an appendix to the slides.", "Moving on to our fourth quarter results, net sales in the fourth quarter were $28.5 billion, an increase of 50% versus the comparable quarter in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the quarter was $836 million, net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance of $26 million, equating to $0.02 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, operating income increased to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by the consolidation of Alliance Boots. Adjusted net earnings, typical for Walgreens Boots Alliance, were $969 million or $0.88 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 14.3% and adjusted earnings per diluted share over the comparable quarter in the prior year. It should also be noted that the fourth quarter results last year included three months equity earnings as a result of Walgreens' 45% interest in Alliance Boots, compared to fully consolidated results in this year's fourth quarter.", "Let me now quickly take you through the walk from GAAP diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter. GAAP earnings of $0.02 per diluted share for the quarter reconciles the adjusted earnings of $0.88 per diluted share. The net adjustment of $0.86 per share incorporates the following additions. $0.05 of LIFO provision cost in Retail Pharmacy USA, $0.20 of restructuring-related costs, $0.21 of transaction and acquisition-related items in regards to step two of the merger with Alliance Boots, a $0.37 loss on our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen shares, and net $0.03 from special items.", "So now I will take you through the performance of each of our three divisions, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Firstly, please remember that we sold the majority stake in our infusion business on April 7. With our minority position, our share of earnings in Option Care now flows through the income statement as post-tax earnings from equity method investments. So looking first at the division's fiscal year performance, total sales were $81 billion, a year-over-year increase of 6.0%. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 6.4%, full year. On a GAAP basis, for fiscal 2015, gross profit was $21.8 billion, while SG&A was $18.2 billion, resulting in operating income of $3.9 billion. On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the full year was $22.1 billion, SG&A was $17.2 billion, and operating income was $5.1 billion.", "Adjusted operating income increased 4.8%, driven by strong sales performance and tight cost control. Please remember when assessing this increase, the benefits of these two factors were partially offset by the inclusion of Walgreens share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in operating income in the prior year. So excluding this impact, adjusted operating income in the division grew by 12.5%. Substantial progress was made in controlling SG&A during the year, as a result of benefits associated with our cost-savings program. This was a significant driver of the division's year-on-year performance. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses decreased by 85 basis points year-over-year. For the end of fiscal year, the division operated 8,173 retail sales.", "So, now let's turn to the division's fourth quarter performance. Retail Pharmacy USA's total sales in the quarter were $19.9 billion, an increase of 4.7% over the fourth quarter in the prior year. Total sales in comparable stores increased by 6.5%. On a GAAP basis for the quarter, gross profit was $5.3 billion, while SG&A was $4.7 billion, resulting in operating income of $511 million. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $5.4 billion, while SG&A was $4.3 billion. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of $1.1 billion was down 10.1% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. This was primarily due to having no equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the current quarter in the segment versus three months in the comparable period. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating income grew by 1.2%. We were able to increase adjusted gross profit dollars compared to the final quarter of fiscal 2014, despite lower gross margins, while at the same time delivering SG&A efficiencies through our cost-savings program.", "So let's now look at pharmacy part of Retail Pharmacy USA in more detail. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 9.3% for the fiscal year. We filled 894 million prescriptions, including immunizations. That's on a 30-day adjusted basis, an increase of 4.4% over last year. Prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 4.6% year-on-year. In the fourth quarter, comparable pharma sales were up 10.0%, as we filled 222 million prescriptions, an increase of 4.6% over the current quarter in the prior year. Prescriptions filled in comparable stores up 5.1%. Year-over-year, we continue to see a positive impact and further growth in Medicare Part D and ACA funded scripts, resulting in our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing to 19.1% for the year ended August 31, an increase of approximately 20 basis points.", "The benefits of positive sales growth were however substantially offset by pharmacy gross margin pressure, consistent with our expectations. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail, and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percent. The decrease in pharmacy margin was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. While we continue to anticipate margin pressure, we remain confident in our strategy to drive access of critical programs such as Med Part D and deepen our payer relationships to grow our pharmacy business over time.", "Moving now onto the retail products performance within Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail sales increased by 1.9% for fiscal year 2015, while comparable sales increased 1.5%. As anticipated, the rate of sales growth was slightly slower in the fourth quarter as we continued to remove our more inefficient promotions, reduce store numbers, and optimize store opening hours. Sales increased 0.8% in total, and by 0.4% on a comparable sales basis. Overall, our strategy continues to be to drive sales growth and improve profitability, and I'm pleased to report that gross profit margins have increased for the sixth quarter in succession. Over the past 18 months, we've improved our product mix with our key health and wellness categories, now contributing to higher proportion of total sales. We have also enhanced our merchandising tools, continue to optimize our promotional performance, and have upgraded on-shelf availability, assuring products are in-store at the right price. Finally, we have improved sourcing, with a higher level of our own branded products.", "In fiscal year 2016, we plan to continue to invest to drive our strategy and improve our customer offer. We will take what we've learned from our successful No7test in Phoenix, New York City, where we saw positive lift in both beauty and overall sales, and roll out a new beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores, for a total of 2,000. With this new offer, we will elevate the customer experience with better fixtures, improved customer care, space optimization, and selected store upgrades. We're also advancing the personalization of our Balance Rewards program, more offers targeted through our everyday points program to our health and beauty customers. Through these efforts we are striving to improve our customers' experience, expand our profit margin in the front of store, and continue to grow sales in key customer categories.", "With that, let me turn to the results of our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy, allied health, and beauty retail businesses in eight countries. As a quick reminder, our biggest operations are Boots in the UK followed by Mexico. We also have retail pharmacies in Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, and Lithuania. At the end of the fiscal year, the division operated 4,582 retail stores. I will focus my commentary for this division primarily on the most recent quarterly results. The fiscal year only has eight months of data and therefore isn't all that meaningful, particularly as it does not cover the important holiday season. Total sales in the division for the quarter were $3.5 billion. Sales growth when compared with our third quarter was mainly due to the expected stronger sales in seasonal categories combined with currency benefits, mainly the British pound strengthening versus the dollar.", "On a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, gross profit was $1.5 billion and SG&A was $1.3 billion, resulting in operating income of $196 million. On an adjusted basis, gross profit for the fourth quarter was $1.5 billion, and SG&A expense was $1.2 billion, which resulted in operating income of $242 million. Adjusted operating margin was 7.0% for the quarter, which was in line with the post-acquisition figure of the last eight months of the fiscal year.", "So now let's look more closely at the operating performance of the division. On a pro forma constant-currency basis, comparable store sales growth for the quarter was 4.3%.Comparable store retail sales growth was 4.5%, being somewhat stronger than pharmacy, up 4.1%. Comparable store sales growth in British UK was 3.5% in the quarter. Growth across all British UK retail sales categories resulted in comparable store retail sales growth of 4.0%, good performances in beauty and from our online offering being the largest factors. In beauty, No7, our award-winning beauty brand celebrated its 80th anniversary with another good quarter, with both skincare and cosmetics delivering double-digit sales growth in the UK. Sales of No7Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum continued to be strong more than one year on from their launch, supported by their continuing marketing program, which highlights the clinically-proven product benefits, which I talked about on our last earnings call. During the quarter, we also launched No7 Advanced Day and Night creams with a new color cosmetics campaign. Both of these initiatives were well received by our customers.", "Our UK website, Boots.com continued to see strong growth with orders during the quarter up more than 65% over the same period last year. At the beginning of August, we further enhanced the convenience of our order and collect offer, now enabling customers to order by 8:00 p.m. and still collect in store at 12:00 noon the following day. In the fourth quarter, nearly 70% of all our online orders in the UK were collected in store.", "Outside the UK, our businesses in Mexico, Thailand and the Republic of Ireland all delivered pro forma constant currency comparable store sales for the quarter, well above the average of the division, as did Boots Opticians in the UK.", "So turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division in the fourth quarter were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming constant currency and excluding acquisitions and disposals, on this basis sales increased 5.0% over the same quarter in the prior year. Sales growth was particularly strong in Norway, where our wholesale business won a major new contract (28:47), which began around the start of calendar 2015, and five other countries where our businesses each achieved double-digit comparable sales growth in the quarter. These included two of our largest wholesale businesses in Turkey and Germany.", "GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $133 million, while adjusted operating income was $158 million. Adjusted operating income margin for the quarter was 2.7%, compared to 2.9% for the eight months post acquisition. This, in part, reflects the seasonal nature of pharmaceutical wholesaling.", "So having covered our divisional performance, I would now like to turn to our synergy program, one of the key drivers of profit growth. The combined net synergies for fiscal 2015 were $799 million, significantly above our target of at least $650 million. This includes $81 million classified as synergies in the fourth quarter, which related to activities commencing in prior fiscal years. Consistent with our prior reporting, these synergies are allocated across each segment and do not include any benefit from our long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen or the benefits of refinancing the legacy Alliance Boots indebtedness at a lower cost. For fiscal year 2016, we continue to expect to reach at least $1 billion in combined net synergies. As time goes on and the combined management team works closer together, there are of course a number of other synergies being identified and actions, but many of them are simply not practical to quantify, as they blend into our core operations.", "So moving now to our cost savings program, which as you know is another key area of focus. As previously announced, we have a target of $1.5 billion of cost savings to be delivered by the end of fiscal 2017. The expected pre-tax charges associated with this program, as previously stated, are between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, which the cash component is expected to be approximately 60%. We continue to make good progress towards this goal and have achieved more than half of the program's expected savings as of the end of the fiscal year. The Retail Pharmacy USA division, which is the primary driver of this program, this included closing 75 stores in the quarter, making a total of 84 store closures in fiscal 2015 as part of our plan to close approximately 200 stores in total. Actions taken during fiscal 2015 have resulted in pre-tax charges totaling $542 million, including $223 million for asset impairments, $202 million for real estate closures, and $117 million for segments and other business transition and fixed costs.", "So now I'd now like to look at cash flow and capital deployment. GAAP operating profit cash flow was $5.7 billion for the full fiscal year and $1.5 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow was $4.4 billion for the full year and $1.1 billion in the quarter.", "As it is hard for you to gauge our cash-generating abilities from today's results, I would like to give you some insight into our operating cash flow and working capital priorities. We remain intensely focused in driving cash flow across our three business segments. Within our Retail Pharmacy USA division, during the year we improved inventory management in both pharmacy and retail products. We have more opportunities in inventory, have a renewed focus on accounts receivable and accounts payable, all with the aim of driving further working capital savings. We will continue to apply the same discipline in Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale.", "Total capital expenditure was $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year and $361 million in the quarter. After the merger, we put in place operational governance procedures to improve capital and ensure that we are prudently maintaining our infrastructure, while investing in the right growth initiatives to generate return to shareholders. This process is working well. You will see a step up in capital spend from the third to fourth quarter, which reflects our renewed drive to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition, including information technology.", "So moving on to our key financing activities; in line with our philosophy of having an efficient balance sheet, we completed $395 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter against our $3 billion authorization, bringing the total purchases under this program to $726 million by the fiscal year end. Since then, an existing 10b5-1 program's been completed, through which we acquired an additional $110 million of shares. We now have $2.2 billion of value remaining under our authorized plan. In addition, as we previously announced, we redeemed $1.75 billion of legacy Walgreens' debt in August. As we have said before, we remain committed to a long-term dividend payout target between 30% and 35% of adjusted net earnings.", "Now before I finish and hand back to Stefano, let me just spend a few minutes on the impact of our agreement to acquire Rite Aid and on fiscal 2016 guidance. As you know, the agreed price per share for Rite Aid is $9, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt. The consideration for the shares will be paid in cash from existing new resources. The transaction is, as you would expect, subject to approval by Rite Aid shareholders, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions. We have done significant analysis on how we can bring the two companies together, including the antitrust analysis, and we'll work closely with the regulators to bring the transaction to completion as soon as possible.", "That said, we anticipate the transaction closing in the second half of calendar 2016. The exact timing of this will clearly determine the impact on our financial results. Clearly, we are very confident that taking everything into account, the transaction will be suitably accretive for us. We have been prudent in our assumptions for the business and have been realistic about our expectations for the markets in which we operate. That said, we expect the transaction to be accretive during the first full year after completion on our usual adjusted basis.", "In addition to timing, there are a number of other factors that will impact us. We have identified in excess of $1 billion of gross synergies that we will start working to capture as soon as completion takes place, but we must recognize that while some of these are relatively easy to identify, others will require investment and will take time to deliver.", "As we are paying cash for the acquisition, we have taken the decision to suspend our share repurchase program and intend to redeploy that cash to partly fund the transaction. This means that in 2016 we will not enjoy the earnings accretion of the buybacks we originally planned. In fact, we will be running a relatively inefficient balance sheet for a short period of time. The transaction will also cause a temporary increase in leverage, but this does not represent an underlying change in financial policy. We'll put in place a glide path to deliver metrics consistent with our commitment to solid investment grade.", "So with all of that said, let me conclude by talking about our outlook for fiscal year 2016. As you know, we previously had a stated adjusted EPS goal for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.60. We committed, at our analyst meeting in April, that on completion of our budget process we would come back to you to give an updated view of 2016. Based on our budget and further evaluation of both risks and opportunities, which factor in a currency headwind of around $0.13, since the previous Walgreens management initially provided our FY 2016 adjusted EPS goal back in August 2014, we are issuing new guidance for fiscal year 2016 of $4.25 to $4.55. This change is primarily to reflect the impact of suspending our share buyback program, to apply these funds towards the consideration for the transaction. This guidance assumes no material accretion from the planned acquisition of Rite Aid, which is expected to close in the second half of calendar 2016. Please also remember that we have currency translational exposure, primarily based on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact for adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause particularly volatility in the sales, gross margin, and SG&A items, as it did this quarter.", "As Stefano indicated, we anticipate the published numerical synergy target from the merger between Walgreens and Alliance Boots to be met during 2016 and we will advise you after we have achieved that target. The synergies and benefits from the transaction with Rite Aid will be almost entirely within our U.S. Retail Pharmacy division, and so will be reflected in these figures rather than as separately itemized programs. Clearly, we will continue to drive hard efficiencies and cost procurement, but we see this as normal working practice rather than unique and discrete projects, and so going further beyond 2016, we would expect our earnings growth to return to a more normal, but still challenging low double-digit growth.", "In terms of the shape of the quarters, please remember that both our first and second quarters in fiscal year 2016 are non-comparable, given that we closed the merger on December 31, 2014. Seasonality is most prominent in our Retail Pharmacy segments, with the first quarter typically the weakest. Our second quarter picks up most of the holiday season, which will be more prominent going forward, as we will consolidate December results for Retail Pharmacy International. This will include Boots performance in December, which is typically its most important trading month. We also expect the shape of the second half of the fiscal year to be generally consistent with what we saw in fiscal 2015, with adjusted earnings per share in Q3 and Q4 stepping down sequentially from Q2.", "So with that, I will turn the call back to Stefano.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, George. So, another good year, but a year of transition that has brought many challenges but also with many successes, including our announcement with Rite Aid. It has been particularly gratifying to have been able to keep our team on track and maintain our momentum in our businesses, both in the U.S. and around the world, while at the same time be able to start to understand our new markets and deliver corporate expansion as we are doing with Rite Aid.", "As CEO, I very much recognize my role is both to support my team in achieving and supporting their goals, but also in creating the opportunities and direction for them to outperform and identify sources of growth and value-enhancement, while helping mark the route for sustained growth to secure the future for the company well beyond my tenure. As we stand today, we have potential opportunities in many businesses, in many geographies. We continue to review all the opportunities open to us to assess where best to deploy our capital to provide the best return for our investors. The healthcare market is extraordinary dynamic with many moving parts, and these dynamics creates new opportunities and new ideas all the time. A key part of my role is to make sure that we pursue these opportunities where they are desirable to do so, and not waste time and resources where it is not. And to ensure that we do that without distracting our teams from delivering on our long and short-term plan for our existing business. For the time, you can expect to see us complement the development of our existing businesses with further additions that we can do that will help us better define and differentiate our businesses.", "As we look at our opportunities around the globe, given the unique dynamic of the U.S. market, it is not surprising that the best opportunity we have found this year has been here, while elsewhere our expansion has been through the selective purchase event and small bolt-on acquisition to our revenue stream. The global healthcare markets, and perhaps the U.S. market more than any, are ready for change, and open to new ideas and new approaches that throughout provide scale. As the leading global healthcare company, we have the potential to play a defining role in this evolution. We have always married prudence with a willingness to find innovative solution and think about things in new ways and these are qualities I am glad to be spreading across the group and I believe will form the foundation for the success of the business going forward.", "Now, let's open up for questions. Gerald, please.", "Gerald Gradwell - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Special Projects", "Thank you. Andrew, we're ready to take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yes, hi, guys, good morning and congratulations on the Rite Aid deal. I did want to start just on that front; your press release \u2013 and the call, by the way, didn't really have any reference to your appetite for FTC risk. Does the merger agreement have a divestiture cap? If it does, can you provide more detail here? And as you think about FTC, I mean there is some history that we can sort of look back to 2007 when Rite Aid bought Eckerd, for instance in terms of the parameters that they looked at. Is that still a relevant way to think about it? Any thoughts related to all this I think would be very helpful for people.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "You know, it's very difficult to comment about that. Of course, before doing this decision, taking this decision and doing these steps, we have analyzed things very carefully. We have tried to figure out what would happen, but of course, it has been done within the closed walls of our company. In this situation, it is very difficult for us to make public comments. You know when we have public authorities, it is better for us not to interfere at all.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "I guess just one follow-up to that, then. I mean, because the merger agreement is going to come out soon, I would take it. So, how much divestiture risk are you assuming within this agreement? Is there a certain number of stores? How have you framed that in the agreement?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "We have put a cap because, of course, we have to take certain precautions, but we are not speculating at all about the number of stores that we will have to divest.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Just sorry \u2013 one, I apologize; but could you give us the number that you sort of capped this at?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I cannot give you the number and you know it.", "Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes, hi; good morning. So congratulations on the Rite Aid deal. Obviously, you've communicated $1 billion of synergies. Can you just help us think about the sources of synergies, and kind of like how long will it take to capture it? I mean should we think about it \u2013 I mean, when you put together Alliance Boots and Walgreens you've also communicated a synergy number, and you've kind of like allocated buckets to drug purchasing, front-end, et cetera. So if you can give us some similar context for the Rite Aid deal, it would be very helpful.", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "We've not given the specific details on this, but I'm sure you can imagine, as with any deal of this nature, there are different classifications of synergies. There are the procurement synergies, or the GNFR synergies; there will be other cost-saving synergies. And these synergies we will access in a structured way, much as we have done with the Walgreens Alliance Boots transaction. We've got a team who are very experienced in accessing those synergies, and we're very confident in our numbers. As ever, these gross synergies take time to access. Some of them can be achieved faster than others. Some will require investment, and we will work through that, but there will be an element of investment to get the synergies, we'll clearly go over the coming time we will work through how best to achieve these. But we've done a lot of work, as ever, to be really confident in the number that we have published.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But you understand that in this case the synergies are coming mainly by internal efficiency, by the fact that maybe we can have a better network to sell our brands product, which is still a fundamental component of our strategy. And so these will not happen overnight. It will take some time.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "And finally, to add to that would be that this is \u2013 the program is in a sense it's not between two companies, the acquisition will be in part of the Retail Pharmacy USA division. So it really doesn't make sense for us to report the synergies separately in the way that we did when these were essentially being shared half and half between Alliance Boots and Walgreens.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But I want to stress what George has said, we have done a lot of work, and we are very confident that this deal will deliver for us.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then Rite Aid has a small PBM business that they acquired recently. How do you think, Envision fits within Walgreen Boots?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Maybe Alex can give you. We have discussed this about their PBM business, and Alex can do something.", "Alex Gourlay - Executive Vice President, Walgreens Boots Alliance; President, Walgreens", "Yeah, I mean, as we know today, it's an important but relatively small PBM business. It's in the top 10, but not a big one. It's a (51:28) business with a lot of beauty abilities and IT, so at the moment we are really interested in, once we get beyond the closure of the FTC review to understand more about the business and how it could really help us understand access in America better. I mean our real purpose view with the deal with Rite Aid is to improve the quality of pharmacy and to really just cross across some markets and make sure we create a market which is more affordable and more accessible for everyone, aligned with the government policy. So we think this could be our way into that in terms of Envision. But clearly we need to understand more, and we'll understand more once we're through the FTC review.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "In any case, it will be a good opportunity for us to learn more. And we are always open to learn.", "Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Your line is open. Meredith Adler, we're not getting any audio from your line.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sorry, I had mute on. We haven't had an update in a little while on the loyalty program. I was wondering if you could give us just a little bit of comment on that. I think you're making some changes.", "Alex Gourlay - Executive Vice President, Walgreens Boots Alliance; President, Walgreens", "Yeah. Hi, Meredith. Alex here. Yes, we moved to something we called Everyday Points. We talked about in the last earnings review as well. And this is where for the majority of front-end products, we're able to offer points and also extended the points in the pharmacy business to other schemes like Medicaid and Medicare where appropriate. We're really pleased with what has happened. Customers have signed into this program. We have I think it's now 27 million about of customers signed into it, and they're collecting points. More importantly, as we analyze how they're redeeming the points, we're seeing encouraging behavior, behavior where people are actually selecting more and more on brand products and bigger baskets and products they may not otherwise have bought. So it's really early days. I mean, the program's been out there for only a matter of months, but the behavior we're seeing in these customers is encouraging. And it's exactly the behavior we've seen in other loyalty programs that we know well in the group. So that's where we are, and of course we intend, as we have done aggressively since we launched the program just over three years ago now, to invest wisely and carefully to ensure we get return back for our investments. And we're seeing the signs here where we can invest more in this program, and we'll do so in the years ahead.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then I have a question about Rite Aid. I think the company \u2013 Rite Aid's management has been fairly upfront about the fact that they have a pretty large number of underperforming stores. I think they've been hesitant to close too many stores because the leases have not yet run out. Could you please talk about your observations of the store base, and what your approach would be to those underperforming stores?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's very difficult to judge the operate of management because we should understand all the different events, and all the different conditions in which the management has to operate. They had a lot of complaints as you know. So, I believe they have done a good job of the situation that they were in. We will approach in our usual way, in a very rational way, trying to do what creates value. So we are not emotional on that, and we will be rational as ever. Alex?", "Alex Gourlay - Executive Vice President, Walgreens Boots Alliance; President, Walgreens", "Yes. I think that it's clear that we are working hard in Walgreens to really develop the front-end. And again, George gave a good update again of some the progress we've made here in terms of being able to improve our operational margin in the front-end the last six quarters.", "So as we develop the best ideas in Walgreens, as we take the best ideas from Alliance Boots, and again, George updated that we intend to extend our beauty products into 2,000 Walgreens stores, having done a controlled test in both Phoenix and New York City. And also as we really learn some of the \u2013 the excellent work from the outside that the Rite Aid team have done in their new wellness format, we have the opportunity to draw all that together, once we're through the FTC review, and see how we can improve performance in all of our network across America and to provide better front-end performance through a more appropriate offer for communities across America, supporting our better quality pharmacy experience and of course lower costs.", "So that's our intention. But obviously, once we're through the process with the FTC, we'll be able to work more closely with the teams to understand that better. But we think there is opportunity both in Walgreens, and clearly the team at Rite Aid are seeing good improvement in their wellness format and will be read (56:54) in terms of the reporting.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And I just have one more question. You highlight the sort of healthcare aspects of this and how the merger is going to position you. Are you considering eliminating tobacco? It seems pretty clear that providers and payers feel uncomfortable working with a retail pharmacy that still sells tobacco.", "Alex Gourlay - Executive Vice President, Walgreens Boots Alliance; President, Walgreens", "I mean, Meredith, we've chosen to invest to help people to stop smoking, to lose weight. Our Balance Rewards for Healthy Choices program we launched about 12 months ago has been incredibly successful, and we've chosen to invest there. Because we believe a little bit less than 3% of tobacco sold today in a drugstore channel, the choice tobacco is there already in many other places. Of course, we continue to review, reflect on this issue and other categories that we happen to sell. But our fundamental choice is to invest to help people who are ready, prepared to stop, stop. And we've made really good progress there and to work with them.", "So at this stage, we have nothing else to update on apart from that we are pleased with progress that we've made with our investments to help people across America stop smoking.", "Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, George, could you maybe talk a little bit about gross-to-net synergies and the investments that you feel like the company will need to make as you try to bring the two businesses together? I know the Walgreens executives have commented in the past that the IT infrastructure at Walgreens needs a little bit of work; I think the same thing is safe to say needs work at Rite Aid. I guess, though, as you try to think about gross synergies versus net synergies from your analysis, is there any more color you can give us there?", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. I'll just -just a quick word on IT. As I touched in the presentation, one of the reasons that we saw a step up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter was our IT program. And so we, as Walgreens Boots Alliance, have been doing a lot of work since the merger how best to structure our IT so that we are able to use our global scale and capability to invest in IT in a cost-efficient way, to best serve the needs of both the business internally, but, most importantly, our customers. So there's a lot of work on IT underway.", "In terms of the gross synergies, it's really \u2013 I mean these will come in the U.S., as we have said, which is why it will become harder to separate out then, as we start to integrate the operations post being able to complete the transaction. But the synergies will come. There will be procurement synergies where there clearly isn't an investment requirement. But then there will be investment over time in areas like in IT and in upgrading the stores, and we will do that in a thoughtful, structured way. We will be looking at stores on a store-by-store basis, as we always do, looking for the returns that we continue to seek. So the investment will always take a little bit longer to come, and it will be done over time because of the nature of that part of the integration takes longer.", "George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Alex if he is still there, can you provide us any early color on what the reimbursement rate environment is looking like for 2016? And how do you effect these conversations to evolve on a longer-term basis once the Rite Aid transaction is closed? Thank you.", "Alex Gourlay - Executive Vice President, Walgreens Boots Alliance; President, Walgreens", "Yeah, I can't comment on long-term basis. What I can tell you is that we really have anticipated the Med D season and we are now in enrollment. We are pleased; we've been able to expand our partnerships with payers. For example, we announced Aetna as a new partner for us, and we're really pleased with that. So we are feeling \u2013 the rates are as planned. Of course, the reduction from last year's rates as planned, as we expected. And we've been able to drive our strategy of improving access, of improving volume through some new partnerships. The commercial ones, as you know we're on three, four-year contracts. And we don't comment on these contracts publicly, as you're aware.", "George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Just one high-level one for Stefano and then just a couple quick ones for George. I guess just from a big-picture perspective, why was getting bigger in the retail space the right move strategically right now? And then I guess more specifically as it relates to that, how much more negotiating leverage do you think this expanded network will give you versus payers and PBMs?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have not done this to increase our negotiating power with payer and PBM. We have done this because we believe that we can extract a lot of synergies, rationalizing the combined company for, I would say, from internal sources and the harmonization of prices in term of harmonization and not improvement, the harmonization of our knowhow; something in software; something of course in the combination of the stores as we were discussing before; something from our products, from our product lines.", "We are not thinking of really improving our position with the payers because at the end of the day we are in an environment where the margins are decreasing. So it was decreasing. We are in an environment where there is a lot of competition. And the fact that we put together two companies will not reduce the competition \u2013 not just the competition among pharmacies. Think of other tandems, think of the mail-order, think of the people who are specialized in certain categories, like the specialty for instance. So there are many people working this area. I don't believe that these will really give up an additional power. But we have not counted on that when we have put together our numbers.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I repeat. We have put together our numbers very, very carefully and very prudently.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then I guess, George, just I'm sure you can appreciate it's very difficult for us to get visibility into the core pharmacy businesses, just given a lot of the moving pieces, not the least of which is the synergies. It looks like the total synergies in the quarter were about $295 million. Is there any sense at all you can give us on how we should be allocating those across the businesses, just to get a little bit better perspective on how the core businesses are tracking?", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I mean we very much try and allocate the synergies based on the activities; so I do appreciate that's made the segmental analysis a little tougher for you to follow. But by doing it on this basis of procurement, we really are therefore reflecting where the volume is, where the activity is. And as a result, obviously with the Retail Pharmacy USA being by far our biggest segment, then you should think of the synergies being heavily weighted towards the U.S. segment as the basis I would always think about it. I think as we annualize through as we get to the third quarter, which I guess will be our first clean year-on-year quarter, it will be a little bit easier for you to see. And of course, it's the hard synergies which are the ones that we're quantifying; but really are a lot of what are, in effect, synergies but they're not the ones that we can quantify, these are the ones that are really coming through as we now increasingly have integrated combined management team working very much together on many of the programs, sharing best practice. And that's very much business as usual now, rather than run through each synergy work stream.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's actually really helpful. And then just the last one and, more of a clarification, George. Did I hear you correctly that EPS growth beyond fiscal 2016 is anticipated to be low double digits? And if that's right, any sense you can give us of what's contemplated in capital allocation relative to that target?", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "I mean, yes, that's as far as we've indicated, just to try and give you a sense of how we see the business going forward. Sorry, in relation to capital allocation?", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Is that contemplated in the low double-digit target?", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "That's got a typical investment program. Absolutely everything is in there. I mean we are being quite prudent as you would expect in these areas.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "But when we are talking of next year, there is a point of next year, which if you do the math and take into account the fact that we will not be able to buy $2.2 billion in shares, you will see that the math is quite favorable. But this is substantially inorganic growth.", "So, in a retail business, to have an organic growth of double-digit, low double-digit is not easy. We have done this for many, many years, I have to say. We have never had one year without double-digit growth in our history. But I can tell you that it's not easy, because it's relatively easy to announce earnings per shares, buying back a lot of shares, or buying additional businesses. The business that we are buying this time will not have effect on next year; so you have to look at the numbers of next year as organic growth.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. George, I just wanted to go back to the synergies on the Rite Aid deal for a minute and just get the time of your expectation on the procurement side. My understanding is that Rite Aid has a relationship with McKesson for procurement that runs through March of 2019. So is the assumption that there is a way to break that relationship and you'll get procurement earlier? Or is it that the timeline is unknown on this, because you may have to wait till the end of the contract?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Lisa, first of all, I have to say we have not taken any decision about the contract. Not necessarily we have to change substantially the contract in order to get the synergies we believe we can have. And at the right time, we will discuss with the contract and of course we will try to discuss in the interest of our company, that's obvious. But you don't have to assume the fact that we will change the contract ore will move the contract. Of course, we have a good relationship with ABC; but I have to tell you that we have a lot of respect for McKesson and a lot of respect for Hammergren and Julian. We will see. We will see at the time. It's obvious that we will try to extract as much value as possible.", "Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, Stefano, you've talked about the U.S. market open to change, your belief in playing a role. You answered in an earlier question around the small PBM, that that's going to be part of this transaction. But can you maybe just give us any idea as to how you think about that potential role that you play, and from your strategic view how you think the U.S. market is changing, and what role the, say, bigger Walgreens will play here in the U.S.?", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, for sure, I can tell you that I have certain ideas. But before making these ideas public, I like to check this idea with the reality which is around us. Now we have just done a deal. We have just started; we have just announced a potential deal. We have started this deal; for a few months we will be really absorbed in this deal. We will continue to think. But for a few months we will not be able to tell you where we want to go next.", "Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I'm sorry, I was just going to say maybe the opportunity here is the beginning of next year. We will get together in January and maybe we'll have some incremental ideas as to how you'll think about this.", "Alex Gourlay - Executive Vice President, Walgreens Boots Alliance; President, Walgreens", "It's Alex here. I think it's about the patient and the customer having more power and more choice. I think with our fantastic group of people under Walgreens and the brands that they represent in communities across America, that's where we have our biggest opportunity, I think.", "Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I appreciate that and congratulations on Rite Aid.", "Stefano Pessina - Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much. We will have time to talk in future.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the last question that we have time for today will be from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Do you anticipate being able to utilize the Rite Aid NOLs? And how much, George, do you think you can raise from sale-leaseback deals in fiscal 2016?", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, on the latter one, we're continuing to evaluate what is the best capital structure going forward. We've obviously, as you can see, done quite a bit of sales and leaseback in the last particular year.", "Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah.", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "We haven't set an internal target. We will continue just to work through this in the normal way, but very committed to having an efficient balance sheet, as I said on many occasions. That's the answer to the second one. So the first one was...", "Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch", "The Rite Aid NOLs.", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "The Rite Aid NOLs, we'd anticipate over time being able to utilize the NOLs.", "Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just the clarity on the sales-leaseback, Walgreens had own 20% of their stores. I mean do you envision bringing that number down meaningfully over time, whatever the period?", "George Fairweather - Executive Vice President & Global Chief Financial Officer", "I mean, what I would answer is I'm not wedded on having to own Retail Pharmacy locations. Clearly there will be certain locations where it may be the right thing to do, but it's not something that I feel is necessary for our business model. So we will continue to look to operate there. We will continue to look at a sale and leaseback where we believe it's the right thing to do.", "Really taking, too, into account the timing of or the tenure of leases and when the lease breaks off, so that we have a balance in our portfolio going forward and don't have a bunching of lease breaks all at the same time. So we'll be doing this, looking at this in a thoughtful way over time is the way I would position it.", "Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful. Thank you.", "Gerald Gradwell - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Special Projects", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the final question we have time for. Thank you for joining us. We know that there are many others of you that had questions. Please reach out to the IR team here and we will answer them and address them as best we can. I should say that we go back into our next quiet period on December 1, so we have a comparatively short open period. Management have been very generous with their time, and we will try and get to as many of you as we can during that period. But please bear with us. You'll appreciate with an agreement as well as our results we have a very busy few weeks ahead of us. Thank you very much indeed.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program.

Sir, you have the floor.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 first-quarter earnings call.", "Today, Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer, will take you through our results in greater detail. Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Alex Gourlay, Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President of Walgreens.", "You can find a link to our webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com.

Much of the underlying detail remains available in the appendix, and you should refer to the appendix for that additional information. With that I will hand the call over to Stefano for some opening comments.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, Gerald. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first-quarter 2016 earnings call. I am pleased to report that today I started with a comparatively strong first quarter, as we expected. Our ongoing work to control costs across the Company and improve adjusted operating income margin is growing earnings overall, with adjusted diluted net earnings per share attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance up 32.1% compared with the year-ago period to $1.03. Although it is early days, we are on track to deliver against our expectations.", "In addition to the encouraging organic results from all three of our divisions, we continue to work hard to develop the Company. We have taken a significant step forward with our proposed agreement to acquire Rite Aid, and we remain focused on building new partnerships. In December, after the quarter end, we announced the fulfilment agreement with Valeant which, we believe, will enable consumers to conveniently access the Valeant's product at lower cost. I will come back to this later, but now will hand over to George to talk us through the financial performance for the quarter.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe.", "Starting with the first-quarter highlights, net sales were $29 billion, up 48.5% on the same quarter a year ago, largely due to the inclusion of Alliance Boots. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.5 billion. Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion and diluted EPS was $1.01.", "On an adjusted basis, operating income was $1.7 billion up 53.8%. Net earnings achievable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion, up 51.1%, and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.03, up 32.1%.", "These results are, of course, not directly comparable with first-quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in segmental reporting. Key factors driving our performance versus the same quarter last year were the Alliance Boots transaction and growth in the Retail Pharmacy USA division.", "Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.4 billion, an increase of 4.2% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable-store basis increased by 5.8%, driven by strong pharmacy volume and mix. Total sales growth was lower than comparable-store sales primarily due to the sale of our infusion business and store closures during the past year.", "Adjusted gross margin at 27% was 30 basis points lower, primarily due to ongoing pharmacy margin pressure. This resulted in $5.5 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.7%. Adjusted SG&A was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 2.1%. This reflects the meaningful progress made in our cost-savings program while maintaining our customer experience.", "The division's adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 11.2%, giving an adjusted operating margin of 6.1%, up 40 basis points. Excluding Walgreens' share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year-ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 22.9%.", "Turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy, pharmacy sales were up 6.7% for the quarter. 231 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis, including immunizations, an increase of 4.1%. On a comparable-store basis, pharmacy sales increased 9.3%, with comparable scripts build up 4.7%. Overall, we are pleased with our top-line growth, especially given the weak start to the cough-cold-flu season this year. According to IMS Health, the reported incidence of flu across the USA declined by 10.7% compared with the year-ago quarter.", "Our increase in comparable-store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy, where we grew market share, and a greater focus on customer care. This resulted in our refill prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increasing by approximately 20 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 19.2%, as reported by IMS Health.", "Consistent with our expectations, we experienced pressure on pharmacy gross margins. These were negatively impacted by lower third-party reimbursements, an increase in Medicare Part D mix, our continuing strategy of driving 90-day prescriptions at retail, and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. This was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions.", "Although we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure, we remain confident in our ability to grow the pharmacy part of our business over time. Our strategy to deliver this is to drive access to critical programs, such as Med Part D, through building deeper payer relationships and through developing innovative partnerships, such as our recently announced agreement with Valeant.", "Since the quarter end in December, our pharmacy sales were impacted by the continuing weakness in the cough-cold-flu season.", "Retail sales decreased by 90 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with sales in comparable stores down 60 basis points. This was primarily due to a reduction in unprofitable promotions as we increasingly focus on our key health and beauty categories.", "Additionally, as part of our strategy, we transitioned seasonal items away from holiday decorations, which were historically sold on Black Friday and in the November run-up to Christmas, with higher-quality giftable items that sell throughout the holiday season. This led to an anticipated fall in sales in the quarter.", "While gross margin was essentially flat, overall retail profitability increased due to the lower costs. Since the quarter end, December comparable retail sales were relatively flat with positive results from our strategic shift to health and beauty, wellness, and seasonal categories offset by the weak cough-cold flu season.", "We believe that our fundamental shift towards health and beauty is resonating with our customers and is an important point of differentiation. Having conducted pilots in over 400 stores, we're excited for the positive results we have seen, particularly for No7 and Soap & Glory. As previously indicated, we are expanding our differentiated beauty offering to approximately 2,000 stores with the rollout planned to begin in summer 2016.", "Turning now to our Retail Pharmacy International division, which is pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, the biggest business being Boots in the UK. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.5 billion, pro forma constant currency comparable-store sales being up by 2.2%. Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion, with an adjusted gross profit margin of 42.6%.", "Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion, the division's depreciation charge marginally benefiting from purchase price accounting refinements in the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $315 million, the adjusted operating margin of 8.9% being higher than in the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, as we expected.", "On a pro forma constant-currency basis, comparable pharmacy sales for the division were up 3.8%. Comparable retail sales up 1.3%.", "Boots UK's comparable pharmacy sales increased by 3.5% mainly as a result of additional high-value drugs dispensed in its hospital pharmacies, higher average volume, higher average item value, and growth in pharmacy services such as flu vaccinations. Comparable retail sales growth at Boots UK was 80 basis points, growth coming mainly from Boots.com, albeit at a lower rate than in previous quarters as in August Boots anniversaried its improved order online, collect in store offer.", "Cosmetics were the best performing retail category in the UK, led by a strong performance in premium, No7, and Liz Earle, which we acquired in July. In November, we added another exciting brand to our portfolio, Sleek MakeUP, which has a young and ethnically diverse customer base. Sleek is currently sold in over 100 Boots stores [technical difficulty] doing with Liz Earle.", "Outside the UK we delivered particularly good comparable sales growth in Mexico and in the Republic of Ireland. Benavides in Mexico, while currently a lower operating margin business than Boots, is a key priority for expansion, and we're working hard to find innovative ways to accelerate our store opening program.", "Since the quarter end, December performance has been encouraging. Boots UK's retail sales growth was higher than in the first quarter due to a strong online performance. Sales of our exclusive range of seasonal gifts were particularly good.", "Turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, overall, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division performed in line with our expectations during the quarter. Total sales were $5.8 billion. On a pro forma constant--currency basis excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 3.1% over the same quarter in 2015. This was slightly ahead of our estimated market growth, weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales. As in the prior quarter, sales growth was particularly strong in Norway; and we continued to see good growth in Germany and Turkey, two of our largest markets.", "Adjusted operating income was $166 million in the quarter, and the adjusted operating income margin was 2.9%.", "Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $288 million, so we are very much on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion in fiscal 2016. As I said on the year-end call, we continue to identify and action many other synergies which are simply not practical to quantify, as they blend into our core operations. At the same time, we're continuing to make good progress to deliver our $1.5 billion cost-savings program and remain on track to achieve this target by the end of fiscal 2017.", "Operating cash flow in the quarter was $732 million, reflecting our typical seasonal build in inventories. As I said on the last call, we continue to seek ways to deliver further working capital efficiencies, particularly in the US.", "Capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $340 million, which was just below the amount spent in the fourth quarter of last year. This reflects our drive, which I again talked about on our last call, to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition, including information technology. Free cash flow for the quarter, therefore, netted to $392 million.", "Since our Rite Aid announcement, we've made good progress with the funding. In December, we completed the placement of $5 billion term loan facilities and the syndication of a new $7.8 billion bridge facility. These new facilities replace our previously reported $12.8 billion bridge facility commitment. Drawings are, of course, subject to closing of the acquisition.", "Let me now conclude with some comments on guidance for fiscal 2016. As you will have seen in this morning's press release, we've raised the lower end of our fiscal 2016 guidance by $0.05 per share to a range of $4.30 to $4.55. This continues to assume no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of the $3 billion share buyback program, continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to stock incentives, and no significant changes in currency exchange rates.", "Please remember that we have currency translational exposure based primarily on movements in the pound sterling versus the dollar. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales gross margin and SG&A item lines. ", "The guidance I have just provided reflects current currency rates and so factors in a headwind of around $0.03 since we provided our initial fiscal year \u201816 guidance back in October.", "So I'll now hand you back to Stefano.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. The company has performed well overall in the first quarter, and I want to come back to that in a moment. I would like first to update you on a few of the things that we have been working on in the quarter and [themes digital] that has not had a direct impact on the quarterly performance and the review.", "As you have heard, we are not assuming our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid will provide any material accretion for the 2016. But I would reiterate that this transaction is progressing as we expected and planned.", "We continue to anticipate completing the acquisition in the second half of calendar year 2016. The transaction remains subject to approval by Rite Aid's shareholders, regulatory clearances, and other customary closing conditions.", "Rite Aid has issued their proxy and their stakeholders meeting to approve the transaction is scheduled for 4th of February. We are continuing to work closely with the regulators. You will have seen, as we expected, that we have received a second request from the FTC for additional information. This is a standard part of the regulatory process in connection with the FTC's review.", "Shortly after the announcement of the proposed acquisition, we appointed a highly experienced integration team which has been up and running since the end of November. They are now well underway on preliminary planning work.", "In December, we also announced our agreement with Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This agreement, though new to the U.S. market, has some similarities to the way we work with a number of pharmaceutical companies in Europe. It is a very good example of how we can transfer existing experience and understanding from one market and direct it to another.", "The two main parts of the agreements combine to provide Valeant with the opportunity to serve a far wider patient base at a significantly lower cost, and the potential to both grow their business and improve convenience and service levels at an overall saving to the healthcare system. ", "From our point of view, we have the potential to offer patients the medications they want and they have been prescribed with a high standard for counseling and therapy in a method that makes good use of our infrastructure and professional capabilities.", "So as we look at our business today and what we have seen happen in our dynamic and changing markets, it [serves] a number of global themes that I have believed to be inevitable for some time. ", "In healthcare, we are continuing to see increasing demand on the existing system for both preventative and therapeutic treatment. This is only compounded by inflationary pressure of new, innovative, and correspondingly high cost [product equity].", "In [desire] to mitigate this pressure and provide more and better care at lower cost, our pharmacy stands out as being one of the most convenient, flexible, and lowest cost means of meeting the challenges which the system faces. ", "Our agreement with Valeant demonstrates how we can use our pharmacy network to improve access and service level while reducing costs in the healthcare system.", "As we have seen in Europe and elsewhere, we believe that when we work in close alignment and true partnership with Valeant in the sector, we can achieve immense benefit, both in service level, therapeutic care, cost savings, and of course in financial reward for both our partner and ourselves. This is why I want the partnership to become a characteristic by which our company will be known, as good partnerships deliver real value.", "As you know, our pharmacy services operate in close alignment with our retail division. In retail, we are at the beginning of a journey, to focus on our customers' true needs and to differentiate our Retail offering.", "We have seen the real changes taking effect. And supported by good operational disciplines, these will deliver growth for the future.", "Like all other retailers, we have also seen an acceleration in the US in customers moving towards omnichannel retail, with online shopping working in parallel and integrated with the physical store. This is a trend we have seen in many of our markets, most particularly in the UK, where we have adapted our model to embrace this trend. We must now decide how to deploy our success and experience to maximize the opportunities which this trend presents worldwide.", "Today, we have delivered what I believe to be a strong performance for the business in a process of transformation. Looking forward, there is no doubt that we still have a lot of work to do within our core businesses to optimize them for their existing markets, to introduce new products, services and ways of working, and to further enhance our spending with our customers.", "These are fundamental drivers that I believe will help us to deliver the long-term earnings growth that we are confident to achieve. As a company, we continue to look at new areas of business to add to our portfolio; we continue to find opportunities complementary to our core operations professionally, commercially, and geographically, that will help us grow the business and enhance its financial performance.", "Ultimately, our success relies on the quality and commitment of our people globally. Their experience, expertise, and drive will improve our business every day. The commitment I see from our team gives me great confidence that we will deliver what we have seen for fiscal 2015 and beyond.", "Now let's open up for questions. Gerald?", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Brian, we are now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies, your line is now open, please go ahead.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Hi, good morning. I wanted to dig a little bit on the Boots side of the business. You have a shift in strategy there where you're focusing more on top-line growth rather than margin. Wanted to see: what's the progress there on the margins at Boots? And then I wanted to ask a little bit about what you think about the opportunity to turn around Rite Aid longer term.", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, first of all, we have not shifted our strategy. We are pursuing both sales and margin.", "Of course, you don't have to judge on a single quarter. We have a program which has been designed over many years, and we are managing the Company in the long term. Whilst we try to be as good as possible each single quarter, but this is not our ultimate aim. Our ultimate aim is to transform this Company.", "So from time to time, we will see the prevalence of the sales or the prevalence of the margin. And maybe you, Alex, can respond to this.", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, thanks, Stefano. Yes, obviously, I know Boots very well from the past, and I think that where we are in Boots is a pretty good space. I think as Stefano has indicated, Boots is really well established in the UK, an enormously loyal customer base, which I [find] the team they are successfully growing.", "So for the first time in many years they're starting to grow this forward and grow customer base in Boots UK using an omnichannel strategy. So the same great products, the same great positioned stores, the same great people who [technical difficulty] for many years. But now we're expanding and using the new technologies customers are engaging with both here in the US and also globally, but particularly in the UK, I think George has said already.", "In terms of Rite Aid, we're feeling pretty good about Rite Aid. They announced their results [technical difficulty] to me. We know there's five years and things they've done also in their front end in growing sales that we can learn from as well.", "As always, the idea here is to put the Companies together in a way that allows us to really get the best practice from both Companies here in the USA, while importing some of the best ideas from other markets.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Do you think you'll have to put a lot of capital into the stores to drive the turnaround in the Rite Aid base?", "Alex Gourlay", "Again, we are really in the early stages. We know this space very well. Our team in Walgreens obviously knows the Rite Aid space extremely well, and we don't think this is a big problem.", "They have had a good investment program in about 2,000 of their stores already, over 2,000. And we believe that with appropriate investment and importantly, as George said, appropriate returns we can get the right sales and margin mix in Rite Aid over time.", "Stefano Pessina", "But what is important -- Stefano again -- what is important to understand is that we couldn't have a better time for this deal. Because in reality we are already investing a lot of capital to transform Walgreens, from the stores in Walgreens. And so at the end, this will be just an extension integration Rite Aid will be just an extension of the work that we are doing at Walgreens.", "If we had done this in three years' time, probably we would have had to start from scratch. Now, we will just continue in the work that we have to do in any case.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Stefano, now that you've done this big horizontal acquisition, do you think there's a possibility of going vertical with your acquisitions moving forward and maybe contemplating a PBM transaction?", "Stefano Pessina", "Yes, you know what I think. I couldn't have been clearer since the very beginning. I have seen this market and I am really convinced that vertical integration is a necessity for the market, [by] market. It is part of what we have to do to reduce -- to control the costs in the healthcare arena.", "Any kind of vertical integration is good. It depends on the opportunities that we will have. It depends on the availability of partners.", "And also there are many ways to have a multiple -- a vertical integration. You can have a merger, which of course is the perfect way. But you can also have a commercial agreement, a very strong commercial agreement, and very strong partnerships. And as we have said many times, we are always open even for a partnership.", "Mark Wiltamuth", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Gill", "Great, thanks very much and good morning. So Stefano, can I just follow up on what you just said around a strong commercial agreement or a partnership as it pertains to a PBM? Is that something that we should expect to see Walgreens announce with one or maybe more than one PBM, as we think about putting together partnerships, in your word over the next 12 to 18 months, how do we think about putting this into context and your overall thought on strategy?", "Stefano Pessina", "I would like to give you an answer because this will mean that I would have a clear idea and a clear target for the next period. Unfortunately, you have to realize that we have just done a deal; we have to digest the deal that we have done.", "We have to look around. And at the right time, when we will be prepared, we will tell you which kind of deal and when we can execute the deal. But we have done two big deals in less than one year give us the time to organize ourselves.", "[Not that we don\u2019t say about the time], let's be clear, it's a problem that we are very rarely speaking, we know what we can do, what we can digest, what we can afford. And so at the right time we will come back to you.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay. Then secondly, when you talk about the Valeant deal, you talked about the fact that you view this as a first stepping stone and maybe some other opportunities in the market. So I guess I have to questions there. The first would be, do you have specific manufacturers you're discussing opportunities with today? And then the second part is for George. Is there any contribution in the updated guidance from the new Valeant relationship?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, the first part of the question I can tell you that we are -- again, we have just done this deal. We have to execute properly this deal. We have to show that we are absolutely able to manage this kind of relationship, as we have demonstrated many, many times in Europe and after we will think about a potential deal if we will find other partners.", "Lisa Gill", "Any financial contribution?", "George Fairweather", "Yes, on guidance, obviously guidance includes everything for this fiscal year. I just would point out, obviously, that we are only shortly going to commence and start to roll out the Valeant program. And of course as ever when you bring in new programs, there's various startup costs that have to be incurred when you go down a new route.", "So, yes. Yes, yes, it's included; recognize that we're half way, pretty well halfway through the year, and this will be ramped up really starting relatively shortly, but will take some time to ramp up.", "Lisa Gill", "Thank you for the comments, and I look forward to seeing you next week.", "George Fairweather", "Look forward to seeing you too, Lisa.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken", "Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. So on the cost side in the U.S. business, it looked like versus what we saw on the fourth quarter you made some great progress. I think there you had maybe had some upfront costs at the end of the year. Can you just help us understand in terms of the progression? It's pretty obvious on the synergy side how well you're doing. But on the larger plan, the 1.5 billion plan, what are some of the examples of projects where we see more of the upfront savings? And then how do we think about some of the longer dated projects that will deliver maybe some value there over the next, I don't know, 18 or 24 months?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, hi, it's Alex here. Hi, Ross. Yes, some of the examples which are maybe more the operational examples, we've spoken about these before. Obviously we've confirmed the [turn] of stores and we're well over halfway through that program, and that's going fairly well.", "We have reduced some opening [areas] as appropriate to make sure that we're able to give better care when more customers are actually in our stores. We've swapped our photo labs for dry photo labs using digital technology; and obviously that's been a great success on the cost side but also important in the growth side as well.", "So these are some of the structural changes that we've been doing so far. But there is some nice work I think in centralizing a lot of pharmacy operations which allows our pharmacists to give more attention and care to customers at the counter, while reducing cost substantially in the cost to fill.", "And all of these are programs that we continue to run into the future. We're not short of ideas. We have a very strong operational and IT team here, and we're working on all the things we can do to reduce workload throughout the Company but particularly our stores, so we can take better care of our customers. And we've got a lot more to go at, both in the plan and other ideas that we will develop over the next period.", "So we believe these are sustainable changes. We believe, importantly, the customer care numbers that we measure internally are going up as well. So removing work, taking better care of customers, taking back costs out, and starting now to reinvest back in the costs that are most important to the customers: have more people in our shops to serve them, as appropriate; and obviously getting the value proposition right as well for customers both in pharmacy and also in the front end.", "So that's where we're on the cost program: bang on track, and more to come, and developing opportunities for the future.", "Ross Muken", "Maybe getting back to the broader based question on vertical integration, I think as, Stefano, you said, merger is always preferred; and that makes sense, because then you have control. On the other side, going on Lisa's question with maybe agreement or partnership or something of the sort, what do you need to have accomplished in something like that?", "And what are the challenges in making sure the economic benefit to the two sides are equivalent, and that both parties are working for the good of each other and the customer? What are maybe conceptually the things that you need to get out of it?", "And then I stated some of the obvious challenges, but what are some of the others in terms of not having necessarily control over the whole relationship and only hoping that your partner, whomever that may be, participates in the same way? Obviously you got there on Valeant and you've done it before; so I would just love some broader context.", "Stefano Pessina", "First of all, let me say that I have never, ever spoken about control. What we want is to do something which creates value -- long-term, sustainable value. We have never spoken about control.", "We have done many, many deals where at the end we have lost the control, and it's by chance that many of our mergers have come back. And this was not the design. It was just the force of things. When you merge a company, when you merge two companies, you have one company; and of course, all the people of the previous two companies are members of the new company. You have just to try to select the best people for the best hope.", "And the people can come from everywhere. So we have never, ever -- I can tell you, I can assure you, never, ever done a deal with the idea of controlling the resulting company, first of all.", "Secondly -- so we are open to any merger; we are open to a merger where we could have the control, a merger where we could cede the control, a merger of equals. We would be open to everything which would create, I repeat, substantial and sustainable value immediately and in the future for the Company. This is for the merger.", "For the commercial partnership, of course, you can imagine many, many different kinds of commercial partnership. Valeant is a really good example, but there are other kind of partnerships that you can do on the cost side, on the margin side, creating synergies that you can share.", "And there is not a model. Every time you have to discuss and you have to see what is the best way to create value and how to share the value.", "But if you approach these discussions with an open mind, maybe sometimes it's possible to find a solution. Alex, you have seen many of these joint ventures, commercial joint ventures in the past, so you can say something maybe.", "Alex Gourlay", "[inaudible] I think that thing that's important here is to create the win-win. For example, in Valeant what we see is the opportunity to really take friction out for customers and patients and doctors and pharmacists so they can spend more time with patients, and therefore patients win. So the whole idea behind Valeant as I think Stefano said in the introduction really is about taking friction and cost out of the interactions between healthcare professionals and giving more time to customers.", "We're becoming more of a services company. We've been faced with things which have to do with the job of pharmacists, which is providing actually dispensing and making sure people understand their drugs properly. And that is great for pharmacists and great for profession. ", "And we've committed, as they, as we all have committed to over time ensuring that we independently monitor, that we deliver more costs in the system as a result of working differently together.", "That's an example we're developing in the U.S., and we will take our time to get this right and make sure that we implement in a way that is appropriate for the systems that we work in America. There's lots of examples in Europe I wish we could go into as well, in terms of not just retail locally in a way that creates win-wins and ensures we deliver better care at lower costs. And that's really what the partnership strategy is all about.", "Ross Muken", "That's super helpful on my end, and I as well look forward to seeing you guys next week. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Robert Jones", "Thanks so much. I actually had a PBM question as well. I know you guys don't provide specific timelines for the large PBM contracts; but based on previous public announcements, it would seem that you're about three to four years into the contract with the three largest PBMs. So I'm just curious. Is there anything you can share as far as how we should be thinking about timelines for renewals, and maybe directionally how you feel reimbursement might match up relative to historical reimbursement rates?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, it's Alex here. Hi, Robert. Again, we don't discuss these contracts openly, so I can't comment on the timelines. What I can comment on is that our strategy is to improve access, access to customers and access by having good partnerships, as we said before, with everyone in the marketplace. And I think, as we probably said, we are working hard with all of the major partners to improve access and also to drive the business forward.", "You look at the performance of Part Med D and you see again it's been a successful strategy. We are well set up again for this season. These are annual contracts in the main. They are becoming more sophisticated, as we also know, being paid of course on services within these contracts. And again we're determined to give better value, better care within these contracts. And we're starting to gently but progressively improve relationships and grow share. As George has said we grew share again in the quarter, which we're pleased with; but we know we have a lot more to do.", "So that's where we are. So we are feeling more confident in relationships with the PBMs. We are feeling more confident as we give better value to the market in terms of both price and quality of care. We get a better return. And we'll continue to develop our strategy over the months ahead.", "Robert Jones", "That's great. I guess just maybe go outside the U.S. for my follow-up, really solid performance in the Retail International segment both from a sales and EBIT perspective. But if I look at the constant currency, same-store sales growth there was about 2.2%, a kind of a step down from what you've seen the last several quarters. And then on the flip side, the EBIT margin came in much higher than we've seen, significantly higher than what we've seen in the last three quarters. Could you maybe just help us walk through some of the dynamics at play in the retail international business? What's driving, outside of same-store sales growth, the strong sales performance? And then on the margin, what's contributing to that upside, and how sustainable could that level be as we look across the next three quarters of fiscal 2016?", "George Fairweather", "Okay, I'll try and have a go at this. There is always an element of mix. But I think that one of the factors that I tried to draw in is obviously we're continuing in -- the biggest business is Boots in the UK, it's the biggest business in the division. They're continuing to perform well. As I said, we had -- in looking at the sales where omni-channel is and Boots.com in particular is a very important part of our growth strategy. We did in the summer anniversary just at the beginning of August our much faster online collect-in-store offer, so we've seen the impact of the growth of that coming through; then the anniversary; then we brought in some new development. So we saw this improvement coming then back up again into the December numbers, which together with the strong gifting meant that we've had a good Christmas in what's been a particularly competitive environment. ", "So in those businesses, it's really about having a differentiated front-of-store offer and then increasingly supported by omni-channel. Of course, in Boots in the UK we're able to piggyback on the Alliance Healthcare distribution system to do that. ", "So if you look at Boots' performance, certainly it's still early days, we're just starting to see some of the figures from our competitors on the [High Street]; but I think what's coming through pretty clear is that Boots is continuing to be a real winner there.", "In terms of the margin, really two points. One, there is always a seasonal impact, given the importance of the retail part of our offerings in Retail Pharmacy International. Of course, we started to see the buildup in November, because it tends to be that people start their Christmas shopping a little bit earlier in Europe than would be the case here in the United States.", "So there is a seasonal element and then, as I said also in the presentation, we got a little bit of a benefit in this quarter from the finalizing of the -- we're working towards finalizing our purchase price adjustment to the fair values that you have to do on the acquisition of Alliance Boots. We got a little bit of benefit there which helped the margin in this quarter that we won't see when you come and look at the same first quarter in 12 months' time.", "The key factor is the seasonality. Of course as we look towards the second quarter where we've got the very important holiday trading, the December results and into early January, you'll also see the benefit of that coming through when we're on the next call.", "Robert Jones", "Got it. Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you very much, our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank, your line is now open, please go ahead.", "George Hill", "Hey, good morning, guys, and I appreciate you taking the question. I guess this one is either for Alex or George. As we think about the Valeant deal, I guess can we talk about the economics of that deal, I'd say versus you guys and then using the regular wholesaling channel?", "Is this structure more economically attractive for you and for them, as we've heard a lot of the midsize manufacturers scream a bit about the fees that are paid to wholesalers? I'd appreciate any color.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, George. It's Alex here. Yes, again as I think we've said it's about taking friction and cost out of the system. For sure, we have an infrastructure here in the USA of the pharmacists; and of course in this deal importantly there will be independent pharmacies in this deal as well, because we wanted to make sure that we give customers proper access to the good products that Valeant has. And within that we have the ability, therefore, to distribute as well as fulfill the prescription, and that's what we intend to do in this occasion.", "But as Stefano said before, every single partnership we work with, at least on meds, we look at how do we create a win-win for our partner and what's important to them, and how do we use our infrastructure, our assets, in whatever country we operate in to make that so. So what we do here is we provide great care and a service model to our pharmacies, to our pharmacists, to the patients; and then we distribute these drugs at this occasion as a fulfillment.", "Each one will be different depending on the circumstances. And as Stefano said already, we will test this model properly to make sure that it is appropriate and does work in the US.", "George Hill", "Okay. Then maybe the quick follow-up would be just to get on Rite Aid. Given that you guys have gotten your second request, I guess anything in the conversations thus far that would indicate whether you guys have any changes on store divestiture expectations? Synergy expectations seem to still be intact. But I guess as it relates to divestitures, are you guys still thinking the number is less than 500?", "Stefano Pessina", "We don't have any reason to change our view. As I have said before, we're working with the relevant authorities in order to speed up the process if possible of course. For the time being, we cannot add any comment to what we have said. We are still confident that this will go through in the terms that we have anticipated.", "George Hill", "Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley, your line is now open, please go ahead.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Yes, hi. Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter. A couple of questions here.", "The first one, if we think about the contract with Valeant, we can also think about it as a form of vertical partnership, right, that helps reduce cost by removing like the distributor from the equation. So when you think about tightening relationships between you and manufacturers and like bypassing the distributor, do you think that this is something that theoretically can be extended to other manufacturers, or these will be like one-offs?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, Ricky. Yes, I think as George said before, many manufacturers are looking for more efficient ways to get to the market, to get their products to the customer and to the patient. So again, Valeant came with that request to us, and other manufacturers may or may not come with that request to us, and we'll look at each case individually.", "So for sure it's really the same answer, I apologize, as we gave to George. Which is, we have a great infrastructure in the USA; we have a very strong logistics operation in the USA; we have good expertise in wholesaling coming from [indiscernible] division across the rest of the globe, particularly in Europe.", "And we will always do our very best to take cost out of the system, to do a better job for customers, and do a great job for our partners. So we're opening to these opportunities, but we've got to make sure that this one actually works and does work in America. And we'll take it from there.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay. Then I'd say that the tone call is a lot more positive than your last conference call. So have you seen something in the marketplace or internally that makes you feel better now on the business trends than you were a few months ago?", "Stefano Pessina", "No, we were confident. We have been confident for all the time we have been here. If we had not been confident we wouldn't have done this deal.", "We have done this deal knowing that we were going through a period of, let's say, substantial work that we -- to really be able to exploit all the opportunities which were there, which are here, which will be here, we have to do a certain work. And this is what we are doing.", "So maybe it's possible that sometimes we are more or less good in our presentations, but this doesn't depend on our mood. It depends maybe on our physical condition, I don't know, but not on our mood. Our mood has always been positive, is still positive. And we still believe very strongly in what we're doing. If by any chance we changed our mind, we would feel obliged to tell you; but I can assure you we are as positive as we were one year ago.", "George Fairweather", "You can take from that, Ricky, that I found a reasonable coffee shop with good pastries this morning before the call.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "There's nothing like American coffee, right? Okay. Thank you very much.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "David Larsen", "Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the adjusted gross margin in Retail USA? It looks pretty good to me, 27.0%, that's actually up a bit sequentially. The year-over-year compression of about 39 basis points, that shows some improvement in the rate of compression relative to the past couple quarters. So can you talk about the reimbursement that you're seeing in the Part D networks, also the commercial plans? And then, what impact is generic inflation having on those margins? Thanks.", "Alex Gourlay", "Thanks, David. Hi, it's Alex here. I think that the first thing I would say, it really is as anticipated. So this is really as we expected.", "Generic inflation, going to the last part of the question first, is not material. So therefore, we are feeling pretty good about this, and this is factored into ongoing guidance going forward.", "The trends beyond that really are the same trends. We have ongoing reimbursement pressure as we work with the market to lower costs. They are more or less as we expected, and the trend continues in the same fashion.", "It's something we're used to in Europe, as we said before. I've worked in Europe for many, many years, and it's a trend that we expect to see, because as healthcare expands and government pays more and patients pay more then you've got to work to become more efficient within the market. And that's what we commit to doing.", "On the front end margins, we are pleased with the profitability as we continue to swap out old products. As George said in his introduction, we took out all of the order home decoration products, which primarily sell in November; and we are replacing these with more giftables.", "This was really the first year of that transition. We had great support from some of our partners. We have more plans to shift that mix next Christmas. And also importantly we have view 2,000 where again we're shifting the mix towards more beauty products, owned brand beauty products, from Ken's organization with the launch of these products in over one-half -- 1,000 extra stores to get to 2,000 stores by somewhere around Christmas next year. So the trends are very similar, to be honest. We are pretty predictable. Maybe the one that was a bit less predictable was promotional markets where, again, we gave great promotional through the autumn. So we've had to adjust that a little bit after that period. And of course, that's important to stay in a market and stay prepared, which we are doing. So really the trends are the same. We adjust as we go, but the fundamentals are the same.", "David Larsen", "Would you expect this 27.0% gross margin to continue or improve for the rest of the year in Retail USA?", "George Fairweather", "As you'll appreciate, we don't give forecasts at that level. I'll really reiterate what Alex is saying: we expect, as we see in Europe, ongoing reimbursement pressures. There's obviously a little bit of growth in specialties as well, which I talked about, which of course has got a high unit margin but lower percent. So there will be some of these mix effects continuing to go through. And what we've got to continue to do is drive the efficiency and the productivity. It's absolutely the way of life.", "What we're really focused on if we come back is, is looking at the operating margin end-to-end. That's where I know Alex and I are very, very focused.", "Coming back to the retail example, Alex just talked about a lot of the promotional work that we talked about created a lot of inefficiency in stores and a lot of cost. So what you've actually got to do is drive the efficiency out as well as focusing just on the gross margin, because what's important is to be able to grow our operating margin from the business over time as well as our top line.", "David Larsen", "Okay. Then just one more quick one. Assuming the Rite Aid deal does close, I think what I heard maybe last quarter was that you would expect the deal to be accretive in year one. Can you give any more color around that?", "Like, what exactly does that term accretive mean? Would that be about and beyond what the Rite Aid earnings would normally layer in? Just any more color around that would be really helpful.", "Stefano Pessina", "We have given you the level of synergies. We have said $1 billion of synergies. We still said we are into that number.", "Of course, the synergies will be down, day after day since the time when we will be able to execute the merger. You can really value for these [guesses] from these how much of these synergies will be possible in the first year.", "We said that we would need two or three years to deliver this $1 billion, so you can see. We have given an indication.", "To be honest, we don't want to be more precise because we don't know exactly the terms. We don't know exactly how many pharmacies we will have to divest; we will know exactly how many pharmacies we could consolidate. So we don't want to be more precise for the time being; but overall, you have an indication.", "David Larsen", "Okay, that's super. Very helpful. Thanks a lot and congrats on a good quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, our next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities, your line is now open, please go ahead.", "John Heinbockel", "I guess for anybody, but particularly Alex, there would seem to be -- one of the ways the Rite Aid deal is going to work really well are the learnings that you can pick up from them; and obviously there's a lot of potential there. Obviously they do the loyalty card differently than you; they do the Wellness Ambassadors, the Care Coaches. What are the one or two things that you look at from afar and are intrigued by, where there might be some earnings that are particularly applicable to your store base?", "Alex Gourlay", "I think the first thing is this company has managed with very limited resources for some time and has done it very well, and I think that's a great discipline. It's a discipline, to be honest, the Walgreens team has picked up really quickly in the last 12, 18 months.", "I think it's people also in the Walgreens organization to use money wisely. But again we have an opportunity I think to learn even more about that, given the level of cash that Rite Aid didn't have in the last period. So that's the first one.", "I think related to that, secondly, to your point, they've invested wisely in their best stores. And they are getting -- from the numbers that the team speak about, and you will confirm, they're getting nice lifts in their refitted stores.", "To be honest, as we review some of the stuff we did in the Well Experience we hadn't been successful in the past, maybe two or three years ago, with some of these lifts. We're now getting better lifts.", "I guess I think if we can put these lessons together we can make better use of our capital and get better lifts in the front end. And of course with [indiscernible] really some really great products coming out of the global sourcing organization from Alliance Boots that [indiscernible] mentioned, [same] with beauty, developing into healthcare, into seasonal gifts. We put these three things together.", "So we are very open. Partnership is about openness, curiosity to learn, and that team has done a good job in these two dimensions in particular.", "John Heinbockel", "Do you have a view to, again from afar, the Gold customer or Silver customer, the nature of that loyalty program, which is very unique relative to a lot of loyalty programs in the US? Is that something that's particularly intriguing as something to give your effort a bit of a boost?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, we had a start at [indiscernible] Walgreens. I mean, the loyalty card here is only three years old. We have 85 million active customers on the card; we have now got almost 28 million, I think it is, save up Everyday Points, which was only launched in May.", "So we're very curious about how that card works in the marketplace, and we'll certainly take our time to understand it and see what benefits it could bring to our partnership.", "John Heinbockel", "Sure. All right. Then maybe just for George, on the $1.5 billion cost-reduction program, have you seen -- was there any benefit in the first quarter? Have you seen anything to date?", "And then if you think about how that breaks out 2016 and 2017, is that more back-end loaded or front-end loader?", "George Fairweather", "We're just really working through the program, so every quarter we're getting more benefit coming through. I think we said we were broadly at the halfway stage at the year end, and we're just working methodically through it with Alex's team.", "We're pleased with the progress and very much on track to deliver this program. Of course, once we're through this program, we will always seek new ways to drive further efficiencies. It's just got to be a way of life for our business going forward, just as we've done in the UK, just as we've done successfully in Boots over a number of phases.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two, and it goes to the Valeant deal that was signed.", "Some of your PBM partners have been on the record saying that they thought the deal was kind of the opposite of what you guys portrayed; it increased costs to the system. So I want to ask you why you think their point of view is so different.", "Then the second question is, as you look at these partnerships, is Valeant the -- obviously you thought it was the right partner. I'm trying to -- I guess I would ask why. And then I had a follow-up question on something else.", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, hi. This is Alex here, Scott. We are determined to implement as well, and we're determined to be very transparent about what the real costs are as a result of this partnership. And as I think we said in our statement that we have employed, actually lead this team to independently review this.", "So we are working very closely not just with Valeant but with our PBM partners to understand their concerns, and we will take care of these concerns. We're not looking to disrupt the system and terms of what they are trying to do to lower costs. We're trying to take costs out of the system which will help them to lower costs for their payers. That's our intention.", "Of course when you introduce something new to the market and some new thoughts, there's always people who maybe think differently about it. But we are determined to implement as well and make it work. ", "And in terms of why Valeant, well, because of the fact that they came to us and they asked us would we be able to, we have done the business in particular with the situation that we're in. We did appropriate due diligence and we decided that this is a good opportunity to take some of the lessons that the team, particularly Ornella's team in Europe, had learned about the attractive pharmacy model in wholesale.", "So we saw the opportunity to lift and shift our best practice in Europe into Valeant. And they liked the idea, and they walked through it pretty quickly and got to a good place in that pretty short period of time.", "They are a great team to work with, and we wish Mike a very speedy recovery. The team themselves are very engaged and working with us very well, and we will do all we can to make sure that any concerns are taken care of and are independently reviewed.", "George Fairweather", "And, Stefano here, don't forget that they have accepted to reduce their price, which is really, I would say, quite exceptional particularly here in the U.S. And they have accepted it because they have understood that a new model which should cost less should deliver benefits to the customers, to the final patients. And this is very important. This shows that this need of new ways of working, the innovative way of working, is really understood. It's important that it's understood.", "Someone has to start, and we are very happy that we'll be able, I hope, to demonstrate how this model will work in the U.S. and how this model could reduce cost for the final customer.", "Scott Mushkin", "Right, makes sense.", "Alex Gourlay", "I know it's a big subject, but remember we are both global companies. Valeant are a global company. They operate in many markets that we operate in. We have great infrastructure across many markets, as Stefano and George and others have explained. So we believe once we implement this well in the U.S. there are other opportunities for us to work in a partnership with Valeant.", "A 20 year deal was unusual, but it was there because we wanted to make sure that over time we generated a great platform not just here in the USA but also they are very good quality products, to make them more available to their brands and maybe even some of their own brands possibly in the European and other markets. So this is a much broader deal than just Europe.", "So to come back to why Valeant, there is a second reason because they are a very good company with good expertise on a model which is a very, very efficient R&D model.", "Stefano Pessina", "And also, as you know, we at Boots are very focused on skincare and we have many products in this area. We're a market leader in this area, and Valeant has also many products and many patents and intellectual properties in this area. And the collaboration could really improve the quality of our relevant products.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Okay, Brian, I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Yes sir. Our last question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you. Two things, if I could. First of all, SG&A performance, SG&A dollars in the U.S. I think grew in 4Q a little more than expected and improved in 1Q. Curious of the difference between that and how we should think of that going forward. And then secondly, I think you said the retail margin was flat in the quarter in the U.S. It seemed like you had done some things to improve profitability. Curious on the color there and then how we think about that line as we move forward.", "Stefano Pessina", "Before I answer the two questions I would like to attract your attention to what I have said at the very beginning of this call. In reality, you don't have to measure up for the quarter taking all the different elements of our Company quarter by quarter.", "We have a long-term project. We are following this project independently on the quarter, and so you will see sometimes better rewards or KPIs, and these will not be always the same. You have to judge on the whole, and you see that on the whole we will continue to progress, as we have clearly demonstrated in the last four quarter.", "Every quarter we progress, and it's a mix of everything we do. The gross margin is important, but at the end of the day, what is really important is the operating margin; it is the earning, the profit that we can extract from an operation.", "Sometimes you have to sacrifice the gross profit because the [lower] increase in the gross profit or in the gross margin can be very expensive but to achieve a level cost or another cost. So we have always a holistic view and this, our holistic view, is extended over a long period of time and not over a quarter.", "Maybe you can answer in detail. But this is the logic, the philosophy.", "Alex Gourlay", "Maybe if I give a specific example in photographic, [tipping] the point that Stefano is making. In photographic we reduced substantially our operating costs by removing more expensive-to-maintain, more difficult-to-use, and requiring more people to use them, wet labs, the old labs. We removed all of that very quickly, in a period of about 18 months across all our states and replace them with a new digital technology which, in essence, reduces the gross margin actually but actually, because of the operating cost advantages of that system, drives two things.", "It drives volume. We had a very strong volume right through the period, and as part of the about-flat sales that George mentioned, in holding [the November] period, that was a driver up the way of sales.", "And also we have been able to offer better value to customers, and we're very pleased with the performance in that category. We have really driven a big differential.", "And that's been also transported to Boots as well. Boots are using the same platform with the same effect now in the UK. So that's a great example of what we mean by operating margin.", "In terms of costs going forward, we remain confident in our cost plan. We're on track [technical difficulty] people's attitude towards this has been fantastic. The teams have done a great job, and customer care scores are up because we're taking workload out.", "So going forward, you should expect to see the same activities. Now how they fall quarter to quarter, as Stefano said, sometimes varies depending on a number of factors. But the strategy we're implementing is a very clear strategy, and we're very pleased with the progress.", "George Fairweather", "I'll just emphasize on top of that really that we're very disciplined in the way that we look at returns, be it from capital, be it from revenue, revenue expenditure. It's really back to what we said earlier: we're very focused on creating real, real shareholder value. So that means driving out cost inefficiencies as fast as we possibly can in a way that still keeps the focus on the customer.", "But equally, we're perfectly willing to invest, invest in either capital or invest in revenue expenditure, where we're confident we can get a good return; and we will always do that. It will mean therefore from time to time we will get the variations between the various categories.", "The important thing is to continue to drive up our overall returns and deliver long-term, sustained shareholder value. And of course there will always be seasonal variations. It's the nature of our business.", "Alex Gourlay", "[technical difficulty] just on seasonality of sales, that point is an important one, which is explains in substantially varying over 10% in the quarter just past. And if you look at the publicly available information, it's continued to a similar if not higher trend in the last few weeks as well. So again, seasonality is a big flux in our business, always has been, always will be.", "But one year we have a benefit maybe from seasonality; one year we have less benefit from seasonality. So we feel very confident our strategy is working and we will feel very confident through the quarter, as Stefano said, we will see that coming [technical difficulty].", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question we have time for on the call. Thank you for joining us today. Feel free to reach out to Ashish, myself, or any of the IR team if you have any further questions. And I hope you all have a good day. Thank you very much indeed.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Gerald Gradwell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Special Projects of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Sir, you may begin.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings call.", "Today, Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer, will take you through our results in greater detail. Also joining us on the call and available for questions is Alex Gourlay, Executive Vice President of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President of Walgreens.", "You can find a link to our webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com. After the call, this presentation and a webcast will be archived on our website for 12 months.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements that are based on our current market, competitive, and regulatory expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. It is a pleasure to be talking to you all today, although I must say that these quarterly earnings calls always present me with my challenge. The work that we are doing within our businesses around the company is far reaching and over time we will have a confirmative impact. But quarter-to-quarter it is not always easy to find new things to say or to demonstrate the changes in our company other than by the meticulous taking of the detail numbers and that is naturally what George is here to do.", "My role on these calls is to put the results in the context of a bigger picture, but that bigger picture though it will look very different over the years to come, does not show great [indiscernible] of a time and frankly, we should all be glad about that as stability is generally a good thing.", "The changes we are making must be managed carefully and progressively if they are to have a long term and sustainable impact on the company. This quarter we have continued to make good progress in driving cost out, establishing even more efficient working practice and in factoring the company appropriately for the future.", "We can see the impact of this in the company's results announced today with adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance diluted share up 11% compared to the same quarter last year to $1.31. All three divisions have we believe delivered a very creditable financial performance, but there is plenty more to do and we are still at a relatively early stage in this process.", "Since last quarter results, we have made good progress in developing the company with a more focused mindset and strategic direction and I will talk about this later in our presentation, but for now I will handover to George to talk us through the financial performance.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Stefano. Good morning everyone and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Overall we view our second quarter performance as quite good, particularly given the number of headwinds including the weak cough, cold, flu season and currency translation.", "So beginning as usual with the key financial highlights for the quarter, net sales were $30.2 billion up 13.6% versus the same quarter a year ago. This increase was largely due to the consolidation of Alliance Boots for the entire second quarter this year and to sales growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. Foreign currency translation adversely affected sales by approximately $750 million or 2.4%. This was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.", "On an adjusted basis operating income was $2.1 billion up 15.2% of net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion up 14.4% and diluted earnings per share were $1.31 up 11.0%. These results are of course not directly comparable with the second quarter of fiscal 2015 due to Alliance Boots transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in our consolidated group and segmental reporting.", "We have now lapped the closing of that transaction and we'll have fully comparable quarterly results beginning in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.9 billion up 35.1%. The GAAP net earnings level our performance versus last year was impacted by a number of accounting factors. The most significant being last year's non-cash gain on the remeasurement fair value of our previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and the change in fair value adjustments on our AmerisourceBergen warrants. As a result, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $930 million and diluted EPS were $0.85.", "This is a leap year our second quarter results benefited from one extra day versus last year. We have also prepared all comparable sales and prescription figures to include only the first 28 days of February. For completeness, here are the numbers for the first of half of fiscal 2016. I will not go through those in great detail, but you will note that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.34 is up 18.2% versus the same period a year ago.", "So turning now to our segmental performance. Total Retail Pharmacy USA sales for the quarter were $21.5 billion an increase of 2.1% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 2.2%. This sales growth was driven by increased market share partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business last April and the weak cough, cold, flu season which was particularly strong in the comparable period last year.", "Adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.7% primarily due to procurement efficiencies. This resulted in $6.0 billion of adjusted gross profit up 2.8%. Adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion an increase of 30 basis points as we continued to focus on store efficiencies and controlled corporate costs. Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion up 2.1% giving an adjusted operating margin of 7.6%. Excluding Walgreens share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the division grew by 10% and adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points.", "So turning now to look in more detail at Pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 3.2% for the quarter, 233 million prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis including immunizations. It was an increase of 3.9%. On a comparable store basis, pharmacy sales increased by 3.7% with comparable scripts filled up 2.8%. We view this as a good performance, particularly given the weak cough, cold and flu season this year which we estimate are the 30 basis points negative impact on comparable scripts.", "Reported incidents of flu across the USA declined by 16% compared with the year ago quarter according to IMS Health. Overall, our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased by 19.5% up approximately 20 basis points over the year ago quarter, again as reported by IMS Health. Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by Medicare Part D growth strategy where we grew market share.", "Consistent with our expectations we experienced a decline in Pharmacy gross margins, which were impacted by ongoing reimbursement pressure and changes in mix, including an increased contribution from Medicare Part D. As you know, the new Medicare Part D rates came into effect on January 01 this year. Our second-quarter results therefore included two months of the new rates, but looking ahead our third and fourth quarters will reflect their full impact. As we've said before, we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure in Pharmacy, but remain confident in our ability to grow the business over time.", "Retail product sales were up 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015 with sales on a comparable basis down 30 basis points. Gross margin increased compared with the year ago quarter. Again, we are pleased with these results given the weak cough, cold, and flu season. We estimate this headwind had an impact of approximately 100 basis points on comparable sales this quarter. We saw good performances over Christmas and New Year with strong sales in giftables and candy.", "Wellness, another area of focus also performed well driven by sales of vitamins and first-aid products. We also made good progress in driving sales of No 7 during the quarter. As I have mentioned before, we are on track to rollout our differentiated beauty offering to an additional 1600 stores beginning this summer. This will increase the total number of stores with this beauty offering to approximately 2000 by the end of calendar 2016.", "So let me now provide more detail on our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total Retail Pharmacy International sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion with pro forma constant currency comparable store sales up 2.3%. Adjusted gross profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross margin of 41.1%.", "As you are aware, this quarter is not directly comparable with the same quarter last year which did not include December 2014. December is a very significant sales month, but typically has a slightly lower gross margin reflecting a higher proportion of gifting items. Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $335 million. The adjusted operating margin of 9.1% was higher than the year ago period due to the seasonally strongest month of December being part of our second quarter this year.", "So looking more closely at the segment, comparable pharmacy sales on a pro forma constant currency basis were up 2.6% and comparable retail sales were up 2.1%. Comparable pharmacy sales in British UK increased by 3.0% as a result of an increase in average item value and additional high-value drugs dispensed in hospital pharmacies. Comparable retail sales at British UK were up 1.8% driven by good performance over the holiday period.", "Growth in our boots.com 'order and collect' service was strong with seasonal categories on our beauty product brands such as No7 and Soap & Glory being key drivers. Liz Earle also performed very well in the quarter both in-store and online. We are continuing the UK rollout of Liz Earle and Sleek which we acquired in November. Outside the UK sales growth continued to be particularly strong in the Republic of Ireland.", "Turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales for Pharmaceutical Wholesale were $5.6 billion. On a pro forma constant currency basis, excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 1.6% over the same quarter in 2015. This was in line with our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales.", "Turkey, the UK and Norway performed well, while the French and Russian markets remained challenging. Adjusted operating income for the division was $155 million in the quarter and adjusted operating income margin was 2.8%. Going forward the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division will include our share of net earnings attributable to our equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.", "I'll now just take a few moments to explain how we will account for this. As you know following the exercise of our first tranche warrants on March 18 we own 34.2 million shares or approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of AmerisourceBergen. We will account for this investment using equity method accounting subject to a two-month reporting lag. The lag synchronizes our reporting with the end of the quarterly fiscal periods.", "Due to the lag in our third quarter we will only recognize our share of equity income for a couple of weeks, but of course we will recognize a full quarter of equity income in our fourth fiscal quarter based on AmerisourceBergen's quarter ending June, 30. From a funding perspective, we used approximately $1.2 billion from existing cash on hand to exercise the warrants.", "Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $329 million taking the cumulative total for this fiscal year to $617 million. We are well on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies in fiscal 2016. We are also continuing to make good progress in delivering our $1.5 billion cost-saving program by the end of fiscal 2017 and are well on track to achieve this.", "Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.4 billion driven by our combination of operational performance and cash conversion from the sale of seasonal inventory. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $317 million. As I have said on previous calls, we continue to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition including IT. This resulted in free cash for the quarter of $2.0 billion. As we have stated previously, we're very focused on cash flow and are very disciplined in making capital allocation decisions and we remain committed to a solid investment grade rating.", "As you have seen from our press release, we have narrowed our fiscal 2016 guidance range to between $4.35 and $4.55 by raising the bottom end of the range by a further $0.05. This assumes AmerisourceBergen equity income on a two-month lag no material accretion from agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of the balance of our $3 billion share buyback program, the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives, and no significant changes in current currency exchange rates.", "Please remember that we have currency translational exposure. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales gross margin and SG&A line items. We estimate that 1% move in Pound Sterling and the euro versus the dollar impacts full year sales by approximately $150 million and $125 million respectively. On an adjusted earnings level a 1% move in Pound Sterling impacts full year adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share of the impact of the euro is somewhat less significant.", "Note that other currencies can also impact reported results, particularly on the sales line as they did this quarter. Our guidance reflects current currency rates and so factors in headwind of $0.06 since we provided our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance back in October 2015.", "Since Walgreens provided its fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share goal way back in August 2014 that was a $4.25 to $4.60 we've encountered a currency headwind of around $0.19 per share.", "And lastly, when considering the outlook for the balance of this fiscal year, please keep in mind that during the third quarter of our last fiscal year that we had a temporary pause in certain investments within our U.S. business as we evaluated the returns being generated on certain projects.", "By the time we entered the fourth quarter of last fiscal year we had finished this exercise and resumed our more normalized SG&A spend. This led to SG&A last year being a little lower in Q3 and a little higher in Q4 than you would expect on a more normalized basis. So with that, I will hand you back to Stefano.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. So, if you\u2019ve heard of all our companies therefore being pretty much in line with our expectation. [Indiscernible] we are now past the main year of the exceptional items that impacted us during the last few quarters as we began to work of bringing our management information system together and started work as with most of our projects is now complete after such a short time as a unified company we are making good progress.", "As our business begins to normalize and embrace a new approach to important gain control both at the business and operational level we are beginning to see far more cleanly the impact and implications of the levers we have to influence our operations and the areas where we have the greatest opportunities and the areas where we have the most work to do. I have to say that this is very much what we expected.", "It is an important and necessary exercise to help ensure our priorities are correct and our assumptions are not flawed. I believe that one of our greatest things as a managing team is that where we can, we base our decision on provable facts and where we can't, we always and I mean always question our own assumptions.", "Then we go back and check whether we were right or not so that we can learn and do better next time. In our U.S. division you can see some examples of how slightly you focus on the way we work is impacting the company already in a very real way, beyond the impact that our cost saving and synergy programs are bringing. In the more innovative approach is we are taking in terms of partnership and strategic relationship such as that we have entered into Valeant Pharmaceutical, why Valeant is as a company is clearly still working its way through some challenges.", "The collaboration that we have with them, though still in its early stages is showing some very promising results in terms of improved access and affordability of their product. Since the close of the quarter, we have announced a partnership with OptumRx to create a new 90-day at Retail Pharmacy collaboration giving eligible OptumRx member choice of how to receive their medication and providing them with 24/7 pharmacists availability.", "Although I cannot disclose the terms of this contract, it is fair to say that it has been structured so that there is a shift in mutual benefit to us working together to increase the utilization and volumes in a more collaborative manner that I understand to have been the case in the past.", "Of course, now let me [indiscernible] is continuing as we expect with the regulatory approval process progressing in line with the timetable we had expected. All these actions not only contribute to the development of the company, but also provide us with opportunities and the flexibility to continue the process of reviewing and rejuvenating our existing operation, both in retail and pharmacy, further differentiating us in the marketplace.", "These actions also validate that in seeking to lead improved efficiency in the healthcare value chain we not only target highly selective M&A activities, but also new partnership and relationship driven on equity alignment like AmerisourceBergen.", "Innovative commercial relationships such as the Valeant supply contract as well as improvement in long-standing arrangements with our critical business partners. As we have always said, this is much longer term, but it\u2019s essential to the sustainable future of our company.", "We have to find new innovative and valuable offering to continue to bring people to our stores. In pharmacy, the contracts can help us to do these to an extent, but we need to announce our patient offering and then ensure we maximize the value of that interaction both to the patients and to ourselves as a company through enhanced services and a richer relationship between the patients, the pharmacies team and our company overall.", "In the front of our stores, we need to focus our offering, be clear what we stand for and define our two areas of expertise and differentiation and we need to offer these through whatever medium or interface the customer wants. We have done well in controlling cost and improving efficiency, but we understand that these have limited life span, if the growing [indiscernible] cannot be altered.", "Alex and his team know this and are very focused on their very strategies to address the recent trend. If these all sound very U.S. focused it is perhaps not surprising as today the U.S. is the market where we have the most immediate opportunities. This does not mean we are neglecting our other markets. Far from it. In the UK, the team is working hard on strategies to keep Boots stores and our brand portfolio not just ahead of the market but most relevant to its customers.", "While working on plan to manage and mitigate the next round of what is ever present government pressure on pharmacy prices and across our businesses owned and in partnership to our equity investment, the work on [indiscernible] constant daily to renew the structure of payment, to be the best they can be and to always be ready to address the challenges, but more importantly to take the opportunities where we see them.", "However, we must do this with a strict vigilance and vigor so that we achieve it without disrupting the extraordinary level of service our customers that they\u2019ve come to they were right to expect from us and without failing to deliver for you as the owners of our company. Now let\u2019s open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. You may begin.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question and great performance in the quarter. I just had a question on the U.S. retail pharmacy operating margins. On an adjusted basis, it looks to be flat relative to last year, so I\u2019m wondering to what extent did the soft flu season hurt your margin this quarter and as a follow-up to that based on what you\u2019re seeing out there, what is your level of confidence that the operating margin in the U.S. retail business will continue to improve both this year and longer-term?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi good morning, Alvin, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes the cough, cold season, I mean the mix particularly in the front of store does have an impact. We have already noticed that we actually might increase the margin from the store despite that impact.", "On the other side, which is still the bigger impact on the operating margin in the U.S. is pharmacy reimbursement and we continue to see the pressures we've spoken about in the past on today and also going forward as George mentioned on the call, we might be seeing additional volume point of view on plan and have the expected impact on margins and reimbursement pressure as results.", "So I will say that there is really no change overall in the margin. We continue to work hard to improve the front end store margin with some successes and we continue to see constant reimbursement pressure which we\u2019re dealing with as we are planning to do going forward.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Thank you. And on the guidance, it does appear to include the ABC equity income now, I\u2019m just curious, what you\u2019re building in for the EPS contribution from that?", "George Fairweather", "Yes it does include ABC, we\u2019ve obviously, this is no change to where we\u2019ve always internally looked at this because obviously the economics of the warrants were such that it was the right thing to do to exercise the warrants, the first set of warrants at the earliest opportunity, which is what we\u2019ve done.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Got it and last one from me, I\u2019m just curious about the beauty rollout. You know I know New York and Phoenix are some of the most matured markets, I\u2019m curious if you could give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there, have you seen an uplift I\u2019m sure to the beauty section but I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen one at the overall front end?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Alvin, it is Al again. Yes, we\u2019re really pleased with the performance both particularly in Phoenix which is more normal for the - in the state. I\u2019m taking the best model we saw in Phoenix and we're now rolling that out as George said to 1600 more stores this autumn. I\u2019m very confident about the return we will get from that.", "It\u2019s certainly impacting the beauty basket in a positive way and in particular No7 continues to be the brand on skin in particular which is driving more frequency and driving a bigger basket. So we [indiscernible] the execution plan is on track and the team are really excited about this. And if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s not just about the products, it\u2019s also important about the customer care model and slight and important enhancement, overall look and feel in a standard drug store.", "So it\u2019s not just about the products, it\u2019s about the overall experience the customer would start to get in beauty and it lays a really good foundation for the future where we have potentially more opportunity and more brands and more opportunity over time to satisfy more customers in the front end in beauty.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Yes, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. You may begin.", "Robert Willoughby", "Just a quick one, do you have any opportunities to expand the generic purchasing power of your consortium? I guess what we\u2019re asking is, do you have a role, any role whatsoever in the Amerisource discussions with Express Scripts about renewing their distribution agreement this year?", "Stefano Pessina", "No we, of course, of course Amerisource is a separate company and they have to manage their contract independently on us. For the generics, the situation is quite complex because it\u2019s not obvious that if you buy more, you buy better, it depends on what you buy and where are you buy.", "It is an analysis which has to be done very carefully and we have also to think that if you want to really be preferred customers, we have also to abide by certain rule. One of those rules being the fact that you must have the right quantity of products because if you need more products then the manufacturer can manufacture, you have to go and have meet the manufacturers at the certain time and at that point, your bargaining powers of course is less because instead of them needing us, we need them.", "So the situation is complicated and of course, we analyze any opportunity on the market. We are open to discuss everything which can improve our efficiency, but we don\u2019t have to believe that every contract or every addition at the end is really profitable.", "Robert Willoughby", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Kutcher with Barclays. You may begin.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thank you. Alex you mentioned that in Part D, you\u2019ve seen the type of volumes you expected but obviously rate pressure, could you speak to your overall strategy on rate versus volume and what you have seen in commercial plans, I know there is some major contract renewals this year, what you've seen in January and February in terms of volume delivered and how this fits in with the broader Optum strategy?", "Alex Gourlay", "Thanks Eric. Yes I think it is finally the results, we have been pretty clear that we want to try more volume into pharmacies and we have been encourage by what we have been in that D and again this season has gone well and therefore you should expect us to continue to drive our strategy in Optum. [Indiscernible] is an example of that where we have an opportunity to work with the team Optum and to really take care of customers 24/7 and provide more services where they want to get a mail order or where they want to pick up in their local pharmacy.", "I\u2019m pleased with that partnership to of course that starts and join in 2017. In terms of our overall strategy to drive more volume into our pharmacies we know that we have to continue to build good relationships and strong relationships with every single payer including PBMs and health systems and insurance companies.", "And that we intend to do, has been a real focus of a Brad and Richard and their teams and we are happy with the progress they are making. The one thing I would say is that, as we always say \u2013 we said this in the start is that we know that reimbursement pressure will continue and therefore we think this is going to be an effective strategy and we believe this will be true at tomorrow as it has been for us in the last 12 months. And of course finally we don\u2019t make any comment about the major contracts. As you know, that's not something we talk about in the open until we have completed.", "Eric Kutcher", "Fair enough and may be a follow up is, have you seen uptake as a result of programs, clinical programs you are putting into place, have you seen any willingness to adapt narrow networks and a more aggressive stance I am thinking back to the Caterpillar type strategy that we saw several years ago?", "Stefano Pessina", "Yes, I think we are seeing now in the networks, I think that\u2019s been a feature of the market family for the last couple of years. But more importantly and we\u2019re seeing people pushing for more of a healthcare comments particularly in the Med D space we have, there is more payment available now for delivering against the SARS on generic utilization. So, I think these features of the market are continuing and we continue to recognize them and do what we can to make sure that we are part of that, not these networks and delivering good care and good quality to our customers.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Yes, hi good morning and congrats on a very good quarter. Stefano in your prepared comments you talked about really how you are challenging the norm in looking for new ways to partner with the different players and continuing. So when we think about the Optum relationship, can you may be share with us any kind of like thoughts about do you have opportunities to expand that beyond Optum and also to include kind of like the united population? Are you having these conversations or is this something that would depend on the success of your relationship with Optum?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, this a first step of course so as you have said. We are very keen to create new partnerships and to have good relationship with as many companies and many people as possible and I don\u2019t exclude that we could do similar things with other partners. Whether this is the first step for further integration, well it seems to me that we go too far if we say this. It is obvious that any, any kind of additional relationship, any collaborations its helping to understand better each other and to find other ways to collaborate. But this agreement is what it is, it\u2019s a commercial agreement which makes a lot of sense, which can create value for both parties, it could be followed by other agreement. Of course we are open, but we could also have similar or different agreements without a partner.", "Alex Gourlay", "Ricky, it is Alex, I just want to add one thing, our biggest Med D partnership remains with United that they are very important player in our space and we\u2019ve been with them for some time and Walgreens and continue to work closely with them.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay, so I guess the question was right, it seems that there is kind of like opportunities once you kind of like tie in the health plan data to kind of like take a more holistic view of the patient and really kind of like empower the pharmacy which I think are things that you have been talking about in the past. So, kind of like for us kind of like when we step back and we think about the longer term this is kind of like part of the bigger vision from Optum-United tie?", "Stefano Pessina", "I wouldn\u2019t give too much weight to this agreement, but I can also say that this agreement for sure is not an impairment problem that relates to the future.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay and then I noted obviously you can say a lot about Rite Aid, but obviously the divestures are top of my investors will get a lot of questions about it. So I guess has anything changed in the comparative landscape since you announced the deal that could impact the potential divestures?", "Stefano Pessina", "No, nothing has changed, except the fact that we are collaborating and as the time is passing probably the solution will be closer because at the end of the day we knew from the very beginning that this would have been a very long process that we would have been of many, many documents and information. We are going through the process, the process is developing in an absolute normal way and so we hope that sooner or later we will have an indication on where we are, but of course we cannot put a day or within a month for this indication because it depends very much on how deeply the FDC wants to analyze all of the documents that we have given, but is nothing a typical exactly on line with what we were expecting.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay, great and last question for George. I know, I think you said that no comment on Express, but just in terms of may be timing clarification given your fiscal year, should we think about just an Express contract is it relevant to fiscal year 2016 or is it more a fiscal year 2017 type of an impact?", "George Fairweather", "We obviously, don\u2019t comment on individual terms of contracts with any of our peers is just Alex had said earlier, so really I can\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t really answer that question.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.", "Robert Jones", "Great, thanks for the questions, sorry if I missed this, but could you share what the generic headwind and price inflation impact were on the U.S. pharmacy same-store sales? It seems to us like price inflation meaningfully decelerated, so I guess first is that correct and then if that is correct did the weakness come more from the branded or the generic side?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, hi, hi, Robert it is Alex here, yes there was a shift towards more of the inflationary and in part particularly in generic switches that always the bulk of our volume, our value so again that is true, but again it\u2019s a \u2013 obviously it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s being \u2013 we were more or less flat last quarter and this quarter we're going straight with the inflationary. And I think the other thing that\u2019s this what [indiscernible] bring really in terms of sales is importance of the specialty business within that as well and again we are driving that pretty well overall, but again as that was an impact in terms of sales year-on-year again in terms of some less inflation in specialty which is a quite a big value number overall.", "So, I think that was, the two key things. We're pretty pleased with volume. You know the volume was, I think as George says it was up 3.9%. We gained some market share according to IMS and that\u2019s pretty much on the trend that's been going out for some time now and we continued to drive that quite hard. So, that's where we are so a slight deflation in generics, slight slowdown in specialty. I\u2019m pleased with volume.", "Robert Jones", "Got it. And then I guess George, just wanted to ask a question on the proposed treasury rules from last night, I know it just came out, but is there anything specific around the proposal specifically around intercompany lending that would affect your tax strategy? Just curious if that or either of the proposals as you see them at kind of first glance would limit your ability to generate more efficient tax rate?", "George Fairweather", "Rob we continue to obviously closely watch those all those developments, at this stage it\u2019s too early to comment. We continue to look to ways to optimize our arrangements in terms of funding, but at this point really I\u2019m not envisaging any change from what you\u2019re seeing in our current numbers, but we will keep you posted.", "Robert Jones", "Fair enough. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may begin.", "Lisa Gill", "Thanks very much. I just want to go back to a couple of comments. First, Stefano, you talked about patient offerings and announcing services related to your pharmacists, can you give us any indication as to some of the things you\u2019re thinking about there and does that tie into specialty or I was trying to hear more in the market that we\u2019re seeing more and more specialty drugs actually comes through the retail pharmacy, is that a trend that you\u2019re seeing and is it more that you\u2019ll have pharmacists helping to manage some of those trends, if you could just give us an indication as to what your thoughts are there?", "And then as it relates to Optum, I know you don\u2019t want to give specifics, but is there any way that you can maybe give us parameters, you or George around how to think about, how many incremental prescriptions we could see come with this relationships based on other narrow network type relationships that you\u2019ve had with United?", "Stefano Pessina", "No I don\u2019t believe that we can give [indiscernible] we cannot give indication about the contract and about the specialty, what you want to know exactly?", "Lisa Gill", "So are you seeing more specialty drugs coming through your retail pharmacy than in the past or perhaps in the past it\u2019s gone through a specialty pharmacy rather than coming through the retail network? So are you starting to see programs for example where your pharmacist is interacting on behalf and doing more services around specialty and just any thoughts that you have around specialty contracting and the impact to your business right now?", "Stefano Pessina", "I believe that these should be an important development in our company in the future. We have started. We are focusing our attention on specialty. The specialty side is important and it will continue to be important even though the margin will probably shrink and so they would be important because they would be a big part of the market, but there will not be probably in future, so profitable as they are today. All the same of course, we have to play our part and so we are focused on that. But it\u2019s true that we could offer for the specialty service to the customers that as pharmacist that not many other people could offer, maybe Alex?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes it\u2019s Alex here. Again, I think it\u2019s really insightful question for sure. For sure there is more interest from manufacturers in mixed model or central specialty on distribution to retail pharmacy and that\u2019s because the patients and customers do like having care closer to where they live, when they are on certain medications so the carers do as well.", "We\u2019ve seen that trend and I will say going for a while. There has been more interest and more contacts particularly since we started to speak about new model and relationship with Valeant, but at this stage we are really working out through in terms of what does that mean for what we do today.", "So we know we got some great assets and communities beyond the [indiscernible] in terms of excellence that we have within our normal drug stores, we have community pharmacies well over 100 now close to where some of these specialist doctors look after patients and we have again plans for well over couple of hundred in hospital pharmacies as well again doing with outpatient specialty.", "So we think we got a fantastic network to be honest to deal with this trend as it comes through, but we\u2019re still working, so the interest is high. We\u2019re building our assets and we\u2019re working on other partnerships we need with both manufacturers and others to try and take advantage of this trend.", "Lisa Gill", "And then just my last question would be, your comment Stefano around the relationship with Optum and the fact that it doesn\u2019t preclude you from working with others, you could see some closer relationships in the marketplace. Back to that, the comments around the Express Scripts contracts being up, I know a few years ago there was a Smart 90 contract that was signed. I\u2019m just curious, do you see incremental opportunities to work with Express specifically, are there ways to enhance what you\u2019ve learnt from that Smart 90 relationship and perhaps to increase the offering and have a tighter relationship between Walgreens and Express Scripts?", "Stefano Pessina", "We have been very clear that we can see the partnership as one above the most important value that we have and we want to put these in practice. So, we will try to create partnership with as many players as possible and of course I see the opportunity to have a great relationship with Express Scripts. I don\u2019t see an impediment. After you have to do what is possible if there are certain relationships which could be good on the paper, but difficult to achieve because after you have to interact with other players, the manufactures, they also have company, may be certain partnerships cannot be achieved, practically achieved, but everything that can be achieved and everything that can be in the interest of the two parties has to be explored and if possible has to be done. So, for sure I see the possibility of having very, very, very good relationship with Express Scripts.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.", "George Hill", "Yes, good morning guys and thanks for taken the question and this one is either for George or may be Alex. I guess as we think about the moving pieces that drove the improvement in retail pharmacy gross margins in the quarter, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for understanding the severity between the generic drug price deflation and the changes in reimbursement rates that impacted at the start of the year and I guess was it a big positive from the changes in drug pricing and a big negative from reimbursement or should we think of a small positive from the changes in drug pricing and a small negative from reimbursement changes, I just want to understand severity of the mix?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes and again the first thing I would say is, it is Alex here, [indiscernible] accent, it is Alex here, the impact happened definitely in each quarter. To be honest I wouldn\u2019t look at any quarter in isolation, as George I think has said, we\u2019ve only had two of the three months this quarter actually have the Med D impact. So, I think is able to look for one quarter in isolation and what I would also say is that we are constantly working hard at procurement not just because deflation, as Stefano said because of the good capability we harbored in Europe. And therefore we are working hard to try to deliver more synergies.", "The cost space also that they would working on its balance \u2013 but all of that is a balanced out by the ongoing reimbursement pressure beyond simply the Med D contracts. There are commerce reimbursement pressures and when the impact is we'll let you know, but they are definitely there and also we are working them hard as well. So, I was say on balance the opening margin in this quarter were slightly more positive because of the impacts of when some things hit the overall trend is really the same trend that is seen and may be seeing for some time\u2019s and with management trend.", "George Hill", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Caldwell with Robert W. Baird. You may begin.", "Eric Caldwell", "Thanks. I have just a couple here, first going back to Optum quickly without going into contract specific details, could you explain in more detail how the economics of a deal like this might work in terms of revenue and profit to Walgreens and will you be booking full Scripts revenue on 90 \u2013 day fills just a service fee, some combination of both and realizing this might be overly meaningful to revenue for some time, would a deal like this generally be seen as margin accretive or margin dilutive to the Retail Pharmacy segment.", "George Fairweather", "Hi a load of detail questions there Eric and so I can\u2019t answer anything as part of the contract. What I can say is our objective is to get more prescriptions into our pharmacies not lowers our overall operating margin by making better use of our fixed assets. That's a really important component in this particular program. It also allows us to take better care of Optum members when in the pharmacy particularly making sure they are taking their medication properly and making sure that as they are as in chronic conditions that they get direct to back into a probably health system a bit more fast as well as saving costs elsewhere.", "That\u2019s really into this program. We are comfortable with the deal that we\u2019re \u2013 is a fair deal both ways and we had a great conversation that went through with the team from Optum and we are in good shape. Obviously the certain assumption is gone in from both sides and we will wait and see what happens over the length of the contract. Remember this does not really start until January 17, so it will be some time before any impact of this new contract is seen in our P&L.", "Eric Caldwell", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. If I could just do a quick follow up on Bob Jones question, I\u2019m not sure if I caught it, but did you specifically quantify the year-over-year revenue impact from generic shifting from inflationary to deflationary?", "George Fairweather", "No, we didn\u2019t and we can\u2019t.", "Eric Caldwell", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. You may begin.", "David Larsen", "Hi, congratulations on a good quarter. I just want to talk a little bit more about the USA retail gross margin. It looks like the first year-over-year expansion in a couple of quarters so, congrats there. I mean with your Part D rates and those Part D contracts do they all now have price protection built into them, so we have generic inflation comes back you have protection on the reimbursement side?", "George Fairweather", "Again David, I can\u2019t be specific, but what we can say is, we\u2019ve been working hard to put that in so, the majority do have some price protection yes.", "David Larsen", "Okay, and then in terms of the gross margin expansion that we did see, I mean was it due to generic deflation like George was asking earlier for the most part?", "George Fairweather", "It was a combination and that was part of it. I think also as we said before, we still got another month of the real impact of Med D to come. We\u2019re not fully protected on deflation. We are mainly protected not fully protected and finally we are making good progress on the front end, you saw that front end margin improved in the quarter as well despite a slight change in mix.", "David Larsen", "Okay and then just last one, it looks like for the wholesale piece of the business, there was a sequential decline in operating income and revenue was slightly below our model, what drove that and can you remind me what impact FX had on the quarter? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "[Indiscernible] that you have to take into account the fact that most of it is - almost all of it is in UK, in Europe, in other countries whether the currencies has played big role in and the mix of the different currencies.", "So it\u2019s difficult really to judge what is happening and after you have also to appreciate that in the last year, we have divested some more businesses which are irrelevant of course, but of course represented some fees because we have tried to streamline and we are still trying to streamline our business more generally, not just our selling business eliminating all those businesses which are not profitable or which are requiring a big attention, a big absorption of energies.", "Now we have a big program, we have big opportunities to create value and each time to and we have started this last year to let\u2019s say start to sell all those small businesses which are not adding much, but can reduce the overall efficiency of the company of the group. I could say that independently on the number, if you look at as we do of course they countries specifically overall most of the countries are doing quite well, even well.", "Surprisingly a country like Turkey and Egypt are doing very well. Romania and other countries are suffering, particularly France I would say and particularly Russia and also Germany is not particularly brilliant. So it\u2019s a mix and a combination of these portfolios with the combination of the different currency because we don\u2019t have just the Pound Sterling and the Euro, but we have the Turkish Lira, we have the ruble, we have many other currencies, the combination of these two things that can give strange effect. But overall, you see that the results are not bad, the margin is still there and which is important of course in interfering business.", "David Larsen", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. You may begin.", "John Heinbockel", "I certainly have a strategic question and one is more tactical, when you look at the partnership with Optum and maybe other PBM partnerships, how does that, how do you think that fits in with your potential ownership of Envision, is Envision too small to matter or do you think, are you committed assuming Rite Aid goes through committed to owning Envision or maybe you divest that, how would that work with the partnerships?", "Stefano Pessina", "First of all we will decide to do with them Envision one, so we will have completed the deal. With Rite Aid we cannot anticipate what we will do on something that is not here today. Secondly, even if we decide to develop it, I don\u2019t see any difficulty because of course, we would not be a major competitor on the market and so we could find a niche, where we could collaborate and we could have a big collaboration as pharmacy, pharmacy chain and maybe some niche or more limited collaboration on the PBM business.", "So it\u2019s not, we cannot be considered a true competitor, a competitor at the point that we cannot collaborate in the most important element of the business, which is to allow the PBM to give to us a very good service to the customers.", "John Heinbockel", "And then more tactically, I mean a lot of the improvement in gross this quarter in the U.S. look to be front end, you know maybe for Alex, if you think about and I know you\u2019re probably more focused on driving top line than margin per se, but if you think about where the Walgreens frontend margin is today, maybe benchmarking that against Boots or others, do you think there is a significant amount of frontend margin opportunity left from mix and maybe promotional cadence or not so much from where we are right now?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, yes, I still think there is a lot to go, it will just take us a number of years to get there. So the focus has been on operating margins. So we\u2019re really focusing on removing unprofitable activity, unprofitable items and try to simplify the offer and focusing on the key destination countries for us which really is primarily help beauty and convenience and we feel good the way we are, but those are, long opportunity ahead of us and our opportunity is to get customers to reevaluate the offer inside of Walgreens and to see it is more unique and more differentiated.", "And we started that journey really with a few differentiation projects, we spoke about earlier in the call, earlier on this [indiscernible].", "So I think the opportunity is still a lot to come, particularly on the expansion of differentiation and higher margin products. It will just take us longer to get that done as customers one by one reevaluate what they\u2019re seeing inside of Walgreens.", "I think finally I will say is that we've had a one size fits all approach to Walgreens frontend for quite some time and as we have all been thinking on omni channel in four months, again we believe there will be more opportunity there in two years, but the first thing I think people should reevaluate their current Walgreens which is almost right now and then we will figure out how do we use this space differently in over the medium to long-term.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. You may begin.", "Eric Bosshard", "Good morning. From a pharmacy margin environment you talked a couple of quarters ago about some of the challenges and ongoing challenges, I'm just curious as you reposition the company to some degree with some of these relationships if you feel on more stable footing about the future of pharmacy margins in the U.S. or give a different view of how that is going to play out?", "Alex Gourlay", "No, I think that, again this is Alex here, I think we've said this already, but it is an important point. We see the volume mix are very important for both our partners and peers, customers and also for ourselves. So we will work within the market, which means that we believe will be ongoing reimbursement pressure and then we work hard within that to drive our volumes through offering better volume, better care to customers. That really is our strategy. I know it sounds very simplistic, what we are trying to do.", "If we do these things we think we can stabilize the operating margin over time and we can grow the business. That is what we are doing right now and we believe that is the future going forward. So that's how we see it. But we accept and as I said is I think Stefano said this obviously Eastern Europe, reimbursement pressure is a constant factor and we believe this it will be a constant factor here in America going forward and our strategy is as I described it.", "Eric Bosshard", "Within that it sounds like the strategy is therefore more volume in order to leverage the expenses and that ought to stable or beneficial operating margin, Rite Aid is a piece of that, Optum is a piece of that is, am I correct in the perception that that is the strategy is more volume and therefore are there more alliances that you will evaluate or pursue to drive more volume through the business?", "Stefano Pessina", "It is part of the strategy. You see when you have to accept that the margin or the gross margin ineluctably decline will decline over time, you have to find ways to compensate the void. So additional services like Valeant can help better, a better organization of the work not just synergies but a different structure of the work, a rethinking of the organization of the flow of the medicine, of the flow of the work, the use of the pharmacies can help.", "Are there an increase, better relationship with your suppliers can help of course because it contributes to the margin a better relationship with the clients, with the PBM with all the people who are at the end of the day the source for the script. And clear the way of collaborating with them can help because it can increase the number of scripts and of course the volume is very, very important, because if you can compensate at least partially the volume, by the volume the actually margin of course these can help substantially.", "So there are many, many different actions that you can take and we are taking. And these actions can stabilize the results, the final results as Alex was saying for years and years to come and in 10 years time or whatever we will have probably another organization of the business and we will see what will happen at that time. And for the next year we see enough ways to compensate the margin reduction. We accept that the margin reduction will be there and we are trying to find and we are finding different ways to compensate for it.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may begin.", "Charles Rhyee", "Yes, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just actually, just one of the random question I guess may be, I think there is a vote coming up in the UK regarding I think the European Union, I guess they refer to it as the Brexit, if that referendum were to actually happen, how would that affect the Boots business here and I guess Walgreens in general? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "To be honest, I don\u2019t believe that it will be impacted directly because there in the retail business is a let's say a local business and the brand business, well even now, we don't manufacture drugs in UK so there and we will find a way to continue to manufacture at the lowest possible cost, so the brand will not be impacted.", "The retail business is local so it will not be impacted. It could be impacted by a change of the whole economy if we had recession or if we had difficult consequences from the Brexit this could impact more generally our business as all the other businesses. And the same is too for Europe because our business is in Europe, again our local businesses, our retail and wholesale businesses, our local businesses depend more on the consumption of the medicines of the products that are on the political and economical situation.", "So they could be just impacted by a general trend, but not specifically. We have totaled it and we don\u2019t - we have decided that we don\u2019t need an emergency plan for it. When there are big changes we try to think at least potentially of an emergency plan, but in this case we don\u2019t see the need for it.", "Charles Rhyee", "Great, thank you.", "Stefano Pessina", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you and now I would like to turn the call back over to Gerald Gradwell for closing remarks.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "Now, I will hand the conference over to Gerald Gradwell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Special Projects. Sir, you have the floor.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call. Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer will take you through our results today.

And we refer you to the Appendix of the presentation material available on our Investor Relations Web site for reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Stefano.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, Gerald.", "As you can see from our results, I am pleased to announce that we have delivered another solid performance. With adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 better than original expectations. We have also made further progress in positioning our company for the future. We are continuing to build strong business partnerships across our markets. In the U.S., we have made particularly good progress in developing a closer relationship with payers and PBM.", "In March, we exercised our first financial warrants in AmerisourceBergen purchasing common stock. We subsequently extended our pharmaceutical distribution and sourcing arrangements by [indiscernible]. ABC has agreed to make certain working capital investments in their relationship, and we proceed with additional capital investment in its distribution network.", "Our proposed acquisition of Rite Aid is progressing as planned. As you know, we are in the process of seeking a regulatory approval in parallel our integration team is continuing its work on preliminary planning. In June, we completed a $6 billion public bond offering to support the funding of the acquisition. Also in June, I am pleased to report that we achieved our $1 billion synergy goal for fiscal 2016 from Walgreens and Alliance Boots merger.", "June was quite a busy month for us. We've also changed our senior management responsibility to structure the company in a way that is more efficient following the successful integration of Walgreens Boots Alliance as we move to operating a unified company. To support me in my role we have created Co-Chief Operating Officer, Alex Gourlay and Ornella Barra, who will oversee the day-to-day activities of the company with the support of George Fairweather as Global Chief Financial Officer and Marco Pagni as Global Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel and of course with the continued support of our other senior leaders.", "Over the past 10 years, Alex and Ornella have established an extremely effective working partnership and that created significant value for our company today. They will be instrumental in driving the operations of our company in the next phase of its evolution. This will allow me to focus even more on driving the growth strategy and developing our company. You can be assured; however, that these change will not in anyway reduce my scrutiny and expectations of our businesses and the team.", "Since the quarter end as you are seeing the U.K. referendum on Europe has created some uncertainty and volatility in our market. Our businesses and management teams have operated through main business cycles in many markets. Perhaps changes normal and the sign of life. We work with and manage it every day. Less volatility and uncertainty create issues that would be overcome, but they also provide opportunity for our company. It is our job to ensure that we meet these opportunities positively and position and structure our company to its best advantage.", "As events unfold and the uncertainty in the wider markets leave us all, I'm confident that we will emerge well-positioned as we enter more optimistic times. The progress that we have made to-date gives us a stronger platform from which to drive further efficiency. Meet the challenges of current volatility manual market and the potential wide economic impact these may have in many of the region we work in and puts us in an even better position for the company to deliver long-term success.", "Now, let me hand over to George.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Stefano.", "I would like to start by pointing out that for the first time since the acquisition of Alliance Boots, we have fully comparable quarterly results.", "Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.5 billion, up 2.4% versus the same quarter last year. These were impacted by currency translation, net sales on a constant currency basis being up 3.3%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, up 9.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion and diluted EPS was $1.01. The decrease in both GAAP net earnings and net earnings per share was due to fluctuations in the fair value of our ABC warrants.", "Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 3.7%. On a constant currency basis, this represents an increase of 4.7%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 14.7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.18, up 15.7%. Adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC was 24.4%. The rate benefiting from revisions to the full-year tax rate forecast, including certain discrete items. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be broadly in line with the year-to-date rate of 27.2%.", "For completeness, here are the numbers for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. These results are of course not directly comparable with the first nine months of the previous year. I will not go through them in detail, but you will see that GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.88 was down 28.7%. This reflects a number of accounting factors, including the fluctuations in the warrants and last year's non-cash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 17.3% to $3.52.", "Turning now to our segmental performance, starting as usual with the retail pharmacy USA. Total sales for the quarter and retail pharmacy USA were $21.2 billion, an increase of 3.7% over the same quarter last year. Sales growth was driven by an increase in pharmacy, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion business back in April 2015 comparable store sales increased by 3.9%. As we expected, adjusted gross margin declined by 0.5 percentage points to 26.9% while the pharmacy margin being partially offset by retail products.", "Adjusted gross profit was up 1.8% to $5.7 billion and adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 1.1%. As you may recall in the same quarter last year, SG&A was lower than normal. This was because we had a temporary pause in certain investments while we evaluated the returns being generated.", "We're pleased with our performance and we are well on track towards achieving our overall target savings from our costs transformation program. This program the vast majority of which is in the U.S., will deliver $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 6.5%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion up 4.1%.", "Turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Total U.S. pharmacy sales in the quarter were up 5.8%. We filled 235 million prescriptions on a 30-day basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.9%. This reflects our strategy of increasing script volume in our stores. On a comparable basis, pharmacy sales increased by 6%, scripts filled being up by 4.5% primarily due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume.", "Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.6%. Over the year ago quarter, this was up approximately 30 basis points. As we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in mix partially offset by procurement efficiencies.", "Retail product sales on a comparable basis increased by 0.1%. This was primarily due to higher sales in the health and wellness and photo categories, partially offset by declines in certain convenience categories. As we've said previously, we are focused on expanding front of store gross margins and are pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. To further drive performance, we are starting to expand our differentiated beauty offering across over 1800 stores. And expect to complete this phase by the end of calendar 2016.", "Turning next to our retail pharmacy international division, total sales in the quarter for the retail pharmacy international division was $3.2 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis. Comparable store sales increased by 0.2%, clearly comparable figures are in constant currency.", "Adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, up 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $258 million, an increase of 8% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales decreased by 0.7% due to Boots in the U.K. and the loss of certain institutional sales contracts in Chile. Boots U.K. comparable pharmacy sales were down 1% due to the negative impact of a reduction in government pharmacy funding that was expected.", "As you may know, the U.K. government has been consulting with the industry on pharmacy funding. The consultation period closed at the end of May and we're waiting to hear their conclusions. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.7% with strong performances in the Republic of Ireland and Thailand. Boots U.K.'s comparable retail sales increased by 0.6%. We were particularly pleased with the performance of our Sleek cosmetics brand acquired in November last year and No7 in April we successfully launched our new Lift & Luminate triple action serum.", "Turning now to our pharmaceutical wholesale division. Total sales in the pharmaceutical wholesale division were $5.7 billion. In April, we sold Alliance Healthcare Russia to 36.6 in return for a 15% stake in the combined group. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions and dispositions increased by 6.3%. This was ahead of our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales.", "In a number of our emerging markets, sales growth was particularly strong. Adjusted operating margin was 3% level with the same quarter last year. Within the pharmaceutical wholesale division, we report a 16% share of ABC's net earnings. This is reported on a two-month lag the quarter included only two weeks of equity method income.", "Overall, the divisions adjusted operating income increased 4.7% to $179 million. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 7.6% of which 4.7% was for ABC. Next quarter we will recognize a full three-month share of ABC's net earnings based on their quarter to the end of June.", "Combined net synergies in the quarter from the strategic combination with Alliance Boots were $330 million. This takes a cumulative total up to the quarter end to $947 million. As Stefano said, since the quarter end, we've achieved our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined net synergies.", "Going forward, we will therefore not be breaking them out separately as we have said before.", "In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.1 billion. This was due to our solid profit performance and favorable working capital cash flows. Cash capital expenditure was $247 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion.", "Looking to the full fiscal year results, we have raised the lower end of our guidance by $0.10. Guidance is therefore $4.45 to $4.55. This assumes no impact from the proposed acquisition of Rite Aid and related financing and already assumes currency exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year.", "Looking forward to fiscal 2017, our current plan is to issue guidance in October when we announce our full year results.", "I will now hand back to Gerald. Thank you.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Operator, could we now throw the call open for Q&A?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "My pleasure. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Steven Valiquette", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on these results. I guess a couple of things I wanted to touch on was, I guess first just on the renegotiation of the distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen that was announced a few months ago, seeing that was maybe driven by some shifting of cash flow but just curious if you have any additional color on that and also what would be the timing of that renegotiation? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "You can understand. Stefano here. That we cannot comment on a contract. We have been quite clear that there has been some agreement on extending our payment terms and also an agreement on the size of their investments to follow us in our future expansion. So we cannot go further ahead, but of course, if we have extended our agreement by three years and we have committed to take them with our main source for the future, we have done this because we had the right risk for doing it.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay. Got you. One other quick one just the legacy Walgreens management used to talk about driving gross profit growth and maybe 100 basis points or maybe one percentage point higher than SG&A costs growth. You are seeming to achieve that this quarter in retail pharmacy USA because you have 2% gross profit growth, 1% growth in SG&A dollars. Just curious, should we still think about that relationship in terms of managing the U.S. operations or have the targets change a little bit with obviously some of the management changes as well? Thanks.", "George Fairweather", "We haven't, since the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance published any targets relating to this. Our focus is obviously on growing our overall profits we're focused on improving our retail gross margin, which I talked about in my presentation. And then on the pharmacy side, we've talked about very clearly that our focus is on growing our profitability on pharmacy in a way linked to building our volume we're clearly pleased with the share gains that we have announced today, which is really continuing the trend we've seen for some time.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay. Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Lisa Gill", "Great. Thank you very much and good morning. I was wondering if maybe could just give us a little more color around your new relationship with Optum. It appears that have been winning some nice pieces of the business in the marketplace. Do each of those new pieces of business, are they tied to the new relationships that you have. So, any incremental color you can give us around expectations of the types of volumes you could see with the Optum relationship?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, Lisa. Its Alex here. I mean we have had a great relationship with Optum on the cash for many years, so this is very strong historically and as improved in the last period as you have seen. They are doing a nice job I think in the market with their offer. And we are helping particularly with the slight maintain program which gives the customer the choice to go to mail order or augment to their retail. And we believe from the evidence we have seen before the retails are very good option for customers and so does Optum.", "So with that relationship and with the contract we have in place, to support it, we are working with them on a commercial basis, and we are doing a nice job in winning contracts, which obviously we're very pleased about.", "Going forward, we hope to see them continue to be successful, and we hope to be their partner commercially for the region for long-term as we have been in the past. So when they win, I believe that we win as we have done in the past we will do in the future.", "Lisa Gill", "Alex, is there any way to put any kind of numbers or expectations around that as we think about pieces of business that we have known publicly that they have won? Any thoughts at this point or do you think it's too early?", "Alex Gourlay", "It is really too early. I mean most of these contracts as you know -- all these contract start in 1 January. The focus that we have are part of the deal is to make sure we give a great customer experience. So they are health plan members as they come into Walgreens so that we can actually make sure that we pill through the customers and they stick with us. And I think that is Richard and the team have done a great job in the last period as you've seen by our volume increase and by our gradual increase in market share. So we're confident that when we win contracts, we can win more than our fair share, but our job is to make sure we do that by providing great service and care in the pharmacy.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. And then just a follow up, George, I know you said that included in the guidance is the expectation around currency, but can you just remind us what the EPS sensitivity is to FX? I know you talked about this in the past but I just want to make sure we have this correctly.", "George Fairweather", "Just of course, Stefano, I think you --", "Stefano Pessina", "I was saying that of course when we do the contract, we were generating multiyear contracts, we analyzed and we made our calculation of the life of the contract. When you see a new contract you don't expect to see the benefits immediately. The benefits will come and it will be of course bigger if we perform well and you will see a growth during the entire life of the contract. So the benefit of all the contract that we will do will be we grow over the next year. Sorry about that.", "George Fairweather", "This is George. I think as we said before in terms of currency translation, a 1% movement in the volume of pound versus the U.S. dollar is approximately $0.01 impact on adjusted EPS.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Robert Jones", "Great. Thanks for the questions. Just trying to get a better gauge of the fundamental performance of the retail USA business. You guys have given us details on synergy every quarter. Could you maybe give us a sense of how you are tracking on the SG&A savings relative to the $1.5 billion target by the end of fiscal 2017? And how we should think about how that's contributing to the EBIT growth in the quarter would be really helpful.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, Robert. It is Alex here. So, I think as George said in the script, we are on plan. The majority of the $1.5 million as George said comes from the USA pharmacy business. We had a comprehensive program and our program is on track and delivering to plan. We see more opportunities going forward and the team here in the USA and also across the rest of the group will continue to drive a more efficient business we can and build more cost plans. And we will give an update at the end of the year in terms of how that plan is going and it's a major part of our strategy to use that scale, user efficiency both in the U.S. and globally to make sure that we are cost-effective pharmacy retailer particularly here in the USA.", "Robert Jones", "Okay, got it. Then I guess just one question on Part D. You mentioned prescriptions on a same-store basis being strength. From Part D in particular I know getting bigger in Part D has been specific goal of the company. Can you maybe share a little bit more of how you have progressed in winning Part D and maybe where you think you are today from a market share perspective as it relates to Part D?", "Alex Gourlay", "I guess -- Alex again. I think it's about partnership philosophy. We worked really well across all of these plans. We've always had a strong relationship with United and that continues. And as we've continue to offer our strong ethos into our store network, the right value, the 90-day retail option in terms of Part D, we've been able to win more contracts and we've been able to get into some of the more narrow networks which are forming actually in the marketplace.", "So I would put that into partnership and delivering really well in stores. It's a very important segment for us. The market is growing faster than rest of the market, we will continue to go up because of the aging population and our 90-day retailers really, really popular with our population. So partnership and focus is the reasons why we are winning and we will continue to do both as best we can.", "Robert Jones", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill with Deutsche bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "George Hill", "Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. George, I guess two parts, number one, is there anyway that you could quantify for us the impact of the med-D, the increasing med-D mix on U.S. drug margins in Q4? And kind of correlated to that question is, I guess we thought that we would've seen more modest gross margin deterioration given the deterioration in generic drug pricing against math part of the book? I guess just us any kind of qualitative or quantitative color you can put around the gross margin deterioration in the quarter would be helpful with the big moving pieces? Thanks.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, it's Alex here. We see this on plan. So there has been constant reimbursement pressure in the market, we've spoken about this constantly. And we see that pressure going forward we been very open about this -- as the market consolidates and the mix. Remember, we focus on operating margin and that really is the number we pay attention to here. So using our very large fixed assets go into more 90-day we're dispensing once around three times is a very important part of that and also the growth of specialty which is lower margin in terms of percent but higher dollars is another feature of the marketplace. So overall, we are comfortable with where we are and we're comfortable with the strategy we're driving to focus on operating profit rather than just gross margin.", "George Hill", "Okay. Then maybe a quick follow-up, maybe Alex, if you just want to rank them, is it and separating pressure and mix, is the change in mix kind of leading to more down drift followed by pressure followed by 90, followed by specialty is that the right way to think about the order of the moving pieces as it relates to the margin profile?", "Alex Gourlay", "No. I just think that the market is growing through the aging population. So that's why med-D is the fastest growing channel as is all of that people are putting together more comparative offers both in terms of price, but also in terms of care and performance. And that comes as well. So I think that's the driving, is really the market has been driven always by the customer and it's a growth market. So therefore, if you are able to provide the right value through a good cost structure which I think we have through the scale, we have here in the USA and the buying power we have globally. And then, you are able to have the right relationship and partnerships, you can take advantage of the fastest growing channel which is med D in a net profitable way and that is what we're doing.", "So I don't think one or the other to be honest George, I think it's about our market change and we are just positioning ourselves and was a very important market segment for our model and one we are very well positioned to continue to win.", "George Hill", "Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Mark Rosenblum", "Hi. This is Mark Rosenblum on for Ricky. Can you just talk about the partnership with Valiant and now that you guys are about six months in kind of takeaways and lessons you've learned and just commentary on how you think the relationship is going to-date?", "Alex Gourlay", "It is Alex, again, here. Yes, we are satisfied and pleased with performance in the dermatology business the volume is as we expected. And remember, we have paid for the service we provide. We're not paid on the margin mix here at all. So we're satisfied the relationship is good. We know Joe well from the past from Pagel where the group had a very good relationship with Joe and Pagel. And we are in constant dialogue with Joe and the management team. Which you see their situation and we are very willing to help them in a positive way. So it's early days a 20-year contract and from our point of view we are pleased. We want to help our partner to be more successful in market.", "Mark Rosenblum", "Got you. And then just on following up on the RAD acquisition, I know you guys are still expecting a second half close, but if the deal were not to get done, how would you rank your capital deployment priorities now that you have the additional cash on the balance sheet?", "Stefano Pessina", "Oh, we would have a lot of ideas, but I can assure you that we are for the time being we are not taking into consideration because we are very confident that at the end of this deal we will go through. It takes some time, but we knew it. It is normal of this kind of deals which is a complex deal at the end of the day is normal for this kind of deals to take months and months. So I would say that we are on track.", "Our lawyers are telling us that we don't have any negative signals, and so we are operating on the -- I thought that we will do the deal, you see that we have raised the capital, you see that we have a big team in place starting the integration and they are working hard to prepare the integration. We are trying to find the right buyers for the pharmacy sector for sure we will have to divest and that is it.", "Mark Rosenblum", "Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Eric Kutcher with Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thank you. Maybe focusing on international going back to your comment about discussions with the U.K. authority. Is there a focus on recent cost reduction on any changes that might reduce that? Is it more of a service focused? Could you detail that?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, Eric. It is Alex here. And obviously, from the past, I know the U.K. pretty well and I've caught up with the team in the last two days. So this is a deeper conversation about what you call a global some in the U.K., which is the amount of money they pay our pharmacy a combination of drop cost and services. And the government is keen to get more value from pharmacy and that's a negotiation that has commonly been carried out. It's not just for boots but it's for the whole market. Boots has around about 1/5 of the market in the U.K. pharmacy. It is not typical, we have lived with these sort of pressure and these requests for very many, many years both in the U.K. and Europe and we are used to dealing with it. But there is a particular phase we are going through but that request is slightly deeper, and obviously, the industry is working together to try and give the government the best answer we can.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thanks for that detail. And then, maybe also on international, the piece in Russia, was that previously consolidated and now has been moved to discontinued? Would we see that in the year ago result?", "Stefano Pessina", "Correct. It was consolidated. Now, it's not consolidated anymore because we have 15% of the new company. To be honest, Russia was quite volatile accounting the weather, the results were depending very much on the weather. And those over time, they are all selling business which was really the best part of the supply chain of the chain in Russia earning wise is deteriorated because the pharmacies have become more important -- in the past the pharmacy were not particularly profitable because they -- the cost of the rents was really very, very high. Now the situation is normalized. You can have long-term or medium-term rents with way of extending the rents. And so the pharmacies are becoming the most important and the profitable part of the chain.", "And so, we had the opportunity to contribute our wholesale to the largest pharmacy chain because we have 1000 pharmacies in 36.6 but 1000 pharmacies also in another chain a five and two chains have merged. And so we have had 15% in the company where we had the reality 2000 pharmacies and the opportunity to buy out the company idea, so we will see what happens in five years and we will take the decision. It is a big opportunity for us because this is the best segment of the distribution in Russia today.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thank you. Maybe just the financial impact from that George, so that sounds a little larger than I was thinking, but is there much of a profit impact from that given your ownership stake?", "George Fairweather", "I mean it's an part working out income is it's very, very small in relation to the size of WBA where we will see an impact is obviously in the sales being a low margin wholesale, the wholesale business, the sales were just under $700 million historically just to give you a size, but that's why we are showing comparable sales on a constant currency basis excluding M&A so that you can really understand the clear performance of wholesale. But really in actual profit contribution terms, this is pretty immaterial.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thank you.", "Stefano Pessina", "You have to devaluation of the ruble, you will remember that the ruble has lost quite a lot versus the dollar. And so, the impact has been really low.", "Eric Kutcher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "John Heinbockel", "So, two things for Alex. Let me start with store level labor. If you can sort of touch on crosscurrents, impact of minimum wage going up and then change in overtime rules. And then, the flipside offsetting that, where do you think there's still opportunity to trim labor hours to get more efficient? Is it a backroom issue how you use the pharmacy tax thoughts on those would be helpful.", "Alex Gourlay", "I think there's always more opportunity. As you remember, we are investing quite a lot in our core IT systems right now both in retail and a program that is about six months in and also the pharmacy where we are redoing our pharmacy system over the next five years. These too are not far from working capital benefits, we will clearly make the whole supply chain more efficient and allow us to remove a lot of non-customer facing activity out of the drugstores and save money and also put more hours into customer care, which is part of our strategy to become more differentiated in health, wellness and beauty care and pharmacy.", "So I think there is a significant investment going in, the Board find itself only a couple of months ago really and we are very confident the programs are well set up and we've got the global expertise both here in America and Europe apply to these two very important programs here in the U.S. We will update you on what that means in the future as it becomes clearer about the benefits that we see coming through.", "We have already -- going back to the first question starting with minimum wage, we've already in the back room we have already for most lower pay people in stores improved the base salary. We've done that already that's already in the cost you see and we will continue to improve minimum wage against the market, putting very cost regions in the market. Second to that, we are also upscaling our people. For example, we're through with a lot of differentiation. We are putting in place a number of beauty consultants in our top 2000 stores who have got deeper expertise and more knowledge and more ability to take care and drive up sales appropriately with customers. That's another investment we're making in labor cost in our stores but with a very clear return on our investment. So, we are feeling good about where we are on these two investments.", "With the overtime, we studied this very carefully, we have a solution very clearly mapped out and we'll announce that solution at the appropriate time and it's one that will be both good for people and cost effective to our shareholders.", "John Heinbockel", "And then secondly, you talked about within the guys at the front-end and the convenience categories, so maybe talk a little bit how you are rethinking that whole part of the business and when you broaden it out to consumables, can that business effectively drive traffic? I mean, you think about, I'm not sure how productive some of those soft drink promotions were, but can that drive traffic or do you want to go back and drive traffic on beauty, the experience and really not use consumables to do that?", "Alex Gourlay", "Consumables is really important to driving traffic. Particularly, the fill-in shop effectively which is becoming really important to customers across America and we believe that Walgreens in particular can play a much broader role in that. We've only had dates with cards -- bonus or reward cards for just about three years. And now, we are seeing very clearly the opportunities for the fill-in machine. And we are now constructing our offer across, I mean these cash including toiletries that we believe will offer the right brands at the right price not the lowest price, but the right price, I mean on that walk.", "And it will be different by types of stores for sure and that is quite a complicated piece to get done, but we are well on the journey and you will see that coming through in the months and years ahead. It's very important to our plan. Obviously, we're trying to create destination -- more destination beauty and that plan has already been executed in one third of the stores as we speak. And there will be more to come once we get these stores complete and healthcare has always been a very important casket to us and we continue to drive that casket pretty well.", "So that's how we see driving football back into a drugstore. Apparently, it's really football, it's the omni-channel, is really important to see that in the U.K., the U.K. team has done a really nice job in the U.K. market here to join our pad, the supply chain and make our effective customers, clearly we can share and borrow some of best practice from Europe and we intend to do that.", "John Heinbockel", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Mike Otway", "Good morning, everyone. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the questions. First question, the $0.10 raise in the low-end of the guidance, could you kind of parse it out into tax rate versus stronger profitability? How much is due to both?", "George Fairweather", "I think there is a bunch of factors coming into this. Obviously, the tax rate has come in a little bit lower as I talked about in my presentation. I think the most important point I would make is obviously we are continuing as we have -- if you look at the guidance we set out at the beginning of the year our ability to continue to raise the lower end really at the time when we've been able to cope with currency moving in the wrong direction for us in translation really I think illustrates the strength of the -- overall strength of the business. Really not a huge amount more I can add to that at this stage.", "Mike Otway", "Okay. Thanks George. And then, I guess following on John's question earlier, given the focus is on expanding gross margin in the U.S., how should we think about the front-end comp trajectory over the next couple of quarters? Should we expect more of the same until, is there an expectation that the beauty rollout is going to change the trajectory of comps, just any thoughts there?", "George Fairweather", "Yes. I think obviously we're in this transition period for sure as I spoke about before. We are seeing nice improvements in the operating margin and in the gross margin within that. And the expense of some sales lost and [indiscernible] some seasonal cash because we've actually fundamentally overbought. The next phase is to really start to drive sales particularly in beauty that would be progressive over a period of time. And actually this summer into the autumn season you start to see the comps gradually improve quarter-by-quarter. But the key thing really that we keep on repeating is the comps are important but always going to be relatively low in reality in that mature market where we are really shifting the mix the important thing is the operating margin and that's the thing that we've been consistently focused on over the past couple of years and we are pleased with the progress we're making there and we are seeing more progress in the future.", "Mike Otway", "Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great. Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on Rite Aid, sounds like it's still on track just wondering when you expect to hear more color from the SEC, if you could give us anymore color on the discussions and related to other changes in the number of stores divestiture you expect.", "Stefano Pessina", "We still believe that our initial estimate is correct. We still believe that at the end we will stay in the range of these stores that we initially indicated around 500. And time wise, we still believe that we will be able to really do the deal -- finish the deal by the end of this financial -- calendar year as we said. So by December, we believe that everything will be done. But of course, it doesn't depend on us, FTC will let us know when they are ready.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Got it. Thank you. And kind of a tough question, I realize it's very early, but as it relates to Brexit, have you seen or would you expect to see an impact in underlying demand, or margins in the U.K. business since the announcement excluding currency impacts of course?", "Stefano Pessina", "Very, very difficult to say. The situation is very volatile at this time. For sure, the period of uncertainty will be quite long whatever happens because even if the U.K. will leave the Euro, it cannot happen overnight, it will take at least two years. And the consequence of it will be much longer than two years.", "So, I believe that once the emotional impact is gone, things will settle down and we will have an idea of what is happening, but for now really -- it's really too early, too soon we have seen in the stores days -- very good days, bad. So in a few months probably we will be able to say something.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, Alvin. It's Alex here. Again, just a couple of things tied to what Stefano said. I think historically Boots has been very solid through difficult times. But it tends to over perform the market during recessions or slowdowns because it's got a strong beauty business and people still buy into beauty even in tough times and that's been historically the case. So we feel that that's important. And this is still broadly positioned both in beauty and in healthcare in the U.K., the team have done a nice job there to keep it strong and the model still very strong. So, I think if any retail business is positioned to do okay during these uncertain times, as Stefano talked about I think it is the Boots brand in the U.K.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Got it. Thank you for that color. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "David Larsen", "Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk about a high level who buyers of these RAD stores could potentially be, especially for stores that are in world markets? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "We cannot give indication on that.", "David Larsen", "Okay.", "Stefano Pessina", "We cannot go even because at the end of the day, we don't know exactly, how many stores and where. We have an idea but we don't know exactly. So, for time being it's really too early.", "David Larsen", "Okay. And then, let's say the FTC wanted to continue to review the transaction until say March of 2017, I mean, are you willing to allow the process to continue into 2017?", "Stefano Pessina", "For the time being, we don't have the feeling, our lawyers don't have this feeling. If this will happen, we will see and we will try to understand why the process become so long because if there are just technical reasons of course we will wait. If it is a symptom of something which is going not in the right decision that we will take a decision at the time. But I repeat for the time being, we are -- our lawyers are very quite optimistic, I would say optimistic.", "David Larsen", "Okay. And then, my last question is, do you have any thoughts on, would you keep the volumes with McKesson or switch them over to AmerisourceBergen, any high level thoughts on that? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "When we will conclude the deal with Rite Aid then we will see what to do. Of course, we are to take into consideration that we have a good confident and fantastic relationship with Rite Aid. So we will analyze what to do at the right time.", "David Larsen", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Caldwell with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Eric Caldwell", "Thanks very much. First, I just have a hopefully an objective and friendly comment here to help, Walgreens both prior to and after this current team's leadership has only beaten revenue three times in the last five years. Even with the Street lowering forward targets after each quarter, I guess what I am saying is, I just really think you need to maybe circle the wagons and provide better insight into things such as pricing, generic launches, conversion rates mix, anything that can help folks get to a better method on the top line, I think would be a huge help. So that's my comment. I would love you to take it under consideration.", "The question is around tax items, I am curious I did not see this, what were the discrete items in the quarter? How much did they impact the third quarter ended any of the lower expected tax rate for the year , did any of that come from items that might be deemed as more sustainable as opposed to discrete? Thanks very much.", "George Fairweather", "Fundamentally, there was a small amount of discrete items. Typically, obviously, one is prudent and doing provisioning, and then, when one is able to agree numbers with various tax authorities, then one has to discrete items. But fundamentally, we've been doing a lot of work looking at our underlying tax rate. And exactly, what the quite complex structure that we got in place, what is the real underlying rate we've been quite conservative in the first part of the year on this. While, we are doing this work and really the numbers that we have seen in the quarter if you look at the year-to-date as we said in my presentation that really gives us a true reflection of what the rate would be with this mix of profits at the currency rates that we've seen in this year-to-date.", "So I think it's -- I think you should really look at it as the clear rate. Clearly, if we then -- our going forward, the mix changes and clearly it will change with Rite Aid coming in being U.S.-based and the U.S. being obviously one of the highest tax countries in the mix of where we trade and you will see the tax rate going up and reflecting mix but only mix.", "Stefano Pessina", "Substantially, this quarter we have taken some provisions that we have made before in the previous quarter for the bulk of it. Being prudent and now we have released it. So overall for the year, this is the real -- substantially the real tax rate and the real dollars that we have paid in tax that we will pay in tax.", "Eric Caldwell", "Okay. Thanks very much for the comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.", "Charles Rhyee", "Thanks. Maybe going back to the rollout of the Boots products in the U.S. I know you're expanding it now into more stores, can you talk about sort of what the up tick has been in the existing stores as a percent of the front end sales? I know you are historically targeting sort of 5% mix shift over time, but just curious where we are at this point.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, Charles. Its Alex. We have had these products in different tests and trials in New York and more importantly in Phoenix, which is a more normal market for us in terms of stores for 18 months. And we're really seeing two effects, we are seeing bigger baskets across the beauty spend from customers, I'm seeing more repeat customers coming back with particularly No7 skincare in the basket. And these numbers we extrapolated with costs.", "We also looked at different models of investment from people point of view and investment fixturing. And we created what we thought was a most customer perspective and importantly the best model for return to our shareholders. And as we are implementing right now the summer and roundabout 1600 more stores. And we are very confident because we have seen these customer behaviors more in the basket and coming back more often, specifically for No7 skincare, consistently for 18 months.", "So that's what we have seen and that's how we have measured it. And clearly, we have long-term goals to shift the mix to more owned and home brands in the U.S. business and this is a start of our journey particularly in the important beauty categories.", "Charles Rhyee", "Can you talk about, if I recall correctly No7 and some of the other Boots products are sold in other chains today, can you talk about what that mix looks like in those shores in those other chains and how relevant they are to what you expect for Walgreens over time and other ways to also leverage that brand recognition majority have and maybe shift those buyers back to the Walgreens stores? Thanks.", "Alex Gourlay", "The intention is to grow the brand. So we have good distribution and target and have had for many years and have good relationship and we have distribution growing and also we are doing a nice job with other brands in many other people's brands to be fair to them, that we are doing a good job. So from our point of view, they are different channels to Walgreens. Walgreens is a drugstore channel and the customers -- some customers do swap across both, of course, they do, but we have so much opportunity with Walgreens was 6 million customers about 20% of them are what we call look good, feel good customers who are prepared to buy more beauty products from Walgreens. And that's what we're focused on in the Walgreens channel. The rest of the team led by Kane, who heads up our brands division for WBA are focused on building the brands and across America and building good relationships with the partners outside of Walgreens is a very clear strategy and one where we want to be successful in both and that's what we intend to do.", "Charles Rhyee", "Great. Thank you.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. That was the last question. We have time for. Thank you to everyone for participating in the call. If you do have other questions, we did try and slightly restructure the presentation and call today to allow for more time for questions than we normally would have done. If there are other people who do have questions, or queries please feel free to contact anyone at the IR team here, myself, Ashish Kohli, Deborah Walter, Jonathan Spitzer or our new member Patrick Bartoski.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to hand today\u2019s conference call to Mr. Gerald Gradwell. You may begin, sir.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Hello, and welcome to our earnings call. As usual, Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer will take you through our results today. Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreen Boots Alliance is also here and will join us for questions.", "You will find a link to the webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootalliance.com.

And we refer you to the Appendix in the presentation materials available on our Investor Relations website for reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information.", "I will now handover to George to take you through the numbers.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Gerald. I am pleased that we\u2019ve delivered good results, which is a fitting close to what\u2019s been an outstanding financial year for the Company exceeding the upper end of our guidance when we have again experienced strong currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions. As usual, this performance has been achieved through a combination of operational progress and corporate efficiencies. In particular, we\u2019ve managed our costs well and generated a healthy cash flow. At the same time, we\u2019ve announced a number of significant strategic partnerships in the U.S., which Stefano will talk about later. But first, I\u2019ll take you through our fourth quarter results.", "Let me start with the financial highlights. Sales totaled $28.6 billion, up 0.4% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our results were impacted by currency translation; on a constant currency basis, sales were up 2.5%. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 36.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.0 billion and diluted EPS was $0.95.", "Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 7.2% and in constant currency was up 10.3%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 20.3%. And adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.07 that was up 21.6%. And the adverse currency translation impact was around $0.03.", "So, now, let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 4.0% over the year ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.2%. Adjusted gross profit was up 0.5% to $5.4 billion, adjusted gross margin being lower for both pharmacy and retail. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 0.9 percentage points to 20.7%. Adjusted operating margin was stable at 5.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by increased pharmacy volume, procurement efficiencies and cost control, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates.", "We continued to make strong progress on our previously announced cost savings program, the majority of which is in the U.S. Overall, we are well on track to deliver our $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017. We now expect total pre-tax charges associated with the program to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which is $300 million lower than we previously estimated.", "So, next, let\u2019s look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 6.2%, driven by increased script volume and improved specialty sales. We filled 229.5 million prescriptions and that\u2019s on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 3.7%. On a comparable basis, the stores which exclude central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 5.0% with sales up 3.9%, mainly due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 19.3%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year ago quarter. As you may know, IMS restated its market share numbers for the comparable period, due to an enhancement to the IMS panel. In the appendix, we set out fully comparable historic market share statistics for the division.", "As in the last quarter and as we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement grades and changes in mix, which were partially offset by procurement efficiencies. Retail sales on a comparable basis were down 0.3% on the same quarter last year. Sales were impacted more significantly by declines in certain consumable categories and seasonal items such as back-to-school and commodity electronics where we took action to proactively clear out old and legacy stock as we move to the next phase of our retail transformation program.", "We\u2019re also seeing the impact of direct management action in tobacco where we\u2019ve continued to reduce space and visibility as we focus on helping customers, the ones who stop smoking. Importantly, the health and wellness and beauty categories performed well. While gross margins in the quarter were slightly down, we don\u2019t see this as a permanent weakness, but the recent declines have been mainly due to actions we have take to put in place foundations for long-term growth.", "I am delighted to report that the first phase of our new beauty offering reached more than 1,600 stores across the U.S. by the end of the fiscal year. This has three core elements, products; store environment; and customer experience. First, the products, in this phase, we are highlighting two of our best known brands, No7 and Soap & Glory alongside existing national brands already well known to Walgreens customers. The second element is the store environment. Our stores beauty areas are being transformed to provide a welcoming and colorful environment with improved signage and lighting, and the product range chosen to suit all types of customers regardless of age or background. The third element of the new Walgreens beauty offer is the customer experience. This involves training and deploying specialist beauty consultants to offer high-quality advice to our customers. The program has drawn our experience internationally, most directly from Boots in the UK but has been tailored [ph] specifically for the U.S. market based on customer engagement and research. This is the first phase of a multi-phase multi-year strategy to differentiate Walgreens beauty offering.", "So, now, let\u2019s look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales of the division were $3.0 billion, up 1.4% in constant currency. On a same basis, comparable store sales declined by 0.6%, mainly due to Chile and the UK, which I\u2019ll cover in a moment. Adjusted operating margin for the division was 8.1%, up 1.0 percentage points. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $247 million, an increase of 15.7% in constant currency. To improve comparability, you will see that we\u2019ve made certain classification changes to prior period sales, cost of sales, and SG&A. These changes have had no impact on operating income. To help with modeling, in the appendix, we\u2019ve provided revised numbers by quarter for fiscal 2015 and 2016.", "Comparable pharmacy sales were flat on a constant currency basis, as the loss of institutional contracts in Chile offset growth in other markets. In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.6%. And while we continued to experience reimbursement pressure, pharmacy services continued to perform well. Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 1.0% due to a weaker Boots performance in the UK where comparable retail sales were down 0.8%, impacted by a particularly volatile and poor June. ", "So, now, let\u2019s look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, down 1.5% on a constant currency basis due to the disposal of Alliance Healthcare Russia in April. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis, which excludes acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 2.9%. This was marginally behind our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to competitive market conditions in Continental Europe. Adjusted operating margin for the division, which we define to exclude AmerisourceBergen, income was 2.9%. This was up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis versus the comparable quarter last year.", "Adjusted operating income for the division was $208 million, up 39.2% in constant currency. While the increase was mainly due to equity earnings from ABC, excluding this, adjusted operating income grew by 7.6% in constant currency. As you know, we report our share of ABC\u2019s net earnings on a two-month lag. As a result, this was our first full quarter of recognizing approximately 16% of ABC\u2019s net earnings. When modeling ABC, remember that equity income related to our increased ownership from the August warrant exercise will be reflected in only five weeks of the first quarter due to the two-month reporting lag.", "So, now, let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2016. As I said at the beginning, this has been an outstanding financial year, exceeding the upper-end of our guidance. These results are of course not directly comparable with the previous year due to the Alliance Boots transaction.", "In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.82 was down 4.5%. This reflects a number of factors including the fluctuations in the ABC warrants and last year\u2019s non-cash gain relating to Alliance Boots. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $4.59. The adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, this was 25.4%. This was lower than we had anticipated when we spoke to you last quarter. Ignoring discreet tax items, our underlying adjusted effective tax rate would have been 26.3%. Discreet items of approximately 0.9 percentage points primarily included completion of certain U.S. tax audits and true-ups of prior year accruals. The tax rate also reflects changes in the geographical mix of our pre-tax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities.", "Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $7.8 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year, working capital reduced by $1.4 billion due to improved payables. Cash capital expenditure was $421 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion in the full fiscal year. During the year, we invested in key areas to develop our customer proposition including investment in stores and the U.S. beauty program as well as upgrades to our IT systems, which we began earlier in the year.", "Store investment included over a 100 new openings in Mexico which continues to be a focus area for expansion. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion in the full fiscal year, a year-on-year increase of $2.1 billion.", "So, turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid. As announced on September 8, we remain actively engaged with the FTC on its review. And today, we still expect that the most likely outcome will be that the parties will be acquired to divest between 500 and a 1,000 stores. We believe that we\u2019ll be able to execute agreements to divest these stores to potential buyers, pending FTC approval, by the end of calendar year 2016, and now expect to close the acquisition in early calendar 2017.", "Taking into account our current expectations of store divestures, we continue to expect that the acquisition will be accretive to adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year after closing. We also continue to expect that we will realize synergies from the acquisition in excess of $1 billion to be fully realized within three to four years of closing. These synergies have been updated where practicable and as previously disclosed, are expected to come primarily from procurement, cost savings, and other operational matters.", "So, turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We are expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.20. This assumes Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 based on the assumptions that I just mentioned, and on the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program, relating to equity incentives. And in addition, this guidance is based on currency exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year.", "Please remember, sterling today is around 15% lower versus the dollar than our weighted average operating income translation rate for fiscal 2016. This had an adverse impact on our guidance of around $0.13.", "In terms of phasing, the timing and development of our recently announced new strategic pharmacy partnerships in the U.S. means that we expect Retail Pharmacy USA script growth to be stronger than usual in the second half of the fiscal year. The new rates come into effect on day one of the contracts mainly around the end of the calendar year, while we believe that enhanced volumes will take some time to build. Overall, we therefore expect Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters, but expect to see sales and profit for the year as a whole to continue to grow as the expected volumes come through from our pharmacy contracts in the second half of the fiscal year.", "So, I\u2019ll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. As you have heard, this was a good quarter despite both currency and operational challenges. It is our fourth quarter and what I believe has been an extremely good year as whole for the Company. That said, the work that we have been doing to control cost, reduce waste and return our business to a path of growth has been showing marked effects for some time. For the past eight quarters however, we have grown our adjusted net earnings over the comparable prior period.", "In fiscal 2014, if you make basic adjustment trading that 55% of Alliance Boots not reflected in the historical published results. We would have generated an estimated $3.9 billion of adjusted net earnings. As we reported $5 billion of adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2016, this could represent an increase of approximately 28% over the last two fiscal years on a reported currency basis. This is a compound annual growth rate of around 13% it also represents an annual increase of over 15% on a constant currency basis. In addition, we have delivered $10.9 billion of free cash flow over the same period.", "While I believe that this is impressive by any measure, it is not solely due to the merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have continued to see aggressive operations growth across the Company, which has been a significant driver of our strong financial performance. This success has been achieved despite it having been a very busy time.", "Let\u2019s take a moment to remind ourselves of everything that we have achieved in the past year. In the U.S., we launched significant initiatives to advance our retail and pharmacy offering. These included investing in the customer acquisitions especially in beauty to differentiate Walgreens as a retailer. We also reset our relationship with healthcare payers and PBM and work to develop closer partnership as a platform for our future. Examples of these strategic partnerships include our new 90-day prescription agreement with OptumRx and EnvisionRx, our announced agreement with Express Scripts, and our innovative partnership with Prime Therapeutics. These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes to our pharmacies and driving footfall to our stores.", "We strengthened our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, exercising both tranches warrants, understanding our pharmacy sale distribution and sourcing agreement. This move further cements the strong and collaborative working relationship our companies have built together over the past three years. Our pending acquisition of Rite Aid continues to progress as George said.", "Globally, we continue to expand our reach and presence. In Russia, we divested our retail [ph] business and as part of the deal retained a strategic stake in the country\u2019s leading health and beauty retailer. And in South Korea, we signed an agreement to form a franchise relationship with one of the Company\u2019s leading retailers.", "At the Company level, we reached and surpassed our $1 billion synergies goal of ours from the WBA merger and further progressed cost saving goal of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017. At the same time, we changed the role and responsibilities of our senior management team to structure our leadership more efficiently and move to operating a truly unified Company.", "Looking forward to 2017, we expect to face the same headwinds we encountered this year but with some additional factors that are going to likely change the profile for the year. We are entering a period where we need to consolidate much of the recent activities in the Company. We must ensure we are properly positioned to get the full benefit of our work to-date as expected volume increases from our new commercial agreement begin to flow to our U.S. pharmacies and global procurement network.", "Additional benefit will come as our retail transformation work accelerates and compounds the expected increase in traffic that flows through our stores with this agreement. We therefore expect a differentiating for the year-end with anticipated growth skewed significantly toward the second half of the year, but as you have heard from George, we are expecting the year as a whole to continue our record of healthy growth. We believe this saving is a temporary phenomenon as we see our work to transform the Company ahead and increase impact. Transformation and integration if done properly is never instant or easy, but we are progressing well. While we are delivering on the policies of the merger, we are also building strong foundation, based on establishing an outstanding team and structuring our Company for growth in core business especially Walgreens. We are doing this without losing sight of the global opportunities and are preparing the Company to play an even greater goal of healthcare awards in the U.S. and around the world.", "Thank you. Now, I will hand you back to Gerald.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, Stefano. Kevin, can we open the line for questions, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.", "Robert Willoughby", "George, what clarity do you have now on the volumes slated to come in from Prime and Express and United? I think you\u2019d have to have a healthy degree of conservatism in the guidance, not knowing exactly how their selling seasons are growing. Have you assumed any incremental volume coming through the Rite Aid stores from these relationships?", "George Fairweather", "We obviously don\u2019t comment on individual contracts, but I think what we\u2019ve tried to indicate, as I\u2019ve said in my prepared comments is that we expect the volume to increase in the second half of the year as we look forward relative to the increase that we would anticipate in the first half, because it takes time for obviously contracts to come through. In terms of Rite Aid, obviously, we cannot make comments at this point, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll appreciate.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi. Good morning, Bob. It\u2019s Alex here. Obviously, we\u2019re really pleased to have this volume coming through. The majority, as I think George has said is coming through early part of calendar year next year apart from Tricare which we expect to start to fall on November the 1st. The team has done a lot of planning here to make sure we take care of customers when they appear back in Walgreens. It\u2019s something new to Walgreens. And obviously as the year progresses, we\u2019ll be able to get a better feel on our ability to both get customers back into Walgreens and hold on to them. And remember, many of these new contracts are narrow [ph] but some are actually pretty broad, [ph] the Tricare contract for example, so has [ph] the vast majority of pharmacies in the U.S. in that contract. So, we\u2019ve been -- what we think is a good estimate from what we know into the forecast and if things change, as George has said, we\u2019ll update you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.", "Ross Muken", "Good morning, gentlemen. So, I guess just maybe not specifics on sort of how gross margins in the U.S. retail business are going to pace on a numerical basis, but more qualitatively. Obviously, you\u2019re getting a volume pickup to get that and there is obviously reimbursement pressure in the market. So, could you just help us in the phasing of that relative to the procurement savings and then relative to the new beauty rollout to just show maybe qualitatively how we should think about the different elements as they roll in, whether it\u2019s Tricare or it\u2019s these new PBM relationships and then offset by the frontend? How we just should think about either the cadence or the other pushes and pulls outside of that?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, we have a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to deliver both these strategies. So, the first one is speaking about the new volume, where we are giving better value to volume. But we believe that we\u2019ve seen already with the Med-D work in the past, this really is accretive to our model. And again, as I said, I think the previous question to Bob, most of these contracts start in January 1st. So, we see the majority of the volume, as George has said in the second half of our fiscal year, which I think starts in March of next year. So that will start to build out. And then we\u2019ve built solid plans on what we know about the market and what our great partners help us to build this business have told us about their networks. And some of the selling season is happening right now; you\u2019ll see some more which we announce particularly [ph] through days and the weeks ahead.", "On the frontend strategy, this is a multi-year multi-phase approach. We\u2019ve put 1,600 new beauty departments on the ground, not complete but new in terms of the brands that George mentioned, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory of this phase with new lighting, importantly upgraded training and development of our consultants to give the customers the information they need. And this is on the ground based on the trials we did before. Now, majority of this work will phase in over a two or three-year period in reality but you should expect the ongoing improvements to margin -- gross margin through 2017 and the years ahead.", "Remember that we focus our business on the whole box; we focus our business on operating margin including costs and of course an adjusted net earnings. All of this work is designed to drive all elements of profitability within the box of Walgreens. And we are very confident with what we are doing and the pace is accelerating.", "Ross Muken", "Again to that point, what I am trying to get at is should we think about on gross profit, a more of a dollar growth basis versus a margin basis so long as it\u2019s accretive over time to kind of returns in the operating margin because the market has been a little bit myopic on the margin percentage overall. But obviously not everything you can do to drive value will be necessarily gross margin accretive, correct?", "George Fairweather", "I think, remember, our big focus is on growing our operating income, our overall income and our cash flow. So, in terms of reimbursement pressures, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen in the past; it will continue to happen. We\u2019ve got to continue to drive efficiencies. It\u2019s got to be a way of life. So, really this is what we\u2019re focusing on and offering our customers a competitive offer and then being very financially disciplined in a way that we can drive our overall shareholder value. So in terms of thinking about -- and that\u2019s how I would really encourage you to think. We are absolutely focused on operating profit. That\u2019s what we are doing, in summary.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Just a question on your views on the supply chain. As we think about potential pricing pressure in the drug world, whether it\u2019s government driven or just the pressure is on the drug manufacturers, how do you think that flows through to your business as we think about that flow through of the distributors and PBMs? I mean what\u2019s your exposure in your minds to drug pricing pressure?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019ve spoken of this for since we\u2019ve been here with some expansion in Europe where reimbursement pressure really does come through the supply chain. And in fact, you\u2019ll probably see if you read the UK papers, this morning the government\u2019s claimed [ph] a major announcement and confirmed what we expected was a supply chain pressure and reimbursement coming through in the UK business as we planned for and as we expected. So, we are quite used to this pressure. Again, if you think back to what Stefano and George said, we are working really close with AmerisourceBergen, they\u2019re proving to be strong partners to help us to not just improve our availability to make sure we take care of customers, which is driving our volume but to make sure we do that in a really efficient and integrated and more innovative way going forward. So, we feel confident that we can use our scale, use our partnerships, use our knowledge and knowhow from Europe to be in a good position in what we expect to be continued supply chain pressure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan.", "Lisa Gill", "I just want to take an opportunity to go back to the strategic partnerships that you talk about and just have a better understanding as to how it works contractually. If we think about the fact that you\u2019ve had PBM relationships with all of these parties in the past, how do we think about those relationships compared to the new strategic relationships? And what I\u2019m trying to get at is that my understanding is that come January 1st, the trade of the volume for the price has to do with specifics around products on the maintenance side where you\u2019re getting people to a 90-day script. It\u2019s not your overall PBM contract, but I just want clarification to better understand that.", "Stefano Pessina", "Lisa, this is really our strategy, it\u2019s always been our strategy. We want to partner with as many people as possible. And when people understand this, they accept that we are on the market and we have to offer our best services to everybody within the market. If you don\u2019t really accept, you as an operator of the market, if you don\u2019t accept this concept of collaboration, sooner or later, you are isolated and you cannot really exploit your potential at best. When we have announced some of these deals, of course we have spoken to the other customers that we have, the other PBMs and we have explained [ph] which is our logic, and we have explained that we are willing to help collaborate with everybody. And you have seen that in few months, we have been able to announce agreement, special collaboration practically with most of the operators in the sector. This is a strategy, a strategy which has always worked for us in the past in other countries, and I believe will work also in the U.S. Of course, as George said, every time that we do something new, every time that we propose an agreement [ph] or take into consideration an agreement which is proposed by one of our customers, we are running the numbers in a very disciplined way considering of course everything, considering the volume, considering the discount, considering the work that we can extract more from our suppliers if anything, considering the increased efficiencies of the pharmacies. And then, at the end, we decide whether we can do this particular kind of the deal or not. And of course we are very conscious that when we come with an innovative deal or with a partnership on the market, we have to be prepared to offer similar things to other people. I believe that this is a beauty of being independent. We can work with everybody and we can offer our services to everybody. And we are not seen as particularly skewed toward this or that player in the market.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. And then, if I can just follow up, when I think about your strategy, specialty is clearly a big and growing area. And Stefano, do you feel like you need to make an acquisition in the area of specialty to continue to grow that business or do you feel that some of the partnerships that you have today, most recently Prime and talking about making some investments around specialty there that that will be enough?", "Stefano Pessina", "We believe that if we could improve our position in specialties through partnership, these would be much more efficient and much more profitable because if we have to buy something -- well, first of all, we would have to buy something in the market which has a potential for development. And now, in this market, we see that many people have an outlook which is not particularly positive in our judgment, first of all. And secondly, this would be extremely expensive. And so, again, we are very-disciplined. We will not buy something just because it\u2019s nice to have. We want to be sure that if we use our money, our money will have an important return, a cash return, and we value all of what we do, not in terms of earnings per share, we value it in terms of EVA, [ph] in terms of cash. Maybe Alex, you want to add something about specialties?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, specifically on Prime, Lisa, I think this is a joint venture which we will get on in the first few months of next year. We have also good relationship with Prime and the team of Prime through Jim. And we\u2019re getting closer, which is fantastic. But fundamentally, we\u2019re combining our central specialty in a joint venture operation. So, we use the efficiencies that we can bring together to the market and we can buy there together in that area as well. So that\u2019s what [ph] we\u2019re doing here on the course by doing that through the PBM, which is owned by the Blue through Prime, we hope to be able to over time when we get that efficiency in it, attract more patients and more customers. This is a build out strategy, a classic example of this sort of partnership approach that Stefano described.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.", "Michael Cherny", "Just a quick question I guess on the frontend retail side. You talked about some of the investments you are making in improving the beauty side in particular. I don\u2019t know if you touched too much on the digital initiatives that you guys are pursuing. Maybe talk about success you\u2019ve had so far as you expand areas around the loyalty card and other digital marketing initiatives. And then if you can, any incremental plans you have in terms of targeting improved areas on a go forward basis?", "Alex Gourlay", "Sure, Michael. Yes. I think as I said before and I think as people know, we have quite a successful digital team and app [ph] for seven years I think as now annually quick fill continues, refilling prescriptions continues to be a breakthrough app that we continue to develop along with the mobile, which we continue to develop and we get absolutely fit for the modern customer and we continue to get score [ph] as a team frankly and it\u2019s a great platform for us. We obviously transformed graphic [ph] business here in the U.S. and to that approach a couple of years ago when we transferred [indiscernible] as well. So to next question, I think as your question, well, we closed operations for Beauty and Drugstore.com and it\u2019s been done successfully. The focus is really on the retail product business. We announced last Monday order online [ph] to store or Ship to Store in 7,600 clock stores including Duane Reade. And success we\u2019ve built in again the Boots business, sharing of knowledge between frontend and the UK is really important part of our journey here. So, we continue to invest behind the digital team. We are a very strong team in my view, very impressive team. And we\u2019re very confident with the platforms we have and knowhow we have and know we\u2019re focusing back on volumes, health and beauty strategy, particularly in the frontend to become the entry gate omni-channel retailer where we have a lot of room to go. And while the rest of it is very clear, we understand the risk very well. We believe with [Indiscernible] corners across America and this capability, we are pretty well-positioned.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "First question is on Rite Aid, obviously divesting the Rite Aid storage has been taking longer than expected. You actually did include divided accretion [ph] in your guidance. So, what gives you confidence in an early 2017 close?", "Stefano Pessina", "I\u2019d say that yes. I agree with you that it is taking more than we expected, but I have to tell you that as you have seen from our presentation and from the fact that we have included some part of Rite Aid potential profit in our guidance, from this you can really understand that we are confident, as confident as we were before about this deal. Nothing has changed. We have just a delay in the execution of the deal. This is our perception. We have always been optimistic because we have never seen an attitude from the FTC which was absolutely negative. Of course, they were requiring, they were asking a lot of questions, sometimes they were taking time to respond. But at the end of the day, I believe we have had a good collaboration; we are having a good collaboration. We try to respond to the all of their needs. This takes time. But at the end, we are still confident.", "Of course I know that we read on the paper very different news. No idea about the sources of this news but for sure if we could talk and of course you know that we cannot, our view will be different. For what we see today, we see just a long administrative process but we don\u2019t see substantial differences from what we were expecting. Yes, probably more stores, a little more stores here and there. But at the end of the day, as far as I can see today, as far as we can see today, we are absolutely confident that we can create, that we can do the deal and we can create the value. Just these values will be a little postponed on time because if and when we will do the deal, of course for the first month, we will not be able to start immediately the synergies; it will take some time. And we were hoping to do the deal at the beginning of this fiscal year for us. In this case, we would have had time to develop some of the synergies. Of course, if we could close the deal relatively late in our fiscal year, the synergies will be small but we will find all of them next year.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "And then my third question is about the PBM contracts that you signed. When we think about the partnerships, in aggregate, they manage more than 50% of the U.S. script market versus your share that is a little bit below 20%. When we think about the opportunity from a long-term perspective, how much incremental share do you think that you can gain through these relationships? I mean, when we look at CBS we estimate that their share with their maintenance choice account at retail is about 33% versus the 20% national share. So, is this a good goalpost for us to use when we think about this opportunity and the returns over the longer-term?", "Alex Gourlay", "We don\u2019t really think about [indiscernible] what we\u2019re focused on is two elements of growing our business. One which we\u2019ve seen in the last period which is a combination of access [indiscernible] growing channel but really through delivering for customers. Customer experiences [ph] for us in our pharmacies have moved and a big credit to Richard Ashworth and all of the teams involved and Brad, [ph] because that really has been a big shift in how we\u2019ve been able to take care of customers in our pharmacies. That really has been a driver of the recent share you\u2019ve seen in the past and we will be completely focused on continuing to do that. And secondly, it\u2019s definitely still [indiscernible] We want to make sure that the people who are paying for these prescriptions with customers and payers, we just make sure we get the right understanding of what we want for the networks that we\u2019re in and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do in different ways and we have all sorts of different ways as we\u2019re demonstrating of getting that done.", "So, we do really, customer-by-customer and peer-by-peer and also network-by-network to make sure that we can grow our business. We\u2019re early in this strategy, to be honest. We\u2019re early in this strategy and we are still learning how to really drive it and make it work. And we remain confident that we\u2019ll learn a lot this year with the ambitions we have and analyze [ph] to have access back into Walgreens that didn\u2019t have access before and again we\u2019ll continue to evaluate [ph] goals going forward.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "And lastly, the new terms of Express had any impact on the margins in the fourth quarter or it\u2019s all in fiscal year 2017?", "Stefano Pessina", "Could you repeat? Sorry.", "Alex Gourlay", "So, the Tricare contract as you know is one as we declared [indiscernible] 2017. Yes.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "But for the rest of the Express book assuming that that has been re-priced as well. So, did you see any impact of that in your fourth quarter results or is this all going to be in fiscal year 2017, outside Tricare?", "Alex Gourlay", "Ricky, as you know, we agree what we disclosed with the partners that [Indiscernible] we haven\u2019t disclosed anything outside of Tricare. So, we can\u2019t disclose anything else this morning.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Steven Valiquette", "So, just a question or two on the Medicare margins. It seems like with Medicare becoming a bigger part of your mix -- I mean, I guess there was some noise in the channel about maybe some Medicare gross margins compressing as calendar 2016 was progressing for the industry, and we\u2019re kind of seeing that in your U.S. gross margin as well, so kind of look at the progression year-over-year. So, I guess I\u2019m wondering, first, are you seeing any fall off in Medicare gross margins as calendar 2016 is progressing or have they remained fairly stable? And then also just -- or is it more maybe just a mix issue where if Medicare is a bigger part of your mix, we\u2019re just seeing our Medicare gross margins maybe lower than commercial gross margins? So, I just wanted to sort of tackle those two ankles on the U.S. gross margins? Thanks.", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes. See, margin is expected -- clearly there is pressure in the margin and Med-D because the volume\u2019s growing stable and as we expected. And the mix as you can see in our book-of-business is shifting. So, therefore that\u2019s what\u2019s driving further pressure on the margin.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay. So, some companies, we\u2019re seeing that pressure maybe as the year\u2019s progressing; you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re not seeing any material fall-off in your Medicare margin as the year is progressing?", "Alex Gourlay", "That\u2019s correct. I mean there is the trend only [ph] year-after-year on these annual contracts but the trend is not any clear than it was in the past as we expected.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.", "George Hill", "I\u2019m going to pull a little bit further on Steve\u2019s thread here. Alex, if we think about the business and you guys talk about the EBIT margin and the kind of continued pressure there. I guess, can you separate the payer pressure and kind of the underlying pressure on the business versus the impact of mix, they move to 90-day, the new relationships with PBMs to take share? I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get is a better understanding of what is actual pressure on the business and what is the margin change as a reflection of mix? And even digging into that further, how much of that is by the company\u2019s design versus how much of it is the design of payers pushing down on you guys?", "Alex Gourlay", "I would say that as a company we now actively manage both these elements. I think as George described well in script on the frontend, we are actively managing the seasonal capacities, some historic stock and also we\u2019re managing out of some product lines, particularly again in the consumables and seasonal items, which as we manage more into getting more space as appropriate over trying to help, and really the biggest example being clearly space for in 1,600 stores for extended beauty ranges. [Ph]", "So, we are actively managing that. We are managing, again as we said, operating margin level, maybe through a box in terms of the question on reimbursement pressure. Again, we are actively managing it. We\u2019ve spoken very clearly that we recognize and predict the trend. We saw conversations much earlier and much more strategically with peers if they call it to broaden the team from [indiscernible] strategy. We do this very actively now to understand how we can help them grow and help ourselves grow. And we are very confident that we can grow, particularly when you look at adjusted operating profit within the box, ticking both these parts. So, I don\u2019t think we can see any more than that to be honest, because obviously we keep these things tight within the business for obvious reasons but we are actively managing it. That\u2019s what we do, that\u2019s what we\u2019re paid, to be honest.", "George Hill", "Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up is one large payer care market is noticeably absent from the deals that you guys have signed recently. I guess, can you talk to us about when the current contract with them runs through and I guess how we should think about how you will pursue kind of the next renewal of the Caremark pay arrangement?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes. We can\u2019t speak about the contracts of any of big peers; we can\u2019t talk about obviously for obvious reasons. They will pursue it exactly the same way that Stefano described. We want to operate with everyone in the marketplace in a way that works for them and works for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. ", "Robert Jones", "On the cost savings program, George, last year, you shared where you ended the year on the SG&A savings, which I believe was $775 million. I know you said you\u2019re well on track to achieve the 1.5 by the end of 2017. But, can you maybe just share with us where you actually ended the year on that program in 2016? And then, I guess along those lines, beyond the 1.5, are there any other major areas of further cost savings that you guys have been able to identify?", "George Fairweather", "On the program, overall, as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very much on track overall. The big change really from where we were a year ago, has really been that we were able to deliver this for $300 million less than we previously anticipated of which -- quite a portion of that will be true cash savings. So, we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019ve been able do this. And we\u2019re very much track to complete the program next year. It\u2019s very much a defined program with the start and the finish. But of course, there are always ways to drive efficiencies. It\u2019s just a way of life for us. We\u2019re looking at it every day across all aspects of our business and we\u2019ll continue to drive to do that. And clearly some of the investment that you\u2019re seeing in capital in some of the areas like IT will take us a little bit of time to get some f the new systems in place that will further enable us to both drive efficiencies and drive -- and to manage the business in an increasingly more-tighter way.", "Stefano Pessina", "And next year, of course, we will have the big task of extracting value from Rite Aid. This would be another huge opportunity for saving costs.", "Robert Jones", "That\u2019s very helpful. So, I guess, just one other one around SG&A. You guys talked about the initiative. Can you maybe just help us frame the investment needed to achieve that rollout? Just trying to think about on the model SG&A within the Retail USA segment as a percent of sales in 2017, maybe relative -- the core business relative to what we saw into 2016? That would be helpful. Thanks.", "Alex Gourlay", "I can\u2019t give you specifics. But what I can say is that taking workload, particularly at out of our 8,200 drugstores is a big part of the cost program. And we are very pleased with the progress we made on our internal measure, independent internal measure to be honest on customer care, as we really move forward, despite the fact that we\u2019ve held costs in the drugstores more or less flat this year. So, we are very confident that we can move that cost to give better advice [ph] and care, as George described, in the beauty model. And that would drive incremental sales and of course better margins for us as we\u2019ve seen in the trials. So, we are very focused, as George said on costs, but we\u2019re also very focused on reinvesting our cost back where customers appreciate it.", "George Fairweather", "Just to remind Bob, and as I said in the presentation there, SG&A in the USA as a percentage of sales fell 0.9 percentage points. And I think that\u2019s the best evidence really of what we\u2019re delivering. And just to add to the question on capital, I haven\u2019t obviously given any specific guidance on capital for fiscal 2017. But in terms of thinking, I would expect it to be a little bit higher than we\u2019ve seen in fiscal 2016, which is really reflecting some of the initiatives that we\u2019ve got to develop the offer that we talked about as well as the investment in the new IT that we\u2019re working on.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the Eric Percher with Barclays.", "Eric Percher", "So, on the Rite Aid accretion number, I understand that you\u2019re not including a lot of synergy here and that will come over time, and it looks like this is going represent about seven months of the fiscal year. It still looks quite low relative to the run rate of Rite Aid and what we might have thought accretion would run. So, can you speak to -- is this a fairly conservative number? I know there is a wide range of potential stores, I get that the indication of confident is really step one here, but any comments on that number itself?", "George Fairweather", "This is our view of it, which is why we\u2019ve included on -- our accretion is built on our economics, which is the way we\u2019ve built the model up. And really to emphasize a little bit of what Alex just said on the synergy -- Stefano was saying, synergies will take some time to come through as ever when we approach a merger like this, our focus is always on the customer first to make sure that we deliver for the customer through this period. And we\u2019ve got a very detailed plan to deliver the synergies. But as we said, this will take three to four years. The important thing is to go in a straight line, but it does very much reflect our view on the timing and the time it will take to start to deliver the synergies.", "Eric Percher", "If I can give you any indication -- it\u2019s Stefano. Normally, I don\u2019t speak about these specifically but normally when we have done big merger, we have started to deliver the synergies after five, six months something because of the first months. Of course, you can do something but the first months are really needed to prepare the plan. And we cannot accelerate the plan; we cannot do the plan now. We are working on integration but we cannot do the plan about the synergies now because we don\u2019t know the numbers of Rite Aid. As you know, we are not allowed to see their numbers. And so, in reality, we cannot put together the plan. As soon as we will know their numbers that we will have done the deal, we will start to put in place a plan which will take a few months and after we will execute the plan. This is why it is still skewed at the end of the first year, the first year of the merger, of any merger, not just this one.", "Eric Percher", "Okay. So, we have your best estimate there. And then for the fiscal year, I know Alex, you mentioned earlier some of the cuts that we\u2019ve seen potentially in the UK. I know that it was a 6% cut that was delayed earlier. Was your comment around that cut actually being put into place and maybe equally important, George is that in the expectation for fiscal year 2017?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes. That was my comment and I think it has been -- announced this morning, we had this morning from the UK. And George will -- I think also it\u2019s in the guidance. ", "George Fairweather", "Absolutely, it\u2019s in our guidance. David made the announcement just a few hours ago, just orally, but it was very consistent with what we\u2019ve been anticipating, so, no surprises there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. ", "Eric Bosshard", "Curious, if -- George, if you could outline at all some cornerstones of how we should think about how the U.S. retail profit path should work going forward. Obviously you\u2019ve got these new partnerships and you\u2019ve outlined how that might influence gross margin and volume in 2017. But looking over the next handful of years, it would be just helpful to understand the walk of what the expectation might be in terms of either sales growth or profit growth just to have some metrics to think about in regards to that outside of acquisitions but just within the core business what you\u2019re envisioning and how you\u2019re -- and what goals you\u2019re running the business to achieve?", "George Fairweather", "Well, I think the overall goal obviously as we\u2019ve said is to focus on our operating income and cash flow. In terms of thinking as we\u2019ve tried to sort of shape, you should think as we develop the new partnerships that we are able to build our pharmacy, our pharmacy volume, and as we said that we expect that to be -- the group to be faster in the second half of the year and you can think then about taking that beyond, as we said a lot of the new partnerships coming around the end of this calendar, beginning of the next calendar. There is obviously then the function of your views on inflation and then on mix, and of course with very different profile in somewhere like our central specialty versus our core pharmacy, there is an element of mix comes through there and that will obviously change over time. And then -- but we will continue to see the reimbursement pressures that are just very much a way of life.", "In terms of retail, a lot of our focus has been on developing the offer, as Alex has said, both in terms of the actual offer in store, our own brands; leading U.S. brand or we\u2019re doing on omni-channel. And so, a lot of our focus is being on working our way through getting ready for that. You should start to see the benefits of that coming through over time, focusing on the offer over time, then we believe we will be able to grow. But we are looking to grow in the right categories, which is very important and so mix is very important. And we know mix is important way of managing the margin, the gross margin in the retail products, part of the U.S. business. And so we\u2019d expect to see the benefits of that coming through over time. And then on cost, as we say, as we drive efficiency, then we\u2019re certainly very focused on continuing to improve our cost ratios. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales is a key area of focus. Again, we would be seeking to see that progressing. So, these really are the core drivers of what should drive the profit. I\u2019m particularly talking obviously Retail Pharmacy USA.", "Eric Bosshard", "And so, within that and I appreciate all of those core drivers and how dynamic it is, but what we\u2019d be curious to know is in terms of what you\u2019re shooting for this to achieve in terms of operating profit growth from this business? And again, I understand there is a lot of moving parts, but is the goal of this -- this is a mid single-digit operating profit growth or an upper single-digit operating profit growth over the next three to five years, not necessarily the second half of 2017.", "George Fairweather", "Our overall growth is really as we target really is in terms of generating profit. It\u2019s the goal we really talked about just over this time a year ago from our underlying activities to seek to drive profit around the double-digit level and assuming there are no extraneous factors. So, I mean currency would be a good example of an extraneous factor, where there is not a lot we can do on currency translation, it can go one way one year, another way another year. But fundamentally, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on is driving profit, and then from core activities, and then obviously shareholder enhancing transactions like the Rite Aid deal. And also at the same time, we are very focused -- and I know it\u2019s a little old fashioned, but we\u2019re very focused on cash flow, because cash flow is an engine for growth in the long-term. You see we\u2019ve made good progress on working capital this year. And this really lets us invest, it lets us over time in M&A, and enables us to continue to drive shareholder value.", "Stefano Pessina", "As we have said in our presentation, in constant currency, in the last two years, we have delivered a compound growth of more than 15% in earnings on a comparable basis. So, this is independent on the acquisition of AB because we have restated pro forma. This is independent on the number of shares. Practically we have not had any acquisition in the meantime, excluding AB, acquisition contributed much in the last two years. We have also divested something. So, the real growth, the underlying growth of our Company in the last two years has been 13% if we consider the effect of the devaluation of the pound sterling, more than 15% in constant currency. And we have always said that we can deliver underlying double-digit growth, low double-digit growth, and this is what we are doing. And this is what are focused on.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.", "Charles Rhyee", "Just a couple of questions to clarify, in the guidance for fiscal 2017, can you give us a sense of where we should think about a tax rate for the year, particularly as we think about the Rite Aid business coming on? Should we expect that as a U.S. business to bring the tax rate up slightly? Also Alex, you talked about minimizing or someone talked about minimizing the tobacco footprint in the stores. How much of a headwind may have that caused in foreign sales and should we think about that type of headwind that could cause as you continue to minimize that going forward?", "George Fairweather", "Okay. I\u2019ll take the tax one first and then let Alex take the second one. In terms of tax, we\u2019ve obviously not given specific guidance for fiscal 2017 on tax. But in terms of thinking about it, if you strip out the discrete items, as I talked about last year, then our real underlying tax pre-Rite Aid last year was -- our underlying tax last year was 26.3% on an adjusted basis. That\u2019s obviously excluding the ABC income because of course that gets reported on a post-tax basis. So, it\u2019s quite -- in terms of modeling, we always model and think about it the way I\u2019ve just described excluding ABC.", "If you think of that 26.3%, then excluding Rite Aid, that\u2019s a fairly good proxy for what it should be going forward because pre-Rite Aid, the mix will be broadly the same. In terms of Rite Aid, you\u2019re absolutely right. With Rite Aid, as the proportion of profit increases from the Rite Aid deal once we\u2019re able to complete it, then we will see a higher portion of profit here in the USA and of course here the tax rates are higher than in most parts of Europe where the rest of the business operates. But of course this year, given the accretion that we\u2019ve indicated that will be a relatively modest impact.", "Alex Gourlay", "On the tobacco, the tobacco comments that George made in his script, we\u2019ll continue to obviously minimize and reduce visibility to tobacco in our drug stores but more importantly we\u2019ll continue to help customers to stop smoking through the various platforms, smoke efficient platforms and pharmacies online and with the key suppliers put in place, for example Balance Rewards for healthy choices as one example. But you should expect that we\u2019ll continue to see reducing sales in tobacco category in Walgreens going forward.", "Charles Rhyee", "Have you -- are you going to be able to quantify sort of what that headwind is as we think about that or can you talk about how much category and sales has been for you historically? I know CBS put out a number of -- couple billion a few years back.", "Alex Gourlay", "I am sorry. Beyond the market data that\u2019s available, we can\u2019t give that number. And as I said before, it\u2019s an effect of the market as well as the effect of what we\u2019re doing. So, we are just -- it\u2019s just getting what we\u2019re doing. And as said also, we\u2019ll give you more updates.", "Charles Rhyee", "And if I could just add one follow up on Rite Aid again. In terms of the divestiture package, obviously a lot of noise, people making comments here and there. How flexible is this package as you think about stores that you\u2019re looking to or willing to divest? Is this one where flexibility in terms of shaping the portfolio to be able to satisfy, not only you have to see it but potential buyers?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, we are not able to give the details. First of all, I\u2019ll repeat again, we don\u2019t know in detail all data of Rite Aid. And it\u2019s early time for us to take these decisions and that of course even if we them, we could not disclose them. So, it\u2019s too early. In a few months, probably we will be able to discuss about this.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to our host.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. And thank you, everyone for joining us today and for your questions. That was our final question. If anybody does have any further questions, the IR team here and myself, Ashish, Deborah, Jay and Patrick are around for the next couple of days and of course always around and available at the end of phone or email.

Sir, you may begin.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. And can I first say that in keeping with our corporate staffs on cold and flu, a number of us have gone out and caught colds and flu\u2019s, so please bare with us if we sound slightly bunged up this morning. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer will take you through our results as usual. Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreen Boots Alliance is also here and will join us for questions.", "You will find a link to the webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootalliance.com.

Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "As a reminder, today\u2019s presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. And we refer you to the Appendix in the presentation materials available on our Investor Relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information.", "I will now handover to George to take you through the numbers.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Gerald. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of this quarter with results in-line with our expectations. We continue to make good progress towards completing our Rite Aid transaction. And today, we have raised the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2017. ", "So, turning now to the financial highlights for the quarter, as we expected currency had a negative impact on the year-over-year financial performance, the U.S. dollar being around 18% higher versus sterling. Sales for the quarter totaled $28.5 billion, down 1.8% versus the comparable quarter last year. On a constant currency basis, however, sales were up 1.1%. ", "GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 1.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.1 billion and diluted EPS was $0.97. Adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion, up 0.4% and in constant currency was up 2.8%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 6.1% and in constant currency up 8.2%. ", "Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.10, up 6.8% and in constant currency up 9.7%. The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, this was 25.5%. This was lower than the same quarter last year, primarily due to changes in our forecast geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities.", "So now, let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 1.4% over the year ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 1.1%. Adjusted gross profit was $5.5 billion, up 0.1% over the year ago quarter reflecting an increase in retail, which is partially offset by a decline in pharmacy. ", "Adjusted SG&A was 20.4% of sales, an improvement of 0.5 percentage points, compared to the year ago quarter. This reflects benefits from our cost transformation program. Adjusted operating margin was 6.2%, up 0.1 percentage points resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion, up 3.7%. So next, let\u2019s look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 2.5% driven by increased script volumes and higher specialty sales. ", "We filled 237.6 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 3.0%. On a comparable basis for stores, which exclude central specialty, our pharmacy sales increased by 2.0% with scripts filled up 3.4%, primarily due to drop in Medicare Part D volumes. ", "Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation was partly offset by reimbursement pressure, which was in-line with what we anticipated and by the impact of generics. While branded drug price inflation continued, it was at a more moderate level than in prior quarters. Keep in mind that these factors impacted sales and gross profit. ", "Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter, on the usual 30-day adjusted basis, was 19.5%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year ago quarter. Total retail sales were down 0.9% on the same quarter last year. This includes the impact of the previously announced closure in September of certain e-commerce operations. ", "Comparable retail sales were down 0.5% in the quarter due to declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, partially offset by increases in health and wellness category and beauty category. Gross margin was higher than the same quarter last year, primarily driven by owned brand performance and procurement benefits. ", "Since the quarter end, while our December comparable sales were still negative, we saw stronger performances in our key health and wellness and beauty categories. We have now completed the first phase of the rollout of our new differentiated beauty offering, which is available in more than 1800 stores. ", "In addition, in October, we launched Beauty Enthusiast, a new loyalty offering which engages our most valuable beauty and personal care customers. Since the launch, with signups and incremental spend among Beauty Enthusiasts has been above plan. As we anticipated, we have increased beauty sales in these remodeled stores, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory. ", "During 2017, within these stores, we plan to introduce further new product lines, as well as expand the number of stores with beauty offerings. A significant element of the rollout is the recruitment and training of beauty consultants. In order to maintain high standards, we are doing this in a methodical manner, which is taking slightly longer than expected. ", "So now, let\u2019s look at the results of the retail pharmacy international division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion, up 0.5% in constant currency. On the same basis, comparable store sales decreased 0.1%. Comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.5% on a constant currency basis, due to a decline in the UK, which was partially offset by growth in other international markets. ", "Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.8%, due to the expected reduction in pharmacy funding, partially offset by strong performance in pharmacy services. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.2%, due to growth in all countries other than Chile and Mexico. Within the UK, Boots performance was flat versus the year ago quarter, and we saw growth in our opticians business.", "Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 2.7% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, mainly due to lower margins in the UK in what is really a new environment for retailers. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis increased by 0.7 percentage points to 32.5%, mainly reflecting higher depreciation costs than the year ago quarter. ", "As you may recall, in January last year, I explained that fiscal 2016 first quarter results benefited from purchase price accounting refinements. In addition, the higher depreciation this quarter reflected our ongoing IT and store investment program. Adjusted operating margin was 7.2%, down 2.0 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $213 million, a decrease of 21.6% again in constant currency. ", "Since the quarter end, I\u2019m pleased to report that December retail sales growth was notably stronger than in the first quarter. Boots December retail performance was solid, reflecting actions taken in the full to counter what are challenging market conditions. However, from December 1, as expected Boots was impacted by the government action to lower pharmacy practice payments.", "So now, let\u2019s look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, up 0.6% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis increased by 4.7%, this was slightly ahead of our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales, with the growth in the UK and emerging markets offsetting competitive market conditions in continental Europe. ", "Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC was 3.1%, up 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating income was $224 million, up 45.2% in constant currency. While the increase was mainly due to equity earnings from ABC, excluding this, adjusted operating income grew by 10.2% in constant currency, cost benefits, outweighing margin pressures. ", "Operating cash flow in the quarter was $525 million. During the quarter, our working capital outflow was $1.2 billion. This reflected our typical seasonal build in inventories and inventory build to a certain new initiatives, partially offset by improved payables days. Cash capital expenditures for the quarter was $378 million. We continued to invest in our core customer proposition, including our stores and U.S. beauty program, as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we have previously talked about. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $147 million. ", "So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid, as you all have seen from today's earnings press release we are actively engaged in discussions with the FTC, and are still working towards the close of the acquisition in the early part of this calendar year, having announced the Fred's agreement on December 20, 2016. ", "So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017, we have raised the lower end of guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.20. This assumes as before, Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12 and current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. Now keep in mind, we still expect second half year growth to be stronger than in the first, as we get to benefit from the strategic partnerships announced last year. ", "During the quarter, we purchased 5.6 million shares at a cost of $457 million. This substantially completes our anti-dilutive share buyback program for fiscal 2017. At the quarter end, this resulted in just over 1.79 billion common shares outstanding. ", "So, I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. As you have heard, the results for the quarter are good and very much in line with our expectations. As usual, they tell the story of a dynamic business with many moving parts. And we are aware of the complication these some things creates for people looking from outside the company when they try to measure our progress, especially on a quarter-by-quarter basis, when we are fulfilling strategies that are aimed at delivering value over the long-term. ", "Last quarter, we told you that we expect that our result for fiscal 2017 would be weighted towards the second half of the year as our new agreement with key strategic partner that begin to believe that volume increase offset the commercial sizing that we have given. As this implies, we will continue to see this impact in the second quarter of the year, which is as we expected and previously segmented. ", "We continue to deliver major progress with cost reduction outsourcing both areas in which we have a lot more progress to make, which is allowing us to deliver these good financial results, while we implement initiatives to drive growth in our store. Further differentiate our retail offering and promote our own and exclusive brand across our businesses. We are still at an early stage of the deployment of new retail initiative in Walgreens and are refreshing the offering and in the processes to announce the customer experience. ", "Looking forward to recognize the natural work we're doing in the US. We are trying to bring on new way of thinking to our company, which if we're successful we will hopefully influence the sector alone. We're focused on working in partnership to provide a better, more efficient, and more effective approach within the U.S. customer. To make a better use of the infrastructure in place at the moment, rethink how we do along the other things that we do today. ", "There is no doubt that the healthcare system needs to change by improving the provision of health care, while at the same time acting to control the rapid growth in costs. We are working to play our part in the changes that need to happen to achieve this and as we deliver value in the system that we create we capture an element of that volume within our own business. Of course, we are a single part of the system, so can only do so much on our own, which is why we are succumbed to partnership and talk about it so much. ", "Working together with others to rethink the interaction and interfaces within the overall system allows us more impact within the system, a more leverage of a side and more ways and opportunities to create value, both in our business and in the system as a whole. Of course, the U.S. is only a part of our business albeit a very significant part. ", "Overall, across our company our business has changed and constantly reinvents themselves to remain relevant in the ever changing market. So, we continue to work to grow and develop the company as a whole. During the quarter, I have visited mainly of our operation outside the U.S. and they remain convinced that there are opportunities for us internationally. I said in the past that Asia and Latin America are areas of particular interest perhaps outside the U.S. And the more I see of the market the more convinced I am of these. ", "In terms of corporate development, you have seen the progress we announced at the end of December regarding the proposed transaction with Rite Aid, in having reached a conditional agreement with Fred\u2019s. We still have to complete our work with FTC and as we have seen these things can take some time, as the FTC are scrupulous in ensuring that they consider everything properly and fully. As said, I remain as convinced as ever of the strategic benefit of the proposed Rite Aid transaction. I look forward to being able to provide you with another update as soon as we can. ", "We are clearly making progress and while I would always like to move faster and do more, we must be measured and ensured we work at the pace with which we are confident, we can deliver for our customers and our shareholder with all the plans and strategies we have discussed with you. How confident? It is only strengthened by our recent performance. Holiday shopping started later than usual, with the bulk of the sale occurring in the last days before Christmas. That said, we have once again seen what appears to be a solid holiday period in our main retail market. ", "As George had told you, we are raising the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the year. As we see the business from in-line with our expectation. We continue to have mainly different ways to deliver the value and growth that we see possible in the business and as ever we will value each of these with prior guide depending on the market and the competitive changes that we see, but overall these continue to give us the tools we need to maintain the financial performance we have committed to further company as a whole. ", "Overall, we remain confident in the outlook for the company, optimistic that the strategies that we are pursuing will deliver future growth and convinced of the long-term opportunity to create the genuine value for this business, for many years to come. Thank you. ", "Now I will hand you back to Gerald.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, Stefano. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Operator, can you open the lines.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. You may begin.", "Ross Muken", "Good morning gentlemen. So Stefano, you talked about the changing healthcare landscape, you\u2019re obviously doing a lot of things to kind of revolutionize in some ways, how the supply chain functions, you know as you think about the competitive responses as you think about the partnerships that have happened, where do you feel like you\u2019ve made the most progress and where do you see the sort of next leg of big opportunity, and obviously it\u2019s going to depend somewhat on the Rite Aid transaction in terms of what you do next, but just on the core business, where do you feel like you have done the most and where do you feel like in the U.S. business you have probably the most to do.", "Stefano Pessina", "Well apart the Rite Aid transaction as you said, I believe that the big achievement of the last year has been for us to be able to create really a bridge with the main PBM and other big players in this industry, and now we have certain joint ventures, we have certain - let's say contracts that may be new patients as a consequence of what - of these or what we have done, but we have something which is much more important. We have established the trust. ", "The trust between us and a certain number of companies, not all of them, not everybody has been able to create these elements of trust, but for certain companies, the trust is there and on the trust we can build a lot of additional opportunities in future. And so, our relationship with Prime, our relationship with Express Scripts, our relationship even with Optum, even though there have been many discussions about Optum, but are creating a new basis of discussion and new basis of collaboration, which of course can go beyond a simple contract and can probably - at the end also take in consideration a wider scenario.", "Ross Muken", "That's helpful. And maybe just quickly on the international business, you know you highlighted obviously key emerging markets as a place for expansion, you know you entered a number of different countries with different mild acquisition, joint venture etcetera over time, I mean is this the kind of environment currently that is favorable toward accomplishing may be more of those goals and in terms of expanding your geographic reach and then to help us understand what are the key challenges, obviously we have seen folks enter Brazil and at times that\u2019s been tough for Russia et cetera, what makes for a good emerging market in your view in terms of the ability to make money there and what not?", "Stefano Pessina", "You see, it\u2019s always a tricky answer because things change so rapidly. For sure, I wouldn't be particularly excited to invest in Brazil unless we could find a very, very favorable situation, but Brazil is still a big country, sooner or later it would be interesting again. But you see countries like China, for instance are still enormously interested. I remember that in China we have a good presence in sales but not as a retailer and this is due to a historical reason that until three years ago the foreign people could have just 30 pharmacies. So, we had 30 pharmacies, we were 29 in Brazil. So, we were prevented by the pharmacies there. ", "So the only way to do so was to team up the minority with state-owned company. So, we have -- now this restriction has been a reality, I would say even withdrawn, there are still certain things, but substantially withdrawn and from - in the last two years, we have been very, very active in finding the right partner for us to have a big pharmacy chain. Sooner or later we will be able to it. ", "The problem is that you have to dedicate a lot of time to get a deal in China, and it\u2019s true that we have a team in China, a permanent team in China of Chinese people, but it is also true that to do a big deal in China, you must have the agreement of the Chairman of the relevant company and the Chairman generally doesn't want to talk to the Chairman. ", "China is really, it\u2019s a very high hierarchical society. And so, it's also true that in the last two years, I have not gone to China as frequently as I used to go. And so I was not able to keep the relationship as I should have done, but now I have gone to China, I have spent some time to China in the last months and now we are back and I believe, I strongly believe that sooner or later we will be able to do something. When? I don't know, but it is possible.", "Ross Muken", "Great, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. You may begin.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. How would you characterize the competitive promotional environment in the U.S.? There has been some concerns that recent partnerships and your wins could result in things like a price war, so I'm just curious, your take on it?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi. Good morning Alvin it is Alex here. Yes, we are - I think as we said quite a few times in the last 12 months, our partnership strategy is to really get deeply inside conversations with our partners to understand what they want from us, and it is not about price, only prices, it is also price and service on how we work together to really help them get their goals of creating better health outcomes. So we feel good about where we are now. We are in the very early stages of delivering these services to our pharmacies to TRICARE, and the first month is going well. And of course January 1st is a very important one for the extension of Med D and our new Prime networks, which again kick-in in Jan 1. ", "So there is no other place from our point of view. We got a very clear governance structure, we make sure that we stick to the pricing structure and with the market - is that not below the market, and that's very important to us. And we are working very hard to deliver existing customer care to the pharmacies to make sure we take care of the patients, our [indiscernible] given us had to take care of.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Thank you. I know this is a tough question, but in light of the new political climate in the U.S., what kind of changes for the operating environment you know things like the potential appeal of the Affordable Care Act, what are you planning for in your outlook, is there anything proposed out there that would change your way of thinking about the business?", "Stefano Pessina", "We really believe that we could start to work on hypotheses with information that we have. We have a lot of affirmation that will appeal the ObamaCare okay, but after they say yes, but maybe we have to give something similar. We have to create a transition. It\u2019s very difficult to understand what worked practically, the new administration will decide to do because for sure will try to do something sensible and rationale and they will start something, which will not be to the detriment of the citizens.", "So, it will take some time to start, probably the outcome will be quiet rationale and at that time we will be able to organize ourselves and prepare our business to respond to the new environment. We don't have to be taken by panic, just because the rules, mainly rules - the rules are changed. We have to wait for the changes and after rationally we will decide how to react without panicking.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Alright, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.", "George Hill", "Yeah. Hi good morning and thanks for taking the question. I guess Alex I wanted to talk a little bit about the U.S. business and the price versus volume trends you are seeing there a little bit, where you guys continuing to see volume up pretty comfortably on the Scripts side with dollar sales coming in below that? However, from a lot of the data that we look at, it looks like net price mix is still trending positively, so I guess can you talk about what are the factors that are driving the discrepancy where dollar sales are coming below script volume growth?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes sure George. I think that if you take it from our quarter-to-quarter, the differential for us is just under 3% as you really pointed. And we see really a couple of main factors George mentioned on the script. The first one is less inflation in branded drugs, that\u2019s pretty clear and that\u2019s our major chunk of it. The second one is volume. Volume in the market is down. So as you see we are doing pretty well in the market, 40 basis points open market share from what we measure, but overall the volume in the market is down in this quarter relative to the last quarter, and I think that's on top of that. And as you said, we have been pricing model competitively in some of our networks in preparation to drive volume as Stefano and George said in the second half of this year. And again that is the third element for us. So that really is the three elements that we see reimburse some pressure continuing, branded inflation de-accelerating a bit of volume decline in the market during this period.", "George Hill", "Okay that's helpful. And then maybe a quick follow-up. There\u2019s been a little bit of chatter in the market recently about the launch of some of the biosimilars, particularly on the pharmacy benefit side with wholesalers trying to take different tax around whether or not they will supply or carry these drugs, I guess how are you guys thinking about primary and secondary wholesaler relationships in general and kind of secondary source contracts if your primary vendor doesn't want to carry certain products or wholesalers all the sudden want to be more selective about products they want to carefully depending upon the economics they can generate from manufacturers?", "Alex Gourlay", "To be honest we have a great relationship with AmerisourceBergen and we, as you know we are very strong partners of particularly having both the second warrants. So from my point of view, we have direct conversations of how do we continue to make the supply chain more efficient, and that is a small part of the conversation, there is many more opportunities that we're speaking about today for tomorrow. So, to be honest, it really is not an issue we see as a big opportunity right at this point.", "George Hill", "Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Yeah, hi good morning. So a couple of questions. So first of all, obviously retail and pharmacy comps, soft across the industry yet did you raise the bottom end of the guidance, so what has changed since you guided that gives you more confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year?", "George Fairweather", "We're obviously very pleased to be able to raise the lower end of guidance by $0.05. This really reflects that we are now four months into the year that gives us a clearer view of our performance. You have seen that we have obviously delivered to expectations in the first quarter and we remain confident very much about our ability to deliver the numbers going forward, but I think when you actually look at the shape of the results you can see obviously, you know Alex has talked about the market, the volume issues and there has been questions about margins, but we delivered very strong cost controls, which is very much a key focus of us across all our divisions, and again you would have looked to the mix of the profits and the taxes has again helped us a little bit on the comparables.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Ricky is Alex here. So, there\u2019s only two things. First one, I\u2019ve spoken about already and we have seen in the first month of Tricare, and is on plan, and that gives us the confidence for the rest of the year, and we will see the first month of Prime that is already this month. Secondly, and I think equally important strategically we have seen all in going solid trends through our investments, particularly in beauty, wellness and health, capturing these on the front end, and you know we saw retail pharmacy operating margin, as you know step up as a result of our investments and our focus on environment service and differentiated products and differentiation is the key example we have.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay and then when we talked in the past, you talked about the vision of Walgreen is being kind of like the new retailer with lot of different wraparound service that will attract patients and consumers into the stores. I think you recently opened or are piloting a vision offering in one of your flagship stores, can you talk a little bit about what type of assets you are looking to add to your current offering and how it fits in with the recent partnerships that you signed in 2016?", "George Fairweather", "Sure. I think we have, we have got solid businesses in Europe, particular in all of the UK if you want send both optical and hearing care. So we have great partnerships in these businesses and we have partnerships with manufacturers that help us, so we have tested as you said, a pilot really in our flagship store in Chicago and that is really is to try and understand the market and how customers will react to that and will take decisions based on how that comes through going forward. So, these are two vision and hearing care, which clearly we could transport from our experience in Europe. ", "I think also we've been very successful in the last 12 months been able to outsource our retail clinics and again as a partnership model that we will speak about a lot and we have continued to sign deals and outsource these successfully with many partners across the Medicare, and again that\u2019s another way that we bring wraparound services and more patients into all regions by walking closely with local service providers, providing the services they want inside of a pharmacy across USA, that\u2019s an example of how we're thinking, how we're walking.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. You may begin.", "Lisa Gill", "Great. Thank you, good morning. George, I just want to start with a question for you, you talk about being back half driven and I think we heard you say that when you gave the initial guidance, but I\u2019m just curious as to how to think about the cadence and how do we think about going from Q1 to Q2, should it be a little more back half weighted than what you are currently seeing in the street, is that the message that we should be taking today?", "George Fairweather", "I think the message today is no different to the message we were certainly trying to give in the full quarter, sorry, in the full year results. The partnerships that we have been talking about it will - it takes time for us to build the volume and so when you are actually looking at relative numbers, our expectation is that as always been the earlier part of the year, relatively would be the tougher part. Then it will take time for us to build the volume to see the gross profit therefore in dollars and dollars come through from these, the new partnerships that we are also excited about. You should think of that in shape and really be thinking about as that of being a build across the four quarters and take the first quarter results as an indication of that and then think in terms of building.", "Lisa Gill", "And then my second question, and maybe I have misunderstood this, but I never thought of drug price inflation as being very important to the drug retail model, am I misunderstanding that, is there more than just that interim opportunity of capturing some level of spread as the price went up before the reimbursement changed or are there other inventory opportunities or something else because I did hear you call it today, less or moderating drug price inflation as being a little bit of a headwind?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi this is Alex. Sorry if I missed. The headwind to sales of either volume differential if you like. In terms of \u2013 it is a slight headwind to the retail business, but obviously it is a support to the wholesale business. So when it makes a big difference, but it doesn\u2019t make a difference in sales which is the question I was answering I think from Alvin earlier on.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay. And I guess if I could just slip in just one last one, and that\u2019s around utilization, you talked about increasing your level of market share, but yet you are seeing less utilization, do you have any thoughts around why that is and normally I know this is a quarter end in November, but we start to see pick up as people move towards the end of the deductible, are you seeing anything or have you seen anything in the December quarter that\u2019s shifted from what you have seen historically?", "Alex Gourlay", "No, the December quarter, I mean it is one so for, again this is a season, it is a season for, obviously for cough, cold and flu and illness, and as Gerald said, it is a bit around the table here this morning as well. So, I think we are seeing a more normal flu trend, which kicked in a bit later in the season than we had expected, but that\u2019s the only thing that has changed in December, which is going to be obviously a slight headwind, sorry a slight tailwind for us in the second quarter, but that\u2019s still early on and we will see what happens with the rest of the season.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. You may begin.", "Robert Willoughby", "Alright, what\u2019s a good assumption for what sale lease backs can contribute in cash over the remainder of the year? The first quarter was a bit higher than what we had thought and then secondarily any metrics on what the new store format is contributing for you?", "George Fairweather", "Okay if I take the sale and leaseback what I mean, we are continuing to look at sale and leaseback opportunities on a go forward basis. The timing of those is a little tricky to actually predict because we\u2019re very disciplined on the returns that we are looking for on the various transactions, but you should take it that it\u2019s something that we would continue to do going forward, but as I said those tend to be your individual transactions. It\u2019s hard to predict quarter-by-quarter, exactly when they are going to occur.", "Alex Gourlay", "I will take the second one. With regards to the new store formats, I mean the investment in the moment is to upgrade the whole state. So we have been upgrading at the whole state with a particular focus on beauty in our top volume stores, top 1,800 so far with more to come next year as George had said. We have got some pilots and test both in urban and what we are calling the lower volume stores, we call these opportunities stores, under the very early stages of testing and trying these out. And again we will update you when we followed in line, but the investment of this is to upgrade the whole state to make sure that we are give a more consistent - all these brand and offer across those and plus stock stores in the USA.", "Stefano Pessina ", "But I would like to assure you that the cash flow this year will be operating cash flow, would be very good, you expect a very good operating cash flow. Of course we have had the first quarter with a relatively low operating cash flow, but this is up against every quarter because of course we buy more stock for Christmas because we pay bond fees because we pay dividends that are mainly cash [indiscernible] in this period. And so in all of our stores, in the first quarter has been relatively modest in cash flow and free cash flow, but after it caught up during the year and we don't see any reason why this year should be so dramatically different from the previous year. Of course it depends on how we manage our investment, how we manage our leases, but substantially we don't have structural differences. So, it\u2019s - as always it is very difficult to analyze things quarter-by-quarter and to draw a conclusion adjusted from the last number.", "Robert Willoughby", "That's great, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. You may begin.", "David Larsen", "Hi. Can you please talk a bit about the billion dollars in synergies that you expect to capture from the Rite Aid transaction by year three or four, like \u2013 I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s $1 billion a year and then what makes up those synergies? And then how do you think about RAT earnings themselves versus cost synergies, is that billion dollars inclusive of both and then how do I tide this billion dollars back to $0.05 to $0.12 of accretion in year one? The $0.05 to $0.12 sounds very modest to me, so that\u2019s a lot, thanks very much. Appreciate it.", "George Fairweather", "Okay. So it is quite a few questions and hope I won't miss any. To start by saying that the first thing is that in terms of the accretion for this year, I think it\u2019s important to remember where we are. We\u2019re already four months into the year and when we complete transactions the first priority is always very much about focusing on the customers getting the key elements of everyone working together. And in terms of delivering synergies our approach to synergies as you saw the Walgreens Alliance Boots transaction is to have a very clear plan going and then build the synergies up over a ramp up, over a period of time, so we do things in a disciplined way that we can secure the synergies year-after-year. ", "So, we don't just go for quick wins and pay the price later. And we've got a good track record of doing that. Clearly, there are certain synergies that take time to access. So, on procurement for synergies for example it takes time to put in place new arrangements. We've got stock sitting on the balance sheet that needs to be sold through. So that is really reflective of the guidance that we have given for the balance of this year. In terms of the synergies themselves, key areas the billion will come from is starting with areas like procurement, where we\u2019ve got our sourcing operation on generics that sources products today both for ourselves and for Amerisource, so as Bergen is going to be that in sort of overhead cost savings that we will be able to deliver over time, but what the billion doesn\u2019t include, which is important to understand is that it doesn't include the opportunity that we would have two actually rationalize the portfolio where there is overlaps in existing large markets.", "And that\u2019s something that we would do separately and it\u2019s equivalent to [indiscernible] and that is outside the synergy numbers. What\u2019s also important in the number of the billion is that we are very disciplined in the way we measure and track synergies and the billion is the synergies that we are confident that we can are very clearly identifiable and quantifiable synergies that we can measure and track and report on because that delivery is very important. What one on always gets in transactions over above that is a lot of the less tangible measurable synergies, but these are the ones that over time really won\u2019t help deliver real long-term sustained shareholder value. The billion I say has a run rate just to be absolutely clear. It\u2019s what we expect to deliver pair item.", "David Larsen", "Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then how is, when we think about like Prime and Tricare and Express Scripts for this most recent quarter where the new prices and also co-pay and deductible plan designs in place at the start of the quarter? ", "Alex Gourlay", "It\u2019s Alex here. No, remember the first one I started was DOD in Tricare, we started on December 1 and Prime starts 1, 1, 2017, started 1, 1, 2017.", "David Larsen", "Okay, that's great. So then all of the new prices and the co-pay and plan design start on those dates right?", "Alex Gourlay", "Yes, correct.", "David Larsen", "Okay. Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. You may begin.", "Eric Percher", "To start, Alex did you just mention rationalization of the Rite Aid post acquisition and is that a important part of the \u2013 or a part end opportunity strategically following completion and approval of the transaction?", "Alex Gourlay", "These guys add sense to the field, so I didn\u2019t mention of it, George answered the question and I think we made no decision on this at all, let\u2019s be very straight about this. And this is not included in the 1 billion synergies that we have enhanced, that\u2019s what George said.", "Eric Percher", "So it will be looked at as a strategic effort.", "Alex Gourlay", "There is a possibility for sure, of course it is, but it is not in the 1 billion synergies and it is not currently in the plan, yeah.", "Eric Percher", "Okay.", "Stefano Pessina", "More generally, one we talk of \u2013 you know if we talk of mergers, we try to figure out, which is the potential level of synergies and we would wait with the elements that we have comparing say that there are stores in this case to us and thinking that at the end we would be able to unify the terms with the suppliers, you may as you need that we can reduce a certain function, a certain duplication and so reduce certain cost. So, we booked in place all the area, we know where we can reduce cost, but it\u2019s an exercise which cannot be precise because we don\u2019t know exactly the situation of the other company. We don\u2019t know exactly how these companies by today. ", "We don\u2019t know exactly which kind of contract they have with the PBM. When we will be in charge of the company we will analyze all these documents and of course we will be able to access a level of synergies which is much more precise. What does it mean? This means that the level of synergies that we are - have calculated in a relatively prudent way rationally prudent, I mean not rationally prudent way because of course we cannot run the risk, not to meet our target internally, so we take some contingency. And are not really, not all of them are really dependent on the number of off stores, I mean 500 stores move - 500 stores may have 10% more, 10% less. In reality, in the rounding, or which we have to calculate in synergies because we don\u2019t have a very clear understanding of what our counter party is because we cannot \u2013 the law doesn\u2019t allow us to share all the secrets of our due diligence is probably necessarily a superficial, relatively superficial due diligence. ", "So, in reality we will - one thing I can tell you that when we - whatever acquisition, whatever merger we find that the final synergies wider and substantially wider, substantially larger than the synergies that we have announced. And so today we shouldn\u2019t talk too much about the synergies that we would be able to view a precise the target and timing that too maybe we will have acknowledged what there is really in the company. But as we have calculated the synergies in the rationale way we believe that the number probably will be higher and not lower.", "Eric Percher", "So, I will come back to the rationalization at a point where we can all talk about it. So, maybe my original question was actually going to be volume, we\u2019ve talked a lot about this year\u2019s volume. As we consider commercial versus Part D where a lot of the growth has been, do we expect that commercial may actually be a greater contributor to growth in the second half and does that then extend over the next year or two where commercial pricing could be stable and give you a bit of an offset to the reimbursement pressure with the annually and Part D?", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi, it is Alex here, so it is - the truth of it is that reimbursement pressure is consistent and while Med D for sure is an annual contract that you see more regularly coming through, the pressure and the commercial pick up business is also strong, you know one does to some extend for the other. So, the market is a market, we are very clear in how we govern within the business and how we structure our pricing within the business. We do that both at the Walgreens level to myself and our Alan Nielsen, our FD and also the group level through Stefano and George. But the reimbursement pressure is real and we manage within the market. ", "So, I don\u2019t think you will see the upside to be really straight with you. In the future that you will see continuing reimbursement pressure and we are managing it through a combination of three, through more volume, through better partnerships, which we are very happy with the moment and are going well. Secondly, to increasing our retail gross margin and retail operating margin where we are seeing good GreenChill and have seen good growth in the last three years and that continues on good cost control.", "Eric Percher", "That\u2019s a straight answer, thank you.", "Alex Gourlay", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.", "Steven Valiquette", "Alright thanks, good morning everybody. So, it\u2019s interesting now that with some hindsight that Walgreens never ended up pulling the trigger around the international tax inversion phenomenon from a couple of years, even now you maybe in a position to benefit from a U.S. corporate tax reform, so just a couple of questions on taxes, I guess first over these past couple of quarters you seem to have enabled to get your tax rate down to levels that people are only dreaming about with this inversion created a few years ago, so kudos on that, but how should we think about your tax rate for the rest of fiscal 2017, and then second do you have any preliminary comments on the pros and cons of this potential U.S. corporate reform and what it might mean for Walgreens? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "I can answer on the second part of the question whether we have some ideas on the coming tax reform, I can repeat the same thing I said before, now there is not a project of tax reform there are certain principle, people are discussing about certain principle, not everybody in the administration agrees on the same principle and even if they are on the same principle they don\u2019t agree on the level on their quantity of the principles. So it\u2019s a waste of time today to start to create a scenario, which very likely would be in reality substantially different. So, let\u2019s see when we will have the frame of the tax and after we will start immediately to think how we can leave with these new environment. ", "In any case we will not have a new tax system tomorrow morning, it will take months and we will have time to see how this will shape over time and when we believe that we are close to a final shaper we will start to see how we can work, but even though having looked at the taxes - at the different principle that are now have been debated, yes, there are certain principle who could damage us, but there are other principle who could benefit us and it is clear that the principle who could damage us, who would damage all our peer and so the market will find another equilibrium and other assets. ", "So, at the end of today, the conclusion is that for the time being we have to continue to work with the rules that are in place today and probably one year or two year or three year, we will have to change if something, but now it\u2019s too early to distract how people - to do things, which should probably will never happen before the end, the mixture will be completely different.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay.", "Stefano Pessina", "The second part of your\u2026", "Alex Gourlay", "Yeah, but just commenting on the rates, as Stefano said, at the year-end we indicated our effective tax rate last year, I think it was around 26.3%, excluding the discrete tax items and we look at the calc excluding ABC equity income on an adjusted basis because it is the only easy way to do the math. This quarter, we\u2019ve come in around the 25.5%, so a little bit better. It is a function really of two things, the geographic mix which of course varies quarter-by-quarter and then the certain discrete items in an individual quarter, if your results, you know historic tax issues or other sort of discrete items that can have a little impact on the quarters-by-quarter\u2019s results. That mix really reflects the composition of profits across Walgreens with the lines recognizing, we\u2019ve obviously got profits from our international operations and we try and obviously organize our inter-group funding structure in efficient way from \u2013 from a taxation perspective and we obviously have sources, say profit outside the U.S. that benefit our rate, beyond that really not lot to comment on and Stefano has already covered the view of what may or may not happen in the future. But we seek - we are very focused on EPS and whether it is tax or whether it is up-funding cost, they get a lot of focus in our organization as well as adjusted operating income, along with cash flow, which Stefano also talked about to drive shareholder value.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. You may begin.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey guys, thanks for taking me in. So just wanted to talk about strategy, and I know Stefano you talked about acquisitions overseas, when we think about Rite Aid, what\u2019s the kind of Plan B if it doesn\u2019t get approved as we kind of get down to the end here, kind of in the U.S. business and does that speed up some of your thoughts oversees?", "Stefano Pessina", "We're working hard to have the deal approved and for the time being we don't want even to think of the fact that the deal could not be approved after so many months when we have given a lot of information and we have had a very good relationship with the people of the FTC and they have continued to ask information and we have continued to gain information and in reality we believe that if they have spent so much time asking self, and analyzing so many documents is because they want to understand the transaction, which is fine. So we are not thinking of a Plan B today. We don't have to distract people today, I can assure you that if I, let\u2019s say we had the big surprise that this wouldn't happen after we would have to sit down and decide what to do because there are many, many possible reaction to this, as you can imagine. ", "We would have to see what our counter party Rite Aid wants to do and see whether there are solutions or not, what are the other alternatives. In reality we would have money and we would use the money in the best interest of shareholders. We will continue to act rationally, we will not spend money in irrational way just as a matter of principle. We will analyze all the opportunities very quickly because I and more team of the people here are thinking in different ways of different scenario and analyzing many other things. ", "Then if we decide what to do we will communicate to the shareholder for what to do, but I can assure you that we will not have a, how could I say an historic reaction and we will not feel forced to do something at any cost, just to show that we are doing something. We will take stock of the money that we have and we will analyze very, very irrationally which is the best use of these money at that time for our shareholders.", "Scott Mushkin", "This does seem like you potentially could litigate depending on what happens, is that correct interpretation of what you said?", "Stefano Pessina", "Potentially, sorry, [indiscernible].", "Scott Mushkin", "Potentially litigate", "Stefano Pessina", "I can give you an answer like that. We don't - for the time being everything looks fine. So we don't go so far.", "Scott Mushkin", "Perfect. I wanted to move on to one last question and I appreciate the time. So Boots in the UK, the retail side of the business it sounds like it was slightly positive, but I think there were comments that maybe December got a little bit better, you know we were over in the UK it seems like it\u2019s discounting, was pretty significant in the front end of the Boots operations, so I was wondering if we could get a little bit more color on the retail side of Boots and what is going on there, thank you.", "Alex Gourlay", "Hi Scott it is Alex here. I think that as George said really clearly in the script two things, first of all environment in the UK has changed and summer is a big change to the retail environment in particular, which we are working within, so we've repositioned into our business and focused on rebasing our cost again and also focused on customer care. So, the good news is these plans are walking on as George said, we\u2019ve had a notable improvement in sales performance in through December as he said in his script. And again we are very much focusing back on our core business in a very clear way, the real challenges going forward, at the same for the retailers, which we are taking care of, we were very effective online on the channel model, which is working well, we have to obviously operate a cost level because obviously that does affect the margin slightly. And of course as George said in his script from December 1, you know the government is taking additional action and new action in fact on practice payments, which means more call back in terms of pharmacy which we are aware of and we've planned for, really planned against. So, we are feeling we are in a good position with a very strong business in a difficult environment and we're pleased with the progress.", "Scott Mushkin", "Alright thanks guys. Appreciate it, good luck.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gerald Gradwell for closing remarks.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you very much indeed everyone. That concludes our call today. Obviously as ever, if you have further questions please feel free to reach out to any member of the IR team, myself Ashish, Deborah, Jonathan or Patrick and we will look forward to seeing some of you during the quarter and if not talking to you all in the next quarter. Thank you very much indeed.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Gerald Gradwell, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Special Projects. You may begin.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. Hello, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer who will take you through the results as usual. Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance is also here and will join us for questions.", "You will find a link to the webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com.

Please see our latest Form 10-K for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. And we refer you to the Appendix in the presentation materials available on our Investor Relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information.", "In a second, I\u2019ll hand over to George to take us through the third quarter results. Stefano will then cover today\u2019s Rite Aid announcement in addition to his usual quarterly update. After the prepared comments, we will of course be happy to answer questions on both the results and on new Rite Aid agreement.", "I\u2019ll now hand you over to George.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Gerald. Overall, we are pleased with our progress this quarter with results in line with our expectations. As in the last quarter, we were particularly pleased with growth in U.S. pharmacy volume and market share. During the quarter, we also completed the $1 billion share buyback program which we discussed on our last earnings call. I'm also pleased that today, we have raised the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2017 by $0.08.", "So now let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter. As we expected currency again had a negative impact, the U.S dollar being 12.5% stronger versus Sterling than in the comparable quarter last year. Sales for the quarter were $30.1 billion, up 2.1% versus the comparable quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 5%. GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 5.3% and diluted EPS was $1.07, up 5.9%. ", "Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, up 5.5% and in constant currency was up 7.5%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 11.9% and in constant currency up 13.6%. These percentage increases were higher than for adjusted operating income. This was due to a lower tax rate, partially offset by losses on certain legacy investments which adversely impacted both earnings from other equity method investments and other income.", "Since the quarter-end, we have disposed of the legacy investment, the gain on which will largely offset these losses. The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate, excluding the adjusted equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 19.1%. This was lower than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to relatively high incremental discrete net tax benefits and a lower estimated core annual tax rate of 25.3%. All of this resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.33, up 12.7% and in constant currency up 14.4%.", "For completeness, here are the numbers for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. I will not go through those in great detail, but you will note that GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $3.02, up 4.9% versus the same period a year-ago. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $3.79, up 7.7% and up 9.9% on a constant currency basis.", "So let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $22.5 billion, up 6.3% over the year-ago quarter. This included two months of results from AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, a recently formed central specialty and mail services business. Comparable store sales for the division increased by 3.7%, adjusted gross profit was $5.7 billion, down 0.5% reflecting a decrease in pharmacy, partially offset by an increase in retail. We'll look at this in more detail in a moment.", "Adjusted SG&A for the division was 18.7% of sales, an improvement of 1.7 percentage points. This improvement was primarily due to sales mix and higher sales as well as an amendment to certain employee postretirement benefits and our cost transformation program. Adjusted operating margin was 6.5% in line with the comparable quarter last year, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, up 5.9%.", "So next, let's look in more detail at Pharmacy. U.S. Pharmacy total sales were up 10.3% versus the year-ago quarter, mainly due to higher prescription volumes, including mail and central specialty. During the quarter, we filled 255.2 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 8.5%. On a comparable basis for stores, which exclude central specialty and mail, pharmacy sales increased by 5.8% with scripts filled up 8.3%.", "In the second quarter, we reported our highest quarterly growth rate in over seven years. This quarter was even better. Growth was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships. Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics. This pressure contributed to lower pharmacy gross profit and gross margin.", "A higher proportion of specialty adversely impacted pharmacy gross margin by around 100 basis points. However, the higher specialty sales had a positive impact on gross profit. Our reported retail prescriptions market share on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.5%, up by approximately 110 basis points over the year-ago quarter. This was the highest market share that we have ever reported.", "Total retail sales were down 1.8% on the same quarter last year. This included the impact of the previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations. Comparable retail sales were down 0.4% with declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness, and beauty categories.", "Adjusted gross profit was higher, primarily due to mix and underlying margin improvement. Beauty category performance and beauty differentiation stores continues to be markedly better than in other stores, supported by strong sales growth of No7 and Soap & Glory.", "We have also continued to introduce new brands into our existing beauty differentiation locations, including Botanics, which I mentioned last quarter. We remain on track to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores by the end of the calendar year.", "This quarter as part of our strategy and ongoing cost transformation, we have also begun to implement a program in certain stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance. This is designed to deliver a better experience for our customers, provide ongoing efficiencies, and reduce working capital. In the coming months, we expect this program to reach approximately 1,500 stores.", "So now let's look at the results for the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $2.8 billion, down 0.2% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter. Comparable store sales increased 0.2% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.1% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to a decline in the UK.", "In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.4%, mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding. Comparable retail sales for the division increased 0.4%, Boots UK\u2019s comparable retail sales increasing 0.1%. Within this, beauty was Boots UK\u2019s strongest category, assisted by the launch of No7 Restore & Renew Face & Neck Multi-Action Serum.", "Adjusted gross profit for the division at $1.1 billion was down 1.2% in constant currency versus the year-ago quarter, mainly due to lower pharmacy gross margin. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was 0.7 percentage points higher at 34%, mainly due to inflationary pressures and higher variable payroll costs.", "Adjusted operating margin was 6.9%, down 1.1 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $193 million, a decrease of 14% again in constant currency. I am delighted to report that in April, the first Boots franchise store opened in South Korea. This is in line with our strategy of expanding Boots retail presence in Asia. South Korea is a highly sophisticated beauty market particularly for cosmetics, and it\u2019s strategically important for sourcing innovative products.", "So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.3 billion, up 2.7% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. Comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.7%. This was ahead of the Company's estimated market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with growth in emerging markets and the UK partially offset by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe.", "Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.9% down 0.1 percentage points on a constant currency basis, but in line with the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $253 million, up 53.1% in constant currency. Excluding adjusted equity earnings from ABC, adjusted operating income was up 0.6% in constant currency.", "So turning next to capital allocation. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.9 billion. During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $502 million. This primarily reflected improvements in inventories both in the quarter and year-on-year. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $273 million.", "We continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and U.S. beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we have previously talked about. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow in the quarter of $1.6 billion with a total of $4.3 billion in the year to date.", "Turning next to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We have raised the lower end of our guidance and now anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Remember this guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year.", "I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. I will turn first to the new Rite Aid agreement which we announced this morning. When we first began discussion with Rite Aid, it was with a vision of increasing our network and our population coverage. It quickly became clear that if we could start with the transaction appropriately, potentially greater benefit could be gained by bringing the two entire companies together through an acquisition.", "However, given the changes in the market that during the longer-than-expected Federal Trade commission review process and the ongoing uncertainty about the potential outcome, we have decided after detailed discussion with Rite Aid not to continue to review the acquisition of the old company.", "Instead, we have today announced the proposed purchase of 2,186 stores from Rite Aid together with warehouses and inventory to support those stores. While we are assuming the real estate obligation, we are not assuming any debt. In addition, the deal is also expected to give significant cash tax benefit, as we tax amortize the intangible assets we acquired.", "This transaction, though smaller than the original, is due to our original strategic aim and I believe simpler to deliver both operationally and financially. Overall, I view this deal as being more attractive than the transaction it replaces, recognizing the adjustments and compromises that we have had to make since the original deal was announced in what continues to be a challenging market for pharmacy.", "We expect that this new smaller deal will deliver synergies in excess of $400 million per annum within three to four years of the initial closing, and be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full-year after the initial closing. Importantly, the stores we are proposing to purchase are more than enough to create the potential opportunity for optimization of our expanded network and, in doing so, the opportunity to create greater efficiency above and beyond the synergies that deal is expected to deliver.", "In addition, the deal is structured in such a way as to offer opportunities for additional benefits over time. In constructing this new agreement, we have endeavored to address all the substantive regulatory points raised about the original transaction. We believe that this will enable us to complete the transaction in a timely manner and drive forward with our plans to further grow our Company.", "I am pleased to have once again being proved right in my firm belief that, as the English say, where there is a will, there is a way that two willing partners can despite adversity, find a deal that delivers true benefits for both. Given that significantly lower cost of the new transaction, I am pleased that today, we have been able also to keep our commitment to our investors that we will not maintain an inefficient balance sheet longer than is absolutely necessary.", "This is why we are planning to return the surplus cash that we are carrying on the balance sheet beyond that\u2019s required for the new proposed transaction to our shareholders through a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This is in addition to the $1 billion program, which we initiated and completed during our third quarter.", "On completion of this new program, we will resume our regular reviews of capital deployment; design it to ensure that excess capital, where appropriate, is used as directly as possible to improve shareholder value. Of course, today our new proposed transaction with Rite Aid is not our only news. As George said, we are seeing progress in many areas of our business in the quarter we are reviewing it today and this has been achieved in an environment when we have seen continued competitive pressure, challenging markets, and regulatory uncertainty.", "Naturally, there is nothing new in these, but it means we must remain focused to ensure our business is meeting the needs of the market and to maintain our stronger position. We are working with our strategic partners to maximize our own role in the healthcare system while at the same time providing the right services at the right price to support those partners in their task of being efficient and relevant.", "The merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance and the subsequent restructuring and realigning of our business was an important step in the process. As we are coming to a successful conclusion of that process of confirmation, we must look again at the Company to understand and identify the next course for us to make sure the business is the right structure, shape and size and with the right skills [indiscernible] truly the leader on the opportunities that change offers.", "Our proposed transaction with Rite Aid would form a partner of this but only part. We continue to see many opportunities, both inside the business and potentially outside with other strategic partners and other partnerships. We should be with no doubt that this is where my focus is.", "Working with my entire team to identify the next step for the business and ensuring whatever we do advances our place in the market is important for our customers and our strategic partner, delivers clear direction for our people and, of course, provides an attractive opportunity to deliver meaningful growth and create true value for our shareholders.", "It is obvious to us that the pressures on healthcare role and by extension pharmacy will continue. Within the healthcare market, we face the range of strong competitor. We each have our own business model. At times, that may give them certain advantages over us, but at other times, we believe it gives us meaningful strength and advantages over them. Managing our company for growth in these markets is a core role of the executive team, and we are never complacent about our position in the market or the competition we face, current and potential.", "Remember also that new participants in the market also provide the opportunity for new partnership and collaboration. Change brings opportunity as well as challenges. We continue to forge and to strengthen strategic partnerships that are delivering real benefits for our businesses today, especially in the U.S., where we are seeing volumes returning to our pharmacies and opportunities arising that enhance both our retail and healthcare offerings. These will open paths for us to new services with new sources of potential revenue and income over time.", "So as you have heard, overall, we believe it has been a recent report where some progress have been made. As a result, we are raising the lower end of our guidance for the year as a whole. We do, however, continue to experience some very challenging markets. And as I've said, we expect these challenges to continue and these may possibly difficult in the months and years to come. We are completing a phase of our business where we were very much focused on driving the optimum benefit from the merger that created the Walgreens Boots Alliance.", "In this phase, we have delivered far more both in terms of efficiencies and cost than we had originally anticipated. While we continue to careful and methodical work to drive efficiency and excellence across our business, we are beginning to look at the next phase of the evolution of our company. We believe this next phase will mainly be focused on Walgreens and on the structure and merchandising of our retail operation which will be intended to deliver further savings and create real value from within the business.", "Building on the sound corporate discipline we are exercising, the exceptional presence we have across the world and the ability that gives us to reach people at that time and place convenient to them, we have an excellent opportunity to be a cornerstone in the healthcare system we work within and a cornerstone of the communities we serve.", "As you have heard from George, we have opened our first Boots franchise stores in South Korea, and we continue to look to expand the geographic presence of our business including increasing our presence in Asia, particularly China, with more of a focus on retail in these markets than we have had up to now.", "It is all too easy to allow the reasonable and important focus on quarterly performance as a measure of progress to distract us from our longer-term opportunities, but I am confident in my belief that the challenges we face along the way are more stepping stones than obstacles to the longer-term growth of our Company in the months and years ahead.", "I will now hand you over to Gerald, so that we can answer any questions you may have. Thank you. Now, I will hand you back to Gerald.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, Stefano. I'd now like to ask Candace, our operator, to open the lines for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "Elizabeth Anderson", "Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross today. Congratulations on the deal that you announced today. And I was just wondering if you could talk about one the \u2013 sort of the profit profile of some of the stores that you are looking to acquire and the attraction of that subcategory of stores. And then, two, more generally speaking, could you talk a little bit more about some of the additional partnerships you guys have been considering and sort of the assets that you guys bring to the table and what sort of things you think might be particularly helpful? Thanks.", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Elizabeth. Good morning, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes, the profit profile first of all of the stores we\u2019re acquiring is more or less the average profile of Rite Aid, maybe slightly less, but more or less the same, and also the same investment profile you know that\u2019s already have been investing well in their wellness format and again these stores have got the same profile as the stores that we\u2019re retaining. So we feel pretty good about that.", "And they\u2019re mainly doing [filling][ph] in the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and the Southern, Eastern regions to give us more presence in these regions and pretty obviously, as the service of Walgreens over time can get to customers and patients in these areas. So we feel good about that core of stores we\u2019re acquiring. We think they are good value for us and it will really, really improve our network particularly in the regions that I mentioned.", "In terms of partnerships, I think we \u2013 you also yesterday saw we announced our partnership with LabCorp which we\u2019re really pleased with, seven store trials called LabCorp at Walgreens and adds on to the partnerships that we've announced in the past particularly with clinics across the many healthcare systems in the U.S.", "And how we see this working both from a space usage point of view, a convenience [Indiscernible] through our pharmacy and then linking into the various IT systems and technologies that we have. We really see this will drive not just cost reduction for us, but real convenience and access for customers and ultimately of course more volume descriptions for us over time in more healthcare and pharmacy services.", "We\u2019ve made good progress in the last couple of years with the strategy. There's more to come and as long as it fits from a customer point of view next to our pharmacy and as long as it makes sense to reduce the costs in the healthcare system, we will continue to test and trial and roll out these services.", "Elizabeth Anderson", "Perfect, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Yes, good morning. Thank you. So Stefano, you talked about looking at kind of the next phase of the evolution of the Company and it sounds like partially it's focused on the retail side and merchandising, but also on the healthcare side. So can you talk a little bit about \u2013 give us more color on how you think of expanding Walgreens role in the delivery of healthcare? And are you thinking about it from a partnership model similar to what you signed with LabCorp \u2013 what you announced with LabCorp yesterday or are you also kind of considering opportunities where you can deploy capital, especially when we think about kind of like the whole concept of vertical integration that\u2019s discussed in the marketplace?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, I have spoken of a second phase of development in our company. We see when we merged, of course our focus was on synergies, and our focus was on cutting cost. And as you have seen, we have been consistent with what we were saying and we have really achieved the level of synergies and the level of cost reductions substantially earlier than promised. And at the end of this year we will have for sure better numbers then even we were expecting.", "So now as I said many times, the integration of the Company and the improvement of a new Company go through different phases. Now, we have done the first phase and we have other phases and in each phase that we will be able to reduce cost and probably to find additional synergies.", "For the time being we have rationalized the Company. We have gone through the most evident cost reduction that we could see. We have improved our procurement and we have tried to buy better or to exploit the possibilities that we had due to our scale and our geographic expansion.", "And now we have to go back and refine the work that we have done and of course now our focus will be mainly on Walgreens and mainly on the stores. Of course, we have done important things in the stores, we have improved the supply chains, we have changed or started to change the mindset of people focusing more on the customers we have started to collect information and data on our customers in order to understand better what they wanted and what we could do for them.", "And now it's time to put all these things together and to reorganize our stores in that direction. We have to understand exactly which kind of categories are really of interest for our customers because it's not particularly useful to us a bit of everything if people are not really appreciating it.", "And so we said that we are really focusing more on beauty, on health and beauty particularly and so we have started as you have seen, now we have started to rollout more products, we have started to test many models, but now it\u2019s time to really go back and really put in act - put in the stores, so, all the experience that we have done in these two years and these will be the focus of the second phase of the development.", "Part of this, for sure, is the logic of having other players with us in our stores, because we have space, we will get more space with the rationalization of the stores and we have to use this space for trying to give a better experience to our customers. And so that we have trialing many different partnerships and most of those trials have been successful and we have to hold them out over time.", "The combination of these two things will give a new look to our stores, which is what we need and what we had really what was really in our strategy from the very first moment, but we had to create the platform, the basis in order to build these transformation of the stores. And after we will have another phase, a third phase, which will be based on technology. We are making big investments, big efforts in updating \u2013 upgrading our technology.", "We will have a completely new system in a few years, maybe few years in the next I would say, many months. And at that point, we would be able to make another jump in the organization of our stores and this will be the third phase. This is exactly what we told you, I would say from the very beginning or at least in the last two years and this is the program that we are following. Alex, do you want to add something?", "Alexander Gourlay", "No, I think I\u2019m really pleased \u2013 just one that\u2019s \u2013 I think it was mentioned in the prepared remarks. We're really moving into phase beyond the beauty differentiation phase of simplifying the core offer and we\u2019re just trying to roll out up to 1,000 stores by the end of this year.", "So it\u2019s another important step in the Phase II as Stefano described. So this is very active. It's very real in the business, and we continue to drive that model forward. And the idea of this one really is to simplify these stores and specially extend that customers can find products more easily and we can edit the products on their behalf using the data that we have been collecting in the last three or four years. So we're not slowing down here. We're actually speeding up is the main point I want to add to Stefano\u2019s description of the activity.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "Okay. And just one follow-up on the guide. One is for the guide for the rest of the year and the other one within the context of this comments, how should we think about the growth algorithm going forward? So for the guide for the remaining quarter, does the increased guidance include the buyback program and are you going to see any benefit from taxes next quarter?", "And then when we think kind of like longer term to 2018 and beyond, do you think that given kind of like the competitive environment in the marketplace, but also your efforts to kind of like simplify the offering and sounds like potentially maybe narrowing the SKUs, do you think that you can sustain double-digit EPS growth now that you know what the Rite Aid deal would look like?", "George Fairweather", "Okay, I\u2019ll try and take some of those in the right order. If I start, perhaps, with just the tax, as I said in the prepared comments, the core tax rate was 25.3% and then this quarter if you look back historically, we had a relatively high number of discrete positives clearly very significantly quarter-by-quarter as you can see going back historically.", "And as I say you can see this was a relatively high number, but I think in terms of the core tax rate and helping you with the model, the 25.3% that you see it today is clearly under U.S. GAAP or the rate that we would anticipate at this point for the core tax element for the full-year. Just in terms of buyback program, clearly, we've announced the program just today.", "And I think \u2013 and just in thinking about modeling, clearly, we\u2019re pretty well the end of June now, so we\u2019ve really only got a couple of months to go to the year-end. So there's not really long for any impact where we to choose to commence that program, any impact will be relatively modest. Obviously, our guidance as ever is all in, but again as I said in the prepared comments it is of course assuming currency exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year.", "Alexander Gourlay", "This is Alex here. We are confident from an operational point of view that we can get to that number at the end of the year and continue to drive the strategy that Stefano described so clearly. So you\u2019ll see through our numbers, the volume in pharmacy continues to be as we expect it, strong as the partnerships and we made a slight improvement, but an important improvement in the underlying sales growth in the front end and the margin in the front end continues to be accretive year-on-year and cost control is good. So we remain confident that we can get that done.", "Gerald Gradwell", "If I could just, again, ask people to speak up and speak clearly when they're asking the questions, we can\u2019t answer questions, we can\u2019t here properly. Thank you, next question.", "Stefano Pessina", "I would add something. What we are trying to do at the end, we said from the very beginning, our aim is to keep the adjusted operating margin as healthy as possible. And you have seen that in spite of all the difficulties of the market. Over the last years, we have been successful in doing that and we hope that we will continue to be able to do this. There are many ways in which you can derive the numbers and the success of a company and we are really focused on these metric.", "We know that there are always additional opportunities to buy better additional opportunities to be more efficient and not just to cut costs for the sake of cutting cost, but to be more efficient. And so we accept that the market is a very challenging market that we have worked in challenging market for decades. We know that this will be our environment in future and as we have done for the past, we will really try to compensate and to respond to the challenges of the market through other actions that we can implement and we have always implemented successfully.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Lisa Gill", "Hi, great. Good morning and thank you. Stefano, you talked about challenges and opportunities and talked about different new partnerships that will come about, obviously there's been a lot of talk about Amazon and then potentially getting into the pharmacy market? Do you view that as a potential opportunity to Walgreens or a potential challenge as we move forward?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, let's say that I see everything as an opportunity and not because I am an optimist, but just because we have demonstrated in the past that we can survive in an environment. Having side so, honestly I don't believer that Amazon will \u2013 the interest in the near future in the next few years in these market, because they have so many opportunities around world and in many other categories, which are much, much simpler than healthcare which is very regulated business and also it's a business which in industry where the consolidation has been really quite significant.", "So there is not a lot of new things that they could do, of course they could. But not so many as they could do in other markets, so as they are a very good team and very rational team, I believe that at the end this will not be their priority. Having said so, if we were wrong and our belief was wrong, I believe that at the end of the day, we could find our goal in the new environment and we wouldn\u2019t exclude to partner with them, we wouldn\u2019t exclude to analyze the new situation of the market and to find our place adapting ourselves.", "So honestly I have seen the emotional reaction about the move that Amazon has done with Whole Foods, but I have found these reaction as I said emotional and with all due respect not rational, because if you analyze things accordingly, you will see that this is not the best opportunity for Amazon and you would see that the market has changed so many times in the past and the big players in this market have survived. So better luck we will continue to survive in any case.", "Lisa Gill", "Great. And then my second follow-up and I agree with you and I think that a lot of prescriptions sell today are Medicare Part D, and I think that's where my follow-up question is for Alex. As we think about bringing on the new 2,186 stories from Rite Aid, does that help to strengthen any of your Part D preferred networks, number one. And number two, I know it's really early to think about Part D networks as I'm sure the negotiations are going on right now, but do you anticipate many changes for 2018?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Obviously, yes. I think, clearly, having more pharmacies in certain markets will improve access for Medicare D for sure and that\u2019s something that we contemplated in terms of the partnerships we have. So this makes us slightly more attractive. I don't think it fundamentally changes the prices paid to be honest. It just makes us more attractive in certain markets, all will certainly help.", "In terms of the market itself, we continue to have strong partnerships, which you see that much of our volume beyond the new partnerships with the Prime and Express Scripts have been driven by Med D this year and we continue to operate well in that market with a target from three or four years ago.", "There has been some changes and that will continue to occur and we'll continue to govern these changes properly to make sure that we are paying within the prices that we think is right for the service that we provide. So we remain very confident about our position in the marketplace, very confident about the prices we have and continue to govern what we get paid as best we can under the reimbursement pressure that Stefano has described.", "Lisa Gill", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open.", "Michael Cherny", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for the details so far. So I want to dive a little bit into further the U.S. Retail Pharmacy gross profit. As you think going forward, when you talked about the reimbursement pressures, can you maybe just qualitatively give some sense of what could be some positive contributors to gross profit dollar growth within the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and then versus the reimbursement change we have now? What could be some additional headwinds that you could expect to see I guess over the next one, two, three maybe five years even?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Michael. Yes, it\u2019s Alex here. So I think as George said in his prepared remarks, we are in the early stages of our new relationship with Rx Alliance Walgreens Prime and that will be accretive in terms of dollars over time. Although, as we all know, specialty is a high-sales and low-percent margin business, but that will be accretive and it's a very important market in the U.S., and we're pleased with the progress made, although it's very early days in this partnership, but you will have noted that we were able to win the FEP contract as one example of the attractiveness of this new model in the marketplace.", "In terms of other gross dollar opportunities going forward, it is more difficult to see in the network side of the stage to be honest, there's more headwinds, as you can see in the Retail Pharmacy gross profit. As Stefano said quite clearly, we\u2019re used to living with these headwinds, and our strategy here has been very clearly to do three things.", "One is to increase our volume to make better use of our network. Secondly is to improve our buying capability, which again you can see very clearly. And also thirdly is to really make sure that we work with other healthcare services to improve the overall gross profit dollars we\u2019ve got. And the major aim of all of these activities is to make sure that we focus on the bottom line. The operating profit at the end of the day is, I think is the most important to us.", "So that\u2019s how see it and I think we see that continued pressure, more headwinds and tailwinds, and we continue to work all these levers to improve our operating profit and you\u2019ll see in this quarter, we improved our operating profit in the U.S. by [6%] as, I think, as one example of it.", "Michael Cherny", "Excellent. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Steven Valiquette", "Hey, good morning. Just congrats on the new deal with Rite Aid. A quick question really, just simply, is that just given the lengthy FTC review of the original proposed Rite Aid merger; it\u2019s safe to say that you're now obviously pretty familiar with these specific hot-button topics at the FTC. But when you do look at the store maps in the Rite Aid slides, it does look like the stores you're trying to buy do still seem to have a decent amount of overlap with existing Walgreens stores at least on a state-by-state basis.", "So I guess I'm just trying to think here should we assume that the new plan takes into account feedback from the FTC such that you're highly confident in a shorter FTC review for the new asset purchase or could this still be a battle with the FTC even for the new plan? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "Okay. So General Counsel, who might answer that, okay.", "Marco Pagni", "Yes, hi, good morning. We should assume that we have taken a kind of specific feedback from the agency that we have received over the last 22 odd months in formulating store package that we have agreed with Rite Aid and \u2013 but beyond that I wouldn't care to express any level of confidence one way or another as to how the transaction will proceed, obviously the matter is before the regulator. But I can tell you that we have designed it in a way, which has been very carefully thought through with Rite Aid with our consul to take a kind of all the feedback that we received during the last 22 months of a very detailed review process.", "Stefano Pessina", "Alex, do you want to comment on the question of the overlap and whatever else?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Yes, as I said before, operationally we really like the spread of these stores. They really give \u2013 we get in some new markets locally, we are able to really intensify our presence for patients and customers in these markets. And of course once we get into the next phase will understand more how we can really operationalized and make the whole areas more efficient, but I think we\u2019ve agreed operationally with the coverage in these new markets.", "Stefano Pessina", "It\u2019s Stefano here. Yes, as we said initially, we were thinking of buying a certain stores and after discussing with I think I am talking off two years ago of course. We decided that the best outcome for both company was to go to a merger. And we were thinking at the time of course and following the advice of the specialists that the merger could go through without major issues. These are not being the case, at a certain point that we have actually a good deal in order to address some concerns of the FTC.", "Also these new deals if they can \u2013 as you have seen a lot of time and at the certain point, we have decided that to get this variety that to go back to the old idea and to buy a certain number of stores. Of course in doing that we had \u2013 and we have to take into account and then needs of both companies. So because if the Rite Aid sell \u2013 decide to sell certain stores. They have to do eat in a way that the remaining company can be efficient and can overall take into account the money that they will receive overall can be better than before.", "And from our side we have to buy those stores, which are feeling certain gap that we have in our network. And in other cases are strengthen our position in other states. So this has been a thoughtful let's say deal as Marco said taking to account all the objections that we could imagine from the FTC. This is just an asset deal, but also taking that into account that our needs and the needs of Rite Aid because they have to come out from this deal as a stronger company.", "And we have selected a cluster of stores in certain states where we needed them. But we could not really cover all of our gap because these would have left Rite Aid in a situation which operationally would not be particularly efficient. So this is really the best possible deal between our two companies and I strongly believe, strongly believe that this is a deal, which is a very good for us because we get probably 70% \u2013 80% of what we wanted as national coverage and is very good for Rite Aid because they come out from this deal as a stronger company and with a company which can be very efficient operationally.", "Steven Valiquette", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Charles Rhyee", "Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just curious about also just staying with the FTC issue and in terms of some of the concerns they might have had leading up to today's announcement. I understand what you're saying in terms of this is more of a simple asset deal, but if I miss \u2013 you've giving them an option to buy generic drugs through WBAD and it looks like from the Rite Aid slides for a period of 10 years? Can you talk about how the FTC might view that kind of more strategic alliance on the purchasing side? And you think that perhaps presents a different kind of hindrance? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "Marco?", "Marco Pagni", "Yes, Charles, this is Marco Pagni here again. We\u2019re not able to comment on how the FTC may or may not see any particular facet of this transaction. But I would say is that it - it's important that the Rite Aid going forward be competitive in the market and clearly it's an option to join our procurements vehicle, WBAD will help it, but that\u2019s cost of goods going forward, which we believe is important for its competitive position in the market, and I express the view as to how the FTC will see that, but one could imagine that might be important for them.", "Stefano Pessina", "And in any cases, it's an option, so they can exercise it or not. So it is not a mandatory part of the deal.", "Charles Rhyee", "Great. And if I could just follow-up one other question with Alex, you talked in the beginning about stores with the new beauty differentiation having \u2013 doing better? Can you give us a sense in terms of comparison to the stores that have not the restructuring in that sense, what the differential in performance might be?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Charles. No, I think as we stated in markedly better particularly expects in beauty and especially driving the beauty category very well in the stores. So we are pleased with the performance of beauty. It\u2019s really coming through quite strongly. We can imagine the beauty is still a relatively I wouldn\u2019t say small, but it's not as big a part of our business for example as a consumable side of a business. We are continuing to refocus on a more profitable promotions and refocus on seasonal lines which end-to-end actually loses money and taken in from our ranges.", "So I think you have to look at the whole mix. So we are very confident that's why we're rolling it to another 2000 stores. We're also very confident in our partnerships with other companies, for example next has been rolled out that's a L'Oreal brand. It\u2019s a very good brand growing right now is well into the Beauty differentiated stores.", "And we continue to see a lot of customers signing up to a Beauty Enthusiast Cards. So again the whole model that\u2019s driving forward and we continue to see the growth coming in beauty that we had hoped to see. So that's where we are and I think obviously will more news as we get deeper into the state and as we get more grand and more beauty customers getting more interested in doing more of their beauty shopping in Walgreens.", "Charles Rhyee", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Eric Percher", "Thank you. Stefano, I want to return to your comment on this transaction being more attractive than the original deal, if we look at the cost per store, it's much lower that would seem to be a clear benefit. The amount of debt you'll issue and I'd be curious to what extent the fact that you have a lower leverage in your ability to execute on the strategy that come next plays a role in that that observation that it's more attractive.", "And then last as we look at I think you just said recently 70% to 80% of national coverage, how much of the benefit is achieved via coverage and the ability to offer your partners more coverage versus the density needed to obtain operating efficiencies and synergies from the stores?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, on the deal, yes I said that this is a more attractive deal not because the other deals were bad, the other deals were good and we believe the other deal. But of course, after we have to make a lot of compromises and at the end of the day the deal were different from the deals that we had in mind.", "So this deal, it\u2019s much simpler. It's an asset deal, so it\u2019s less controversial \u2013 much less controversial. We don't take practically any liability. You can imagine that as part of the deal we have just talked and we have the tax savings that we will find amortizing the goodwill at least cash wise.", "If you think that the amortization of the goodwill is on 2,000 pharmacies practically and the inventory is on 2,000 pharmacies plus, three quite big warehouses you will see that we have a strong cash element in this deal already there. So it\u2019s clear that economically and thinking of the IR, this deal is very good.", "On the other side, this is not a bad deal. I believe not at all, it's a good deal also for Rite Aid because at the end we don't have to give any part of the value to third parties. So in reality, the two parties are better off. And about our coverage, well, it's very important that we have a complete coverage. We were relatively weak on the East Coast. So this was our main objective particularly in the Northeast because it's a very rich region and it\u2019s a region where it's relatively easy to work. So this was our main thoughts. We would like to have a few 100 stores more on the West Coast.", "Yes, of course, we would like it even though we are present there, but there are certain spots of Southern California and maybe the State of Washington where we would like to have a more stores. But at the end of the day, our presence there is already better than the present that we had in the Northeast.", "So if we had to choose by far we prefer to be stronger now and very present in the Northeast, even because as you know California is not an easy state for us and for everybody to work in the healthcare. So I believe that we are very happy what we have achieved and it's important that we have this coverage because it's important to be able to offer a wide coverage to our customers. And it's also important for us because we have a better basis to amortize our cost and we have a better basis to sell our products. Alex?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Eric. At this point of coverage being the operating efficiencies, there\u2019s both, but I would say there is probably more in the operating efficiencies side. Again, if you think of all we\u2019ve achieved with Walgreens and also think of the ambition as Stefano described very well in an earlier question to simplify and make the front end more efficient and more differentiated. Once we have done that in the first phase of IT simplicity, we'll be able to plug-in all these stores into that platform. So I think there\u2019s a lot to go at in the operating efficiencies probably more than the coverage site in reality.", "Eric Percher", "So that said George, I'm surprised there's not more than modest accretion. Are you assuming any inventory write-downs or other elements that will weigh on that and how should we think about the synergy buckets here?", "George Fairweather", "I think in terms of the accretion, what we said is modest accretion in the first full-year and I think that's important to take away and we\u2019re very clear on the synergies that we can deliver the $400 million over three to four years. We've got a very clear path to delivering it. And I think one of our approaches to acquisition integration is one where we have very detailed plans. We take it in a very structured way, so that we do things smoothly.", "We are going to be obviously \u2013 actually acquiring those stores over a period of time as we've explained in the announcement and then we will be rebranding those over time to Walgreens, bringing in the Walgreens offer. And that is not something that we would ever dream of actually big banging. We need to do it properly so that we have the customer proposition is delivered in a consistent way as we do the rebranding.", "So we're very confident about the returns, but what's important is to go in a straight line and do in a way where we keep the focus on the customer as we integrate the business on the service that we provide our patients rather than sometimes which you see, dare I say, I see in other businesses do, where they rush things and they don't execute properly. And I think you\u2019ll have seen that consistently as with the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots, I think you'll see we've got a very clear track record of doing that over time.", "Stefano Pessina", "And you\u2019ll see the main important thing, looking at the accretion, is that we will ramp up over time the transfer of the stores and in the first year we will have \u2013 it will be at a certain extent, the most complicated year, because we will have to start to do this transfer. And we have said that the transfer will take a certain \u2013 probably two, three years, it cannot \u2013 if we want to do it in an orderly fashion, if we want to do it without disruption, if we want to keep the value what \u2013 at the end we will have both, we have to do like that.", "On the synergies, we have said that we would have at least $400 million of synergies, of course as you know and as we have always done in the past, when we give a number for the synergies, we take into account all the elements we are practically sure or very, very confident. But over time, the experience tells us that we find other synergies and as you have seen we have \u2013 in the past at least we have exceeded what we were expecting, because we cannot see all the potential synergies today until we don't understand exactly the nature of the stores that we will have both.", "Remember that for the time being, we don't have the full set of numbers about on those stores. And so we cannot see exactly which kind of synergies we can achieve and we have just taken the basic synergies that we are quite confident about.", "Eric Percher", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Robert Jones", "Great. Thanks for the questions. Alex just wanted to go back to the U.S. business, and I know this is the same case last quarter, but can you just help us understand a little bit better how despite the really strong script growth you've seen in the last two quarters that gross profit dollars were actually down again in the U.S. business? And I guess more importantly, is there a timetable that you're thinking about as far as an inflection in gross profit dollar growth in the U.S. business?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Robert, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes, I think all the drop year-on-year, as George said in his prepared remarks about 100 basis points was due to specialty. So, there for the trend on the two quarters as you pointed, it\u2019s about the same that you ask a little bit worsening, but not significantly worse.", "And as I said already in another remark, we are really focused on operating margin. So therefore we drive \u2013 operating margin by driving volume through the fixed \u2013 primarily fixed cost base. And again I wanted a big call, it\u2019s a teams who have handled that volume and the cost base, as you see has been almost flat in reality, giving a 6% more growth in the USA in this quarter.", "So I think that's the model that we spoke about it before that\u2019s the model that we've been executing, recognizing, as I\u2019ve said consistently the reimbursement pressure is really \u2013 and what's driving really is market condition the consolidation really of the PBMs in particular. The downward pressure on pricing and that's a real effects that we're seeing with less inflation on branded drugs and that\u2019s clearly featured the marketplace this year in particular and we continue to see that going forward.", "Now we were used to this as Stefano said and we used to managing in a certain way and we're pleased with the progress of our cost of goods. The WBAB organization continues to perform well for us and we set a new partnership there with Express we announced in May.", "We continue to work on the cost base and the structure of the company and where Stefano said already we're moving into Phase II there and we have more opportunities there and we continue to work in partnership to make sure that we get the volume into that fixed cost base in the future. So that's our focus. It would be wrong we tell you that I see a time in the future, when I see that the reimbursement pressure going away from its current levels as the market and we are operating an effective to be within our marketplace.", "Robert Jones", "Okay. That's fair. And then I guess George, if you look at where the company will be post this transaction, I think it looks like maybe somewhere in the 3.5 times, leverage ratio on a rent adjusted basis is factoring the buyback as well? Can you just maybe share what the long-term leverage target is that you're comfortable with post the transaction?", "George Fairweather", "We've not published our long-term leverage target. We've chosen as you know Robert to talk about our commitment to solid investment grade and that\u2019s very much what our policy as we've obviously because of the time is taken since the original announcement of the original Rite Aid transaction we've obviously been building up a lot of cash, which is not something that we like doing we're very committed to having an efficient balance sheet. We have to do and that\u2019s why today when we've announced the new transaction, we've been probably announced the $5 billion share buyback program.", "So we're very committed to being financially disciplined to when we're looking at M&A we\u2019re always very focused on the numbers. If the numbers don't add up, don't give meet our investment hurdles then we're very disciplined, we don't do transactions and so we're very happy to grow organically and invest with to do M&A when we get the right returns, but equally a very clear policy of returning any surplus funds to shareholders within those parameters that I've explained, having an efficient balance sheet very important to us.", "Robert Jones", "Great, thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Ross", "Hi, this is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. Congrats on the record script growth again for the second consecutive quarter. My question is more when you're looking at these Retail Pharmacy contracts and networks as they come up and keeping in mind your goal to continue boosting volume through the stores? Do you get the sense that conversation with health plans or in payers are shifting more to these preferred networks like Prime and Tricare, are you actively pursuing these type of networks moving forward?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Bryan it\u2019s Alex. I would say it's mixed. I mean I think so first of all nothing is fundamentally changed year-on-year in the marketplace from what we're seeing. Some peers prefer preferred networks and some preferred to have open access across the networks. So I don't think there's anything fundamentally changing. There's certainly a trend towards more preferred networks over time, but that\u2019s more accelerated or decelerated and we are in the marketplace.", "We look at every partnership to understand what the payer requires of us and what we can bring to them and then we work through the government processes, which are very tight in the business, what is that we expect to be paid in the current marketplace for the services that we provide.", "So we \u2013 that\u2019s how we see it on the \u2013 it\u2019s very active for us, a very important part of our business and we try very deeply to understand what the marketplace and what the payers want from us and we're not trying to drive in any direction. We try and drive customer care and access and as such really our strategy.", "Bryan Ross", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey, guys. I just wanted to poke on a couple of things. Just want a clarification and then I want to poke on a couple of things. So I think it was referenced that there was a change in the postretirement benefit that benefited costs. If you guys could tell us how much that was and then whether that\u2019s one time that would be really helpful?", "Marco Pagni", "The postretirement changes is one of the \u2013 a number of changes that we are doing as we look to make sure that we have a clear remuneration policy that for all our employees that this was the change that affected our relatively small population of employee. So it's really part of an ongoing program. We're very focused on \u2013 in all aspects of compensation as well as all aspects of cost base. You'll see when the Q comes out later today that there is a change in the provision of $109 million, so you'll see that number in the detail of the Q.", "Scott Mushkin", "So $109 million is that ongoing or is that a one time benefit for the quarter?", "Marco Pagni", "Our $109 million changed in the provision, but clearly in terms of the benefit going forward, there will be a benefit going forward in relation to this. But clearly we've been doing a lot of work on looking at our base remuneration for our employees in our stores, so we're seeing rising costs in those areas for all the right reasons.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay. Then the second thing I want to talk about obviously with the deal that's been announced, just going through some of the HHI analysis from back when you guys did the original deal. And just kind of curious in your Salisbury, Maryland, the HHI index goes almost close to 4,000 and I assume that's maybe one of the markets. But I mean there is other markets that jump well into the region. I\u2019m just trying to get my arms around why this isn\u2019t going to be a problem. It seems to me a lot of these markets, when you look at Buffalo, New York, you look at some of these markets, the HHI index is going really high?", "Marco Pagni", "Yes, Scott. It\u2019s Marco again. HHI index, Herfindahl Index are pretty old technology for the FTC. So I'm not sure that are particularly focused on that as a measure at all. And as I said before, we spend 22 months with the agency, we have a pretty clear ideas to where they're concerned about overlaps and where they're not.", "Scott Mushkin", "So like a Bangor, Maine, where you're going to be 60% share, they are not concerned on that?", "Marco Pagni", "As we said, Scott, we\u2019re pretty sure that we understand whether they are concerned and whether or not.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay. Then my final question just has to do with something that came up earlier in the call just in transitioning from kind of streamlining the operation to kind of transforming it and then looking at the pressure on gross profit dollars. How should we look at your earnings or your EBIT algorithm in the U.S. as we move out over the next year or two? I mean it seems like it's going to struggle to grow, but I want to get your take on that and then I\u2019ll yield? Thanks.", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, as we have said many, many times, we are not living in an environment where we will see a lot of goals and particularly where we will see margin going \u2013 gross margin going up. We accept these and we work on other part of the business, on other elements of the profit or loss in order to compensate for it. This is what we are trying to do what we have down and what we will continue to do.", "So if you want to say that there are in these markets \u2013 certain headwinds, of course there are. But this is the nature of the business and we have to cope with it and we have to work on the elements that are available to half and believe us that are available to us to compensate for it, which we have done until now and we continue to do.", "Scott Mushkin", "Thanks very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Thanks for taking my question. I know earlier you had talked about the deal closing a lot of gaps in your coverage. But you have plans to divest or closed any of those stores you're playing to acquire to improve efficiency of stores where there is significant overlap?", "Stefano Pessina", "Listen, when we will see exactly the situation of the each store we will take the decision of what to do. What is important that to say is that \u2013 in what we have said in the $400 million of synergies that we have a given you. We have not taking into account that the benefit that we could have from the rationalization of the network. Something will be there for sure, but we cannot give you an indication because we need to see the details of each single store. Alex?", "Alexander Gourlay", "That\u2019s right. Stefano, so I think there's nothing in the plan to the rationalization, but obviously we\u2019ll study the situation very carefully when we get to the right point in process and then we'll update you. That is as simple as that in works. We understand that model very well from within Walgreens where we have been rationalizing some stores in some markets, so we have a very clear model we used to assess the opportunity.", "Stefano Pessina", "And in any case, that this will be a plus up there of the deal. For the time being we are not taking into our numbers. So we would see as soon as we will be able to take a decision to take a thoughtful decision.", "Gerald Gradwell", "And we probably have time for one more question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.", "John Heinbockel", "So I guess for Alex, the simplification program, if you can dive into that a little bit more deeply, is that solely SKU rationalization? Is it also process improvement, labor hours? And then as it relates to SKU rationalization, is the idea that on certain take food for example, that you cut back more deeply in something that's more convenience driven right that you're not necessarily known for, is that a bigger target than I imagine would be an OTC, HBA those core categories?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, John, well I think again we are very rational \u2013 as we have the data now for four or five years of what\u2019s in customers baskets and we use an idea to understand exactly where we should cut the tail. And the stores are going to first of all our lowest volume stores there we're looking at from a very local point of view. So that's the first thing I would say. The second thing, I would say about this is that really is about taking the workload out of the stores.", "So that our colleagues can spend more time with customers and reduce of course, the store hours as appropriate with the workload is reduced. We have a very, very complicated operating model, a lot of many promotions, which in these less intense stores don\u2019t sell, causing a lot of excess working capital and sometimes loss in the business as well.", "So the focus really is simply on making so easy to shop, clear to shop, reducing workload and making sure there's more as available within our store for customer care. And I'm going to first 1,500 stores having done some tests and trials because these are stores where there is least risk to sales and lot's more we can learn as we accelerate that process going forward.", "John Heinbockel", "And then just as a follow-up to that, you talked about \u2013 the format is obviously very promotional. So what would you like to do over time? Would you like to dial back the promotions? I don't know if the format will ever work in a quasi EDLP approach, but dial back the promotions. And then if you think about personalizing circulars, what does that do to the ebbs and flows of product demand? Would that help you with respect to you're taking out or smoothing out labor in the stores?", "George Fairweather", "Yes, I think as I have said, go back to the point that is very promotional far too promotional. We don't think is good for us. It\u2019s not good for customers, I mean don't think is actually good for suppliers either. So we believe much more net consumption driven model and that's where we\u2019re heading to. Also as customers change more and more new future will use personalization and digital marketing and more than the secular to understand what Walgreens can do for them.", "And we've got a mature digital organization for retail that as you know and we're making moves no to really shift to spend over time in marketing and towards digital and personalization. So all these things are true John and is an evolution of the model and we're really accelerating it based on fact, based on data and we are really making strong moves in the next 18 months as Stefano said to do that.", "And then we have the systems coming in and Phase III to really sustain not move and accelerate to further. So we've been running for two or three years we're very confident that we know the approach have to do. I\u2019m going to taking the steps to get on with it.", "John Heinbockel", "Okay. Thank you.", "End of Q&A", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you. And that all we have time for us. So thank you very much indeed for everyone participating. Obviously, if there are any further questions, I know we didn't have time to address all the questions, the IR teams are around, about and available. And please bear with us if it takes a lot to get back to you. We do have quite a little lot of questions already queued up to get through.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Gerald Gradwell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.", "Gerald Gradwell - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hello, and welcome to our earnings call. Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer, will take you through our results as usual. Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance, is also here and will join us for questions. You'll find a link to the webcast on our Investor Relations website at investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com.", "After the call, this presentation and webcast will be archived on the website for 12 months.

Please see our latest Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors as they relate to forward-looking statements.", "As a reminder, today's presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to the appendix in the presentation materials available on our Investor Relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and related information. Before I hand you over to George to review our results, I would just like to draw your attention to the announcement made by CVS last night, in case anyone may not have seen it.", "CVS announced a new PBM, performance-based pharmacy network focused on reducing costs and improving clinical outcomes. Formed through a partnership between CVS pharmacy and Walgreens and including a number of community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States, this initiative creates a 30,000 store network to service CVS's Caremark PBM clients and their members.", "As this new network has been announced since the year-end, we did not comment on it in the presentation of our results today, but we will be happy to take any questions you may have on it following our presentation. Given how much we have to cover today, our presentation will run slightly longer than usual, I am pleased to say only slightly. But we will still allow the full hour for questions at the end of the presentation.", "I will now hand you over to George to take you through the numbers.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Thank you, Gerald. We have delivered a strong business performance in the year, both in terms of adjusted profit and cash flow despite currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions. In the fourth quarter, we recognized, of course, that our GAAP numbers have been significantly impacted by the Rite Aid-related costs, including the merger termination fees.", "However, overall, on an adjusted basis, the final quarter was better mainly due to U.S. pharmacy volumes and market share continuing to grow in line with our strategy. As you know, on 29th June, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase program. During the quarter, we purchased $3.8 billion of shares, and since the fiscal year-end, have completed the repurchases. In keeping with our commitment to operate as efficient a balance sheet as possible, we've decided to add an additional $1 billion to the program. This is in addition to our routine anti-dilutive share repurchases. Of course, our other recent news was Rite Aid regulatory clearance in September, which I'll come onto shortly.", "First, I will take you through our fourth quarter results. As we indicated throughout the year, we expected the fourth quarter to be particularly strong. As you can see, this is the case. Currency had a negative impact, the U.S. dollar being around 4.4% stronger versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year.", "This impact was less significant than in the first three quarters. Sales for the quarter were $30.1 billion, up 5.3% versus the comparable quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 6.4%. GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, a decrease of 2.3%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $802 million, down 22.1% and diluted EPS was $0.76.", "This was 20% lower than the comparable quarter last year due to Rite Aid-related costs, mainly merger termination fees. Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, up 21.2%, and in constant currency, up 22.3%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 18.8%, and in constant currency, up 19.1%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.31, up 22.4%. The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 24.6%. This was 6.3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year.", "When you'll recall, we particularly benefited from positive discrete items. Our core tax rate, which excludes discrete tax impacts, was in line with our rate in the third quarter. So turning now to the performance of our segments, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $22.3 billion, up 7.5% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.1%.", "Adjusted gross profit was $5.6 billion, up 4.3% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in both pharmacy and retail. Adjusted SG&A was 18.9% of sales, an improvement of 1.8 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales has improved versus comparable quarters for 17 consecutive quarters. Adjusted operating margin was 6.3%, up 1 percentage point, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 27.5%.", "So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 12.6%. We filled 250.2 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations, an increase of 9%. On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, our pharmacy sales increased by 5.6% with scripts filled up 8.7%. This was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships.", "Within sales, volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics. Our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis was 20.5%, up approximately 120 basis points over the year-ago quarter.", "Total retail sales were down 3.9% on the same quarter last year. This includes the impact of the previously announced closure of certain e-commerce operations. Comparable retail sales were down 2.1% in the quarter, with declines in consumables and general merchandise and the personal care categories partially offset by growth in the beauty and health and wellness categories.", "Compared to prior quarters, comparable sales were lower, partially through changes to our promotional plans as we focused on delivering improved margins. Gross profit and margin were higher than in the same quarter last year, mainly due to actions we took in the fourth quarter last year to put in place foundations for long-term growth. In addition, margin was higher due to the changes to promotions, as I just mentioned, and improved mix as we increasingly focus on higher-margin categories.", "On the last call I told you that we were implementing a program in approximately 1,500 stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance. This program has now been completed and we're starting to see the early benefits, including ongoing efficiencies and reduced working capital.", "Our beauty differentiation program has driven profit and margin improvement as our own brands continued to perform well. Beauty category sales in beauty differentiation stores continued to be markedly better than in other stores, supported by strong sales growth of No7 and Soap & Glory.", "In line with our strategy of introducing new owned brands to our U.S. stores, we launched two terrific cosmetics brands during the quarter. CYO is our new and exciting makeup collection developed by Boots in Nottingham, which is designed to encourage our younger customers to be colorful and creative.", "We have, in addition, launched Sleek MakeUP in Walgreens stores and online after a successful launch in Boots two years ago. Sleek is one of our fastest-growing brands in the UK, with a young, ethnically diverse customer base.", "Since the year-end, we have launched a brand-new skincare range, YourGoodSkin, which is exclusive to Walgreens and Boots. Developed by our scientists, the product is designed to promote visibly healthier skin.", "As well as developing our offer of own brands, as I said on the last earnings call, we are introducing our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores. This program is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, bringing the total number of stores with the enhanced beauty offering to around 2,900.", "So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $2.9 billion, down 0.4% in constant currency. Comparable store sales decreased 0.2% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.5% on a constant currency basis due to higher prescription volumes in the UK, with Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales up 1.2%. Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 0.5%, with Boots UK's comparable retail sales decreasing 1.3%. This was due to a decline across a number of product categories, with beauty being impacted by the timing of new product launches. We've continued our work on cost control in the quarter, while putting in place the foundations for future growth.", "Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 0.8% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, mainly due to lower retail gross profit. This was more than compensated by lower adjusted SG&A, which was down versus the year-ago quarter on a constant currency basis. As a percentage of sales, adjusted SG&A on a constant currency basis was 0.9 percentage points lower at 32.8%, reflecting work we have done to reduce costs, particularly in the UK.", "Adjusted operating margin was 8.9%, up 0.8 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $261 million, an increase of 8.9%, again, in constant currency. This was a much better performance than in the first three quarters due to the measures we've taken to reduce costs.", "So now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, up 5.4% versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis. This was ahead of the company's estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, with growth in emerging markets and the UK being partially offset by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe.", "Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.5%, down 0.3 percentage points on a constant currency basis. This was mainly due to lower gross margin, including some generic procurement pressures in the quarter. The division benefited from $84 million in adjusted earnings from ABC, up $34 million versus the same quarter last year, mainly due to our increased level of ownership. Adjusted operating income was $221 million, up 11.5% in constant currency.", "So now let me turn to the full year numbers for fiscal 2017. As I've said, this has been a strong financial year, with results coming in just above the top end of our guidance. In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.78 was down 1%. This decrease primarily reflects a number of special items, including, as I said previously, the Rite Aid merger termination fees. Importantly, our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 11.1% to $5.10, up 12.9% in constant currency.", "The adjusted effective tax rate was 23.2%. During the year, we particularly benefited from favorable discrete items. As ever, the tax rate also reflects the geographic mix of our pre-tax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S. entities.", "Operating cash flow was $2 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year, our working capital inflow was $1.5 billion, reflecting improved payables and lower days inventory. As a result of our focus on driving working capital efficiency, over the last two years, we've generated $2.9 billion of positive cash flow. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $439 million. For the fiscal year, expenditure totaled $1.4 billion, which was broadly in line with last year.", "We continued to invest in key areas to develop our core customer proposition, including our stores and U.S. beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we've previously talked about. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $1.6 billion and an impressive $5.9 billion in the full fiscal year. In addition to the share repurchase program, which I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we made early repayments of $2.6 billion of debt to further optimize our balance sheet.", "So turning next to Rite Aid. As you know, in September, we secured regulatory clearance for the purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores and related assets. We're delighted to be completing this transaction, which will extend our network, particularly in the Northeast and Southern states.", "In the past week, we've acquired the first stores to confirm the operational readiness of the key Rite Aid transitional IT systems. We will then begin acquiring stores in phases with completion anticipated in spring 2018. To deliver the full benefit of the acquisition, we must, of course, fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores into the Walgreens network. This is a relatively complex, time-consuming and costly process.", "Initially, Rite Aid is providing transitional services for all acquired stores. Over time, we will transfer these stores onto Walgreens' existing IT systems prior to rebranding as Walgreens with our full retail offer. We expect to complete the integration of the acquired stores and related assets within the next three years. The acquisition-related costs of this are estimated to be approximately $750 million.", "In addition, we plan to invest around $500 million in incremental capital expenditure on store conversions and related activities. As previously announced, we expect to realize synergies of over $300 million per annum, which we anticipate realizing within the next four years.", "Following regulatory clearance, we have been able to complete a comprehensive review of the combined store portfolio to determine the scope for optimizing locations. This has resulted in our decision to close approximately 600 stores and related assets over an 18-month period, beginning in spring 2018.", "We estimate the cost of this program to be approximately $450 million, substantially all cash spend. The resulting cost savings are expected to be approximately $300 million per annum by the end of the fiscal year 2020. We will, of course, when reporting our adjusted operating results, adjust out both the acquisition-related and optimization program costs.", "So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2018. We're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. As usual, this guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. As we've said before, we do not expect the Rite Aid transaction to significantly impact adjusted diluted net earnings per share in this period.", "As I'm sure you'll appreciate, the recent hurricanes have been very challenging and continue to be so in Puerto Rico, where Walgreens is the largest pharmacy chain. We are very proud of all our people who have worked tirelessly to give our customers access to the medicines they need.", "Based on our work to-date, our initial estimates indicate that the cost of the storm damage and store closures could be around $90 million. The majority of this is in Puerto Rico. We plan to adjust for this when reporting our first quarter results.", "The damage to Puerto Rico's infrastructure continues to impact everyday life, including trading in our stores. We estimate that in the first quarter, this could adversely impact adjusted earnings per share by a few cents.", "Moving on to Med Part D. Although it's not our usual practice to comment on future sales expectations, given recent market speculation, I feel that it's worthwhile to point out that in 2018, we're expecting Walgreens to grow its Med Part D business year-over-year. While not material, you should also note that our partnership agreement with Fareva, which includes the sale of our contract manufacturing business, this will commence at the end of October.", "As a result, in the future, we won't have these low margin sales within Retail Pharmacy International. Thinking about phasing, we expect this year to be more balanced between the two halves.", "I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Thank you, George. So as you have heard, another strong quarter, and for us, a busy quarter to round off a very busy financial year. It has been another year of good financial growth, delivered in a variety of ways, but all coming back to the hard work, determination and commitment of our team.", "It's amazing to think how much we have achieved in such a comparatively short period of time when you bear in mind that it is less than three years since we completed the transaction to create the Walgreens Boots Alliance. Over the past three years, we have delivered growth of over 50% in adjusted diluted net earnings per share, averaging over 15% compound annual growth year-on-year during the period.", "I appreciate that looking from the outside, it may be easy to underestimate how much progress has been made. Economic progress is clear. And however people may choose to view it, the earning growth that we have delivered has been impressive. Since we started this project to create Walgreens Boots Alliance, we have delivered on our promises and more. It has been a real delivered value to our shareholders.", "We have always been clear that we deliver growth in many different ways. Part of the benefit of a large and complex organization like Walgreens Boots Alliance is that its size and scope gives us many different opportunities in many different areas, both commercially and geographically. And so our task of managers becomes more about deciding where best to use our resources in order to create the most value.", "Naturally, in part, these decision are influenced by where we know we have proven strength and experience. I would characterize those strengths as being primarily around operational expertise, financial expertise and strategic expertise. Alex and Ornella are continuing their work to deliver the transformation we need in our businesses to keep them relevant and deliver healthy mixture of operational and financial growth from our core operation.", "The work and skills needed differ business by business and country by country, which is why during the stage in our company development, the structure we have with Co-COOs is appropriate given the huge amount of hands-on work that is needed. For all of our businesses, we are constantly balancing the benefits of investing for growth, developing new services and products and controlling costs.", "We are still some way from where we need to be overall across the company, but we are making good progress and I measure the work we need to do to continue this progress as pure opportunity. From time to time, I hear some concerns raised about the amount of growth we will be able to deliver from financial or economic restructuring of our business. I do not see this as an issue at all.", "I see it as essential for any company to be as focused on its economic health, every bit as much as it is on its operational health. Also, as I have said, I believe our focus on the financial efficiency of our organization is a key strength. The work that we are doing to structure a robust and efficient company and transform the value businesses within it, is at the same time, providing us with an extraordinary range of opportunities to announce the economic efficiency of our business. Make no mistake, these are true cash benefits. It is real and tangible value creation. Then there is a need to use the benefits of all these operational and financial work to invest in the continued growth of the business and further value enhancement for our shareholders.", "In September, we saw in the U.S. our acquisition of assets from Rite Aid move from review to execution, a process that I will not deny to cost far longer and was far more complicated than I had expected. We were always optimistic that the deal could be structured in a way that could be acceptable to all parties.", "While the deal we have ended up doing was very different from what we originally announced, it was not so very different from what I had originally envisaged. And now, I am pleased we are finally able to get on with the process of bringing these stores into our group and undertaking the next phase of review and transformation work within our U.S. network.", "This is the latest and perhaps most public transaction in a range of deals and partnership we have announced over the year, including our innovative strategic partnership with (29:26), FedEx and Fareva and our minority investment in the pending acquisition of America. These range of deals is aimed at both developing our core businesses today and putting in place the foundation for developing new products and services for the future.", "Of course, all of these is very much a work-in-progress. We are an organization in transformation and that will always be the case. We are an organization that works in market that are constantly changing and we must change and adapt to them and with them. Change is good. Change is a sign of life. Change brings opportunities.", "Our challenge is to make sure our businesses are ready for change, embrace change, at times, even drive change, both within our organization and in our markets overall. We achieved that by continuing our work to help ensure that we are delivering the right products and services at the right price and in the right way to differentiate us to our customers, whoever and wherever they may be.", "To do so, we must continue our work to ensure that our structure, system and skills are right. We must continue to study our market and ourselves, truly understand our strengths and play to them, truly understand our weaknesses and address them.", "Sometimes, internally through hard work and effort, sometimes with partner, sometimes by bringing new skills and experience into the organization. You may not recognize it, but I see us doing these across our businesses every day. The changes are often individually small, but they all adapt to deliver a far more dynamic organization with a far more dynamic approach and mindset.", "Our markets contain a compelling mixture of personal well-being, huge economic scale and political attention. These factors attract a lot of comment and commentary, which in turn, leads to a lot of speculation and noise, all with an agenda, reflecting their point of view.", "As a management team, we must see through this noise to recognize the true underlying trends and dynamic of our markets and manage our businesses in a way that addresses the market, not the commentary. So as I hope you can see, I remain very optimistic about our company. We have achieved a great deal, delivered a great deal in the past year, indeed, in the past few years, and I still see truly massive opportunities ahead of us. We have come a long way in creating an organization that is well placed to embrace these opportunities and in many ways, lead the market in approach and vision.", "In a company with many businesses in many areas, we have many moving parts, which give us a great flexibility in how we respond to our markets and fully embrace the opportunities I have spoken about. We have many levers in our organization to deliver growth and value.", "We have set our guidance at the level that we know can bring all these together. And as you have heard, we are, again, giving adjusted earning per share guidance that reflects the double-digit growth we seek to achieve. In coming to this guidance we have, as ever, take into account our assessment of the many headwinds that our businesses face as well as the driver inherent in our markets, to offer what we believe is a realistic view of our prospects for the year ahead.", "We never give guidance lightly and I am proud of our track record of delivering against the targets that we set for ourselves. In the year ahead, you can be assured that I and my entire team will be continuing our work operationally, economically and strategically to make sure we have the right structure, people, skills and strategy to continue to deliver real growth and value, not just for the year ahead, but well, well beyond that. Thank you.", "Now I will hand you back to Gerald.", "Gerald Gradwell - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Thank you, Stefano. We'll now open the lines for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The first question is from George Hill of RBC. Your line is open.", "George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions. And I guess, Alex, I have two questions for you. In the U.S. business, I guess, can you break out the difference between pricing pressure and client mix as it relates to gross margin? And then I guess, where do you think this stabilizes? And then on the retail side of the business, how do you separate the impact of promotional changes from what might be other channels or players taking share? Thanks.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hi, George. Thanks so much. I think on the first question, I think we've been really clear that reimbursement pressure is part of our life and we have very clear levers that we use to address this. On the pricing side, we have a fantastic organization in WBAD and a real partnership philosophy. And you saw recently that we've also now joined that up with Express Scripts to help us to deal with that pricing pressure on that side. Also in terms of the mix of the businesses, you can see that we are very open to different networks for different types of business, government and commercial. And also we are partnering with everyone in the market including, as Gerald said this morning, our partnership with of course CVS, and of course with our partnership this year, the pricing has been driven a lot by our AllianceRx partnership, so fundamentally changed our position in specialty.", "We don't see any of that changing going forward. The one bigger opportunity we have, of course, on that side of it is, of course, the work on print optimization, which give us another lever in which to manage the cost of reimbursement and pricing on the pharmacy side.", "So we see that \u2013 that's how we see it today. On the retail side, we made a deliberate change when we do this consistently, but maybe more aggressively in Q4 in the promotional side. And that was the additional impact that you primarily saw in terms of the trend change in our front-end sales.", "And as George said in his prepared remarks, we improved both the margin and the gross margin in the front end. And again, we are seeing good growth in beauty. In fact, if you look over the last two years against front-end sales, we've seen a 60 bps improvement in the beauty category in that period of time.", "So we see our strategies working in both the retail side and the pharmacy side and we continue to work hard, as Stefano said in his prepared remarks, to drive these opportunities as they come with different partners in different ways.", "George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Maybe as a quick follow-up then. I don't know if George would update us. As the business has evolved, the profit contribution front of store versus back of the store, any direction or color?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Really nothing to \u2013 I really don't have much to add to what we said in the prepared statements and just what Alex has said. Just I think the one thing I would add to Alex, if you remember in the third quarter when we were looking at gross profit percentage and RPI, I drew attention to the fact that we'd obviously post the establishment of the AllianceRx Walgreens Prime joint venture, which we consolidate. If you recall, I said that impacted the mix by about 100 basis points, and of course we didn't have a full three months in at that time. So it's just worth bearing that in mind. But I mean, we're very pleased, as you can see, with the progress that we're making in both the retail and the pharmacy part of our business in the States.", "George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. I appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. First, I just wanted to start with Stefano's comment around new products and services for the future and trying to bring that change to healthcare. You talked about the relationship with Caremark on the network side. What we consistently hear is about this idea around member engagement. What are the things that are changing in the pharmacy? And is it changing the way you're being reimbursed? Are you seeing new elements of risk that you've got to see a certain amount of outcome in order to be able to drive the reimbursement that you're getting? I just want to understand how do we think about some of these new relationships as well as some of the new products and services that you'll bring in this new world of engagement.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hi, Lisa. It's Alex here. I think, as you clearly see from the CVS announcement yesterday and previous ones that we have also been involved in, health outcomes are becoming more important in all of the networks and for all of the peers. And I think that you can see that in the Med D networks and you can also see that in some commercial networks as well.", "Again, we can't be explicit in terms of what we get and don't get paid for and how that affects the overall payment to pharmacies, but more of a payment slowly but surely over time we see as being driven by the role of the pharmacist and the service they provide to the patient in the pharmacy that drives different behaviors and different outcomes. I think that's very clear. And that's slow, but it's certainly happening and we saw something very similar in Europe, particularly in the UK. So, we have a lot of experience in our group as the model changes to more peer services for outcomes rather than just dispensing tablets into a bottle. That is for sure.", "I think the networks are also changing, as you can clearly see. They are becoming more nodal, not just on the Med D and the Medicaid sides, but also in the commercial sides. That's very much driven by the strategies of the PBMs and the insurance companies. And we are very open and very happy to speak to anyone about our network. The deal with Rite Aid, as we said on many occasions, was to improve our network. And then through that improvement in reach was to improve the quality of that network for the peers and the customers that we serve.", "Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. And then just my second question would just be for George around the key assumption as we think about fiscal 2018. I know we see the EPS, we see your assumptions around FX, but anything else that you can help us understand? I know there were comments that your Medicare Part D business will actually grow, when I think some people in the market thought perhaps it wouldn't going into 2018. You've shown that you can have the leverage that you talked about is to bring in these new scripts. But is there any other key metrics that we should think about as we go into 2018? And should we be thinking that you can grow U.S. operating profit growth as we go into 2018?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "I very much tried in my prepared remarks to really point you in the direction of our thinking. Obviously, we don't give specific guidance on adjusted operating growth in total or in our divisions, but I think from what you've said, you'll gather that we're very confident that we can continue to grow our business through that combination of driving the top line, managing the margins and obviously, keeping a very, very tight control of the costs because saving costs is very much our way of life.", "The one thing I would sort of just, I think, remind everyone is, of course, that in this new fiscal year, we'll have a full year of contribution from the Prime acquisition which resulted in the forming of our AllianceRx business.", "Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. I'm sorry, did you have something else, George?", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yeah, so I'll just add one thing. Remember that our strategy in the front end is a very important lever as well here. So there's costs, as George has mentioned, where we're actively preparing and managing costs ahead of the game and I think we have a very strong track record, I think it was 17 consecutive quarters where we've reduced our cost as a percent of sales. We're making strong progress in key elements of our front end strategy and, again, that will play through the year.", "And of course, as George has said, our partnerships with Prime and also with UnitedHealth in Med D is an important partnership. So again, I would just point to the many different ways that we have developed our front end \u2013 sorry, our overall U.S.A. business as evidence that we can continue to grow operating profit going forward.", "Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "It's Stefano. But if you look, we have said this every time, but if you look at the adjusted operating income, and particularly at the overall group at adjusted operating income, the overall group, you will see that we are very constant \u2013 this number is very constant, is very flat over the years. So you have to expect in future that this will probably, probably be a little weaker because, as you have understood, we will have the full integration of AllianceRx and of course, as you know, the specialty products have a very lower margin. So they will have an effect to the full year. But you can see that even this year, we have been able to compensate for the partial effect that we have hit just on part of the year and that there we are coming with an overall margin which is quite constant. So we have shown that we are able to took action at many, many different levers.", "Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. So just so I have that straight, when we think about specialty, it's going to be a higher dollar amount, obviously, but a lower margin percentage. So your EBIT dollars will grow, but when we think about the margin of the business, could have a headwind just like you talked about in this quarter as we think about 2018. Am I correct in that?", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yes, I think as George said in the previous answer, absolutely. The specialty business, as you know well, we will grow much faster than the past but the margin is much smaller. But it's still a very good business and a very important business, as half the market will be specialty by 2020.", "Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to go back to the aggressive shift we've seen to preferred and narrow networks over the last few years. And it seems like it's certainly posed some challenges for retail pharmacies to grow gross profit dollars during this transition. Just curious how we should be thinking about this shift and the impact to the business as we look out into 2018 on the gross profit dollar growth expectations within the U.S. pharmacy business.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hi, Robert. Again, it's going to be a similar answer, I'm sorry, but it's really a similar answer. As Stefano said in his prepared remarks, we will look carefully at what we are achieving and we'll look carefully to what we can achieve and we use all the levers available to us, as you'd expect.", "So we are confident that we can grow our share, as George said in prepared remarks, in Med D and in the other books of business. So volume will continue to grow. We continue to work hard with partners to gain access in the networks that are available to us, both commercial and government. And again, the announcement last night was another example of that. And of course, we continue to really work hard to make sure that we give real incentives, effectively, to our peers, as they want to be paid not just in the cost to fill the products, but to develop services with them that will change the model over time.", "So we are in the market, we work with the market, we adapt to the market. And I think our evidence is very good. So we remain really positive that the 120 basis points growth that we have achieved in the dispensing market will continue to be held and we remain very positive that over time, particularly with the acquisition of the assets of Rite Aid, that we'll continue to grow market share in pharmacy volume and retain and grow gross profit dollars.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "At the end of the day \u2013 Stefano here. At the end of the day, we give guidance, look at what we have done in the past, how we have given our guidance, the results that we have delivered at the end. Everything is in our guidance. And though you have to look at it \u2013 and our guidance, it's really the synthesis of all the elements of our businesses. We couldn't be clearer than that.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "No, I appreciate that. I think it's just the building blocks to get to the EPS that I think we were just looking for a little bit more on. But I had just one follow-up for George on cash flow. As I look at the costs associated with the cost transformation initiative, continues to trend a little bit above where we were looking for. Can you just give us a sense as you think about the cash cost expenses associated with the cost savings programs as we look out into 2018? Just trying to get a better handle on modeling cash flow for the coming year.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Well, the main cost transformation program, obviously, we completed that last year and we were delighted with the results and the costs, as you've seen, have come in exactly where we anticipated them to be.", "In terms of the store optimization program that we've announced today, clearly the majority of that is cash and then we're going to have the investment in the capital in the Rite Aid stores and the conversion and the rebranding. And so we've tried to give that factor into guidance.", "But I'm very confident about our ability to continue to deliver a really strong cash flow. I think as I explained in my remarks, we had another very strong year for cash flow in the year just ended, the same the prior year. We were really able to really continue, in particular, to improve our working capital efficiency. We talk a lot about driving cost efficiency, which is a way of life, but similarly continuing to improve working capital is a way of life as well.", "And so I'm very confident that we're going to continue to really be a very strong cash generative business going forward. And obviously, when it comes to the returns on all the projects that we do, similarly as I think we've said on many times, we're very disciplined in the way we evaluate all our capital expenditure and investment programs. And I'm very confident that we'll get the returns on those.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Just one example, over summer, we decided (50:06) to the simplified stores in Walgreens and we did 1,500 stores in a matter of weeks. And that was really designed to not just face into some cost challenges in these lower stores in terms of lower-volume stores for front end, but also get working capital out and I can tell you successfully achieve both of these in a very short period of time and give us lessons for the rest of this period as well.", "Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks for all the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC", "This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. I had a question on the store rationalization program. I guess how are you \u2013 you talked about 600 stores and how are you thinking about the optimal set of these Rite Aid stores that you'll ultimately retain? I mean, is it more focused on retaining the stores with end markets where you already have a sizable presence? Is it bolstering outside of that? And how are you thinking about it in terms of \u2013 you talked about before about the preferred networks and that Rite Aid would be a nice asset to add to your assets for those networks. But I guess, how are you thinking about the trade-off between the access and maybe some of the more productive Rite Aid stores?", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hi, Bryan. Thanks for the question. Yeah, it really was quite simple. Post the transaction, the team's really looked at it location by location. And really, the vast majority of these closures will be Rite Aid and the vast majority are actually \u2013 being closed are within one mile of another drugstore that we own going forward. So it really is a micro level and real detail and also we have a very strong record of file transfers.", "We understand how to do it. We understand the economics of it very clearly. And I think as the numbers that George described in terms of the value of this $300 million by spending approximately $450 million, you can see this is economically a very good thing to do. But also because mainly within one mile of each other, it means that the network, the ones remaining, really, is buying on our strategy. It really is about improving access to Walgreens in the future and in Northeast and the South of the country.", "Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on \u2013 I guess, from our math, about half the stores that you're getting from Rite Aid have, I guess, already gone through a remodeling type of phase and what are your thoughts on \u2013 can you talk about the additional investment in some CapEx? Are you \u2013 and then even related to the stores that you'd be closing, the majority of the stores that you're keeping, have those, I guess, what's the view on that in terms of how many have been remodeled or kind of going forward, what you'll be doing to improve those stores?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Again, as you know, the sizable amount of these stores, not the majority in this occasion, have been remodeled. So therefore, they are in good shape. However, there are some which are very important just from a network point of view that would require some additional capital.", "And also as we develop the front-end proposition in Walgreens further, we'll have the opportunity to move some of that investment with a good return also into these stores. So again George has mentioned a figure for, not just for integration, but a figure also of $0.5 billion. I think it was more or less for capital improvement into the stores that we're buying and remaining open going forward.", "Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Eric Coldwell of Walgreens (sic) [Robert W. Baird] (53:59). Your line is open.", "Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Maybe I should work at Walgreens. So it might be a better career than what we have here, with MiFID coming.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yes, look, I'm open. Got to call the regulators though. So honestly, so much of this investment story is about the gross margin right now, especially in U.S. retail. You guys came historically the last few years, a management team that came from Europe where you gross margin was very good in Retail Pharmacy. U.S. is in the mid-20s, you're 40%-plus ex-U.S.", "My question is, when you look at the stores where you've done beauty, you've done mix enhancement, you've done simplification, could you give us some proxy for how much gross margin improvement you've actually seen in those stores? And that's it. Thanks.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Eric, if you worked for Walgreens, you know that you'd know the answer, but unfortunately, we can't give you the answer. We don't give that level of details, and I'm really sorry we can't give that. But we keep on reassuring you that we understand the model really well. We are working diligently to apply that model appropriately in the U.S.A. and we believe we're making strong progress and you can see that coming through at an economic value that Stefano described.", "So again, we're into almost 3,000, 2,900 stores with the differentiation. We have farther to go much more opportunity there. You can see that we have also materially improved the cost of goods, both in the retail side and also on the generic side, again, (55:45) that constant working with suppliers and long-term ways to make that happen.", "And you can see how we are carefully investing our cash as well as our operating costs to drive improvements in volume and also improvements in customer experience. Our internal Net Promoter Score's and many of our brand measures are improving going forward towards more of a pharmacy-led health, wellness and beauty retailer.", "So we continue to work diligently on this model. We continue to believe strongly that we absolutely know more about the American market has achieved it. We understand the customer is changing, we understand the market is changing and we will adapt appropriately. So again, I don't know what more we can say. We can't give you any more detail. But I promise you that we are satisfied with the progress we are making.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "And you see you said that coming from UK, we are used to better margin and higher margins. But if you look at the pharmacy, the pharmacy in UK is quite under pressure and it has been under pressure for decades, I would say. And the way that we have \u2013 the reason why we have developed both with this increasing margin on the front of the stores \u2013 the shop or creating a completely new model is just because over time, we had to cope with a margin in the pharmacy, which initially being very, very good, as it shrunk over time and we have to compensate.", "So we go out to adapt. In the U.S., the margin of the pharmacy is still decent. It's under pressure, yes, but we have so many levers to compensate for it that we are not particularly worried. But in the meantime, we are trying to create a new model that will help us to keep overall the profit of the company at the level which we believe satisfactory.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "And also, Eric, I mean, I would encourage you to take a trip to the UK, see how we continue to improve the model in the UK. For example, our holiday season started really strong in the UK because the gifting in that marketplace is really strong this year. So again, I think we often have a conversation in this call about the U.S.A. only. We have a model in Europe which we continue to improve and continue to drive, and I think it's worth sometimes understanding that model even more in terms of looking at the whole group and what we can bring to the knowhow to the American market.", "Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "That's great. Thanks very much. And I'm going to go ahead and hit submit on that resume, so let me know.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, hi, good morning. So obviously, you talk about the fact that the market is changing and the customers are changing and partnerships are key to your strategy. But as the landscape continues to evolve and CVS is tracking (59:12) their partners, there have been (59:14) some are very similar to yours, and we hear about Amazon evaluating a potential entry, how are these changes impacting your strategic thinking of partnerships versus M&A going forward?", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "No, I have to tell you that the market is changing, but it's not changing in a direction which was (59:37) from us. So our strategy substantially doesn't have to change. Our idea of partnership, our idea of trying to adapt our stores to a future different reality is practically still the same.", "Of course, we are adapting, of course, we are learning and we make some changes from the experience that we have, due to the experience that we have, but the basic strategy is still the same. And we are just, as we have said many, many times, we are just building the strategy piece by piece.", "We have to create, I have said this many, many times, the right platform to build the future company. And we have worked on that and you can see that now, things are changing. You can see that we are constantly delivering.", "You'll see that we are not only constantly controlling our costs, but are also now expanding our sales. And of course, all the different trials and tests that we have done in these years are coming to fruition.", "I would think of something we have already spoken about, our collaboration with FedEx, the fact that now FedEx is practically, it's everywhere in our store, except Puerto Rico, I believe, that FedEx is everywhere in our stores.", "Whilst we have really tested the case, I feel the execution has been quite fast. In seven, eight months, we have a hold over the FedEx pickup and delivery point in all of our stores. And this is just the first phase as we said because now, we will use this to create a fantastic network to deliver to the customers directly from our pharmacies. And so you'll see that we are consistent with what we were saying in the past.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hi, Ricky. Again, just on the FedEx point, I just want to say what a fantastic partnership we have here. And also when you think about the idea of the last mile and having the ability to really deliver in the last mile, we believe this FedEx partnership, which we've rolled out in a matter of months to every single drugstore apart from those affected by the hurricane, as Stefano said, is not available to our customers and to FedEx's business partners as well.", "So I think that's just one quick example of how we are rapidly changing with the market as it rapidly changes. And I think that this idea of the last mile, which many people are struggling with, many \u2013 particularly the online business are struggling with. I think the stat in the marketplace is that 30% of e-commerce get returned, for example, parcels get returned, reversal in the supply chain is a big customer problem. Piracy is a big customer problem. We believe that with the best last mile, working with people at FedEx and many others, we can solve some of these problems for businesses and for customers and that's what we intend to do.", "Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So just a thought on the FedEx partnership, so do we think about it both as addressing the omni-channel, but also competing more effectively with mail?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "So, Ricky, I didn't quite catch your question. Could you repeat your question? I apologize. I couldn't quite hear the end of your question.", "Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just on the FedEx partnership, should we think about the opportunity not just as response to kind of like that omni-channel, but also as more effectively competing with mail?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "In pharmacy, yeah, I mean, obviously, that's an opportunity going forward. We look at \u2013 we work hard on costs and still reducing that cost in the pharmacy. We are very convenient, close to many, many customers, both patients and people who buy retail products, I said before. So that's an opportunity for sure that we are looking at and I'm going to let you know if we do anything about it. But that is certainly one of the opportunities with this partnership.", "Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then one just last question regarding guidance. Obviously, the SG&A improvement has been the most substantial we've seen in the last eight quarters. So should we think about that as the new run rate given the savings you've talked about? And then can you just share with us what are you assuming for tax rate for 2018?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "I'll take up on that. But on the guidance, obviously, on our prepared comments, you've seen we just gave guidance at the adjusted EPS level, so we haven't given the composition. But notwithstanding that, I would really stress that we are continuing to look to drive SG&A efficiencies. It's very much a way of life. Clearly, we'll have additional costs coming in as we go through the Rite Aid transition. So we won't be quite comparing apples with apples as we go through that period.", "But the focus on improving SG&A will continue to be absolutely relentless. It's just the way of life. We will, of course, also then have the mix effect from the Prime because we'll have Prime acquisition because we'll have a full year in the coming year and I think as Alex has already explained, there's a mix effect in terms of, it's a lower percentage gross margin by nature.", "In terms of the tax rate, we've not given specific guidance for tax, but as I said in my prepared comments, our effective tax rate excluding ABC equity income was 23.2%. Within that, there was a couple of percent of discrete items. So, excluding discretes, we were 25.2%. And of course, the level of discretes can tend to vary year-by-year.", "The final point, really, would be post, in terms of you thinking tax post Rite Aid, and of course, we will have a higher proportion of income as we start to see the accretion come through from Rite Aid over time and we will start to have a higher proportion, other things being equal, in the U.S., which of course continues to be one of the highest tax rates really in the world at the moment.", "Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Your line is open.", "Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my question. I know you mentioned that Rite Aid shouldn't be materially accretive in 2018, but I'm wondering if you could talk about accretion level in the first full year, I guess, the run rate for fiscal 2019. And then I have a follow-up after that. Thank you.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "We've not given the specific guidance beyond what we've said in numerical terms, but to help you with your thinking, in terms of the Rite Aid stores, we'll be acquiring them on a phased basis.", "And as we've said, we've just acquired the first few in the last week or so to start testing the IT systems. So we'll be acquiring those on a phased basis over the next six, seven months until the spring of next year.", "We then have the store optimization program which I talked about, which Alex has elaborated on a little more detail, which is when we acquire the stores over time, we then have to really treat them like internal file buys and do the conversion. And that is going to take roughly \u2013 we've got an 18-month program from the spring of 2018 through to the end of 2019.", "And then we have got to convert \u2013 as we convert the existing stores, we've got to do the remerchandising, the rebranding, putting in our IT systems, getting everyone trained up, particularly the pharmacists on our pharmacy management program, which is very important part and obviously moved the logistics over.", "So really, as we've said originally, it will take a number of years to complete that till we absolutely see the full benefit from the Rite Aid transaction, which we're very confident about.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Hi, Alvin, it's Alex here. Again, from an operational point of view, we feel really good about this execution. The team have been working really closely, this has actually gone on (01:09:21) for almost two years, and we got going really quickly and the first stores that was mentioned in the prepared remarks by George have transferred really well. So I think we're feeling good. We're well prepared and we'll get this job done and execute it really well and get this network inside of Walgreens network.", "Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you. And in the U. S., do you need the front end comps to turn positive in order to hit your 2018 guidance? I know you're undergoing a transition, so I'm wondering at what point it becomes positive and if it's necessary in 2018.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "As I said before, we only give guidance on one number. A lot of our focus is on improving our offer, as Alex has said, and driving overall shareholder value creation of profit. And mix, it's not just all about driving the top line, what's important is growing in a profitable way. And we're very disciplined in the way we evaluate our promotions so that we don't unnecessarily promote when it doesn't make economic sense to do so, and we're very focused on improving the mix. And I think as Alex had said again a few minutes ago, the lessons that we learned from Boots in particularly developing our own differentiated offering, particularly in the beauty area is a key component of being able to do that. And of course, it offers our customers fantastic products at fantastic value.", "Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. If I could squeeze in one more. Just wanted to ask about your mail order business. What kind of trends are you seeing there? How sizable is it in terms of your sales, how the margin profile has been looking? Just curious if you could provide any color on mail order.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Mail order is part of AllianceRx, so it's part of our Prime business. So really, we're at the very early stages of this. I think as a previous question came in, we don't think of mail order separately from the network. We think of how do we make it the most convenient way for customers to receive their prescriptions in a way that they want to. So we're confident that we can grow our pharmacy business, including mail order over time by having a really customer-focused approach, working closely with Prime in this case but also closely with other partners on the network.", "Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Kevin Caliendo of Needham & Company. Your line is open.", "Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning, guys. Question on Anthem and Ingenio. Can you take us through the opportunity for Walgreens in that network? Obviously, they're going to restructure a lot of their preferred networks. And just wondering how Walgreens might fit into that come 2020.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yeah. It's Alex here. Yeah, I think, obviously, it's an evolving situation from the point of view of the networks. I go back to the point that we want to partner with absolutely everyone. This was a PBM contract, not a pharmacy contract. And we have a relatively low share of the network within the Anthem book of business today. So we believe as things evolve with our performance-based networks, our higher quality pharmacies, our better customer offer, we can play a big part in the evolving Anthem PBM.", "Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 you mentioned some comments about cadence for the international business earlier. But just as we think about fiscal 2018 and the cadence for earnings over the course of the year, should it look or be similar to what we saw in 2017 or will it be, like you said, a little bit more level or even as the year goes on?", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Currency is obviously a key factor in this, as obviously, in forming our overall guidance, we assume constant rates. But in the international division, the number of different markets with \u2013 obviously in the UK, we're very confident about continuing to grow our Boots business, which has got a very strong position with its differentiated products and product ranges, in some of the international markets in Latin America. These are, by nature, more challenging, a challenging market. But again, we believe that we've got the right strategy to continue to develop those businesses. So we're very confident overall about our prospects in really in all three of our divisions, not just Retail Pharmacy International.", "Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC", "Well, in terms of cadence, I was talking about Walgreens' corporate earnings cadence for fiscal 2018 and how we should think about it in terms of modeling. Should the cadence look a lot like it was in 2017? There were some certain things that happened in 2017 that might change that. I'm just wondering how we should think about the full year in terms of a quarterly progression.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Really, I would just re-emphasize what I said in guidance. As I said, I think that in the phasing, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect this to be more balanced but between the two halves. I think when we gave guidance a year ago, we always explained that fiscal 2017 would be more weighted towards the final quarter. And obviously, the results that we've announced today demonstrate that. So I would think, think more balanced would be really the best way of thinking about it.", "Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Well, thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Charles Rhyee of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, thanks for taking the question. Alex, when you talk about the evolving business model and trying to meet all the kind of competitive threats out there, can you kind of talk about other things that you're doing? I mean, are you considering in your outlooks new technologies like pharmacy automation or maybe can you go in more details on how the pilot with LabCorp is going?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Sure. Sure, Charles. As Stefano said, we have a lot of pilots and tests in the marketplace. Again, we are very pleased with the progress on all of them. They're really testing, at this stage, consumer behavior. We'll currently (01:16:17) get consumers and patients to see us differently and use these services that we are now providing.", "So just some examples, LabCorp, as you said, that's a recent one. That's early, but the early indications are positive. And of course, we learned something from the previous experience we had in terms of customer experience with the team we had before. Secondly, we are moving to an increased number of pilots in optical. We have a big business in the UK, a very successful business in the UK and global partnerships with the most important partners in this industry in the UK and are bringing all of that knowhow to the American market. And again, we're pleased with the progress so far.", "Hearingcare. Hearingcare, again, we have a successful business in the UK. We understand the model very well and again, we're bringing that here to the U.S. in a test and trial here in the U.S. as well. And again, that's happening just after Christmas.", "And last but not least, we talked about urgent care where, again, with MedExpress, we're in the ground (01:17:25) in urgent care. And again, that is going well so far.", "So again, using our physical convenient locations, using our healthcare brand, working in partnerships to give them access to our Walgreens customers and of course, working together to make sure that we target people through data in the most appropriate ways are all part of what we're doing right now in terms of developing new business models in that healthcare space. All work in progress, all being properly managed, all with the best partners in the U.S.A. market and so far, so good.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "And I want to stress the idea of partnership because to have a partner in areas which are close to what we do as a basic business but not exactly the same is important because of course, these partners will continue to evolve and adapt their technology, so we are sure that we will be always at the forefront of what is required of the needs of the customers. And having also a strong partner will help us \u2013 once we will have really tested carefully the formats of our offer to the customers, a strong partner will help us to develop the business very rapidly, to roll over the business very rapidly. And this partnership are, for sure, an important element for us and we have had very, very good experience in the past in UK and in other countries when we have been able to select the right partner.", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks. And just to follow-up on the urgent care, the MedExpress partnership. Can you comment on how you're looking at that market? Obviously, it's a fast-growing market, very large as well and very fragmented. Can you just give us some thoughts on how you're looking at that in the sense that \u2013 does it make sense at some point to really have those as your own, maybe through acquisition or growing \u2013 building it out organically? Thanks.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "It's really early. I mean, at the moment, we're really I go back to \u2013 we're looking at customer behavior and how that's changing inside of the Walgreens brand and inside the Walgreens box, the properties. And it's very encouraging. So, of course, we'll analyze what we bring. We bring great locations, we bring a great brand to which customers associate healthcare. But we also, as Stefano said, believe in partnerships. We believe in not having to build things that already successfully built. So we will assess all of that in urgent care. But you're right, more and more healthcare is going to be delivered in communities and many people see the drugstores today as an ideal place to deliver these healthcare services. And of course, we are doing lots of work to understand what that could look like in the future, as I said, with the very best partners and urgent care, for sure, is a good example of that.", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks. And if I could just add one more. Opioids, obviously, a big issue right now. Can you give us some \u2013 your comments on what you're doing in terms of trying to prevent over-prescriptions and divergence and maybe a sense of how long you've had these measures in place? Thanks.", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Sure, yeah. We rolled something called take back out, I believe it was about 18 months ago was our first take back. And now, we've now got that in 800 pharmacies evenly spread across the U.S.A. And we're now expanding that by another I, think, it's 800 in partnership with our key partners to provide that service even closer to communities in America.", "So people can bring back their unwanted drugs out of their bathroom cabinets to make sure they're not available for misuse. That program is going very well, I think and the ones we have at the moment, we've got about, I think, it's 80 million tons of drugs back, so that program is going very well and we're delighted that others are also doing that now as well.", "Secondly, pharmacist education, really important and we're making sure that pharmacists really understand how to deal with this issue in a positive way through Good Faith Dispensing as a program has been in place for many years and we continue to drive that and improve that.", "And thirdly, we're working with the industry to make sure that any other opportunities there are to play an active part in preventing this situation, we play a role in as well.", "Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is open.", "David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC", "Can you just talk briefly about the agreement that you reached with CVS last night? It seems to me like you and CVS have been very competitive in pricing on the retail side. Is this maybe an indicator of perhaps a bit more of a friendly relationship and some easing potentially of price pressure that we're seeing in the market? Thanks very much.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Let me say one thing, there was not a war. There is a competition on certain contracts, which can go either way. And our relationship with CVS have always been good. So this idea of the war is not precise. Having said so, I will ask Alex to comment more \u2013 in more details.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yes, I mean, obviously, CVS PBM is a very, very important partner. And we said this in previous calls, has always been so and always will be so in the marketplace. They discussed with us this performance network where they wanted to have around about 30,000 (01:23:53) pharmacies where they could manage and measure the performance of the individual pharmacy in certain ways that drove better health outcomes for patients and for payers. And we worked with them and agreed as part of the normal agreements to go into this network. So we're very pleased. We think this is an important move for us and an important move for CVS. And we look forward to making this network successful.", "David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. And then just one more. Did I hear you correctly? Are you considering getting into the mail business, where Walgreens members could go on online and order a script through the Walgreens website and then you would ship it to them through your own mail facility? And is that in response to Amazon by any chance, did I hear that correctly?", "George Rollo Fairweather - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "No. I think we've always had a mail business. We combined it with Prime's mail business as part of the AllianceRx deal that we announced last summer. So we're always looking for ways to reduce cost to fill. We believe that the position of our network, which is closer to customers than any other network in the U.S.A. allows us to have a lower cost last mail and give customers the flexibility of being able to receive the prescriptions in their pharmacy and potentially at home. So, of course, we're looking at that option. But really I think that's not a response to Amazon, it's a response to the customer opportunity we have.", "David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.", "Michael Otway - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, good morning, every one. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Appreciate you taking the questions. I guess, first, on the synergies and store optimization savings over the next three to four years, can you frame the ramp up of those savings, are the bulk of the savings to come in any year, like fiscal 2019, or should we \u2013 how should we expect you guys to benefit from those savings over the next three to four years kind of the ramp?", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "They will take time to come through because as we go through the store optimization, the store optimization program, and we've set out the timescales for the programs, the important thing, as I think Alex emphasized, is that we do that in a structured and disciplined way so that we, like we do with file buys, we maximize the transfer of the business that we're acquiring into the combined store. And that \u2013 we've got a lot of experience in doing, but we will do that over a period of time on a store-by-store basis. And we've got a \u2013 there's a very well experienced team being set up to lead this within the Walgreens business.", "So you should expect things to come over time. We're very clear both in terms of the benefit. The benefit will be the $300 million by the end of 2020, but it will ramp up over time is how I would best describe it.", "The same thing then with the overall $300 million that we also talked about in the synergies. Again, that takes time as we move over the business over our \u2013 more and more over our control as we move on to our systems and our ways of working.", "Michael Otway - Wolfe Research LLC", "All right, thank you for that. And I guess, then just my second question here. We talked about it a little bit on the call, but the front-end comp sales, you guys made a decision from a promotional standpoint. But do you ultimately think that all the things that you're doing and beauty can overwhelm, kind of from a positive standpoint some of the drag from these other categories and actually get the front-end comp back to positive?", "And then much longer term over the next couple of years, how do you see customers shopping Walgreens from a front-end perspective? What's your role on consumables and general merchandise and that roll that those categories play in the store? Is your expectation that store trips for some of these items or purchases for some of these items decreases over time as maybe consumers want them delivered to the homes? So just a bigger picture view of customer's interaction with Walgreens from a front-end perspective.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yeah. Hi, Mike, it's Alex here. Yeah, Walgreens' strategy is always to be the \u2013 very convenient, it's a convenient-driven strategy and that does not change. So the model we are developing really is to really understand more and more how customers will shop today and in the future from a convenient location.", "So job number one is to simplify the offer so they can find a product really quickly they want at good value, a combination of convenience, quality of products, uniqueness of products and also price. We believe we can do that really well in healthcare and do well in healthcare OTC and also going forward, we're doing it better and better and better in beauty. We think that's one that we can accomplish.", "In terms of other categories, they're very important to that offer. So we are working hard. For example, we just re-launched the Nice! product, that own brand product. The packaging is fantastic. It is doing really well early on, and that's a roll-in, roll-out. So again, we will continue to improve the quality of our products and the quality of our value and improve the convenience as part of that model.", "I think that the second thing I would say is that what's really important to the customer in the future, particularly the evolving customer is the app and how we can join both the convenience store with our mega (01:30:05) app under Walgreens. And we've got a really good platform, a mature platform there and more and more, we're connecting it into a store and allowing other people also to connect into store in the same way.", "So again, since we combined all of our assets and ecommerce under Walgreens.com, we have seen good positive growth in Walgreens.com, in particularly health and beauty again. And again, we continue to invest in that particular capability and will do going forward. So again, nothing changes. We just got to adapt to the evolving customer.", "Of course, we want to see improvements in front-end sales, but more importantly of all, we want to see a value proposition, a customer proposition, which really makes us more unique and more focused on the emerging customer than the all-drugstore model. And that just takes time, as we said before.", "Michael Otway - Wolfe Research LLC", "I appreciate the color. Thank you though.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the last question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "So Alex, wanted to touch a little bit on Rite Aid. I know it's early yet, but you've been looking at it for a long time. What are the one or two things you learned from them that you think could be applied to the Walgreen business? Maybe you're not doing as well as they are.", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Yes, thank you. And I think, the most obvious thing for us is how they have adopted to run a lower cost, genuine lower costs, low volume front-end model. So I think as we said before, we have \u2013 we've started our journey with the 1,500 lower-volume stores in the summer and for sure, I'm looking forward to reunderstanding how they apply \u2013 how we can apply their thinking to our model going forward. That's one area that is very obvious to me.", "I think the second area is we're getting a lot of great people. We're getting the operational teams who have run that business, who understand the drugstore channel. I'm sure within that, we will find talent that will really help improve the great talent we already have in Walgreens of the two obvious areas, looking at it going forward, and I'm sure we'll discover more. You always learn lots from acquisitions and we're very open to learning more going forward.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And then secondly, if you look at the underperformance, right, of those stores versus you or versus the core Rite Aid base, so how much of that is real estate versus operational issues? I guess, structural versus not?", "Alexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Oh, well, again, we believe that over time, by transforming everything into the Walgreens brand and improving by learning lessons from Rite Aid and also applying what we are doing from the knowhow we have in our group, WBA, to the Walgreens model, that we will be able to generate similar returns today from Rite Aid as we get from Walgreens.", "So for sure, there are some location \u2013 some profit disadvantages in the Rite Aid portfolio. We understand that. But having said all of that, so we think we can improve Walgreens further and we can improve Rite Aid further and put them both together. So I know it's a clear answer to the question, but we are confident in the synergies of being $300 million plus over the full-year period. And of course, we're looking to improve that further. And as Stefano said in his prepared remarks, we're always looking to improve our core business anyway and will put both of these together going forward.", "Stefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "And also, remember that we are closing certain stores, transferring the files to other Walgreens stores. This will have a double effect. To eliminate the store, which generally is not particularly profitable and to increase the efficiency of the stores where we transfer the file, this, of course, it's in the synergies that we are expecting, but at the end, the stores that we will keep will not be bad stores, so will already be good stores. And improving the offer, improving the service, integrating them into the Walgreens organization, these stores will, for sure, be absolutely comparable to the rest of the stores that we have.", "John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions. I'll turn the call back over to Gerald for closing remarks.", "Gerald Gradwell - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.", "Thank you very much, indeed. Thank you, everyone, for your questions and thanks to the team here for the presentation today.

At this time, all percipients are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct and question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Gerald Gradwell, President, Investor Relations and Special Projects. Sir, you may begin.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Hello, and welcome to our earnings call. Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and George Fairweather, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer, will take you through our results as usual. Alex Gourlay, Co Chief Operating Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance is also here and will join us for questions.

Overall in the quarter, we have delivered strong business performance both in terms of adjusted profit and cash flow, which gives us a good foundation for what we expect to be a solid year.", "We are particularly pleased with the continued growth in U.S. pharmacy volume and market share. We recognize, of course, that our GAAP numbers have been significantly impacted by some notable special items, which I'll talk about in a moment.", "During the quarter, we completed the $5 billion share buyback program announced in June plus the additional $1 billion expansion announced on our last earnings call. Of course, our other development was Rite Aid regulatory clearance in September. In October, we started to acquire our first stores. This has gone well, and by the end of December, we have bought a total of 357 stores.", "Since the quarter end, we have announced our agreement to acquire a 40% minority stake in GuoDa, a leading Chinese retail pharmacy chain with over 3,500 pharmacies across 70 cities. While this transaction in the context of the group is relatively small, we believe it has significant potential for the future.", "We have also announced an agreement to reduce our investment in our wholesale partner, Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation, giving us a cash-on-cash return of 3.6 times. This will leave us with a 20% interest in this successful partnership. Both transactions are, of course, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.", "Moving on to guidance. Today, we have raised the lower end of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year 2018 by $0.05. So now, I'll take you through our results for the quarter.", "Sales for the quarter were $30.7 billion, up 7.9% versus the comparable quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales were up 7.2%. Currency was moderately favorable, the U.S. dollar being around 5% weaker versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year.", "GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, down 8.6% versus the comparable quarter. Adjusted operating income was $1.8 billion, up 4.8% and up 4.4% in constant currency.", "This quarter, GAAP operating income was adversely impacted by our share of AmerisourceBergen's litigation accrual as reported in their last quarter results and by the hurricane-related storm damage and store closures, which I highlighted back in October. We estimate the trading impact of the hurricanes to be around $90 million of sales and a few cents of adjusted EPS.", "GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $821 million, down 22.1%. This quarter's number was also adversely impacted by an impairment of our equity method investment in Guangzhou to reflect the fair value of our entire holding.", "Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.3 billion, up 7.8%; and in constant currency up 7.2%. Diluted net earnings per share benefited from the lower number of shares in issue. As a result, GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.81, down 16.5%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.28, up 16.4%; and in constant currency, up 15.5%.", "The adjusted effective tax rate, which we calculate excluding the equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 24.9%. Our core tax rate, which excludes discrete tax impact, was marginally higher than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.", "So turning now to the performance of our segments, starting with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail Pharmacy USA sales were $22.5 billion, up 8.9% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 4.7%. Adjusted gross profit was $5.7 billion, up 3.7% over the year-ago quarter, reflecting an increase in both pharmacy and retail.", "Adjusted SG&A was 19.2% of sales, an improvement of 1.2 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. SG&A expense was higher than in the fourth quarter in part due to the normal seasonal activity.", "Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales has improved versus comparable quarters for 18 consecutive quarters. Adjusted operating margin was 6.1%, down 0.1 percentage points, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion up 6.8%.", "So now let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 14.1%. We filled 260 million prescriptions on a 30-day adjusted basis, including immunizations, an increase of 9.5%. We have now reached a significant milestone, exceeding 1 billion scripts for the first time on a 30-day adjusted and rolling annual basis.", "In the quarter, over 20% of Walgreens retail refill scripts were initiated through digital channels, demonstrating the impact of the work that we are doing to improve our digital capabilities. This includes the progressive enhancement of the Walgreens' mobile app, which has been downloaded over 50 million times since its launch and has a 5-star customer rating on the U.S.", "Apple app store. This growth in script volumes led to our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual 30-day adjusted basis being 20.6%, up approximately 110 basis points over the year-ago quarter.", "So turning back to sales. On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty and mail, pharmacy sales increased by 7.4%, with scripts filled up 8.9%. This was primarily due to strong volume growth from Medicare Part D and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships.", "Within sales, volume growth, mix and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics. A higher proportion of specialty adversely impacted pharmacy gross margin by around 140 basis points. These factors combined resulted in higher pharmacy gross profit. ", "Total retail sales were 2.8% lower than in the same quarter last year. Comparable retail sales were down 0.9% in the quarter partly due to changes to our promotional plans, which I spoke about last quarter, as we continued to focus on delivering improved margins. This was a lower rate of sales decline than we saw in the fourth quarter last year.", "Declines in consumables and general merchandise and the personal care categories were partially offset by comp sales growth in the health and wellness and beauty categories. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that we've delivered comparable sales growth in both the health and wellness and beauty categories.", "Gross margin and gross profit this quarter were positively impacted by the changes to promotions I just mentioned and by improved mix as we increasingly focus on higher-margin categories.", "The beauty category today represents around 9% of total retail sales. As discussed in prior quarters, we continue to invest in our beauty differentiation program and are encouraged by the results. As well as developing our offering of own brands, we have now completed the introduction of our enhanced beauty offering to over 1,000 additional stores, bringing the total number of stores with this offering to around 2,900.", "I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, the beauty differentiation stores performed stronger than in prior quarters. Beauty category sales in these stores continued to be markedly better than in other stores, resulting in higher retail gross margin and higher comparable retail sales.", "As I mentioned on the last earnings call, in the last quarter, we launched our brand-new skin care range, Your Good Skin. This is now being rolled out to all our beauty differentiation stores. Following the success of the program, we have now extended No7 and Soap & Glory to over 4,400 Walgreens stores. Given how well our beauty offering has been received, we are working to widen the range of products offered in our beauty differentiation initiative.", "Before turning to Rite Aid, I just wanted to make a comment on December.", "Since the quarter end, in pharmacy, we continued to deliver strong growth in prescription volume as we began to annualize pharmacy contracts that contributed to fiscal 2017 volume growth. In retail, while our December comparable sales were lower than in December last year, we delivered a strong performance in our important health and wellness category.", "Turning now to Rite Aid. During the latter part of the quarter, we acquired 97 Rite Aid stores and [are part of] the 260 stores in December. As we've said before, we are acquiring stores in phases, with completion anticipated in the spring. This will be followed by the transfer of the 3 distribution centers at a later date.", "And as we've also said, in terms of our store optimization program, we plan to close approximately 600 stores and related assets over an 18-month period, beginning in spring 2018. Our assumptions on synergies, store optimization, timing, costs and expected savings are as previously announced.", "So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.1 billion, up 4.1%; and in constant currency, down 0.8%. Comparable store sales decreased 0.7% in constant currency. Comparable pharmacy sales were down 0.1% and comparable retail sales decreased 1%, both on a constant-currency basis.", "In Boots U.K., comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.1% mainly due to temporary price rises caused by shortages in certain generic drugs. Boots U.K.'s comparable retail sales were 1.4% lower in a challenging marketplace. Adjusted gross profit for the division was down 0.8% in constant currency to $1.2 billion due to both lower pharmacy and retail gross profit.", "Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales on a constant-currency basis was 0.3 percentage points higher at 32.9%. On an absolute basis, adjusted SG&A dollars were broadly flat. Adjusted operating margin was 6.8%, down 0.4 percentage points in constant currency. This resulted in adjusted operating income of $210 million, a decrease of 5.6% in constant currency and down 1.4% on a reported basis.", "Since the quarter end, as we expected, trading has continued to be challenging. However, we are managing our businesses to address this trading environment both in terms of promotional efficiency and costs. As a result, we remain optimistic about our future prospects.", "Now let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.7 billion, up 4.5% versus the same quarter last year on a constant-currency basis. This was behind our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to challenging market conditions in certain Continental European countries, partially offset by strong performance in emerging markets.", "Adjusted operating margin, which excludes ABC, was 2.6%, down 0.5 percentage points on a constant-currency basis but in line with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This was mainly due to a combination of cost inflationary pressures and lower gross margin, including some generic procurement pressures.", "Our share of adjusted earnings in ABC was $77 million, up $19 million versus the same quarter last year, mainly due to our increased level of ownership. Adjusted operating income for the division was $224 million, up 0.4% versus the same quarter last year in constant currency.", "So turning next to capital allocation. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $961 million. Our working capital outflow was $745 million. This reflected our seasonal build in inventories, which was substantially lower than in the comparable quarter due to actions we have taken to reduce inventory days in the U.S.", "Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $378 million. We continue to invest in key areas to develop our core customer proposition, including our stores and U.S. beauty program as well as the upgrades to our IT systems, which we've previously talked about. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $583 million, an increase of $436 million versus the same quarter last year.", "So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2018. We have raised the lower-end level of our guidance and now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.70. As usual, this guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year. And as we've said before, we do not expect Rite Aid to significantly impact this year's adjusted diluted net earnings per share.", "In addition, our guidance does not take into account the recent changes to U.S. tax law that have just occurred. Once the detailed tax guidance for the new law has been published, companies such as ours will be able to quantify the full impact, and we will, of course, update our guidance accordingly.", "Based on our initial assessment, we believe that these changes will have a positive effect on cash taxes. As in the past, if changes in tax legislation result in material changes to balance sheet provisions, we will adjust for these. Our tax team are working through all this ahead of 2Q results.", "And finally, thinking about the phasing. As I've said on our last earnings call, we expect the year to be more balanced between the two halves than in fiscal 2017.", "I will now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. As you can see, it has been a strong start to the year. Our strategy of geographic and commercial diversification continues to serve us well, giving us both scale and presence while managing our relationship with the pharmaceutical manufacturers and diversity to help us manage the downturns of the business cycle in any individual geographical market. That said, we do not just sit passively. We actively seek opportunities that the changes in our markets offer.", "Most recently, we have announced our change of emphasis in China. We have been involved in China for some time, as they all say there, with strong local partner. But following regulatory changes, we have taken some time to assess the market and review our position.", "As a result, as George has said earlier, we are taking a significant stake in GuoDa, a leading Chinese retail pharmacy chain, in a strategic partnership arrangement indirectly with the Chinese state itself. This will help us to participate more actively in the retail pharmacy sector.", "I am pleased to say that we have been able to do this transaction on terms that recognize the significant benefit that this strategic partnership will bring to GuoDa.", "Around the same time, we announced an agreement to reduce our stake in our main wholesale partner in China, providing them with greater freedom to pursue other routes to develop their business. Although, as you have seen, we have taken an impairment charge on this investment, our holding overall has generated a very good return.", "We remain committed to our wholesale partners in China and maintain a significant interest in them both, but we believe that we are now best served by focusing on the opportunity that the partnership in retail offers.", "We are very excited about the potential of the Chinese market. As with every country we operate in, health care and personal care are very culturally-specific sectors, and we are convinced that our strategy of entering markets through strong local partners with excellent local management teams is the best approach. But of course, I know, quite understandably, that your focus is on more Western markets and the U.S.A in particular.", "The U.S. continues to be a very dynamic market with a lot going on and many changes underway. We have been contemplating some of these changes for a while. As most of you will know, I have been convinced of the benefit of vertical integration in the U.S. health care system for many years.", "I do not, however, believe that vertical integration can necessarily then be achieved only through ownership or within a single entity. Much can be achieved through close partnerships and collaboration.", "Looking at the U.S., it is very important to remember that we are partway through a process of transformation. I believe this will set our business in the U.S. on a path of growth for the future.", "I know many of you have heard this before, but it is still relevant, and I think, sometimes, the significance of the work we are doing gets overlooked. As you know, the process of transformation began with a review and denouncing of the Walgreen business. Cost cutting was an important first step.", "A lot has already been done in this regard, and this work, together with an ongoing strict discipline on costs, has given us the runway to begin the process of reinventing Walgreens while, at the same time, delivering good results.", "We are now well underway with our work to upgrade the existing Walgreens business model in pharmacy and in retail. We have been going through a process of fine-tuning throughout the U.S. business. In pharmacy, we have adjusted pricing on our commercial contracts to bring them more aligned with the rest of the market and, in doing so, have generated significant net growth in prescription volume to our dispensaries.", "In retail, we have continued with the detailed and selective refinement of our merchandising, products and service offerings. I believe we are about halfway through this process, and the benefit it is bringing are, again, helping us continue our track record of growth while we develop, trial, assess and then roll out our vision for the future of Walgreens in the U.S. market.", "So the third phase in our transformation is to rethink our business model to adapt to changing market and changing customer behavior and look ahead to the future of the U.S. business.", "We are already extensively working on this at the same time as continuing to optimize the business that we have today. We have made a lot of progress in defining what our stores should look like in the future. You will hear a lot more about this during 2018.", "We are researching and analyzing our customers that are shopping in our stores to understand the true profitability of each category and area of business and what our patients, payers and customers want from us. We have been working hard to put in place the relationship we need to offer a range of health care services seamlessly across the group alongside a far more focused and differentiated retail offering.", "There is no doubt that the complete transformation will take time to achieve, but I believe we have the potential to do a great deal more with our core assets, particularly given our physical presence and the strong position this gives us in the community, our scale and the purchasing power this gives us and our unique global brands.", "As you know, over the past few years, we have been conducting pilot studies in certain U.S. stores to test our merchandising, format, supply chains and beauty propositions and a number of new initiatives and partnerships.", "In 2018, you will see us deploy the first pilot stores incorporating all the work we have done to date in a single store format. We will study the results in depth and fine-tune the format before rolling this new concept out under the ongoing store rejuvenation initiative and within our current capital plan.", "However, this is about much more than just our retail offering. It is about rethinking and redefining our presence in and relevance to the communities we serve, and that requires us to rethink our supply chains, the services we offer to our customers and how we deliver those services.", "This is why strategic partnerships, like the one we have done with FedEx, are so important. It gives us an additional role in the community. It provides flexibility in how we physically move things in and out of our stores, and that creates a completely new way of thinking about how we interact with our patients and our customers.", "As I say, you will be hearing more from us over time about all of these areas, but behind all of these is a recognition that our best opportunity to grow our business is also our best defense against new competition or changes in our marketplace. Quite simply, we need to offer the best pharmacy service.", "Being a differentiated retailer and providing services and convenience are the value propositions that keep us relevant to the communities we serve. In doing this, we must make sure that we provide the goods and services that payers and customers want. We must do this across all channels in an integrated manner and to uniformly high standards.", "We must be agnostic about how they wish to interact with us. That is key. A payer should know that whatever they want or need in terms of services to their patients, we can provide it, provide it well and at a competitive price. A patient or customer should know that however they choose to interact with Walgreens, in person, online or even through a third party, they will get quality products and services at competitive prices, delivered to them directly or via a partner in the way they want, when they want and where they want.", "To do that, we must actively manage our business, our cost base, our product size, our services and our partnership. We must ensure our people and our company, they all can match or beat our competition in all areas, and we must do this without faltering in our delivery to our owners in this venture.", "That is all big picture, very relevant and in total future, but in the more immediate term, we have a lot to do in the year ahead. However, we are facing tough market condition. And as ever, there are many challenges to be addressed in our business and in our markets, but we are more than up to the challenge and I am excited for the year ahead and for the years to come.", "With a strong first quarter, which, as George says, give us a good foundation for a solid performance. For the year as a whole, I remain as confident as ever in this business looking forward.", "Thank you. I will now hand you back to Gerald for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa Gill", "Thanks very much. And good morning. I was wondering if maybe you could just comment on 2018 around preferred relationships. I know, on the last quarter call, you anticipated that scripts would be up in calendar '18.", "But now that we know where things have shaken out as far as Part D participants go for 2018 as well as the commercial market, can you just give us updated thoughts around that?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Lisa, it's Alex here. Yes. I don't think we have much to add. We still see the same position as we saw in the last update. We are confident we will grow in 2018, and we're also very confident about the customer care we're providing to our partners. That's actually helping to make customers more sticky and grow and stay with us as well.", "So nothing really more to add to that. The numbers we gave seem consistent with what we've seen since. And of course, we'll give a further update when we have the total market available, probably sometime in April, May or June, as it becomes much clearer.", "Lisa Gill", "And how do we think about the margin then on that business? I mean, any changes to 1/1/18 around any of your payer or PBM relationships?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Again, we don't disclose, as you know, the commercial contracts. We speak all the time about pharmacy reimbursement pressures, so that continues to be a feature of the Med D market.", "We manage our price to the marketplace, and we do that very carefully. And we're confident that we can sustain the appropriate margin with the volume we've got. Some of the contracts that we became less excited in, of course, we have improved the payment. And of course, some of the contracts stepping down is normal this time of year. So overall, we feel okay about the margin. It's pretty much on trend.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay, great. And then if I - I'm sorry, go ahead.", "Stefano Pessina", "You see, when we approve a new contract, of course, we make sure that we can afford the contracts. And so if we give some additional discounts, if we could use our margin from one side, we analyze during the contract where we can recover all or most of the margins that we are giving away.", "And this is why our results are quite consistent overall, and this is why we are not losing dramatically or at all in our bottom line, in our operating -- overall operating margin, adjusted operating margin, because every contract is studied and approved if we understand or know how to compensate for what we have to give.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, George, you talked about the U.S. tax rate obviously being a positive. Is there any way to think about how to quantify this early on?", "I mean, by our math, it could be nicely positive for you, somewhere in the range of maybe $0.40 or $0.50. Is that a number that would be close to how you're thinking about it?", "George Fairweather", "Look, where we are, as I said in the prepared comments, is that we're still -- the tax team is still working through this. Obviously, all -- the full details are still in the process of being published, so it would be premature to make any sort of financial comments from our perspective at this point.", "I mean, for me, the key issue that I'm always focused is -- on is the cash taxes. And as I -- again, as I said in the prepared comments, we'd expect a positive effect on cash taxes. But it's worth remembering, of course, that we are a multinational.", "It's much simpler for some of the domestic companies to give a fairly quick and dirty estimate. But for us, it takes a little bit of time to work through, and that's what we're doing. But we'll update you in the second quarter, as, again, I said on the prepared comments.", "Lisa Gill", "Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Hill with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "George Hill", "Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. Alex, I want to drill on this something that you made a comment about. It sounded like you talked about a more challenging procurement environment as it related to generic drugs.", "I guess, could you throw a little more color on that, tell us what's driving and talk about whether that was specific to the ex-U.S. business? Or is that something that's kind of having a global impact?", "Alexander Gourlay", "George, no, I didn't say - I apologize. Sometimes my accent is a bit hard to pick up. I didn't say that at all. But on the comment on generics, we're really seeing a very similar trend in the marketplace. So we're seeing deflation. Obviously, the market's a bit consolidated, and we feel good about the work of our colleagues in Walgreens Boots Alliance development and we feel confident.", "We work with manufacturers in a very consistent way and over time, so no change. I apologize if my remarks were picked up wrongly. We're seeing the same trend, and we feel good about the capability we have to manage this well in this marketplace.", "George Hill", "No. And then - I apologize for mishearing you. And then maybe, I guess, a follow-up for you and for Stefano would be - I know that we're not even through the Rite Aid acquisition yet, but you talked about some of the growth initiatives and the new store format. I guess, with 90-ish percent plus beneficiary coverage in the United States, macro script growth is slowing down.", "Aside from engaging in a battle for market share with your largest pharmacy competitor, what do you guys see as the best opportunities to continue to monetize the box or generate earnings in the box?", "Or where is the whitespace for growth kind of as we think about the next leg for the company beyond the roll-on of the CVS stores in first half of '18? And I'm thinking about this more from a top line perspective as opposed to a margin or synergy perspective?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Yes. So again, we are working - as Stefano said in his concluding remarks, we are working really hard to rethink and redesign the box. And we've been doing this really for a number of years with a number of tests and trials. And some of them would be -- just to give you an example, beauty differentiation's the best example, but many others like the mobile app who we have - again, George in his remarks announced 50 million downloads and a 5-star app.", "So we're putting all of this together in a single-format trial. Some time later on this year, we'll give more details as we step into it. And we feel very confident that, that box, that single format, we will be able to generate more value from that in the immediate and long-term.", "The data we're seeing, as we develop our ability to use [indiscernible] data in a different way, particularly in the front end, we are very confident about as we re-merchandise and simplify and make sure that we have a differentiated offer. We've been doing all of that, of course, not just to Walgreens but into the Rite Aid stores that we have acquired.", "And last but not least, we feel good about our access strategy. Again, the numbers are very clear, 1 billion prescriptions for the first time ever in Walgreens. And we think we can continue to grow volume by giving good value and great care.", "George Hill", "Okay. And maybe just the last tack-on would be, as I think about the new format, it probably includes the clinic model, it includes beauty, it might include the LabCorp demos. Is there any other, what I would call, customer magnet or customer-facing components to the new format we should be thinking about?", "Stefano Pessina", "Listen, we have a clear model, and we are doing certain trials. And we are, let's say, finalizing agreements with certain partners. But you will understand that we cannot present a full model today.", "As we said, you will hear more from us during this year, during 2018, at the end of the year, but some of the things that we are doing are commercially sensitive, as you can imagine.", "So you can be assured that, in our box, you will find all the things that we have been talking about until now and, I hope, something more.", "George Hill", "Great. I look forward. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Glen Santangelo", "Hi, thanks. And good morning. I just want to follow up on a couple of things. First, on the margin question, when you look at sort of your gross margins in your U.S. retail business, obviously, they continue to come down. And as you anniversary some of those commercial wins here as we look forward to 2018, I understand you don't want to give any sort of specific margin guidance going forward, but just how do you generally think about the reimbursement environment?", "Do you think we're in an environment where margins will continue to come down, given the competitive nature of the business and the pressure from the PBM and so the goal is ultimately to grow revenues and try to cut SG&A to be able to grow? Or do you think we get to an environment where margins eventually stabilize in this business?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, Glen, it's Alex here. Again, I think, specifically, in this period, remember the prepared remarks George made about the specialty mix, which was 140 basis points. And as you also recall, we announced with our partners, Prime, through AllianceRx, the successful FEP contract which kicks off in this quarter we're in - or in the last quarter.", "So that mix is quite important as you look at the margin. But more in a long-term trend, we expect to see the long-term trends remain the same, and we said that consistently.", "That hasn't -- our point of view hasn't changed. We expect to lever the same levers which we've successfully used and will continue to use, costs, cost of goods, developing this front-end margin in a way that we described in the previous question and, importantly, volume.", "Again, we do believe that we are able to drive volume through our pharmacies in the way we've done in the last 2 years as well. These are all levers we will use to ensure that we drive gross profit dollars and adjusted operating margin -- adjusted operating income, sorry, in the business. ", "Glen Santangelo", "And then maybe, if I could just expand that. Any comments on the reimbursement outlook over in Europe? Given some of the challenges we faced this year, as we head into calendar '18, comps should ease. I mean, do you expect that to be meaningful?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Again, I can comment specifically on the U.K., which is our main pharmacy business. Of course, in Europe -- we have many other businesses in Europe, but this is the main pharmacy business. The government have taken a large amount of money out. We've been very clear on that and went to the second phase of VAT. And this is something that is a cycle, as mentioned by Stefano before.", "Almost every decade this happens in the U.K. And we're managing our business appropriately. The pharmacy business is very important to our brand and to our customers in the U.K. and we have the scale and we have the presence to manage this appropriately.", "So again, it's a tough environment in this period because the government action has been beyond normal. That will come back to normal action in the future years again, and we remain confident we can manage it in that cycle.", "Stefano Pessina", "But you see, in Europe, we are used to it because in all the European countries, I would say, for the last 20 years maybe, we have seen the government pushing down the margins of the pharmacies, the margin of the distribution. So it's a part of the business, and we know how to react and we react.", "And of course, in Europe there had been a great consolidation, there had been a great improvement of the efficiency of all the operators. Now generally, this is quite -- it goes through, I would say, quite smoothly. We see some shock today -- in this year mainly, I would say, for the Brexit because this has created a lot of instability not just in U.K. but also in the rest of Europe.", "And also, the strong FX, we were not used to see the pound depreciate 20% in 1 day or 2 days. We had very big depreciation in the past. We created the euro and the depreciation were much more under control. And to see again this big fluctuation and big depreciation has created an environment which was a little difficult to control.", "Now these things are coming back slowly into normality, and all the business will come back to normality. But this might be considered quite an exceptional situation overall in Europe. And you see that after all, we and the other operators, in spite of these big changes, have been able to -- in constant currency, have been able to stay more or less where they were before. They are all about there.", "Glen Santangelo", "I appreciate that. Maybe lastly, just on the capital allocation. You decided to pull some of the repo forward here in the current quarter. I understand you still have some authorization outstanding, but do you expect to sort of back that off as we look out to the balance of the fiscal year or do you expect to continue to be active in that regard? And then I'll stop. Thanks very much.", "George Fairweather", "We completed the $6 billion program. And so other than sort of our normal anti-dilutive program that, obviously, is something that continues on an ongoing basis, we have no authorizations out at the moment for additional share repurchase programs. Obviously, we continue to review our overall position to have an efficient balance sheet, as you will have seen from our track record.", "Stefano Pessina", "You understand -- Stefano here. You understand that we produce a lot of cash every year. And you have seen this in the last year, we have increased substantially the cash we're able to create. And of course, we have to use this cash, either we have to do some external acquisition or we have to buy back shares or we have to increase the dividend. But we have, in any case, to use this cash.", "We have found ourselves in an awkward situation because we have done -- or we intended to do an acquisition and we have to put the money aside for the acquisition. And after, the acquisition was smaller than anticipated and later, so we had some cash to deploy and we have decided to buy back shares.", "We hope that we will not find ourselves in a similar situation in future. And we will be able to deploy our cash in a more orderly fashion in future. But for sure, we believe that we don't see any reason why we should not produce the same or more cash in future. Well, of course, this cash has to be utilized or given back to the shareholders.", "Glen Santangelo", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. Your line is open.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about tax reform again. I know you don't want to quantify at this time, but what do you plan to do with the benefit? You just talked about external acquisition. Does this accelerate your time line or plans for an acquisition? Or do you assume most of this just gets considered away?", "George Fairweather", "Well, I think, as we all know, the tax reform has got the potential to help companies such as ours invest, whether that's jobs, equipment, facilities, to grow the economy and open up new opportunities really for Americans across the country. And from our perspective, again, as I said in our prepared comments, we're continuing to invest in the U.S., here in our Walgreens business and our core customer proposition.", "And very importantly, as you also know, we're planning to invest substantially in the Rite Aid assets post acquisition completion and the big conversion program that we've got to convert the stores to Walgreens. So we welcome the tax reform and see this as reinforcing our opportunities to invest here in the United States.", "Alvin Concepcion", "And just a question on M&A. I mean, you mentioned vertical integration has many benefits. Does this include managed care as part of your thinking? And what part of the supply chain do you think could benefit the most through integration? And also, what are your priorities, U.S., international? Is it more on the retail side or various parts of the supply chain?", "George Fairweather", "We continue to look at M&A opportunities in a very disciplined way. As always, when we are looking at the opportunity for new partnerships, we start with a partnership mentality and look at what the opportunity is and look at the best way to extract value for our shareholders. Sometimes that is just a good commercial arrangement. Sometimes, it's taking an equity-method investment or having a minority partner.", "And sometimes, it's 100% M&A. But we always start with the mindset of partnership and then, in a sense, what is the logical structure from a shareholder value point of view just really based on the opportunity and how best to deliver it. And we always approach M&A in a very financially disciplined way, and we're very clear on what our returns criteria are.", "And we continue to look for quantifiable synergies, real hard synergies underlying our key financial models. And then what we always do on top of that is look at the soft synergies, which are the ones one can not quantify but often create a lot of the long-term sustained shareholder value.", "We'll continue to look at opportunities here in the U.S. and internationally, but -- as you've seen and what we talked about earlier in China, but always in a very financially disciplined way. Clearly, the tax reform and some of the changes in the U.S. make the U.S., in some ways, a more attractive opportunity than it was prior to tax reform.", "Alvin Concepcion", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Robert Jones", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions. You noted another strong quarter on the same-store script growth, and I'd imagine that next quarter would be similar. But as you look out to the back half of the fiscal year when you begin to lap some of the market share gains, what kind of script growth or even declines should we be looking for given some of the competitive changes you've seen in the preferred Part D networks?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi, it's Alex here. As we said in the last quarter, we are very comfortable growth at the market or near the market next year. That's why don't see that as a problem given the changes that we have seen so far. And then on top of that, we do have the additional stores from Rite Aid coming in. It's non-organic, it's non organic growth as well, to help to drive our platform, our buying power and of course, our efficiency.", "So again, we have different ways of delivering growth. And as you've seen over the last few years, this growth is what we intend to do and I think that's a great example of how, as we move from one phase or maybe into another phase of growth with the same focus and the same intention.", "The last thing I would say is that we remain extremely committed to partnership in this sector as well. I believe that we provide great value, and I believe that our partners will see consistently us delivering for them what they need from this marketplace as it changes and becomes more competitive. So really, no change. We remain confident, and evident that we are growing in pharmacy this year compared to -- growing above the market this year compared to the previous year.", "Robert Jones", "Okay. I appreciate that. And then George, you made some comments on the performance in December, but I was hoping maybe you could just go back and break down what you were seeing relative to the performance in 1Q. I thought you had mentioned, I think it was you that might be - had mentioned something around generic procurement pressure, but I was just hoping you could elaborate on the December comments that you provided?", "George Fairweather", "The generic procurement pressure point, if I can just - was in relation to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, and we emphasize, when we're looking at our generics operation in terms of shareholder value and generic sourcing that we do out of Switzerland, we look at this very much and around as a whole.", "And whilst we were impacted in this quarter, as we were in the fourth quarter last year in wholesale, we're very pleased with the over performance of our generic sourcing operation. It's just sometimes where it falls and it can be \u2013 but I say it's the overall that we're really focused on.", "In terms of the U.S. obviously, we've just finished December, so we're just closing -- [Technical Difficulty] But what I was trying to do was give you the, a fairly -- [Technical Difficulty] level overview of the performance. And as I said, in the U.S., in pharmacy, you saw strong growth in prescription volume in Q1.", "As I said in the prepared remarks, we continue to deliver strong growth in prescription volume in December and it's worth reminding ourselves, that we're beginning to annualize the pharmacy contracts that contributed to the fiscal 2017, what's really building on what Alex has just been saying.", "And then in retail in Walgreens, again as I said, where our comparable December sales were lower than December last year, and it's worth remembering obviously, what I said in Q1.", "Again, what's really important for us was we delivered a strong performance in our important health and wellness categories. So that's really the sort of the December story.", "And then in looking back looking into Europe, the, as again, as what I indicated, it was relatively tough trading in December, particularly Boots in the U.K. And that's no different. I believe we're starting to see in the preliminary figures that are [Technical Difficulty] from some of the other large High Street-based retailers in the U.K.", "Robert Jones", "Got it. Thanks for all that clarification. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask if you could give us some color or comments on any improvement you're seeing in the stores that have rolled out sort of higher-acuity health care services, whether it's MedExpress in your partnership with United, or the clinics that you've sold to some of the health systems such as Vanderbilt here in Nashville. And then how far do you think you can push that MedExpress opportunity in terms of rolling that out?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Hi John -- hi Brian, sorry, it's Alex here. I think that -- we're really pleased with the tests we have. It's a strong model, it's a good brand. It's really link, to be honest, to know the success of this. So far, so good, then we'll update you when we have more information and more confidence in the overall model. It would make sense, from a customer point of view, that you can pop into a convenient location, that we have the, a, corners across America, everybody knows that, the best corners in America.", "So it makes sense from a customer and patient point of view that you can go in and get yourselves sorted, when you have an accident or when you need a medical or something of that type, which is what MedExpress does.", "So, so far, so good, but very early on and related to give any information that would really make a bit of a narrative, to be honest. I think in terms of the clinics, I mean, we're really pleased with the partnerships we've got there. They are local, which is important to the health systems. We are providing different services depending on what we want to do and what the local needs are, and it fit really well into Walgreens' brand.", "And of course, as we said, when we did these partnerships, we have the opportunity of providing more pharmacy services to the health care systems alongside that, which is the bit that you don't always see.", "So again, these are more mature. We are performing exactly as we wanted to. They are different from location to location, bringing added value to customers and driving - [Technical Difficulty] of a relationship in our pharmacy business with important health care partners.", "Brian Tanquilut", "Just a quick follow-up to that, as I think about the FedEx rollout. I mean, you already rolled out, across a big base of stores. So how should I think about how you view that as a defensive strategy perhaps, or as a way to drive margin and volume into the stores?", "Alexander Gourlay", "This is absolutely not a defensive strategy. We have got a fantastic supply chain. We are situated closer to America's rooftops [ph] than any other retail brand, and we've got a -[Technical Difficulty] and pharmacists inside that retail brand. So this is about us definitely -[Technical Difficulty] As redefining the promptness of -[Technical Difficulty] Locations across America. This is not a defensive, and FedEx have been fantastic partners, and we're really pleased, the progress we've made, particularly in the holiday season.", "Brian Tanquilut", "I appreciate that. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Gerald Gradwell for any closing remarks.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you very much, indeed. And thank you, everyone, for participating in the call. We look forward to speaking to you all again on our second quarter results in three months' time. And we hope to see you all over the next few weeks and months as we go out and about, and look to speak to our shareholders and the financial community. Thank you again.

Please go ahead.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our 2018 second quarter earnings call. As usual, I'm here today with Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance; Alex Gourlay, Co-Chief Operating Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance and President of Walgreens; and George Fairweather, our Global Chief Financial Officer.", "We're presenting in a slightly different format today to try and give you a better overall picture of our thinking, where we are with the business and where we want to be. We would welcome any feedback you may have on the updated format to ensure we're addressing your needs. I will shortly hand you over to Stefano to make some opening comments and host the call. Before I do so, however, there are some things that never change; so I'd ask your indulgence and attention please while I take you through the legal Safe Harbor and cautionary declarations.", "Certain statements and projections of future results made in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements that are based on our current market, competitive and regulatory expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially.

After the call, this presentation and webcast will be archived on the website for 12 months.", "I'll now hand you over to Stefano who I should say is slightly under the weather today with a bad cold; so if sounds a little cocky, that's why. Stefano?", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, Gerald. If you would have seen from these mornings announcement, it has been a rather good financial quarter for the Company. We've re-run the progress in our key numbers. It is despite the what has widely been seen in the retail markets as rather mixed stuff to the year.", "George will run you through the numbers, but before then, I would like to say a few words about our markets and strategy and ask Alex to give you some insights about how we are interpreting and implementing that strategy in our daily operations.", "So I would like to start by reminding you why we believe that we are at the heart of an extraordinary dynamic sector despite it apparently being a little out of favor at the moment, and why we have such conviction about our future. Fundamentally, we see ourselves as being in very attractive markets, the pressure of pharmacy adjusted elements of the overall pressure in the healthcare system. In the U.S., this is mainly the reimbursement pressure from the payers, the PBMs and the health plans. Although as I have always predicted, these are now pretty much one and the same and the sign of the pressure, the payers are under from their customers. It is a sign that everyone recognizes the need to control the inevitable growth in demand.", "Population continue to age; with increased life expectancy comes increased expectation for quality of life and increased demand for healthcare. In the U.S. alone over half of all prescription drugs are taken by the over 65 and this percentage is even higher in many of the entirely state funded healthcare systems in other countries. The cost of care continues to rise. The relative attractiveness or medication based treatments to keep people leading productive life in the community continues to increase as the cost of medication remains materially lower than the total cost of healthcare. The innovation in healthcare means demand is infinite and most markets manage cost by managing supply.", "Against these backdrop, we see different approaches to managing healthcare spend. In most countries around the world, these have been achieved through government intervention either to limit reimbursement, limit availability of treatment or more usually, some combination of the two. The most sophisticated system combined these with some element of free market economics. The United States is one of the markets with the greatest element of such free market economics built into the system.", "But with some 18% of U.S. GDP already spent on healthcare, significantly more than any other country in the world, everyone recognizes that the U.S. system can be more efficient. The greater the element of free market economics in the healthcare system, the greater the scope for us and the greater the number of ways in which we can add value through reducing overall cost of care and working with that to evolve the way in which healthcare is both delivered and funded.", "We have outstanding experience and a strong track record of success in managing our business to play an active role in the management of our area of healthcare costs. We have shown that we can tie commercially while doing so, sharing the benefits and at times the growing pains of the market without partners in the relevant healthcare system. These has made us a trusted partner for patients, payers, governments and providers; most notably, the drug companies, and of course has been the foundation on which our team has delivered many, many years of excellent financial performance. In the market we are applying the strategies that have systematically delivered us a combination of cost control and commercial growth in other market.", "I can summarize our approach really quite simply. The main points of our strategy are to drive growth and consolidate volume through organic growth partnership of acquisition and use these volume to buy best-in-class, and most importantly, significantly better than our competitors. Control cost optimizing financial efficiency and leveraging our financial strength. We rigorously apply financial discipline in everything we do from day to day operation to business development. Differentiate ourselves where we can through value, quality of service, exclusivity, or innovation; and our own trends form a strong point of differentiation. Build a portfolio of complementary business across a broad geography to provide protection from the unique cycles in any one area. Reinvest for both organic and external growth and foster a portfolio of opportunity to give us multiple levers for growth.", "Naturally, we must adapt these approach specifically to the condition in each of our markets. And the U.S. it's not different, in fact, if anything -- these approaches are more relevant to the U.S. than to many other markets. I can honestly say that there is nothing that we have done in the U.S. indeed anywhere across the Company that cannot be traced directly back to one or more of these teams. And of course, underlying these are two basic principles; the need for dynamism ensuring that we move with indeed lead the market and the strength of leadership and management ensuring we have the right team with the right skills and experience. Our announcement of James Kehoe's appointment to join us as Chief Financial Officer from June 1 reinsures to add with [ph] business development after a carefully managed transition, demonstrate our ability to attract exceptional skills and experience. It also demonstrates the commitment of our current team to remain engaged in our future and prevail the team as much as the Company to keep it relevantly strong.", "Don't take these as an indication that I am going anywhere, there is still a lot for me to do but it is an indication that we are committed as a team at every level in our organization. George has done outstanding work as CFO over many years which we all thank him for, and he has a lot more to contribute to the Company.", "Thinking of other members of the team who have done great work but still have a lot more to do, this is probably an appropriate time for me to hand you over to Alex who will tell you about how we are implementing our strategic approach in the U.S.", "Alexander Gourlay", "Thank you, Stefano. I'm going to focus today on the U.S. as this represents so much of our activity. Stefano has defined a strategy succinctly, and the evidence of the strategy in action is clear from a recent earnings performance and in stores although of course a lot more goes on behind the scenes.", "As I said, everything we do eventually comes back to the service we give to the patients and customers and how we deliver for our partners. Before I talk about the future, when we just review how we apply our strategy in the U.S. market today besides what we've had to do a lot of work to quite the data we needed and apply it in the way we needed. As you know, we are investing considerably in our systems and are spending a lot of time getting pointed in the right direction and working even better. Overall, we spent over $500 million to-date on building, testing and implementing new systems; we're on-track and in addition, in the next 3 years we anticipate investing more than $500 million on this area of transformation of our business which will in turn lead to further cost savings and efficiencies.", "We're starting to get good data from our stores and we're making progress towards what we need. We're now running the balanced awards program as a data and customer insight tool as much as the marketing program as it was just designed and we have now 88.6 million active users who are so working to simplify the program but we now have available tool as nearly 3 years of excellent customer data. We're part way through updating other core retail systems which will give us a full suite of data enabling us to better mine the business and provide a platform for future growth, those are working in a number of other key systems.", "We've been very open about the files that our pharmacy management system although state-of-the-art when we implemented some 25 years ago and still performing very well given this age has some constraints in it's ability to handle the future needs of the business and our markets. This is a big priority for us, the work is progressing on-track and we've been significantly helping this by recent experience of developing for assistance elsewhere in the Company. In addition, some of the work George and his team are doing within Walgreens to update the financial assistance and with the processes is already giving additional visibility on our financial performance on a much more timely basis which is helping us track and respond to changes much more quickly. As ever there is more to do but the combination of management data and customer insight has really begun to kick-in and they form a great deal of change in our business.", "Turning now to pharmacy; as you know, one of our top priorities has been to grow volume and keeping with Stefano's forced strategic gain. It is pretty clear to us 3 years ago that our cost base was designed for a volume of prescriptions that have been lost but not fully replaced. We did some work to validate the information we have in the markets and compare that with our own internal information; it was clear with updates in our thinking and approach. The implication was a pretty big shift in our approach which we had to work hard to manage significantly cutting out places to bring us back into line with the market, but also focusing on improving our service standards, particularly availability of prescriptions and speed of service. In this we had to meet the judgment call on network, our position in the communities we serve and service levels would make us attractive at market prices. We made this judgment based on extensive consultation everywhere with peers on both a leg work and the consultation paid off. Once again this quarter you've seen prescription volumes grow and our market share increase to the highest level we ever reported, 21.4%.", "Over the past few years, we have grown our market share by over 200 basis points. While volumes and market share come and go as contract shift, I'm confident that we are now back to a position where we are competing strongly. Despite any short-term shifts in the market, we are well positioned to see volume and market share growth overtime. This gives us a strong basis on which to review our pharmacy operations and improves them in areas where we can generate more value for both ourselves and our partners, and look at ways to improve costs and efficiency overtime to augment the growth we will see in volumes.", "Of course, as you know, this team in Switzerland are using these volumes alongside those of our procurement partners to do a truly fantastic job in terms of getting us great buying terms but we do not and cannot rely solely on buying. The procurement work is there to support the pharmacies and volume counts in procurement. Especially growth can also be seen clearly in this quarter's performance as we continue to develop our Alliance RX partnership with Prime Therapeutics and extend the number of successful community specialty pharmacies. And the products here that we have recently added [indiscernible] in specialty pharmacy, a 23 Walgreens community based specialty pharmacy sites. Overall, I believe we are well positioned to grow specialty market share in the future.", "In the retail side of the business, despite having been area of much discussion we are at an early stage. Over the last 3 years we have been focused on driving profitable growth, looking at the comparative quarter 3 years ago on our usual adjusted basis, we delivered higher retail gross profit through improving gross margin by over 300 basis points. This progress has been made through a combination of good solid retail management and focusing promotions and a plan with rigorous financial discipline which Stefano has already mentioned. Through changes in merchandising and product mix, we have followed our strategy of differentiation and increased penetration of own brands while significantly improving margins. This has been achieved in competitive markets by driving improvements in our health and good [ph] offerings, we made good progress but not perhaps as quickly as I would have hoped but the new store formats we're working on will provide a platform for us to accelerate this growth.", "Of course there have been many areas we've been able to make progress within the comp store formats such as optimization of ranges and promotional activity, all of which have delivered improvements in performance. This can be clearly seen in our beauty differentiation roll outs within partnership with our suppliers, we have extended the rollout to our own 2,800 stores having more brands including our own brands. It's not just about improving the look and feel but making sure we have the skills and training and our own team to support this work. Since we concluded all out, beauty sales and beauty differentiation stores have outperformed our non-beauty differentiation stores in the quarter, as accounted for retail margin differential of around 2 percentage points. We intend to continue this and just to add more stores on more cashes on beauty.", "In the new store format, we'll bring together such as optical, hearing care and lap [ph] along with further testing of value, royalty and supply chain initiatives. We plan to bring together all of this learning in the pilot stores which we will begin launching in the coming months as we mentioned in our first quarter updates. I was stressed that the new formats as much of bringing Walgreens upto date as themselves living the future but they will provide a platform from which we can deliver future services, retail offerings and accessible healthcare. The past stores would also provide a platform for the existing initiatives we've already introduced. Such strategic partnership with FedEx is already available in almost all of our Walgreens stores, all performing very well. Equally, there are areas unique to us that don't have the scale or expertise to optimize in our grid.", "We've gone for some quick wins but known our position for more fundamental change. The development of the new store formats and [indiscernible] as we learned more from their performance in the market also provides us with the opportunity to develop a wider range of services at different value proposition. The acquisition of the ready stores which is now being completed at accelerated -- the development of our network during this transitional phase accepting as we have said there will be no material attrition from right at the fiscal year.", "Another key initiative that's developing a digital presence which is not just a buzzword but increasingly of true relevance in the healthcare area, as well as obviously in retail and again, whilst as it is, we have not been sitting still in this area. Our app has been downloaded 50.6 million times, has a 5-star customer rating on the U.S. App Store. During the second quarter, around 21% of Walgreens retail resale scripts were initiated through digital channels, up almost 3 percentage points versus the comparable quarter last year. So with all these initiatives while there is a long way to go, we must not lose sight of the ships in the market while we are transforming the business. We have many great opportunities at stake and many paths that we can choose to follow as we drive our business forward to create a more differentiated customer proposition in the USA.", "My job is to make sure that we are the right team, with the right tools, and the right focus; to make sure we have the dynamism that Stefano talked about reaching all parts of our operations. That's why in the U.S. we have paid to investor into $100 million per annum and increased wages beginning later this calendar year. Putting the systems in place as I said in my opening comments is an example of providing the right tools and the forthcoming appointment of Sebastian and James to head our booths is a good example of how we can broaden and renew the skill base of our team, how we execute our planned succession within our operations. I'm delighted I'm doing this, we've also been able to keep the experience of less [ph] within the business.", "Now, over to George.", "George Fairweather", "Thank you, Alex. We are pleased with our overall progress, both in the quarter, and through the first half of the fiscal year and we continue to expect to have a solid year. And today we have raised our guidance for fiscal 2018.", "In the quarter, our key profit metrics were all up on the comparable quarter last year both on a reported and constant currency basis. As we announced this morning, on a reported basis, sales were up 12.1%, adjusted operating income was up 7.3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings were up 16.6%. Most importantly, adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased by 27.2%. This very strong growth was in part due to the U.S. tax law changes, our share buyback program and of course good growth in adjusted operating income. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share increased by 38.8%, the key difference between GAAP and adjusted growth being the cost transformation program in the same quarter last year, partially offset by the provisional net discrete tax expense. For completeness, here are the first half financial highlights showing adjusted diluted net earnings per share growth of 22.4%.", "So, turning now to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, starting with retail pharmacy USA. Retail pharmacy USA total sales, comparable store sales and adjusted gross profit all increased versus the comparable quarter last year with adjusted gross profit being higher in both pharmacy and retail. At the same time adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales has improved versus comparable quarters for 19 consecutive quarters; these together resulted in adjusted operating income increasing by 6.3%. So let's look in more detail at pharmacy where we've continued to make good progress.", "U.S. pharmacy sales were up significantly, increasing by 18.7%. This was primarily due to higher prescription volume including central specialty and mail following the formation of Alliance RX Walgreens prime and from the acquired Rite Aid stores. On a comparable basis, pharmacy sales increased by 5.1%, partially due to higher volume. Reimbursement pressure on generics had a negative impact, partially offset by brand inflation. The number of retail prescriptions failed on a 30-day adjusted basis including immunizations increased by 9.1% leading to an increase in reported market share in the quarter to 21.4%, up 100 basis points. On a comparable basis, prescriptions filled increased 4%, this was primarily due to the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships and to Medicare Part D.", "As in the first quarter, we delivered higher pharmacy gross profit despite ongoing reimbursement pressure and a higher proportion of specialty which adversely impacted gross margin by around 190 basis points.", "So turning next to retail. Total retail sales were 0.7% lower. Comparable retail sales were down 2.7% as we continue to focus on delivering improved margins. This action resulted in higher retail gross profit than in the comparable quarter last year. As Alex has said, looking at the comparable quarter 3 years ago, we have improved adjusted retail gross margin by over 300 basis points.", "Next, let's look at retail pharmacy international. Retail pharmacy international total and comparable store sales on a constant currency basis were lower this quarter, market conditions continuing to be tough, particularly in retail. Comparable pharmacy sales increased by 0.6% with UK being up 1%, mainly due to mix. Comparable retail sales decreased 2.8% with UK being 3.3% lower. As I indicated on our January earnings call, our trading has been challenging, we are managing our businesses well to address this. In particular, we are managing our cost base very tightly. As a result, we've been able to increase adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis by 6.6%.", "So now let's look at our pharmaceutical wholesale division. Sales increased by 3.4% on a constant currency basis; this was behind our estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales due to challenging market conditions in certain continental European countries, partially offset by strong performance in emerging markets. Adjusted operating income was down 1.3% on a constant currency basis, generic procurement margin pressures being largely offset by higher adjusted earnings from AmerisourceBergen, primarily due to the U.S. tax law changes.", "So turning next to cash flow. We continue to deliver strong cash generation. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.2 billion. During the quarter, our working capital inflow was $502 million reflecting our seasonal reduction in inventories. Cash capital expenditure was $288 million. We continue to invest in key areas to develop and differentiate our core customer proposition, as well as the upgrades to our IT systems which Alex has referred to. Overall, this resulted in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. This brings our free cash flow for the first half to $2.5 billion which is another strong performance.", "So turning next to tax. Now that we have better clarity on the tax benefit for this year and beyond, I thought it would be useful to explain the impact. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter which we calculated excluding ABC was 16.5%; this was lower than in the same quarter last year, primarily due to the recent U.S. tax law changes. For the first half the tax rate on the same basis was 20.3%. The core tax rate in our half year income statement is a blended rate. As we have in August fiscal year end, this reflects 4/12th of the old U.S. tax rate and 8/12th of the new rate. Our GAAP effective tax rate in the second quarter was 27.4% compared with 19% for the comparable period last year. This was significantly impacted by a provisional net discrete tax expense of $184 million associated with the new U.S. tax law.", "This net figure consist of current estimates of $794 million of transition taxes payable over the next 8 years, partially offset by $610 million reduction in deferred tax. In terms of the fiscal year 2018 cash tax benefit, we now expect this to be more than $350 million; this compares with our previously announced estimate of over $200 million. All these figures are current estimates which we will continue to refine.", "Finally, turning to guidance for the full financial year. We now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.05. Our guidance now incorporates the U.S. tax law changes. The expected benefits are now marginally higher than the $0.35 per share upper end of our previously indicated range. As we said before, we do not expect Rite Aid to significantly impact this years adjusted diluted net earnings per share, and as usual, this guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year.", "I'll now hand you back to Stefano.", "Stefano Pessina", "Thank you, George. So from what you have heard, I hope that you can see we remain very confident of the robustness of our business and our ability to drive growth in it. The results that we have delivered today demonstrate the real value we are creating, as we continue the transformation of our business and our updated guidance reflects the confidence we have in our ability to continue to deliver solid financial return.", "The strength of the Company like Walgreens Boots Alliance does not lie entirely with the momentary placed any single business in the Company is in it's specific business cycle. It lies in our ability to bring multiple businesses and multiple opportunities to bear, to manage our portfolio business against our market position and our partnership to create opportunities, to deliver a consistent performance as a company, overall. We have a great deal of experience of doing this and despite the ever changing markets that we see much to give us confidence that we can continue to do that going forward.", "So to conclude, as we look ahead, we are optimistic as we have always been. Thank you.", "We will now take any questions you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Elizabeth [ph] in for Ross. Given the reasons be in industry consolidation, how has that changed your view if at all on any of your capital allocation priorities?", "Stefano Pessina", "Well, it doesn't change it at all. We have our strategy and we follow our strategy trying to be consistent in what we believe. I have just announced which are our principle, and of course, we are always willing to do a deal if the deal is consistent with what we expect from a deal, if we have the right return, if we can see a way to have back indication that we used for the deal. So we are always open to the deal, we are open to joint ventures, to collaborate with other partners in order to extract synergies, to extract benefit that we can share, possibly investing capital but not enormous amount of capital. But if all these would not be possible inspite of our cost and attention to the market. We will return somehow the money today to shareholders, we are a good cash generative companies, of course we have to use the money that we create. We will try to do reserve M&A if possible, otherwise we will give back the money to the shareholders.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And in addition, your Alliance RX partnership seems to be going off great; what is it do you think is it about your offering that's really resonating with clients?", "Alexander Gourlay", "I mean it's really early stages, so we are pleased with where we are. I think there is a couple of things; I think that we're able to really work in a different way in terms of the visibility of the partnership and what the payers are seeing within that partnership. Clearly, there is more to do here but that's one part of it. Second part of it is, that we're able to connect some of the customers to our local specialty pharmacies, they are also handling the additional LDD drugs that we've been able to acquire as a result of that both in partnership with Alliance RX and expansion of our local community pharmacies within all these network. So we feel good about where we are, we think we have a more local model as more relevant along with the great partnership with Prime Therapeutics.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Robert Jones", "I guess just looking back scripts growth, up 4% on a same-store basis was maybe a little lighter than what we were expecting, given the residual benefit we thought you'd still have from the prime arrangement and obviously, a very strong flu season. Could you maybe just comment on what you saw as far as volumes on scripts in the quarter? And then I know earlier this year you had talked about the back half, seeing script growth in the 2% to 3% range; I wanted to see if that was still a valid target?", "Alexander Gourlay", "I think that remember as investors in Q2, they meet the wins of last year and it happened obviously January 1; so Q2 does contain an element of that. Secondly, the flu season was unusual in the sense, it was very strong in December and January but relatively we can feel [ph] overall, it was a pretty -- from our point of view, a pretty normal flu season. And remember, Q2 for us is these 3 months; so we saw the flu season pretty much to our level off to normal. So I wouldn't say there was much impact, I don't know volumes there. Going forward, as we said before, we still expect to grow in the back half of the year and also we expect to grow going forward. We have seen some additional marketing activities from some of our competition which again is impacting some of the volume, this is pretty much as we said and we're very confident -- we are in a really strong comparative position, not just for this year but the future as well.", "And of course, last but not the least, very importantly, the smooth transfer of the rating businesses that we have purchased to ourselves, of course again is growing on volumes in the second part of this fiscal and calendar year.", "Robert Jones", "I guess just one quick follow-up or clarification on the plan to increase wages, I think you mentioned by $100 million; that won't affect this fiscal year, is that correct? I think you said it would start in fiscal '19. And then I guess more importantly, any sense you can give us on where you think this puts you relative to others in the market where you're competing for our hourly wage earners?", "Alexander Gourlay", "Yes, we haven't given a date yet but we did say based on this calendar year; so you can assume that it will have little or no effect on this calendar -- this fiscal year. In terms of the marketplace, we review this all the time, there is quite a lot of announcements we've made from people in the marketplace and we're confident what we're doing later in this year will keep us in a very competitive situation and we continue to invest in our people in over the long-term. While this really has nothing to do with the tax benefits that George outlined in his prepared remarks, this was already something that we plan to do but obviously was helped by the fact that we had some release date as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from George Hill from RBC. Your line is open.", "George Hill", "First, I start with George; if I look at the guidance change, kind of where you guys came into the quarter versus the updated guidance -- it looks like most of the benefit is coming from the tax change, I guess I would just ask are there any changes to any of your internal operating assumptions as it relates for the guidance where we should just think of most of the changes? And then I have a quick follow-up for Alex.", "George Fairweather", "Yes, you've summarized it pretty well. Our updated guidance really reflects no change to our core growth assumptions which you can if you do the math from the midpoint to midpoint; you will see that it's really primarily from the expected tax reform benefit, so really no change. And just to add to that, I think as we said in the last two earnings call; we said that we expect fiscal '18 to be more balanced between the two halves and that was the case in fiscal '17.", "George Hill", "And then -- I guess Alex, as we think about the payer environment, we've seen the Cigna-Express deal and the CVS-Aetna deal; I guess are you seeing anything from your end that makes you concerned about future reimbursement pressure on the commercial side of the buck from payer consolidation or does this -- do the alignment of these payer organizations not seem like they're going to impact future reimbursement?", "George Fairweather", "No, too early in any case to work or to see it. But remember that for sure there will be some negative effect in these consolidation but there will be many positive effect because we are in a free market and so the people who have not taken part to the consolidation will be more willing to work a bit -- the people were independent on the market. It's too early to see the effect but overall, we would expect a slightly positive effect for us.", "Alexander Gourlay", "Thanks, George. I have nothing to add, just to those remarks, I see the same way.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "My first question is on the new store format; just if you can kind of like help us quantify what type of capital investment do you envision as required per store and how should we think about the cadence of the rollout?", "Alexander Gourlay", "These really are tests, there are tests based on a lot of stuff we've learned in the last 3 years, both on the front and product mix, and also importantly, some tests that we've got in the markets separately with healthcare services along of course with our new platform with that X on a digital platform that we already have in place. So really putting all of that together to understand that this is the test, so we really haven't got any more information on rollouts. In terms of affordability I think we've been very clear that we are fiscally very disciplined, and we will work this within the normal rules that we have in the business about returns that we would expect to get from any initiative including one, rolling out a format. And our experience in the past has been that you can achieve with a reasonable spending capital in a small box like Walgreens, a good return as you would start to shift the mix and induce more services, and also improve the value proposition overall and that's exactly what we intend to in these formats, it's proved that case and then when we're ready, we'll come back and let you know how that looks in terms of plan.", "Stefano Pessina", "This is what we're typically doing. We make a trial, spending a limited amount of money and after we refine the trail because before holding it over we work on the trial and if we know that these takes a little more time at the end of today but we believe that is worthwhile to spend sometimes and to be sure of what we want to do in order that when we hold over the clients to many stores, we have a model which is not perfect but it's quite robust. And of course, these times -- but at the end we save a lot of money because we don't under-risk to all over a trial format or any activity that after we have to adjust or probably to substitute, so we try not to waste money.", "Ricky Goldwasser", "And then my follow-up; one is on -- United and Aetna are moving to point of service rebates where there are fully insured members. Does this have any impact on the pharmacy economics as it relates to the co-pay? That's one. And second of all, when we looked at your front end comps, of the door down 0.27 in the quarter, but how should we think about the impacts from your decision to rationalize SKUs? So how should we think about comms on the same SKU basis?", "George Fairweather", "We actually believe that point of service is a good thing for the customer, so we actually think this is a good move forward, creates more visibility. And we don't expect that to be any more than normal reimbursement pressure that we've seen consistently over the years as a result of this. But we expect that pharmacy experiences to get better which should help us from an efficiency point of view and a customer care point of view, but clearly, we'll see what happens when our colleagues in the industry rollout these initiatives.", "On the front end comps, we have been consistent in saying and I think the number we gave today about the 300 basis points is the one important data point that we are driving for profitable growth. Part of that was a significant SKU reduction in the bottom quarter over stores last year and I don't have any specific data to give you today but we are pleased with the performance of these stores and are moving that thinking on as an important part of simplifying our offer, both for people who serve as customers. But also importantly, for customers who wanted to actually have a really good experience some more gains as well.", "So one of the things we have seen is good improvements in MPS as a result of that work. So there is more management to do, more work to do but remain confident in this approach and that's why we're accelerating it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Lisa Gill", "George, I understand your comments around guidance and primarily being taxed but what did the quarter look like versus your internal expectations? Would it be nicely, I think first is a straight execution; so I'm just trying to understand the way that we had it modeled versus your internal expectations?", "George Fairweather", "Overall the year-to-date is very much turning out as we had anticipated, hence really what we said today about the guidance for the full year.", "Lisa Gill", "And then just secondly, Stefano, I know you consistently get this question, the first question today was about capital allocation but if I go back to our discussion in January where we talked about vertical integration and you anticipated there would be even more opposed the CVS-Aetna deal. I want to better understand and I understand what you're talking about, whether you're talking about a deal that's consistent with returns when you think about things financially but is there something that you believe you need to strategically from where you sit today or is it just more of -- if something comes along that fits our financial criteria, that's the direction we're looking at. I just want to better understand how you're thinking about from a strategic standpoint?", "Stefano Pessina", "From a strategic standpoint, I rarely believe that our market -- our pharmacies, our stores tomorrow would have to be very, very different and so for sure from a strategic standpoint we have to change a lot but I don't believe that the change is only possible if you merge with a health plan, this is one-way to rationalize the market. Of course, if you can extract a value from it, if the value that you can extract from it is justified price to pay but this is one model, but there are many other model because we will have to change today. The stores are quite substantially in the future and the way we will serve the consumers in a very radical way; so there is much to do with our without a merger with a health plan, with or without merger with other players in these market. And I see that the main transformation in future would not be just a merger with one of the main part we mentioned would be to adapt the stores, to what the future customer will require.", "And if we go to Asia and you will see what is happening there, if you look at what the people like Feint [ph], Alibaba and others are doing or are talking of doing, you will see that at that end even we -- given us have to think in a different direction for the future and this is something that of course it's ineluctable. While a merger with an insurance company or with PBM or with whole sellers, if not ineluctable; the fight in future would not be on this basis.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Steve Valiquette", "Just curious here now that you completed the purchase of the 1,900 plus Rite Aid stores; just curious if there is anything that has surprised you on the upside or downside and now that you have all these assets under your ownership?", "George Fairweather", "No, we're really pleased to have got to this point as you can imagine and the process has been good, nothing surprised us on the upside or downside and we remain confident that we will be able to execute what is still quite a big plan. I mean adopting an over 1,900 stores into your network is not actually forward; so we still have a lot to do but we remain confident it's on plan and will give us returns that we had expected.", "Steve Valiquette", "And then just quickly, just to throw it out there since nobody else brought it up; are you able to comment at all on these broad news articles, a month or two ago suggesting there were talks going on between ABC and Walgreens on the potential buyout of the rest of ABC that you don't currently own? Just curious again, just to throw it out there. Thanks.", "Alexander Gourlay", "We don't comment on any market speculation.", "Stefano Pessina", "Maybe people are curious about that.", "Steve Valiquette", "Yes, now you're right about that.", "Stefano Pessina", "People are so curious that we too -- we have become curious reading the press.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Michael Cherny", "So I want to go back to Lisa's question little bit regarding the store of the future; I think Stefano you talked about some of the changes you're seeing globally. As you think about the positioning of where the stores are right now along some of the partnerships you're doing whether it's with Lab Corp [ph] but you know, is my expressed business. How do you think about the transition of that moving target in terms of staying ahead of whatever you think the consumer might demand in the future versus the investments that you're making now to make sure that you can react to those demands?", "Stefano Pessina", "With an additional service you can offer apart from that these additional services represent an additional source of revenue and profit which of course is not irrelevant but apart from that, it's clear that most services we'd be able to offer, the easier would be to catch the customers, to keep the customers review. Just probably in future you will have to offer your services in much more sophisticated way and knowing more about your service or your customers being able to anticipate what the customers will need. All things that everybody says today but of course it is necessary to repay the company for this preparation or it's quite a complicated one.", "This doesn't mean that we don't have to expand and to lead in the world of today and we have to do whatever we can to improve the efficiency, to improve the profitability of our company. The two things are not excluding; I was asking -- the way I was asked before, I would see that pharmacy in 5-10 years in future, I have seen pharmacy under stores and store -- quite different from now.", "But of course if now we could do a good deal with someone at reasonable terms, where we could see a substantial return, not just in earnings per share but also in IRR-- also in ADA [ph], cash return, we would be delighted to do it.", "Michael Cherny", "And then George, one just quick clarification question on the tax savings; I'm not a CPA, so I won't admit that I'm an expert here. But if you think about the difference between the original $200 million cash tax benefit, it's led to about $0.30 to $0.35 based on your previous guidance. The guidance for the midpoint in terms of the official change was $0.37, you increased that tax benefit by $150 million, how do we think about the bridge in terms of those two numbers?", "George Fairweather", "I mean they are essentially two quite different numbers because of the way the tax law is structured. The way I would try and think about, if you think about the rate then -- and what the rate is, I think the best way of looking at it is that the half year adjusted effective tax rate and that came in at 20.3%. And within that we had a discrete charge of about 0.5%, so that in effect says that for this year we anticipate -- because the half year is based on a forecast, for full year you should be thinking around the 20% mark, plus or minus for whatever discreet end up at being. In terms of the cash tax this year, when we first set the estimates, it was very quick after the law was enacted and some of the details on timing and other things have really only come out since that time, and we certainly were always very careful before we published numbers that we're absolutely sure that we're clear the numbers are really good estimates that we always feel comfortable before publishing, and so that's really what's driven the increases.", "And then I also talked a little bit about the deferred tax and repatriation tax and again that's just taken us a little bit of time to work through to publish the estimates that we've put in our numbers today. I'm afraid it's really quite complex and of course, as I said in the prepared remarks, because of our fiscal year starting 4 months before the tax reform came into place, then when you're thinking about next year, you have to remember that we'll obviously have a full year of the numbers. But everything, all the numbers I'd stressed are provisional under the accounting we have 12 months to finalize this and of course we're overtime, increasingly seeing more clarification from authorities on exactly how to interpret the various changes that have come in at a very, very short period of time.", "Michael Cherny", "So the 20% -- I just apologize for this -- should be a good tax rate for the second half of the year or the annualized full rate? I just want to make sure we get this quick.", "George Fairweather", "I mean, as a proxy, the way the accounting works; for the first half of the year you have to -- businesses have to forecast your full year rate before discreet and not based on your forecast and that is what you use for the half year. So the half year rate is a good indication but it can vary obviously depending on the mix. In the second half it's different versus what we forecasted internally this time and it can also change depending on the discreet which of course, vary quarter by quarter; some quarters they could be positive, some quarters it could be charged.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Your line is open.", "Eric Percher", "So as the discussion on consolidation brought to bear, it sounds like you would expect that there will be some pressure overtime on volume and reimbursement but that's a reasonable expectation, you would do the same. I wanted to get your thoughts on relative to the commentary on both, past 3 years what you've seen in share gain and reimbursement. How do you view the steady state of growth? What do you think the opportunities are for growth over the next 3 -- do they look similar given those headwinds on consolidation?", "And then on reimbursement pressure, are we at a point where your relationships have evolved to a place where there may not be as much pressure as we've seen in the last couple of years?", "Alexander Gourlay", "I think it's always hard to have a crystal ball over 3 years but yes, we are assuming that we have the same opportunity to grow as we have done the last 3 years. So I think in terms of volume, that would be a reasonable assumption to take. In terms of margin pressure, it's harder to anticipate at the moment but we see the same trends right now, so as we build and think forward and think about how we are preparing the business for the future as Stefano mentioned earlier within the pharmacy, we're looking for similar reimbursement pressure as the past, will ebb and flow a bit year to year, but there is no indication there is going to be any materially different. What is going to be different we think is the ability to take care of customers better and link them better to a total offer.", "Going forward, we mentioned quite a lot about our investments in data and technology and we're doing that for a reason which is to try include a more joined up experience for our customers and we see pharmacy as the area where we have got in the next 3 years probably more opportunity going forward. So I would be happy to see the future in pharmacy in the next 3 years.", "Eric Percher", "On that investment I heard you speak to data and efficiency; I would think that your peers are also going to be looking at clinical capabilities to make these transactions impact cost. What is your view on investment today and the ability to impact the pharmacists enabled in this part of the care team?", "Alexander Gourlay", "We see it the same way. I'll go back to what Stefano said many times and I agree with this, which is you don't have to be vertically integrated to be able to provide the same services to the payers, as well as to the patients. So you can assume with the investments we're making that we are going down the same route and of course we're getting there as I said already in my prepared remarks, and we're in a pretty decent shape at the moment.", "Eric Percher", "And I just wanted to squeeze in the $90 million legal benefit this quarter, could you just define that for us?", "Alexander Gourlay", "We really have nothing else to add to that Eric. I mean I know obviously we can't speak about it, it is what it is, so we have nothing else to add.", "George Fairweather", "At some places as you can see, it's just -- it's an accrual related to ongoing U.S. regulatory models.", "Stefano Pessina", "We have our ways to review carefully the potential risks that we have and we are account for consistently what we see.", "Operator", "Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gerald Gradwell for any closing remarks.", "Gerald Gradwell", "Thank you, thank you all for your questions. As I mentioned in the beginning, this was a new format in the presentation for us, so while we're talking to -- anyone who wishes to talk to us, afterwards the IR team are all here, Ashish, Debra, Jay, Patrick and myself to take your questions over the next few days and any feedback you have on the presentation format will be much appreciated as well.
