My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim McHugh", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's first quarter 2017 results. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and Scott Estes, CFO.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances as projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com.", "Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I want to highlight three significant points regarding our first quarter 2017 results. First, we disposed of over $1.1 billion in non-core assets, bring our private tape as a percentage of revenue and 93.1%, and using proceeds to retire $1.1 billion of high rate, secured debt and preferred securities. Second, this balance sheet focused capital allocation, reduced net debt to book capitalization to 35.8% and net debt to EBITDA to 5.26%; and nearly half turn reduction from just a year ago. And third, we reported 2.2% total portfolio same-store NOI growth for the quarter, and we are reaffirming our guidance of 2% to 3% total portfolio same-store growth for 2017 which as a reminder does not include any benefit from leap year adjustment.", "And, with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for some remarks on the quarter. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tim. We were pleased with our first quarter results, predictable and right on-track characterize this quarter. Words that may sound boring to some but speak of the stable growth that an A quality premium portfolio of healthcare real estate assets provides. The effective new supply hardly coupled with little differentiation in cap rates for A versus B assets has made us a net seller of senior housing assets this quarter. We have taken that capital and redeployed it behind the Welltower family of operators and reduced the leverage to historic low levels.", "Welltower's senior housing presence in dynamic metro markets on the eastern west coasts, as well as in Canada and the UK continue to provide a significant competitive performance advantage. We continue to reinvent the way we run our business with a focus on integration, efficiency and data. This contributes to continued decreases in our G&A costs. You see, we look to model the most successful growth companies of tomorrow and not bloat it [ph] inefficient structures of yesterday. Our unique focus on investing only in premiums assets has given our senior housing operators crucial pricing power and resilient organic performance that tells a very different story from national trends. Our leap year adjusted RevPAR was up over % despite a number of issues seen in Q1 like elevated and prolonged flu [ph].", "Shankh and Mercedes will offer more detailed comments on senior housing supply but we are hearing that non-recourse construction financing is more limited than we've seen in years which may dampen the speckle of building we've seen in many markets. This leads us to believe that supply issues that have been impacting the senior housing industry may in fact start to moderate.", "Mercedes will offer some comments on the investment environment but I will say that today discipline is a hallmark of our investment strategy. There are many lessons learned from the asset aggregation period of our past that today guide how we deploy our shareholders capital. We will continue to refine our portfolio by shedding non-core assets where we do not see an adequate return on CapEx dollars, and reinvest that capital in a next generation of our senior housing assets that will become an effective partner to the major health systems in the top markets in which Welltower is concentrated.", "Now over to you Mercedes.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Thank you, Tom. I will start today by describing our first quarter 2017 investment activity and will follow with some market perspectives, as well as an update on our value enhancing initiative.", "During the first three months of 2017 we completed $217 million of new investments, all with existing Welltower partners including new perspective senior living and Avery Healthcare. These follow-on transactions consist of recently constructed buildings and include a $104 million of new acquisitions, a blended yield of 6.4%. We also faced nine development properties into service during the quarter with a total value of $186 million and a yield of 7%. Our ability to add recently constructed assets to our portfolio at attractive stabilized fields is especially valuable given our disposition strategy.", "As you heard in the first quarter, our dispositions totaled $1.1 billion and yielded 6.6%. These dispositions included a combination of loan payout, outright sales and the completion of the previously announced monetization of a 75% interest in 11 Brookdale assets into our Cindat/Union Life joint venture for $268.5 million. Scott Estes will describe our uses of proceeds in more detail.", "To echo Tom's opening comments, Welltower's investment in dispositions this quarter highlights our disciplined capital allocation and spending. On the investments front, we're pursuing earnings in NAV accretive opportunities which are often off-market while at the same time we're careful to reject those deals that don't offer adequate risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. Our disposition strategy is designed to improve portfolio quality while selectively capturing the benefit of buyer demand and attractive market pricing.", "Speaking of market pricing; this fair to say that cap rates remain aggressive, especially for widely marketed portfolios. Our focus on all markets deals and repeat business throughout our operator partnership keeps us mostly out of that fray but as owner, we are observing these trends with great interest as local and foreign institutional investors growing appetite for healthcare assets with a premium on quality portfolios like ours.", "Regarding new supplies, we continue to monitor changes in occupancy and other operating metric which may result from new competition. But we remain optimistic about our portfolios resiliency and are encouraged by the slowing in construction financing and starts of recent quarters. As you know, starts peak in the third quarter of 2015 are continuing to moderate. Non-recourse construction financing have become scarce in the last six to nine months and spreads have widened 50 to 75 basis points along with the increase in LIBOR. This has resulted in an all -- in a cost increase of as much as 150 basis points.", "While starts data is volatile from quarter to quarter, we continue to believe that we will see a dampening from construction cost increases as we look into the second half of the year. In addition to anecdotal and evidence of these trends, the year-end seniors housing industry report published by CBRE has detailed discussions on the topic for anyone looking for more color.", "I want to end by sharing a few examples of our most recent asset management initiatives. First, we're helping operators implement industry leading systems to better match staffing levels to current census and acuity, and to improve billing accuracy for the services provided. These tools are tailored to fit each operating platform and should have a meaningful impact on revenues.", "On the expense side, we have previously talked about our savings resulting from group purchasing of property insurance. We're now looking to expand into other products such as health and wellness benefits coverage. And finally, we're leveraging our outpatient medical teams experience to produce maintenance expenses in our seniors housing communities. These projects use to scale and the intellect of the Welltower platform to drive sustainable improvements and cash flow. We're excited about the possibilities that we will post to you on progress.", "Now I'm going to turn the call over to Shankh who is going to discuss portfolio performance.", "Shankh Mitra", "Thank you, Mercedes and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly results with an emphasis in our senior housing business and focus on some geographic detail that many of you have recently asked about.", "Our overall same-store NOI increased 2.1% year-over-year. The triple net portfolio continues to produce stable and reliable performance. Our senior housing triple net segment grew 3.2% and the long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.4%. Growth remains healthy and payments remain secured. Same-store NOI for outpatient medical portfolio grew 2.4%; all three of this business segments are in line with our expectations that we describe to you in the year end call in February. As a reminder, we don't include fee-related income in our same-store metrics. We think this provides more accurate picture of underlying performance.", "Our senior housing operating segment reported growth of 0.9% above our initial budget for the quarter. The headline results are partly lower due to leap year effect, sales in 2016 which benefited those operators that bill residents on a part DM basis adjusting for one extra days of NOI in Q1 of 2016; on a comparable basis, Q1 '17 shows same-store NOI grew 1.9% despite a 90 basis points decline in sure occupancy, revenue increased by 2.3% due to a 4.1% increase in RevPAR on a leap year adjusted basis. Strong pricing power is the hallmark of Class A real estate and long-term value preservation.", "Operating expenses increased 3% for shop; adjusting for the leap year, same-store expenses were up 3.5%. Labor expense remains elevated but the growth rate is down from recent highs. 2016 UK living wage growth is still impacting Q1 numbers but we expect overall operating expense to moderate in rest of the year in UK. Overall, senior housing demand supply remains largely healthy with the pockets of imbalance due to heightened deliveries in certain markets. We have seen overall industry occupancy drop as new deliveries lease up. It is important to understand that move outs in the quarter was elevated due to a heightened and prolonged flu season.", "Much has been written about this topic with a focus on overall population data from CDC. If you look at 65 plus segment of the population as we do; outpatient visits due to flu increased 70% from last year and was 35.5% higher than the epic 2017 flu season. The hospitalization rate in this segment almost quadrupled from last year but was 50% lower than 2015. While debt due to flu is almost up 4x over last year, it is a lot lower than 2015. How do the stats translate into our business; quality operators learned valuable lesson in 2015 and were much better prepared to deal with a bad flu season this year. These precautions have led to many more temporary resident bans to protect our resident population.", "Say for example, what we observe in the New York metro region. While we saw strong demand that manifested in 5% plus RevPAR growth in New York MSA, admissions banned in a handful of our communities contributed to an occupancy decline of 2,280 basis points resulting at flattish NOI growth in this market which usually ranks amongst our top markets quarter-after-quarter in NOI growth. We think this admissions bans will prove beneficial to rest of the year's results as they have held to protect our resident population, providing us a base to build upon as we enter the traditional moving season in late Q2 into Q3.", "These markets -- in markets where we did not experience this occupancy headwinds, we continue -- our continued strong pricing power manifested into strong NOI growth in markets like D.C., Southern California, Toronto and London. Our core market versus non-core market performance spread narrowed this quarter relative to last year. Other markets remain relatively flat but core market growth has receded from mid-single digit growth due to flu situations in New York and New England. We expect core market growth to pick up in the second half as we build back occupancy.", "It is important to note that we also observed an interesting divergence in our IL versus AL performance from last year. While same-store NOI growth in our IL communities was higher than that of AL communities primarily due to lower expense growth in IL we observed higher occupancy decline in IL versus AL. While one quarter does not make a trend, we will continue to keep close eye on this topic. In conclusion, our operating metrics were as expected in Q1 with the exception of [indiscernible] portfolio which outperforms our initial expectations. We're excited about the year and at the prospect of our operating performance. We believe our operating portfolio provides significant total return or unlevered IRR opportunity driven by three levers; occupancy upside, rate growth and normalized expense trends.", "We believe our sustained rate growth in the face of new supply exhibits not only the quality of real estate that we own but also the value propositions senior living provides for its growing need based resident population. While regency [ph] buyers may dominate the mindshare in very short-term, we are confident our assets class in general and Welltower in particular offers a unique opportunity to medium and long-term investors. This is particularly interesting as investors think about comparing our portfolio to many core group asset class with mid-90% occupancy level at the time when the economy is essentially at full employment. We hope as our growth rate starts to reaccelerate in the second half of the year relative to the first half and shows resilient growth in next couple of years; the public markets will share the enthusiasm that we encounter every day from world's most astute private investors.", "With that, I'll pass it over to Scott Estes, our CFO. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Alright, thanks, Shankh and good morning, everybody. From a financial perspective we're off to a solid start to the year as we continue to demonstrate the capital allocation discipline that we've been articulating over the past year. As we continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio, our corporate finance team has ensured that our balance sheet has made commensurate improvement as well.", "I'll start off by emphasizing three specific first quarter financial highlights. First, we generated over $1.1 billion in disposition proceeds during the quarter which were used to repay both secured debt and preferred stock leaving us with limited debt maturities throughout the remainder of the year. Second, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet through these pay-offs resulting in enhanced credit metrics and a reduction in undepreciated book leverage at 35.8%, its lowest ordering level in nearly five years. And third, we dramatically improved the operational efficiency of our platform as first quarter G&A declined by more than 30% from the comparable quarter last year.", "Most importantly, our stronger balance sheet and nearly $3 billion in current liquidity will allow us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year. I'll begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our first quarter financial results, our dividend and changes to our supplement and earnings presentation.", "We started off the year with solid financial results relative to our expectations generating normalized FFO of $1.05 per share versus $1.13 per share last year. Earnings declined as expected due to the nearly $4 billion in dispositions completed since the beginning of 2016 and our efforts to reduce leverage by nearly four full percentage points over the last 12 months. As a reminder, we're no longer providing an official fed per year [ph] calculation this year but are providing additional detail regarding straight line rent, CapEx, non-cash interest expense and stock based compensation at the bottom of exhibit 2 in our earnings release.", "Our G&A came in $31 million for the first quarter, this represented a significant year-over-year reduction from $46 million in 1Q '17 as we continue to enhance our operational efficiency. Based on the strong start to the year, we're tracking at or slightly below our initial G&A guidance of $135 million for the full year. We recognized significant gains on asset sales of $244 million during the quarter. This was partially offset by small impairments and a few held for sale properties and an unconsolidated entity. We also recognized charges related to our secured debt extinguishments and preferred stock redemption.", "In 2017 we began capitalizing most transaction costs which is why you see a zero in that line in the income statement this quarter; but I would note that the $11.7 million in other expenses includes some transaction costs primarily from deals that occurred in 2016, as well as severance costs.", "Moving onto dividends, we'll pay our 184th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 22 of the $0.87 per share representing a current dividend yield of 5%. We made several changes to our supplement this quarter to simplify and streamline its presentation. On page 6 based on analyst and investor feedback, we did refer the presentation of our triple net payment coverage stratification back to a chart format. And I think one notable addition that was made this quarter is on page 18 where we now provide additional detail on our debt broken out by local currencies, as well as related hedges.", "Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet; I think the most significant capital event this quarter was the $1.1 billion in proceeds generated from dispositions to $65 million in long pay-offs and over $1 billion of property sales which included $244 million in gains. We used the majority of the proceeds to repay $806 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.6% during the quarter which lowered the average rate on our remaining secured debt at 3.7%. We also redeemed all 11.5 million shares of our 6.5% Series J preferred stock during the quarter valued at $288 million; and in terms of equity we generated approximately $112 million in proceeds under our [indiscernible] programs during the quarter. So as a result we have nearly $3 billion of current liquidity based on $2.5 billion of credit line availability and nearly $400 million in cash on balance sheet.", "Our significant secured debt and preferred stock pay-offs allowed us to significantly enhance our balance sheet metrics during the first quarter. As of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization declined 35.8% representing a 116 basis points sequential improvement from year end while net debt to enterprise value declines at 28.8%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.26x while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage for the quarter increased to 4.3x and 3.5x respectively. Our secured debt declined to only 9.6% of total asset at quarter end representing a significant 240 basis points decline from the previous quarter.", "So I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2017 guidance. First in terms of same-store NOI growth based on the solid first quarter results generated across our portfolio. We're maintaining our blended growth forecast of 2% to 3% for the full year. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisition other than that was completed during the first quarter and our 2017 guidance. Our guidance does include an additional $265 million of development funding on projects currently underway, and an additional $375 million in development conversions at a blended projected stabilized yield of 7.9%. In terms of our full year disposition forecast, we continue to anticipate a total of $2 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.6% based on $1.1 billion completed to-date and $900 million of incremental proceeds throughout the remainder of the year. And finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share.", "So in conclusion, our enhanced balance sheet in $3 billion and current liquidity as a result of our capital allocation discipline continues to provide us with maximum financial flexibility in the current environment.", "So at this point, I'd turn it back to you Tom for some closing comments.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. So let's talk about the deal of the week. We were quite pleased to see the excitement generated by Duke's decision to sell its medical office portfolio. In our almost 50 years in this business we have never seen such enthusiasm for healthcare real estate. Should we all be surprised? No.", "Revisited data indicates the value of hospital and medical office real estate in the U.S. to be $1 trillion. And by the way, 82% of this real estate is owned by health systems and physician groups with only 10% held by REITs and 8% by institutional investors. Over $600 billion of that is attributable to hospital brick and motor and the balance is MOBs. You should know that the majority of this hospital real estate was built around a fee for service model; so if it takes 10 days to fix a hip fracture, the hospital submitted a bill to the payer and got its cost reimbursed plus the margin. That model requires lot of real estate.", "Today however, we are moving to a value based model; if it takes you 10 days to fix a hip but the payer will only reimburse the hospital for the equivalent of a two-day stay, the hospital must eat those 8 days. As the focus increasingly shifts to outcomes, underperforming hospitals will be under further pressure. You should not be surprised that 52% of U.S. hospitals lost money last year. Like many malls, strip centers and suburban office; much of the hospital real estate in this country is obsolete and health systems are looking to evolve their real estate footprint while they invest heavily in other areas like technology.", "The shift in patient demand is being reflected in real estate demand as spread between hospital cap rates and MOBs continues to widen. A new generation of outpatient medical real estate connected to lower acuity settings like senior housing and modern post-acute care needs to be built in order to facilitate the transition to value-based healthcare. This is a huge opportunity, perhaps the most compelling opportunity the real estate industry has seen in decades. So the enthusiasm for Duke's healthcare asset is yet another indication that we are finally being recognized as an institutional investment class. If only a small portion of the 82% of this real estate transitions to REITs and other institutional investors, it's tens of billions of dollars investment opportunity. No company is better positioned than Welltower to take advantage of this opportunity, so stay tuned.", "Now Holly, open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you just quickly it sounds like there is no change in your -- or you said there is no change in your full year outlook for same-store NOI but I was just wondering was there any change in the composition of getting to that and I guess specifically are you still in that kind of 1% to 3% change growth in your -- in the same-store shop NOI for the year?", "Scott Estes", "This is Scott Estes. You are correct; there is no change to any of the components to the build up for the same-store NOI.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you. And then Tom, I'm just wondering, I know it's only past the house but the potential changes in the ACA -- does that give you any changes in the way you think about being in the post-acute business and I guess particularly some of the changes that we're talking about for Medicaid?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, you know, it's still very early to tell. I think some of the proposed rhetoric that was coming out from CMS was initially seemed to be taking as negative. Actually it could easily be positive, I think it's just we have to stay tuned. You know, I come back to the fact that we need to move to lowering healthcare costs and improving outcomes. The real estate footprint that I just talked about is limiting the ability to reduce costs in healthcare delivery and I think the proposal for the repeal of Obamacare is very much focused on improving outcomes reducing cost and doing that by increasing competition. And I do believe that this should drive more of this hospital real estate to shut down. We cannot afford to keep the lights on in hospitals that are continuing to lose money in this country and I think that's going to drive a lot of senses to other lower acuity settings like post-acute care and seniors housing, and medical office buildings which really will become primary sites of care versus the traditional acute care hospital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great. Okay, thank you for that. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord.", "Paul Morgan", "Hi, good morning. In terms of -- do you have any update on John Hopkins [ph] and kind of how you expect to really -- coming the first year of that venture to evolve and then maybe -- you know, any update on progress kind of with other systems with similar ventures?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Sure, this is Mercedes Kerr. The conversations that we're having with John Hopkins Center are primarily around two topics; research and collaboration, clinical collaboration and both of those conversations are actually very active and starting more tangibility well with respect to the kinds of projects or specific implementations that we might seek to collaborate on together. So we're working on the research project that we've talked about before having to do with outcomes and quality measures and indicators for seniors housing, as well as a collaboration primarily, and some of the markets that they are expanding into for example, DC. So nothing particular that I can share beyond that today but just I suppose giving you a little bit of comfort around the fact that this is -- lead publications are really going in the right direction and turning more tangible projects for us together.", "With respect to other health systems, the same is true. Conversations that were a little bit more general or conceptual in the past year let's say are now turning into much more specific tangible opportunities that we are pursuing and we hope to have something to talk about yet this year.", "Paul Morgan", "Thanks. And in some other question you commented about higher loan cost for developers kind of helping the supply picture as you look into '18; are you thinking about capitalizing on the balance sheet that you have as you look forward and maybe kind of reaccelerating senior housing development into that, maybe decelerations looking into '18 and '19?", "Mercedes Kerr", "No. You know, we're not -- we're setting as we go to -- supposed to with respect to development, we see a lot of opportunities, especially from our existing operator, and there are some certain operators that grow more specifically through development, others grow through acquisitions and so I don't see any radical changes with respect to our approach there.", "Shankh Mitra", "It's Shankh, I will just add that if you look at -- you know, if your question is specifically about we filling the void for the construction lending, as you know we're not a lender, we have no ambition to be a lender but we do think that finally the construction cost are going us. As Mercedes said, with LIBOR also on the spread; so that's something very interesting, we observe the cost are going up, recently we heard from a big bang that one of the constructional loans which was priced at LIBOR plus 300, they could not syndicate it. So we're pretty excited about what is -- the industry is going, you know, there probably have been too much development that should not have happened but were they excited where the industry is going and we will find opportunities like we have seen in New York where its core development and we'll continue to pursue those.", "Paul Morgan", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin", "Thanks, good morning. Just trying to sort of put together just couple of the pieces on sort of -- you know, the targeted markets and the discussions you guys have been leading Tom for the last year or so and you know, I understand a lot of the new investment which is relatively modest is with existing partners but when I see cities like [indiscernible] Lancaster, Warsaw, etcetera; I know you're -- to some extent at the mercy of where your partners are expanding but how do you think that just -- how are you guys affecting a more targeted strategy to really build in where you think buy close to [ph] -- you know, premier market as you describe it?", "Tom DeRosa", "So Josh, I would say that our investment strategy is very much built around our operators. These operators are largely concentrated in major market but because they all share a focus on the premium part of the market, there are many smaller markets, you mentioned Rawly [ph], Rawly is a fantastic market, it is a high growth market, it behaves like a major metro market in a state where there -- it is not easy to build because North Carolina is the certificate of need state [ph]. So we are not red lining some of the smaller markets, particularly in the South or even in the Midwest because there are towns, whether it be Michigan or Madison, Wisconsin that behave a lot like the types of major markets that the same drivers in terms of job growth and population growth are seeing in some of these smaller markets.", "So in summary Josh, I'd say, we're focused about the deploying capital behind the partners. If there are partners that do not have that focus, those are likely the assets that you have seen us sell or will sell in the future. And we will again continue to be laser focused on deploying capital into markets where you see positive demographic factors.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes, and the one thing that I would add to that is; some of the conversations that we're having with health systems do center around development. It's not the bulk of it but there will be some element of that and those are conversations that we are driving, and they will potentially in seniors housing as a component. But my point is to say that we are actually on the forefront of being proactive and trying to select our markets and select our partners and so that -- you know, on one hand we're receptive and responsive to our operators and on the other hand we're also trying to help guide the conversation with the data and other relationships that we can bring to bear.", "Justin Skiver", "And one more point I'd like to make Josh, this is Justin Skiver, SVP of Underwriting; is that the distinction between triple net and our ideas important in that a lot of the deals that you're referencing are triple net based structures as opposed to an idea where we would expect a steep higher growth from the portfolio than triple net.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay, that makes sense as well. And then just a second question, just trying to figure out the calculation on this VPR impacts; you know, just taking an apples-to-apples comps to the others and I understand the shop impact is about 100 basis points, just sort of finger in the air that makes a lot of sense when last in the quarter; but these are the rate impact, it was 180 basis points but the OpEx impact was only 50 basis points; so what drives the difference in leap year impacts on the different parts of the NOI?", "Shankh Mitra", "Josh, it's Shankh. So if you think about expenses, roughly half of the expenses are fixed and half of the expenses are floating, right. So only that portion of the expenses which you have floating labor cost and others are food, that will only be impacted but if you have a fixed expense category, that will not be impacted. On the revenue basis obviously, we're only -- remember, we're only looking at the 29th day of February last year, and if you charge on a per DM basis, you have a revenue. So if you charge on a monthly basis, you have no difference. So it is only impacted some operators that charge on a per DM basis on the revenue side and on the expense side it's only impact the cost of the expense category.", "Joshua Raskin", "That makes a lot of sense. So the OpEx of 50 basis points makes a ton of sense that 50, 56 and floating; but again, I guess I'm just struggling with the rate; if you're charging on a per DM basis, why would rate be as much as 180 basis points, right, because I'm assuming not everyone is even charging on a per DM.", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, because where do you see the most impact at higher there as to entry market like Boston and New York, that's why the rates are much higher. So when you get that operator in those -- in New England and New York market, where you have one higher extra grade, that impacts the overall report than if you just compare to our overall portfolio, it's not just those markets. For example, I told you -- New York report was 5%. So you have one day of change in New York where you have an operator who charges on a per DM basis you have a much bigger impact.", "Joshua Raskin", "Right, so it's really a mixed issue as well.", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, it's a market mix issue.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay, that's perfect. Thanks again, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC.", "Michael Carroll", "Thanks. Tom, can you give us a little bit more color on the plans for future dispositions, is there anything else we should expect that you could sell outside of the $2 billion that's included in guidance?", "Tom DeRosa", "Michael, we are -- we look at our portfolio over the long-term and we're always trying to be in front of where we might see changes in a market that might impact performance. So it's hard to tell you that -- to give you a specific number, we're also opportunistic. If someone is willing to pay us a cap rate on assets that for a variety of reasons maybe very strategic for them but are not so strategic for us, we'll take advantage of that. So I often say both in my personal life and in my business life, real estate is always for sale. So I think you have to be opportunistic and I think over the long-term I think that protects the shareholder.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And can you kind of talk about -- I believe on previous calls you highlighted that Genesys [ph] had some purchase options that they could exercise in 2017; should we expect that tenants exercise as purchase options and how you're thinking about that portfolio going forward?", "Shankh Mitra", "Michael, that's a very good question. So as we mentioned Genesys had some purchase options and is that to echo as [indiscernible] from our portfolio that expired on March 31 and we're pretty excited because their purchase options were priced at a certain cap rate and the cap rates on those assets have come down significantly from there when we exercised those when we struck that deal. So what happened because of this Genesys credit as you know has significantly improved in last nine months, so -- and that happened obviously a month ago, we are currently negotiating three term sheets with various buyers, so we're hopeful that you will see further reduction in Genesys concentration as we go to through this year but more to come on that, stay tuned.", "Michael Carroll", "Great. And is there a timing on this term sheets or are those completed yet or is that just kind of still in the negotiation process?", "Shankh Mitra", "It's in the negotiation phase, too early to comment but definitely as I said, stay tuned, there will be more to come on this topic.", "Michael Carroll", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks. Good morning. So just wanted to get to the shop portfolio, the 0.9% first quarter same-store NOI growth was underwhelming relative to your nearest REIT peers. I guess what you're saying kind of not to be viewed as a trend maybe for the full year; but looking back at your comments last quarter, you were expecting flattish occupancy and you got a 90 basis point reduction in occupancy this quarter, was that in your expectations? And how much of the performance caused you to think a little bit about tweaking down the guidance for same-store this year?", "Shankh Mitra", "Rich, that's a very good question. So if you think about when we said last year, last call about flattish occupancy, we talked about the entire year, not Q1. So Q1 -- if you think about, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks; Q1 same-store NOI growth for the shop portfolio is actually higher, not lower. So what is the difference? First thing is the revenue growth -- it is underwhelming as you said for sure but if you look at the revenue growth, it's actually higher than most peers I believe. So we've got slightly lower occupancy but we got much better rates, and we are -- we have no desire to decrease same-store idea guidance for the year, we do not change the guidance quarter to quarter on different segments but I think we're trying to tell you we are more excited, not less, about that particular business and as we throw -- think about the entire year.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, I just wanted to break that up a little bit and see if I can get some more but I appreciate that. And then Tom, maybe you used the disciplined a lot in your opening remarks; can you quantify discipline as it relates to your process in the Duke sale?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, we were certainly interested in that portfolio; I think everybody was interested in that portfolio, they ran a very competitive process. I don't really know any other details Rich regarding who was in the process but there must have been lots of players to drive the price to where it eventually settled. And I think that's a positive for our industry and this property type.", "Rich Anderson", "Maybe I could ask it this way; I know this is a medical office and just a general focus on lower cost environment is your bread and butter investment approach for the hearing now. Let's call it 47/45 cap rate, I don't know -- we can argue with the numbers but how many -- how does that compare to the value you see and what you're looking at? In other words, if let's just say the numbers four/five -- if you're looking at medical office in -- the conversations you're having, how many basis points is that lower than what your dialogues are starting?", "Tom DeRosa", "We've never seen cap rates at that level. And if cap rates have been at that level, they've been situations that we have not participated in.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes, I guess let me add a little bit to that and we've been successful in acquiring at more favorable cap rates, let me put it that way and with respect to this portfolio, I mean I would tell you I think it's -- there were a lot of overlaps with ours and certainly we were very interested both in terms of market concentrations, as well as tenant roaster. It's probably the second best portfolio out there after our portfolios of medical office buildings, and so we were very keenly interested. But there is a point where naturally it needs to make sense to our shareholders and we need to know that it will be accretive. And considering that we have a very successful property management platform which tends to operate at a far higher margin frankly than just an anything we've seen out there comparatively. You know, we thought that we did a good job of underwriting it and then remaining disciplined about it.", "Tom DeRosa", "And I would say that it is -- it's our strategy in the future to build our medical office, outpatient medical business through the relationships that we have formed with the major health systems. So as we keep telling you, stay tuned for that, we don't have anything to announce to you today but the -- those relationships we believe will bear fruit overtime and we'd rather build our asset portfolio in that way than in participating in major marketed auctions, whether that would be in the senior housing space and you know you've not seen us build our senior housing asset base through auctions, we've done it through our relationships and that's what we're trying to duplicate in the outpatient medical business.", "Rich Anderson", "So it's 4.5 -- 100 basis points lower than your radar right now? 50 basis points lower, 75?", "Tom DeRosa", "I'd say there are deals trading at five -- probably 50 basis points higher we've seen.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, thanks.", "Mercedes Kerr", "That's fair, we haven't seen the 5% reach until now.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, we have not, exactly Mercedes.", "Rich Anderson", "Good enough. Thanks very much.", "Tom DeRosa", "Alright, Rich.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thank you. So just -- Shankh, going back on your comments on IL and AL, I thought it was interesting; you mentioned the performance was a little better in IL but certain metrics was better in the other category. I'm just wondering given all the supply in AL and limited supply in IL, what do you think is driving sort of this difference? And what is that -- what are the implications going forward in terms of your preference for IL versus AL?", "Shankh Mitra", "Vikram, I think that's a great question. As I said, one quarter does not make a trend, I will tell you that not only the occupancy was better in AL but also the revenue growth was better in AL. So do we have -- does that mean that we have a better preference for AL versus IL today? The answer is no. We have preference for best quality real estate in the best market run by best operator, and that wherever we find that opportunity, whether it's IL versus AL, we do not think about that any differently; it depends on that particular asset in the particular sub-market run by the particular operator and we think about a lot of -- sort of supply ways coming. As you know, as marked into [indiscernible] as we have for IL today, and we love independent living as a business, absolutely love it. It is a relatively more cyclical business and we have to think about that as we -- you know, in particular time in the economy which is essentially at full employment, so we do think about that.", "And the other point I would tell you is, despite all of the talk of the supply, our AL portfolio is in very, very good markets and they are need-based products; so obviously the care component of it, we cannot overemphasize that what's the importance of operators in this business. So we're seeing some -- starting to see some differentiation but it's too early to comment.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, thanks. Then just second question; can you give us some more color and maybe some perspective on the UK; one of your peers has at least decided in part to move away. Just how are your recent developments that have come online? How are they being -- how are they performing and just expectations for future opportunities in that market?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Hello, it's [indiscernible]. So I mean, we've historically restricted ourselves and our partner relationships to our peers, so we don't have the same structural impediments as you saw HDP notes in the past. And as you know, we've got a full service team there on the ground in London. We've opened up, I think 15 buildings or so in the relatively recent past and occupancy across that portfolio has done really well. So we're quite pleased with the work of our partners at Sunrise Grade 12 [ph]. I've been doing on filling those buildings, we've got a good rate, as well as good occupancy. So we feel further cautiously optimistic about how the market is developing there. Again remember, you see the starting of supplement, buildings on average half the age of the UK, the UK's on an average is 20-years old and talk about not fit for this session, we're bringing online high quality brand new buildings into superior markets. So it's the [indiscernible] have good occupancy and good occupancy growth. So we're happy to put a good quarter together and we're optimistic for the rest of the year.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And if I can clarify just on pricing in the UK, you talked about in the U.S. being flattish; and any notable changes in the UK?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, the UK had some structural costs increases as you know. Shankh noted the National Living Wage which has been escalating quite quickly although it has started the temper, and because of that the whole industries had to push pricing up; and that pricing industry-wide has obviously stuck across the industry. We're very luck that we're very highly privately pay focused, so we're in a business to consumer market in some ways rather than some of our peers operations which are receiving large amounts of government reimbursement, on average the private sector has been pushing rate in the UK between sort of 4% to 6% per market rate; and I'd say that's sort of the average for our partners as well in the market.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi good morning. Thanks for the time. Just going back to one of the earlier question on skilled nursing, you said, you've been focused on kind of the newest operator trends which to me kind of talk towards Genesis' focus on the short-term rehab and that clearly seems to be one of the focal points in terms of potential pressures from CMS' new initiative. So, just wondering if that changes your thinking on how you are focused with your remaining post-acute portfolio, are you still committed to being exposed to Genesis in their short-term therapy business over the long-term?", "Bryan Hickman", "This is Bryan Hickman. I guess I'll answer your question in two parts. First, to talk a little bit about our thoughts on the CMS rule that came out. So, for CMS' initial estimates of the impact of the proposed rule to modest with changes in payments to for profits and freestanding facilities of minus 1.1% and minus 0.5%, respectively. So, this is yes at the high single digit cost of Medicare revenue that some are suggesting maybe significantly overstated. ", "Second, ACA, the skilled nursing industry's lobbying group has been involved in the design of this payment reform package with that several years with input from providers across the industry. So, CMS did not create this proposal in a vacuum. We've been hearing from several of our operators that the proposed rule contains provisions that will help operators deliver care more efficiently. For example the increase in the allowance for utilization of concurrent and group therapy seems like a positive, especially when you consider that in the context of our Genesis PowerBack properties which are highly rehab focused.", "Finally, the consensus on the pre-rule is that it's long way from implementation and there is going to be commenting on over the next several months of the year. An analogic credit is the revision to the long-term care regulation with CMS implemented in late 2016. Those were originally proposed in early 2015. So, that also has played out over about 18 months and further more operators had ample opportunity to provide commentary directly to CMS regarding that changes. So, we expect to see that play out similarly.", "As it relates to our PowerBack portfolio, we believe that that is a -- has been a good investment for us and we continued to invest with Genesis. We have a construction start that began with them in the Philadelphia metro market, a PowerBack property and then one that's coming online in on the New Jersey side of their operations this year.", "Tom DeRosa", "So Juan, I think as Bryan stated, we're going to continue to look to invest in the next-generation of post-acute care assets whether that will be with Genesis or maybe there will be some other operators that are bringing this next-generation of post-acute care to the market. It is very clear to us, because of the amount of time we spend with the major academic and superregional health systems that this is an area that is keenly important to them, and so we are working with these health systems to try and refine the infrastructure that post-acute care can be delivered in effectively. It's always going to be a volatile space to be in and we want to make sure that we can continue to invest albeit never going to be a big piece of our business. But invest in a way that we will be getting an adequate return on the capital that we will deploy towards this space.", "Juan Sanabria", "Just one question on the senior housing side, we've heard that Holiday maybe looking to transition some of their independent living assets that are facing more supply -- sorry assisted living assets facing a supply to independent living. Do you think that creates a shadow supply that maybe not disclosed or highlighted in the mix data in the independent living bucket that payers are watching. Are you seeing that trend at all?", "Mercedes Kerr", "No, I have to -- this is -- I'll speculate a little bit, but I'd have to tell you this, this is prime where the exception in the rule there. Frequently conversations is based you know that are responsive to the market for example we might take some units in a building convert them to memory care. If we decide that there is a lot of demand that should be met and that we could get a nice return on that sort of conversion dollars that we invest in a property, things like that are happening frequently. But to have sort of whole clause changes when you are taking a portfolio and converting it from assisted living to independent is not a common -- I have not seen that happening in any widespread way at all. And we don't expect for it to happen.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thanks Mercedes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Good morning everyone. I just have a quick question about senior housing. I think in general there is this sense out there that things will get better soon based on slower delivery later on in the year or everyone taking a look at some of mix of that. But if you do look at mix forecast, you know they do still call for decline in occupancy and tough kind of NOI outlook all the way up until 2018. So, I guess how do you kind of reconcile some of this kind of optimism that things turn around very soon versus saying it could still be another 18 months of tough outlook", "Shankh Mitra", "Tayo, it's Shankh. Your definition of soon may not exactly match with our definition of soon you talked about. We talked about you know emphasize on medium to long-term, that's questions number one. But I will give you some numbers where I want you to focus on -- focus on not the whole industry, but our portfolio. So, if you go back and calculate quarter-after-quarter, we give you a three-mile, five-mile sort of radius and how it impacts our portfolio right?", "Let's just talk about a broader picture 5-mile. In Q3 of 2015, our total NOI that was impacted by supply was $83 million. That was the total. It peaked in Q2 of 2016 at about $90 million and today that is $73 million. So, I'm talking about just our portfolio. You saw a spike up and now it's coming down. So, you know we can sit here and talk about the NIC data and how that all relates to the whole industry. Obviously, you know we share enthusiasm for our sector, but we are particularly talking about how our portfolio which we think will do better.", "Tim Lordan", "Tayo, this is Tim Lordan. The only thing I would add to that is, one of the reasons we're optimistic about the balance of the year is, you know the rate growth in our portfolio, the rate of rate growth continues to exceed what we see in the NIC data and that rate growth has been there consistently. That's not something that's new for us this quarter. So, that continued rate growth combined with what Shankh mentioned earlier slightly deceleration in the rate of increase of labor driving our optimism.", "Tayo Okusanya", "That's helpful. And then this quarter it didn't seem like you announced any new relationships with some of your investments that you've done. I was just kind of curious if that deliberate in regards, you have been much more selective in regards to who are partnering up with, but that's more of a cast of -- you just see a lot of opportunities with your existing relationships.", "Tom DeRosa", "Well you know we have 17 RIDEA operators in our portfolio. You know you hear us use this term the Welltower family of operators. You know Tayo, I think we have a pretty strong bench. There will be on the margin, you saw us add a new operator to that group last year. I think there maybe a few left, but we are focused on putting capital behind this very skilled group of operators that have dominant positions in the markets that are important to us. So, I wouldn't see us -- I would doubt that you will see us 25 operators next year.", "Shankh Mitra", "And I thought we have always been very selective. So, we're not -- you know particularly selective now. We have always been selective and that's not changed.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chad Vanacore", "So, I was thinking about same-store shop NOI performance and we've talked about revenue and occupancy. But what were some of the issues that lead to higher OpEx in the quarter and what happened in Iowa in particular?", "Shankh Mitra", "So, Chad I think you have two question, one is not -- quarter OpEx was actually pretty favorable. It's pretty inline to what we expected. So, I'm not sure you know what are you thinking behind that question. It's pretty inline what would be expected is the same issues we have faced. Labor remains and issue, however we expect as we said, we're seeing it moderating and U.K. has an impact as John Goodey talked about. So that sort of one thing. I yelled, there was no specific, we saw a favorable revenue trend in AL versus IAL, but we saw a favorable expense trend in IAL versus AL and that's what drove the NOI difference in those two property types.", "Chad Vanacore", "Just thinking about the midpoint of same store NOI guidance for the year, you did 2.2% of first quarter, so mid-point figure 2.5%. That would imply some improvement through the year. So, what segments would be the primary driver of that improvement if you hit it?", "Tom DeRosa", "Shop.", "Chad Vanacore", "It's all on shop.", "Shankh Mitra", "You will see improvement in shop as we sort of discussed here.", "Chad Vanacore", "Alright, is there anything that could really move on the needle on the outpatient medical portion?", "Shankh Mitra", "Outpatient medical has been relatively very steady performer. It continues to produce a very favorable and predicable growth for us. I mean quarter-to-quarter things change, but we don't see massive change in that portfolio.", "Scott Estes", "Yeah, that's around 95% occupancy and 80% retention is a good forecast. So, we're pretty much maxing out our portfolio occupancy as we have for some time in that part of the business.", "Chad Vanacore", "Alright, thanks Scott, and I will hop back in the queue.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the MOB portfolio trade this week. So, the one thing that seems to have surprised everybody was the price at which it traded. You guys and as well as your peers. But as the same time you know I guess Tom, as you were wrapping up your remark, you mentioned to stay tuned. So, I'm just curious, do you expect more sellers to basically put assets on the market is a result of this pricing or you know how should we be reading into that. I think there's just been an acceleration or pick-up in the number of players looking to buy MOB assets and then that was demonstrated in this price, and I'm just curious, what brings the supply to bear?", "Tom DeRosa", "So, Jordan, if you are buyer that needs to find assets in auctions, this was the action of all auctions in the MOB space, because we don't know of another portfolio of that size diversity that is available. It's hard -- it's not on our radar screen. When I said stay tuned Jordan, it goes back to a point that I made on another question. We will build our medical office portfolio organically, which means that we're not sitting waiting for some big portfolio trade, not to say if one comes out, we won't be hanging around the hoop. But I will tell you that, we believe that the major health systems that we have aligned ourselves with across our business. We realize they cannot own all of their real estate for the long-term. You heard me talk about that 82% of this real estate is still owned by these health systems. They have significant capital needs for example in technology that will allow them to remain competitive. If they don't invest in technology and continue to sit there and think they need to own all of their real estate, they will become less and less relevant. So, we believe that we will mine medical office investments and development opportunities through the same way we've done it in the senior housing space, by picking our partners and being a trusted partner.", "I moderated a panel last month at a research conference, where I brought not only Chris Winkle from Sunrise assisted living, but also Mark Shaver who is head of Strategy for the Johns Hopkins health system. And actually Mark looked at the audience and said, I have to tell you, we own too much real estate and you know you haven't seen -- you probably haven't heard, someone at that level publicly state that. And basically said, and like you will see Tom owning some of our real estate at some point in the future. I think that's the way we're going to grow this business and it's important that their medical office footprint is going to be connected to our senior housing in post-acute care portfolio. That's the future of this company, that's why I am so excited about our business. I think this is one of the biggest opportunities that the real estate industry has seen in decades. So, that's why I say stay tuned. I don't have anything to announce to you.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. That's helpful. How do you gauge? You guys mentioned, I don't know if you are seeing fictitious but you know the portfolio that traded was the second highest quality portfolio next to yours. How do you gauge portfolio quality?", "Mercedes Kerr", "By age, by occupancy, by operating margin, by retention by the tenant rosters, so on just about every mark that you might be thinking about when you consider outpatient medical portfolio we outrank.", "Jordan Sadler", "On campus versus off, does that\u2026", "Mercedes Kerr", "We talk about affiliations too. Be careful with that, it's affiliated or not affiliated, you should care about and our portfolio is 95% affiliated with health systems.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott", "Hey guys it's been a long call. But I wanted to ask one question in particular. On your senior housing business, your full year guidance is 1.5% NOI which is comparable to the 0.9% for 1Q. So, you've talked about it a little bit on this call on different questions, but just can you help me better understand the comment that you are more excited not less, as you think about that particular guidance range as it relates to what you reported for 1Q?", "Shankh Mitra", "Michael, its Shankh. So, as you know we do not update our guidance on a quarterly basis for different segments of the business, but you heard me right, that 0.9% which we reported as the growth is comparable to 1.5% to 3%. So, Tim, I think cleared that and we are more excited about that segment of the business because of the first quarter beat that we had relative to our expectations. And it's driven by Tim Lordan said, it's driven by what we see in the rate trend as well as the expense trends.", "Michael Knott", "Okay, and then what do you make of the country breakout just to go little deeper into, the slightly negative print for U.S. excluding leap year or 1% leap year adjusted you know as I think somebody else said earlier was a little underwhelming. So, just curious how you thought about that part of it I assume that part too was also largely in line with your expectations.", "Shankh Mitra", "It was, if you think about on a country basis, it was largely in line with our expectations and we expect U.S. to perform as we look through rest of the year. Again, I would recommend to you one thing obviously we're excited about our U.S. portfolio, we think that performance will get better, but as we want you to think about our whole portfolio, not just parts of the portfolio because different parts of our portfolio came together purely because our strategic allocation, capital allocation decision is right. So different points in the cycle, you will see different countries will react differently. IL and AL will react differently, but that's how we think about our capital allocation as a portfolio rather than one particular product type or one particular country.", "Michael Knott", "Sure. But then just overall, it relates to the 1.5% to 3%, it sounds like it's mostly on the rate side to drive that sort of the three quarter of the rest of the year from 0.9% up to the 1.5% to 3%.", "Shankh Mitra", "That's right Michael.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I\u2019d like to hand the conference over to Tim Smith. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim Smith", "Thank you. Welcome to Sunrise Senior Living\u2019s first quarter 2012 investor conference call. This is Tim Smith of Sunrise\u2019s Investor Relations. Before we begin, let me remind you this call is being recorded and the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.", "During the course of this call, the company will make various remarks concerning management\u2019s expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks Tim. I\u2019m pleased to report a strong first quarter for Sunrise Senior Living. Our year-over-year stabilized community occupancy rose 60 basis points to 88.2%. Our average revenue per occupied unit stabilized communities was up 2.9% year-over-year. NOI was up 8% year-over-year for stabilized communities and 10.1% overall. Our sequential quarter to quarter occupancy was flat but historically we declined in Q1 so we were very pleased here as well.", "We are off to a flat start in Q2, so it\u2019s too early to see any trend stemming from our strong first quarter. As Marc Richards will detail shortly, our cost declined in Q1. G&A of $28.6 million compared with $32.4 million for the same period last year. Last year\u2019s first quarter did include significant severance cost, but overhead has continued to trend lower and is now at about $100 million run rate that we had talked about over time.", "The combination of our incremental EBITDAR driven largely by our recent acquisitions along with our lower cost drove adjusted EBITDAR to $43.8 million up from $28.3 million in last year\u2019s first quarter.", "Stepping back from daily operating results let me discuss some highlights since the start of the year. While we continue to add net asset value to Sunrise and to make progress in our remaining restructuring activities, we are particularly pleased by our recently announced venture sale to Ventas. This transaction again validated the value of Sunrise purpose built communities in solid locations. We closed this transaction yesterday and the proceeds to Sunrise, $28 million, will be used to fully pay off our active key bank line.", "Finally, and in some ways most important, Ventas by meaningfully adding to the Sunrise portfolio attested to our ability and track record of caring for our residents while being strongest towards a real and financial assets, and that means a lot to all of us.", "All that this transaction represents is to the credit of many Sunrise team members in our field operations and in our office. We manage better, report carefully, budget better, communicate openly, and we invest more and more to always be the sector leader in care for people who depend on that care. When we see short comings we attack them immediately with any resources needed.", "In the first quarter and going forward our story is much less about restructuring than it is about developing new ways to strengthen the core Sunrise platform. While we have reduced overhead we spent significantly in our hiring, training, oversight and in advanced systems so that we are prepared to go forward and sync with the new healthcare world.", "We have reduced churn over something that\u2019s generally accepted in healthcare but we hate. I'm leading a drive called You Voice Counts along with our Head of Operations, Laura McDuffie and our Head of Human Resources, Mike Rodis, just for the engagement of all of our team members by visiting with them and seeking their counsel about how to make Sunrise stronger. I could not overstate the importance we see in listening to our team to shape a better Sunrise, and then questionably this is the best part of our jobs.", "In a few minutes Greg Neeb will describe our progress on the few remaining restructuring initiatives in the United States and in the U.K. In all of these cases our discussions while not final and therefore subject to change, make us optimistic for positive outcome. The progresses we\u2019ve made here has enabled Greg to work closely with our IT group led by Pat Horne to implement information and management systems that will touch all areas of our operation.", "I hope that our results and what you hear from us in this call will leave you with no doubt about how our determination and optimism about the solid and bright future Sunrise, our residents, our team members, our partners, and our shareholders have to look forward to.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Richards, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Marc Richards", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, and welcome to Sunrise\u2019s first quarter earnings call. I will focus my discussion this morning on Sunrise\u2019s consolidated operating results for the first quarter of 2012 and the impact recent transactions have had on our consolidated financial statements.", "During the first quarter, we reported adjusted EBITDAR of $43.8 million as compared to $28.3 million for the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to of approximately $9 million of incremental EBITDAR generated from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012, a $2 million increase in our share of venture EBITDA primarily due to venture NOI growth, and a decrease of $4.3 million in general and administrative expenses excluding non-cash stock compensation expense.", "We\u2019ve adjusted net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense, to further exclude certain non-cash gains and losses, and certain items of income or expense in arriving at adjusted EBITDAR.", "Net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter was $2 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $17.7 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2011. The change between periods was primarily driven by a $7.1 million gain on fair value from business combinations relating to the acquisition of Santa Monica and the transfer of five operating properties and one land parcel to us from two unconsolidated joint ventures for no-cash consideration.", "A $6.9 million increase in our share of earnings and unconsolidated communities which was primarily driven by venture NOI growth and transaction cost incurred by certain ventures in 2011 but not in 2012 and a $3.7 million reduction in general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2012.", "General and administrative expenses were $28.6 million for the quarter, compared to $32.4 million for the same period in 2011. The decrease in the period is primarily due to $3.2 million of severance expenses relating to the reduction of 42 positions at our corporate and regional offices and a payment of $2 million retention bonus in Q1 2011.", "As a result of those and additional staffing reductions at our corporate and regional offices in 2011, salary expenses decreased by approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. These decreases were partially offset by a $3 million contingent loss recorded in Q1 2012 relating to outstanding litigation.", "Management fees for the quarter were $24.3 million, which includes $0.7 million of fee income from management contracts that has since been terminated. For the same period last year, management fees were $24.2 million, which includes $2.6 million of fee income for management contracts that have since been terminated or eliminated in consolidation, including $1.5 million from the 15 AL US communities.", "Our first quarter 2012 consolidated and leased community net operating income, excluding the impact of the communities acquired in 2011 and 2012, which include the 15 AL US communities acquired in June 2011, and the six communities acquired in the first quarter of 2012 increased $600,000 quarter over quarter. The acquired communities accounted for $24.6 million incremental resident fee income and $15.3 million of incremental community expense in our first quarter 2012 consolidated results.", "Net operating income is income from operations excluding depreciation, lease expense and impairment charges related to these communities. Our supplemental; disclosure for comparability purposes reflects the operating results of the AL US communities and the six communities acquired in the first quarter of 2012 for the periods prior to their acquisition dates in our consolidated NOI.", "Looking at the balance sheet, our unrestricted cash balance at March 31st was $47.2 million. The principal amount of our outstanding consolidated debt at March 31st was $751.5 million, compared to $607.4 million at the end of 2011. This increase reflects the now consolidated debt of the six communities acquired in Q1 2012 of $141 million. The asset side of the balance sheet also reflects the consolidation of these assets with a corresponding increase of approximately $156 million representing the estimated fair value of the acquired real estate assets.", "At the end of April, we also paid down the outstanding principal balance on our credit facility by $10 million, reducing the balance from $39 million to $29 million, and as Mark mentioned earlier, we will use the proceeds from the community sold to Ventas to pay down the remaining balance.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Neeb. Greg?", "Greg Neeb", "Thank you Marc. Let me give some color behind our results. I will provide comments for our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures and our management agreements for both stabilized and leased up properties, which reflects how we manage our business. I will also elaborate on a number of key transactions. This information is available on our supplement 8-K filed yesterday.", "Our consolidated community portfolio now consists of 30 properties. 27 of these properties are either newly opened or recently acquired high quality Sunrise purpose built mansion. 27 additions to this pool over the last few years are part of a conscious effort on our part to systematically grow our net asset value by opportunistically increasing our ownership in what we believed to be the best performing product in the assisted living space.", "In the first quarter these 30 properties delivered $15.5 million of net operating income before management fees, and five of the assets are still on lease up. A stabilized pool of 25 properties delivered an NOI increase of almost 23% for the first quarter of 2012 over 2011.", "In the first quarter we added six additional properties to our consolidated pool in two separate transactions. In both instances we acquired assets that were previously held in joint ventures. On February 28, 2012, we closed a purchase with a venture partner who owned 85% of the membership interest in Santa Monica AL, LLC. for an aggregate purchases price $16.2 million. Simultaneously, with the closing of the transaction, we entered into a new loan with Prudential to pool Santa Monica with Connecticut Avenue, with senior secured debt, the principal amount of this new seven year loan in aggregate is $55 million with an interest rate of 4.66%.", "In a second transaction on March 20, 2012, two of our existing joint ventures transferred their ownership interest in two venture subsidiaries to us for no cash consideration. The transferred ventured subsidiaries indirectly owned five senior living facilities and one land parcel. Prior to the transfer, we had a 20% ownership interest in the facilities.", "The facilities are currently encumbered by approximately a $119.7 million of existing facility level mortgage debt which is consolidated in our financial results commencing March 20, 2012. This mortgage debt is not on recourse to us with respect to principal repayment, and no new obligations will be required by the mortgage lenders as a result of the transfer. However, on 57 million of this debt we remain obligated under the operating deficit guarantees.", "NOI for leased communities was down 6.9%, and occupancy was 88.2% for the first quarter of 2012 versus 88.8% for the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the 10 leased communities that we\u2019ll terminate in 2013, NOI increased approximately 1.1% and occupancy was essentially flat.", "On our venture and managed communities net operating income stabilized joint ventures combining the US and the UK was up 14.8%, while stabilized management communities was up 5.8%. Rates for stabilized joint ventures combining the US and UK and managed community increased 2.9%. Joint venture lease-up properties combing the US and UK continued strong as evidenced by NOI increasing 53%.", "Within this grouping, 16 communities will be transferred from the ventures to managed in the second quarter. Yesterday, we closed the previously announced sale to Ventas of 16 joint venture communities for a purchase price of approximately $362 million. Sunrise received approximately $28 million of cash at closing and we\u2019ll continue to manage the 16 communities under the pre-existing terms relating to management fees and contract length, which range from 18 to 27 years.", "I will now turn to our two remaining workout situations. First is our Senior Living condominium project where we have a condominium component and an assisted living component that are each owned by a different venture.", "We continue to be obligated to our partner and the lender on the assisted living venture to find future operating shortfalls. We are also obligated to our partner on the condominium venture to fund operating shortfalls and marketing costs. We funded [inaudible] million under the guarantees from March 31st 2011 of which 200,000 on the assisted living venture was funded in 2012. As of March 31st 2012, amounts of $117 million for the residential condominium venture and $29.7 million for the assisted living venture are both in default", "We\u2019ve accrued $4.2 million in default interest relating to these loans. In February 2012 the lenders for the residential condominium venture commenced legal proceedings necessary to foreclosing the assets of the residential condominium venture. We are still in discussion with the lenders for the assisted living venture regarding default and the loan and are evaluating our alternatives.", "In United Kingdom one of our venture\u2019s mortgage loan is in default at March 31, 2012 due to a violation of certain loan covenants. The mortgage loan was approximately $639 million as of March 31, 2012. The loan was collateralized by 15 communities owned by the ventures located in the United Kingdom. The lender has rights, which includes foreclosure on the community and/or termination of our management agreements. The venture is in discussions with a lender regarding the possibility of entering into a loan modification.", "During 2011 we recognized $9 million of management fees from this venture. Our United Kingdom management segment reported $1.6 million in income from operations in 2011 and $700,000 for the first quarter of 2012. Our investment balance in this venture was zero at March 31, 2012.", "Our German restructure note will mature in October 2012, and we may be required to pay under the guarantee if we are unable to sell the mortgaged assets. We have one closed community and nine land parcels as of March 31, 2012. To the extent that we are unable to sell all the assets at their estimated value by October 2012, we may be required to fund the remaining minimum payment under the guarantee, which was $26.3 million as of March 31, 2012. Based on our estimate of likely property sale by October 2012, we believe that we may be required to fund at least $10 million under this guarantee.", "In addition to the debt discussed above, Sunrise Ventures have total debt of $2.4 billion with near term scheduled debt maturities of $0.3 billion for the remainder of 2012 and there is $0.8 billion of debt that is in default as of March 31, 2012. The debt and debentures are non-recourse to us with respect to principal payment guaranteed and we and our venture partners are working with the venture lenders to obtain covenant wavers and to extent maturity dates. We have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lenders or ventures with respect to $0.5 billion of the total venture debt.", "Under the operating deficit guarantees we are obligated to pay operating shortfalls, if any, with respect to these ventures. Any such payments could include amounts arising in part from the ventures obligations for payment of monthly principal and interest on the ventured debt. These operating deficit agreements would not obligate us to repay the principal balance on such ventured debt that might become due as a result of acceleration of such indebtedness or maturity, we have not shown any interest in these ventures. Back to you Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you Greg, thank you Marc. We are now prepared to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Daniel Bernstein of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning gentlemen. The question I have \u2013 a couple of questions today. One of them is on the G&A. I guess the current G&A run rate, something you are comfortable with for the rest of the year, do you expect it to trend down a little bit further at all?", "Marc Richards", "I think there will be ways to chip away at it but we are not putting out a different number.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, this is a good number, $100 million [ph], a little less maybe but that's about [Unclear].", "Marc Richards", "Thank you.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. On the operations side you brought up some items in terms of the initiatives that you have. I wanted you to go into that a little bit more about how from this point you improve the operations. Are you going to add some more ancillary services? You used to have Sunrise at home, you used to have Trinity Hospice. Now that some of the financial issues are going more into the background what can you do to improve the operations of the business?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, the major thrust that we have been undertaking, which we are very proud of is to really strengthen our team to make sure that our 320 communities, many of which we own, will have the right to purchase and really operating at maximum efficiency and providing the best care. So we spend a lot of time and money building our team, a new head of care who reports to our head of operations. In general I think we\u2019ve strengthened the organization. We have been piloting terrific new programs for memory care. We are, as you know Dan, the largest provider of memory care services and we want to stay at the forefront of that. So we want to make sure that our programming leads the sector.", "Then the next obvious step is to say, well, what other services can we provide to our residents. That\u2019s something that we have been working on. We want to make sure that when we do that we do it properly and carefully so that we don\u2019t have a hiccup. So that is something that we foresee adding to what we do.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. So you do see some incremental opportunity for ancillary services?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, I think there are great opportunities there. But we want to make sure that we never lose anything in our core. Again since we both as a manager with the benefit of our owners and for ourselves, we still see significant additional opportunity running our business the way we do just doing it better.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then I have two questions on the U.K. I mean one is the occupancy, it looks like it dropped in the U.K. while in the U.S. it did pretty well. So I was wondering if you could talk about the differences between the seasonality you saw in the U.S. versus U.K. There was a light flu season in the U.S. What was the flu season, what was the winter like in the U.K. that may have contributed to the seasonality there.", "Then the other question I had on U.K. was, if you could talk just a little bit about how long it has taken to go ahead and get some kind of role modification on that U.K. JV loan. If you can talk about specifics on what is holding up that modification? Anything else you can give us on that?", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah, we had a little softening in demand in the U.K. Nothing I wouldn\u2019t say there is any trend that we can see because of that versus the U.S. So we wouldn\u2019t read more into that than anything else. Generally we\u2019ve been a very strong performer in the U.K. In the last several months the quarter was a bit off.", "As far as why it\u2019s taken us so long, maybe it\u2019s because Greg has been handling that. But more accurately it\u2019s a large loan and it\u2019s something that we have to work through. It\u2019s complicated, but as Greg said and I\u2019ve said, we are very optimistic from the conversation that we\u2019ve had with our lenders. We are working through it. These things are important and they have to be dealt with care. We have a very good relationship with our partners and our lenders, and again we are optimistic.", "Greg Neeb", "Dan I think \u2013 we can go back even to the third quarter maybe when I first talked about this. I said it was going to take well into 2012. Quite honestly I would say that the timing thus far where we are, is tracking fairly well with what our expectations were and sort of played out by our quasi government owned U.K. lender. I feel like that the timing is not really outside of our expectation.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. That\u2019s satisfactory. Just one more question on the real estate strategy. You obviously are moving a lot more real estate on your balance sheet, you have purchase options in some of the JVs. What is your thoughts about managing assets versus owning? Obviously there are some tradeoffs there, but what are your views about whether you preferred or owned or to manage or lease. I mean that is a pretty large question with investors at this point like your real estate strategies.", "Mark Ordan", "We are a manager in senior housing and that\u2019s the core of what we do. Along with that we I think are opportunistic. We understand the capital markets, we understand the real estate market, so if there is an opportunity for us to buy real estate in an advantageous way we will do it. Similarly, if we think that there is value in our real estate that would be better off with us not owning it and somebody else owning it, that\u2019s fine as well. We used to own a portion of the Ventas portfolio. We sold that portion back to Ventas couple of years ago and since that time our metrics have only improved.", "So we don\u2019t think that we need to own real estate to maximize the performance of those assets. We will do it whether we are manger or we are an owner. So we separate the two. We want to make sure that whatever we are doing we are maximizing value and if that\u2019s buying real estate we will buy it, and if it\u2019s selling real estate we will sell it.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. That\u2019s all from me and have a good day. Thank you.", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks a lot Dan.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have no other questions at this time. Mr. Ordan I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.", "Mark Ordan", "Great. Thank you everybody for your continuing support of Sunrise. We look forward to reporting to you in the coming quarters additional progress. Have a great day.", "Operator", "That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Casey and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Bowe, Vice President of Communications for Health Care REIT. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bowe", "Thank you, Casey. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's third quarter 2009 conference call. In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the company's website at www.hcreit.com.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we are holding a live webcast of today's call which may be accessed through the company's website as well. Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that projected results will be obtained.", "Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I would now like to turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, George.", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Jim. We have used the last two or three years that have been very difficult in the economy and in the capital markets as an opportunity to essentially condense five to seven years of planned progress into two or three.", "In the capital markets, we have lengthened our maturities, enhanced liquidity and deleveraged, and along the way, we have match-funded our development pipeline through equity raises that have totaled over $1.4 billion for 2008 and 2009 year-to-date, as well as through agency paper totaling $266 million with an average rate of 6%. We are now in a position to raise both equity and debt capital and begin a new growth phase for the company.", "In the portfolio, we made tremendous progress in executing our game plan, to emphasis combination facilities in the senior housing sector and new state-of-the-art customer focus facilities in the medical sector.", "We have pursued these goals through our usual culling through our portfolio adding favored new investments and selling assets that are less desirable in the long-term. In executing these plans, we have generated significant gains.", "In 2008 and 2009 year-to-date, we have net gains after any losses or impairments relating to this activity equal to $151 million. In the fourth quarter of this year we have already recognized gains of approximately $20 million on the sale of a skilled nursing portfolio.", "Generally our portfolio is performing quite well with an overall facility coverage level of 1.98 to 1, up from 1.94 to 1 in the previous quarters. Our skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities performed well with increases in facility coverage quarter-over-quarter.", "Surprisingly, in these tough economic times, independent living and CCRC have the greatest occupancy pressure because of the elective nature of the services. Yet, IL coverage remains solid after 1.28 to 1 level, and the reduction in occupancy has been offset by rental increases as well as enhanced attention to operating efficiencies.", "Anecdotally, I can report to you that we have seen a nice rebound in occupancy in July and August for some of our larger operators. In all cases the lack of construction in the senior housing and healthcare sector, together with increasing demand for these service bodes quite well for the facilities in the next three to five years.", "Let me comment generally on CCRCs. We continue to believe that these facilities are some of the best assets in our portfolio and are quite desirable to seniors. The recent AAHSA study found that the youngest, healthiest and wealthiest seniors are drawn to CCRCs for their many amenities and services.", "Clearly entrance fee communities have been most affected by the tough economy because of the relationship they have to the housing market and the large initial payment required, and yet, we are generally pleased with our operating teams and their willingness to do the blocking and tackling necessary in these times.", "For example, during the first nine months of 2009 we've had 158 entrance fee move-ins; only eight behind our budget. The rental component within these facilities has now reached 70% occupancy. Our largest operator continues to progress with approximately 60% entrance fee occupancy with 27, 10% deposits with scheduled move-in days.", "Moreover, its rental occupancy stands at 79% with good momentum likely to move that rental occupancy to between 85% and 90% by year end. Virtually all of our CCRC operators have adopted some form of deferred purchase program that allows residents to move into the CCRC by making a down payment, with full payment when their house sells. These deferred obligations now exceed $14 million across our entrance fee portfolio. ", "All of our operators also take deposits that to-date has converted at an 80% rate in due purchases. Accordingly, we have 48 deposits within the current CCRC portfolio, there are additional funding expected as well.", "We are closely monitoring these properties and continuing to see progress. As Scott will detail, we have decided to defer certain CCRC rental payments based upon the current supportable rent stream over the next 18 months, and to the extent that sales continued at or above the current pace, and deposits are converted at high levels into move-ins, we believe this approach is likely to drive solid revenue growth over time as the deferrals are paid.", "Our medical office portfolio is beginning to show the results of hard work by John Thomas, Mike Noto and the medical facilities group. This quarter, we fully integrated the medical office portfolio into our proprietary asset management software, further enhancing what we believe to be one of the best asset management programs in our industry. ", "Occupancy in the medical office buildings at the end quarter was 90.9% and should finish the year over 91%. The team has generated strong leasing activity for both new and renewal leases and we anticipate a full year retention rate of 70%.", "Third quarter medical office building operating income was the highest contribution we reported to-date and it will continue to increase next quarter with the full impact of our new development properties and recently completed construction.", "Our origination team within the acute care and medical office sector is cultivating some great new relationships in investment opportunities, and we are close to finalizing several very attractive new projects in the acute care space that will further enhance our portfolio.", "Relating to the market going forward, we have made it clear that critical change is occurring, both in senior housing and medical facilities. The primary driver of the change is the customer, who is demanding top flight services and state-of-the-art real estate platforms. In senior housing, larger units and facilities are required with more and better services.", "In acute care, as more procedures become noninvasive or minimally invasive, the customers would rather have the services performed in an environment that is right sized, customer friendly and accessible. We believe this is an opportune time to acquire and develop such projects. ", "Throughout our history, we have developed new facilities that were needed as senior housing and healthcare evolved. In the 70s, we developed and invested in new purpose-built skilled nursing homes that replace the older mansion style facilities.", "In the 80s, we invested in independent living facilities. In the 90s, we were a leader in the emerging assisted living sector that filled the gap between skilled nursing and independent living. During the last decade, we have been developing and investing in combinations of the above, as we believe that the ability to age in place is a significant benefit to seniors and a competitive advantage to operators.", "We believe similar changes are occurring in the medical arena, whether with respect to MOBs, hospitals or other types of acute care facilities. Accordingly, to address the need for better real estate platforms, we began development on a number of facilities during the last several years. ", "During 3Q '09, 234 million of development projects came in line. In particular, three medical office buildings with strong health systems opened, with a total of 577,000 square feet of space. These projects are all pre-leased at an average occupancy of 92.6%. Another benefit of MOB development is that because of the rigid pre-leasing requirements, substantially all medical office buildings immediately move from development to stable upon construction close.", "Moreover, our hospital development projects also have substantial credit behind them, essentially eliminating the practical effect of rent-up risk that is inherent in senior housing. Year-to-date 2009, over 40% of our $1.4 billion of total development were in these two categories. We will continue to invest in new attractive development projects going forward, as senior housing and healthcare sectors continue to evolve.", "In order to drive this growth and produce additional value for our shareholders, we have also been adding key personnel to our team to originate state-of-the-art facilities across a full spectrum of senior housing and healthcare, and to execute effectively within our full service platform that includes development, design, and property management services.", "We will be disappointed if we do not make acquisitions by year end or early in 2010, and with our infrastructure and the stabilization of the markets, we expect to continue moving toward more normal levels of acquisitions and development in 2010 and 2011. ", "With that, I'll now turn to Scott Estes our CFO for a brief financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "The third quarter was an active one in terms of both capital markets and portfolio management. Our equity offering in September generated $357 million in proceeds. We placed $133 million of new secured debt with Freddie Mac at a blended rate of 5.9% and prepaid $59 million of secured debt maturing prior to 2012, with an average rate of 7.2%.", "We successfully tendered for 161 million of our 8% senior unsecured notes due 2012, which will lower future interest expense and improve our debt maturity schedule. On the portfolio side, we completed 234 million of high quality development projects, including the three medical office buildings affiliated with strong health systems that George just mentioned with over 577,000 square feet that are 93% pre-leased, adding immediately to earnings.", "Our unfunded development at the end of September had declined to only $329 million on our $967 million of projects still under construction, and we're projecting another $277 million of construction completions in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of third quarter investment activity, we completed a total of $126 million of net investments. Gross investment activity of $156 million was primarily ongoing development funding, while dispositions of $30 million included 10 medical office buildings, totaling roughly 175,000 square feet. The 10 properties were previously classified as held for sale.", "I would point out that subsequent to quarter end; we sold one additional medical office building and six skilled nursing facilities for gross proceeds of $51 million, generating a $20 million gain that will be recorded in the fourth quarter. I \u2018d also note that we received loan payoffs of $40 million related to two of our skilled nursing operators thus far in the fourth quarter as well.", "In terms of portfolio performance, I mentioned our 234 million of construction completions this quarter, which included about $60 million of combination rental senior housing and 174 million of health system affiliated medical office buildings.", "Including the $277 million of projected fourth quarter completions, we will have completed almost $725 million in development projects during 2009. We did start one new project during the third quarter, which is 120,000 square foot, $36 million medical office building that's 100% pre-leased to a high quality health system in Missouri at an initial yield of 9.3%.", "In addition to our development activity, five properties also converted from unstabilized to stable this quarter, reducing our unstabilized properties to 36 at the end of the quarter. In senior housing, both our assisted living and skilled nursing portfolios continue to perform well in this tough economic environment.", "Our stable assisted living coverage increased 1 basis point versus last quarter to 1.58 times, while stable skilled nursing increased 3 basis points sequentially to 2.24 times. Our IL/CCRC portfolio continues to experience some occupancy pressure, resulting in a slight decline in coverage to the current 1.28 times level.", "However, as George mentioned, our initial read of July and August performance suggests that occupancy is on pace to improve at approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, in both our IL and AL portfolios, and by about 10 basis points in our skilled nursing portfolio.", "Regarding our entrance fee communities, we have 14 entrance fee properties with an investment balance of $715 million, representing 12% of the portfolio as of September 30. We continue to believe these are among the best physical assets in our portfolio that are seeing varying degrees of fill-up velocity in light of the economic downturn.", "However, as George mentioned, we have continued to see an increase in the number of move-ins and are tracking relatively close to our revised budgets through September. Although we're pleased with this progress and the increase in traffic across the communities, in light of this slower fill-up, we have revised our short-term return expectations for our entrance fee portfolio. ", "As we assess the future cash flows of these communities over the upcoming 12 to 18 months, we recently made the decision to reduce the current rent on our nine open communities from a rate of 9% to an average rate of 6% effective July 1. These communities have an aggregate lease basis of $385 million.", "At this point, we believe that these communities will be able to support these new rates until we can begin to recapture deferred rent, but as always, are contingent upon the ongoing fill-up of the communities.", "I do think it's important to understand that the distinction that our rent reductions are structured as deferrals, so unlike other property classes, when our entrance fee properties are able to support higher rents in the future, we would be able to recover any deferred rents. Lastly, I would point out that this deferral is included in our updated 2009 earnings guidance.", "Turning now to the specialty care portfolio. This portfolio continues to perform very well with strong payment coverage over two times after management fees. We have amended our disclosure slightly on page 27 of the supplement to include only the last four quarters of information rather than eight so we can capture a larger population of our properties in the data. ", "Regarding our medical office portfolio, the medical office portfolio generated $22.3 million in NOI this quarter, and occupancy increased to 90.9%. We continue to forecast a full year retention rate this year of 70%, and note that our third quarter retention of 63% was slightly below forecast due to a single facility in Texas, where 10,000 square feet of space moved to a newly opened building in the area.", "Our core MOB-NOI forecast is now $89 million for the full year 2009, which now includes a little more than 4 million of NOI from the three development properties that converted during the third quarter.", "I would now like to take a moment to discuss our same store revenue results on page 23 of the quarterly supplement. First, the entrance fee community rent deferrals previously discussed had an impact on same store results. More specifically, third quarter same store IL/CCRC rent was reduced by $2.4 million due to the deferral at certain entrance fee communities, resulting in the same store revenue decline of a little less than 15% quarter-over-quarter.", "However, excluding these projects, IL/CCRC same store revenue increased 1.9%. Our same store specialty care revenue continues to be impacted by a $242,000 quarterly rent reduction, provided to one specialty hospital, which we discussed on last quarter's call. As a reminder, on this facility, this facility is still paying at approximately 10% on this investment. However, the reduction caused specialty care same store revenue to decline 1.4% in the quarter. However, excluding this facility, same store specialty care revenue increased 1%. Excluding the effective both of these items, our aggregate same store portfolio revenue rose 0.7%.", "Lastly, I would point out that we would expect our same store IL and specialty care comparisons to be impacted by these two items over the next several quarters as well.", "I'll turn now to financial results. Third quarter normalized FFO of $0.77 per share declined 10% versus the previous year, while normalize that of $0.72 per share, declining 12%. These declines are primarily a result of the significant capital activities completed over the last 12 months, which included over $1 billion in equity and secured debt.", "We also had several nonrecurring items this quarter. Debt prepayments in the quarter resulted in a $26.4 million debt extinguishment charge that served to improve our maturity schedule and lower future interest expense. We also had an $806,000 loss on sale from the 10 medical office buildings sold during the quarter at final prices which were slightly below carrying value. Finally, the $1.9 million impairment charge is related to the other four MOBs held for sale as of September 30, based on actual or projected sale prices, which are slightly below where we had them on our balance sheet. Again, all of these items are excluded from normalized FFO and FAD results.", "Regarding our dividends, we recently declared the 154th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30 of $0.68 per share, representing a rate of $2.72 annually. On the capital front, we raised a total of $568 million of capital during the third quarter. This includes the $357 million from our September equity offering, $133 million of seven year secured debt with Freddie Mac at an average rate of 5.9%, $14 million under our DRIP program through the issuance of 358,000 shares, and $64 million under our equity shelf program through the issuance of 1.6 million shares at an average gross price of 41.88.", "As a result, our liquidity position remains very strong. At September 30, we had $1.1 billion in cash and line availability, only $329 million of unfunded development, and sufficient liquidity to meet our upcoming maturities through 2012.", "As George discussed, we believe we're now in a great position to begin deploying capital for the right investment opportunities. Our credit profile remains excellent. Currently our debt to undepreciated book capitalization is down to 35% at quarter end, while interest and fixed charge coverage are 3.5 times and 2.9 times respectively.", "I would also point out that on page 10 of our supplement, we've added a net debt to trailing 12 EBITDA ratio, and I think we measure very well on this statistics at a ratio of 4.6 times. Despite successfully tapping the secured debt market to a greater extent this year, our secured debt remains only 9.8% of total assets at the end of the quarter.", "Finally, turning to guidance. We have updated our investment expectations and tightened our 2009 earnings guidance ranges. We now project development funding of $550 million, and dispositions of $250 million, resulting in $300 million of net investments.", "Regarding earnings guidance. We've narrowed our normalized FFO to a range of $3.10 to $3.12 from the previous $3.07 to $3.14 per diluted share, and a normalized FAD to a range of $2.92 to $2.94 from the previous $2.91 to $2.98 per diluted share.", "Our expectation for net income available to common stockholders has been reduced to $1.61 to $1.63 per diluted share, as detailed in our press release.", "That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it back to you, George.", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Scott. We're now open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michelle Ko with Banc of America.", "Michelle Ko - Banc of America", "I was wondering if you could give me a little bit more color on the rent deferrals if you anticipate taking any more of those further down the road and in terms of timing when you expect things to improve?", "George Chapman", "Michelle, the exact timing of increasing the return is difficult. I would say unless that we could have taken more risk in terms of the liquidity of our operators and not taken this large of a deferral, but we chose to do that to be conservative hoping that we're positioning ourselves to have some nice revenue increases over the next three to five years. What we've seen so far has been that tours have essentially gone up by 30 or 40% at the CCRCs between the first and the third quarter. If you look at some of our largest operators, ongoing properties that have been just open, for example, we've seen sales double between first and third quarter. I'm trying to give you a metrics. The other variables are when will the people sell their homes and therefore begin to pay off the deferred obligation they have, which totals $7 million or so for our largest operator, 14 million overall?", "Moreover, when will they convert the 10% deposits, both at our largest operator and throughout the portfolio? Those are all variables and that's why we chose to be what we think is pretty conservative. So we're hoping that in fact we will not have any further reductions. We're hoping that there's a cleared path upward, but there are a number of variables. I would say this we have a much greater sense of optimism, as do our operators, and the data is bearing that out.", "Scott, did you want to add anything?", "Scott Estes", "The only thing I would think just maybe from timing purposes, we looked essentially 12 to 18 months out, so our best assumption at this point would assume we stay at the same rate through most of next year as well. We're optimistic and hopefully could maybe start to recapture some of the deferred rents by the end of next year, but probably for conservatism purposes, you could assume the same rate from now through next year.", "Michelle Ko - Banc of America", "Okay. Could you also comment on the increased level of activity and property transactions where you think cap rates are for the different Health Care property types? Also, if you could comment on your decision, whether it's better to develop or maybe make more acquisitions in the future, which you prefer and the yields associated with each?", "George Chapman", "Scott, why don't you give them early cap rates and then I'll comment on development.", "Scott Estes", "Sure. We're seeing both, on the senior housing side, Chuck Herman and the team, as well as John Thomas on the medical facility side see a pickup in potential activity. In regards to specific cap rates, in senior housing I would still say the independent and assisted living cap rates are still probably in 8% to 8.5% type range. You still obviously have the agencies lending to the space as impacting the market pricing.", "In the skilled nursing area, we are not as actively looking at transactions. I would say the cap rates there probably are in the 11% to 13% range.", "Then medical office buildings, I would probably say would be in the 7.5% to 8.5% rate range. I don't know. John or George, you want to add any color on the market.", "George Chapman", "John, you want to add on the medical facilities area?", "John Thomas", "I think that's right. For the higher quality, on-campus or off-campus affiliated properties are probably where the ranges started to settle into. Then on development, where we continue to see a lot of opportunity, it's still north of 9%, even for the highest quality projects.", "George Chapman", "As to your question on development versus acquisition, I suppose in a perfect world, we would rather just buy brand new purpose-built facilities because it immediately drops to the bottom line in terms of our earnings. However, the reality is that the world is changing and I would suspect more in the acute care side than the senior housing side the need for different real estate and better real estate platforms is more prevalent. We have purchased an attached cancer center out in New Jersey a year or two ago, and we would like to buy more of those.", "On the other hand, many of them have yet to be built. So we're going to have to do some development to be in the forefront of acute care, investing in development. In the senior housing side, I think that there are going to be some good opportunities to do some development. The assisted living and dementia, for example, have worked out very well with some of our top operators, IL-AL combinations and as well with CCRCs, but I just think that there's going to be more ability to acquire in the senior housing side perhaps than in the medical facility side.", "Having said that, every time we make a guess like that, different opportunities come about and the world changes, but that's our current thinking.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Biffert with Oppenheimer.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "George, just continuing on with the development side, a number of the operators, Brookedale mainly came out and said that they are starting to look at their expansion projects again. How are you guys helping out with that? Would you look to lend to them to help them complete those expansions in some of the assets that maybe they leased from you?", "George Chapman", "I think the best transactions we can do, the best investments we can make are to help great operators like Brookedale expand their existing facilities where they already have waiting lists. Those are just perfect deals to do and we would do that all day for our other operators. We think those are terrific.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "What kind of yield would you expect to get on those?", "George Chapman", "Probably more than they want to pay, but that would be a process of negotiation. Certainly the current market would have to be considered along with the existing terms for their existing projects.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "Then to the non-profit hospital world, I'm just wondering if you can comment if you guys are planning on targeting that world where credit maybe is not as available for them, given what we're seeing and a lot of their charitable giving may be down as well?", "John Thomas", "Mark, it's John Thomas. I think we continue to have great access to opportunities there. The credit markets for them have eased a little bit and so I think right now on two or three projects that we are in discussions about, really the competition is their own balance sheet versus our development services.", "We expect to continue to add some development directly with non-profits and came online this quarter with what is now the largest single tenant in our medical office space, which is Aurora, which is a very strong non-profit system based in Milwaukee and we're very pleased to have them jump at the top of our MOB portfolio.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "I mean, did you guys bid? (inaudible) bought a portfolio from those guys. I mean what are you seeing from opportunities? Is Aurora and other people coming out? Are these portfolio-sized opportunities or are these one-off assets that people are trying to sell?", "John Thomas", "We've got, I would say, in discussions with a number of non-profit systems some larger portfolios than others, some off-market, some on, but we continue to see some good opportunities. I think what we're talking about right now are really some larger portfolio trades with those non-profits in particular.", "George Chapman", "John, I might add too. I believe we are trying to capture some transactions is the fact that we can also provide them with development and design services and some thoughts about where the systems should be going and more often than not in the acute care space other than some one-off transactions, the ability to add ideas and to add some real value is helpful in capturing deals and capturing development opportunities.", "Scott Estes", "That's correct, George, and again, the non-profit systems, again, CSOs, somebody they can trust with their physicians when they sell off their on-campus billings or partner with us in their on-campus billings, and again, those non-profits that we're looking to work with are those who are looking at health care reform as an opportunity to expand their reach with their physicians and integrate technical and outpatient services in new buildings and are looking for us to help them think through that process and then develop those facilities for them.", "Mark Biffert - Oppenheimer", "Then lastly, George, I'm just wondering, looking out down the road three to five years, obviously, the senior housing space will be much improved over that period, but I'm just wondering if you can talk about maybe the percentage of your NOI you expect to have in each of the different segments that you guys are playing in?", "George Chapman", "Again, this is just guess work, but looking at the world as it exists today and our capabilities, I would expect senior housing and care to be somewhere around 50% to 55% as our attention to medical facilities, MOBs included, gets some traction. Within senior housing, I would expect that our standalone skilled nursing portfolio would be down to 15% or so, and our standalone IL, and for that matter, AL, might be down to 7%, 8%, and most the rest of them will be combination of some sort. ", "Then, again, as we look at combinations, I would expect probably the entrance fee properties to be more like 10% of the total and most of ours to be rental, but we still think that there is just a great place for the entrance fee communities. Within the medical facilities, it might be around 45% then, Mark. I would guess that, that the medical office buildings would be 25% and hospitals and other types of medical facilities would be 20%. That's just my guess right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [Jarell Solati] with Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "We've noticed that the projection on in initial cash yield for 4Q \u201909 conversions increased 40 bps to 8.9% from what you had in the second quarter. We were wondering if this is reflective of a change in the asset mix coming in line or if it's indicative of the market in general?", "Scott Estes", "I don't think it's really reflective of any changes in the specific assumptions. The only addition we had in our projects underway was the one MOB I mentioned at 9.3%, and I think the numbers, at least over the most recent couple of quarters, I think are bouncing around a little bit just based on timing. For instance, we closed a couple of the MOBs this quarter a bit earlier than previously anticipated. So you just have some movements by facility type that are moving maybe quarter to quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The other question I had was in terms of same store revenue growth, which, excluding the impacts of rent deferrals is 0.7%. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more as to why the number was lower when compared to previous quarters.", "Scott Estes", "Excluding the impact of the couple of exceptional items, we were advertising kind of 1% to 2% same store revenue growth, and I think we would be on pace for that this year. You're probably seeing the impact of the 70% of our leases in the senior housing area have increasers that are based on CPI, where it's only about 7% in our medical office portfolio, but in essence, with CPI turning negative, I think the first month was December of 2008 through current. You missed out on some of the increasers and I was even looking at the data, CPI stays where it is, probably by the end of this year, you would start to be able to recapture some of those increasers and who knows next year, but that's probably been the biggest factor why just sequentially you\u2019ve seen the number turn to be about 1%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo with UBS.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS", "Scott, just quickly, I may have missed this, but the rental income numbers that are in the supplemental for the quarter, those already reflect the rent deferral?", "Scott Estes", "Yes. The deferral was effective July 1, so that would be in all of our numbers and quarterly earnings impact, yes.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS", "On the MOB portfolio, can you just talk a bit about what's behind the decline in operating margins that we\u2019ve seen there and is it specific to either the (inaudible) portfolio or the legacy winner of that, or is it really just across the board?", "John Thomas", "It's really a very small number of facilities. Probably the biggest impact, and we talked about this I think last quarter on the same store number, was a very large ASC that rolled out of one of our buildings. We have replaced the tenant. We've actually replaced that tenant with two tenants, but the conversion of that ASC into essentially two smaller ASCs and at lower rents than were there historically, so that's part of the single biggest impact. It's probably a third of the same store number impact.", "We've actually increased our occupancy on a same store basis and absorbed some space last year and through this year with some very aggressive leasing activity. We've also made some investments in some people, again, increasing our leasing team and some other resources. So overall, I think we're still in line and we are really well positioned to continue to increase not only our same store, but really our core numbers continue to improve and by the end of the year, we will have leased well north of 600,000 square feet this year.", "So we're very pleased with where we are. We had a slight timing miss, as Scott mentioned, attributable to a couple of renewals in one building that surprised us, but we feel good about where we are for the rest of the year.", "Scott Estes", "Only thing I would add Dustin on the margin is; there's some higher expense items like utilities. A lot of our portfolios in the southeast, typically in the third quarter results, so as we looked at that that impacted margin this quarter. We had some higher utility costs in the portfolio as well.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS", "As you look at the expiration in 2010, what are your expectations today for where market rents are relative to the in-place rents?", "John Thomas", "We're ahead of pace on next year, so some of our renewal numbers reflect some pretty aggressive leasing for next year\u2019s renewal. So, we're doing a good job on particularly getting two to three years increased terms on those renewals, and I think some of the in-place rent we're trying to stretch out and get 2% to 3% increase on those renewals to current market rates. So, I think we're still working through the expectations for next year and we'll have a better estimate of that. However, again, we had a lower amount next year of expirations and continue to be well ahead of track on where we expect to be next year.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS", "Scott, just finally, turning to the loan book, I know you talked about the nonaccrual balances last year, but seeing as that number hasn't really changed much, are there any moves being made on your part to foreclose and how many loans are really in this bucket and what is the associated underlying asset value there?", "Scott Estes", "You're correct, the loans that are in our nonaccrual bucket really hasn't changed. For everyone's benefit, the loans on nonaccrual stands at 72.4 million as of the third quarter. We obviously do have a reserve in place of 7.6 million. As we look forward, there's about five different buckets of properties in that portfolio.", "There's one specialty hospital in there and probably the majority of the rest are independent living campuses, where you have some unit or cottage sale components to them. So, you haven't really seen a lot of fluctuation, because as we assess the carrying value and the appropriateness of our reserve, we have to look forward often times three to five to even more years in terms of making estimates for future sales in terms of the appropriateness of the reserve. I think for an earnings recognition perspective, we're taking as conservative stance as you can by keeping them on nonaccrual.", "George Chapman", "Scott, I might add a couple things. One, as it relates to the mortgage loan portfolio, we've had some payoffs in the fourth quarter that were $40 million that we are reporting. Then the other points I would make and it goes really back to the last question as well, when John reports on the MOBs, you can expect us to be very aggressive in terms of buying new and better and larger facilities, MOBs, and developing them.", "At the same time, we will probably continue our cutting out process of our portfolio and we will select some MOBs for sale. Frankly, our feeling is if we have any impairments or if we have any losses, we'll do it anyway because we combine some rigorous activity in terms of selling some that we think are going to produce some very good gains as we have over the last two years; $150 million, now $170 million. We will take impairments and we will take losses on the sale of MOBs.", "Similarly, if we find by the year end that any of the loans should be written off, we'll do that. Don't be surprised. We've done that throughout our history and we're going to continue to do it. It's just part of our process of portfolio managing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus ", "I'm going to shift gears a little bit, I wanted to go over to just kind of capital markets side. I think you categorized that a lot of this catch-up stuff maybe has been done and you're now looking at making acquisitions. So as we go forward, I guess I want to just get a little better sense of how you're thinking about the capital markets? Obviously, unsecured debt costs have come in a lot, I think even since we talked the last time on this call. So if you're funding new stuff what might you be using? How much need do you feel to continue to buy back the 8% or do some of the other debt refundings at this point in advance?", "George Chapman", "We have been pretty successful in terms of moving our maturities out. We're not sure really that we have to do much more work at this point. We have our whole line available to do transactions or to use in whatever way is appropriate and we're finding that, as you say, the unsecured debt markets have come in to 7%, maybe 6% or a little less than that.", "So we think we have the ability to access capital. We also have had like our colleagues in the health care REIT sector, we've had pretty good support in the equity markets. So whereas our stock price moves up, the chances of the convertible debt actually exercising their right as opposed to pushing it off for five years, becomes less of an issue.", "So I think we're in very good shape right now. What we're waiting for, Jerry, is to know exactly what transactions, acquisitions, we are going to have and are proceeding to closing, and what other development projects we are going to pursue subject to keeping some limits on that activity. So it's really a hard [dance] but right now we have adequate capital and we have access to adequate capital and we're just waiting to being certain about our acquisition and development activities.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Just maybe to re-categorize that or characterize that, so we might get back to a more normal pattern where you build up acquisitions online and then go out and do unsecured and kind of proportionally issue equity. On the equity, which you would be more likely to do larger deals or may be continuous equity issuance?", "George Chapman", "I said in my remarks that I thought we're approaching a more normal time and so I think you characterized it appropriately. We like the, sort of the continuous equity program to a certain extent, but we also know that we need the support of the investment banks and the bankers, so we will from time-to-time do some equity transactions as well.", "Again we're going to keep our leverage at a somewhat lower level and perhaps we did the last three or four years, which is usually shooting for 45% to 50%. Right now we're probably more like 40% to 45%, so we're going to continue our discipline, perhaps at somewhat lower levels until there's even more visibility on the capital markets.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus ", "Just last thing, you said that you are going to return to kind of a typical average (inaudible) going back to look at the average but what's in your mind, what's that number for acquisitions?", "George Chapman", "I've told the street that with John's team and Chuck's team and our reach in the market place and our relationship-driven programs, both in senior housing and increasingly in acute care, that we're a team that is built to do up to $1.5 billion a year. Now, that means that there have to be adequate possible transactions and development out there and it's been a little sticky in the transactional side, a little bit unevenness in the bid/ask area. We are built to do that kind of volume and we're built to then watch all of those assets with our asset management team. So I think we can do that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "George in that last comment, the $1.5 billion; that was total investment dollars out the door per year or is that just development?", "George Chapman", "Rich, when we think about it right now, and again, the world changes dramatically sometimes. We usually think that with our relationship folks, we can do $200 million, $300 million, $400 million, maybe up to $0.5 billion. We think that we could do development of $300 million to $500 million and then maybe new deals of another $300 million to $500 million. Then, we're inevitably going to be selling $100 million, $150 million, maybe $250 million, so maybe the net number is more like a $1.3 billion.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "I actually said that wrong. I meant to say at any time development, your development pipeline could be how large?", "George Chapman", "The way we look at this is we would really like to drive development and for that matter, fill-up properties that are mainly related to senior housing for the reasons I mentioned earlier, down to may be 10% each. Right now, we're a little higher than that and we've explained to the street that that is partly a result of the market place catching all of us cold, so that we have development underway and we can [just continue stable] or acquisitions, so we got a little higher than we wanted to be. We got up to the high teens on our development and I don't think we want to be there. We'll gradually work it down to probably 10% to 15% development a year.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "Back to the deferral rent strategy for your entry fee, I'm just trying to do the math. I think you gave, you gave the lease rate decline from 9% to 6%, but did you say what your investment balance was in those nine assets? Maybe you have it in your disclosure.", "Scott Estes", "Let me connect the dots for you, Rich. Yes, there was an aggregate deferral from roughly 9% to 6% on the current lease spaces of 385 million. The same-store number does not include two properties that came on within the last year, so that number is more or like the 280 million same-store lease spaces.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "To do the math to get to the 2.4 million, I have used 280?", "Scott Estes", "That's right.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "Now, you think that you captured this and these are the nine lease-up entry fee communities, but you have seven others under development. What is the status of those and how are they progressing toward a point where you will have to start thinking about the lease rate deferral idea for those?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, we actually have nine that are open and there are five that are under development of the total of 14. You can see those numbers on page 30 of our supplement. There are currently about 350 million that are still under development. They are coming on. There's about two or three of them coming online toward the end of this year, and then another two, I think, about middle of 2010.", "We lift the initial yield in our supplement because that is as the current contractual yield, which for those two lines is 10% on one and about 8% on the other. We don't know. It is still contingent upon continued fill-up between now and when the assets open, but to be conservative, could we see a potential 6% to 7% type initial rate there? Yeah, I think it's possible. A lot of variability still, but that's probably up to you and until we actually negotiate anything. We'll obviously let you know every quarter.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "I think you mentioned that your entrance fee operators are 8% behind budget, is that right?", "George Chapman", "No, the actual move-ins.", "Scott Estes", "The move-in number is only 8 units behind. Year-to-date, we have 158 move-ins versus the projected move-in number of 166.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "So, if it's just that slight bit behind budget, why such a big cut to the lease rate, the deferral? It\u2019s just wiggle rooms or what's the story on that?", "George Chapman", "I think they were probably being conservative. I hope we're being conservative.", "Scott Estes", "I think it\u2019s the best comment and also the nature as you mentioned, George, there's a pretty significant deferred amount as well. A lot of these again were only getting 10% to 20% of the entrance fee, building up a significant receivable. Also the health care component fill up, which is probably not a factor here, because the rental components of these buildings are actually filling fairly well. So, I think that's probably the biggest factor, and we're trying to set an appropriate rate that\u2019s really sustainable over the next 12 to 18 months.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "You feel as though that all of the deferral, all the building AR is a collectible over the next couple of years?", "George Chapman", "We think that it is. I mean the folks are obligated to pay. Now, what happens if there are deaths and other things, I mean there could be some slippage, but there is an obligation to pay and they are living there and enjoying it generally. So it looks very certain.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "Then lastly, just as an explanation for me, I'm just looking at your supplemental notes 16 and 17 and you have year-to-date and third quarter gross investment activity. In the third quarter, just looking at the entrance fee, it looks like you made investments in five of the seven. Am I reading that right for the third quarter? I'm confused. I'm trying to draw a connection between the seven for year-t- date, r is that two that have since gone to the operating portfolio?", "Scott Estes", "This would be the investments during the quarter on the projects that were under construction. If something converted in the quarter, the dollars would also be in that chart, but the specific question, the entrance fees, we have two CCRC entrance fees and three combination entrance fees. That matches the development projects on the other page we just highlighted.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets ", "So, two have since gone to the operating portfolio?", "Scott Estes", "Yeah, I think so. We can check and talk after the call, but that's what would be the factors there, Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Pretty much got everything I needed to know about entrance fee community. Just want to make sure I heard you right earlier, Scott. The 2.4 million is reflected in this quarter as rental income line?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Then also in the updated FAD guidance, CapEx and TIs were up. It looked like that was kind of a blip in this quarter. Was there anything particular going on?", "John Thomas", "I think part of the biggest blip was, I mentioned before, the ASC that rolled out proprietary hospital at the ASC, of the long-term master lease and repositioning that ASC into two smaller ASCs which have both been leased require additional TI to do that.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "So that project sounds like it\u2019s done now?", "John Thomas", "Yes. They are moving through the TI build out now, so those will come online I think, one by the end of the year and the other half by the early second quarter of 2010.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "So we should be kind of drifting down to a more normalized quarterly rate?", "John Thomas", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Most of my questions have been answered. Just two quick ones. In regards to Freddie and Fannie and their requirements now when they are underwriting loans backing senior housing properties, could you give us a sense of what kind of terms they are asking for now and kind of what it looks like versus six to nine months ago?", "Scott Estes", "I don't think the terms have changed a heck of a lot. It seems like to me like pricing still is zeroing in around the 6% range. It depends obviously terms and then what you're looking at a shorter length of term. Honestly, we actually removed our incremental secured debt assumption, because I think as George mentioned, we're looking at the unsecured market spreads between that, and the secured market is probably a bit narrower. So, I guess as the REITs think about it for us, if 10 year unsecured is 7%, it maybe in the midsize to 6% on a secured, I don\u2019t know. Mike Crabtree, is there anything you would add to that in terms of the secured markets?", "Mike Crabtree", "I think the thing going on right Tayo is that, they are underwriting a little tougher, so they might have a leverage of 65%, but they are leveraging a tougher underwritten NOI. So, I think that's what you might be finding.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Then just in the supplemental on page 23, I know we've talked about this before, the $4 million of rent deferrals, but there was also a rate adjustment for the specialty care hospital?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Could you just talk about that a little bit and what that was?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. It's a hospital that's been in our portfolio. We basically reduced rent by about $242,000 a quarter, but are still receiving a return of about 10% after that reduction. So, based on performance at the hospitals and its sustainable rental rates, so we actually getting a reasonable yield but the $240,000 reduction quarter versus last year impacts the reported results. ", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "What was the issue with the hospital itself? It's just revenue pressures?", "Scott Estes", "Yeah, actually a lot of that is based on procedural volume that fluctuates often quarter-to-quarter and over time. So, you look forward to making ongoing assessment of appropriate rental rates in the hospital world.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Does the hospital have any particular specialization? I'm sorry.", "Scott Estes", "Neuro and orthopedics.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Both in neuro and ortho hospital, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford from KeyBanc.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Can you give us the cap rate on the fourth quarter sales and the rate on the fourth quarter loan payoffs?", "Scott Estes", "Yes. The fourth quarter loan payoff averaged probably a little higher. It's about 11.5% when you blend it together. There are two pieces to that 40 million that we alluded to. The skilled nursing portfolio I believe was on our books for about $27 million where we had $20 million gain. I don't have the cap rate in front of me on that one. I could get that for you. It\u2019s probably around 10.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Just a final question. Can you tell us how much you currently have acquisition wise under contract and letter of intent today?", "George Chapman", "No.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James.", "Buck Horne - Raymond James", "Quick question, and maybe a little early to know this just yet, but do you know if a senior household might qualify to use the new $6,500 move-up tax credit as part of using it to enter an entrance fee community?", "George Chapman", "The first time homebuyer?", "Buck Horne - Raymond James", "Well, it would not be the first time homebuyers. It's the new move-up tax credit that Congress is passing for homebuyers that have lived in a house for at least five years.", "Scott Estes", "Actually, it's probably the first time we thought about that. So we'll look into that.", "George Chapman", "We'll get back to you, Buck.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "You talked about some optimistic data points with respect to the CCRC fundamentals, a very contrary data point would be the bankruptcy of Erickson. When you were talking about the motivations for the rent deferral in your portfolio you mentioned I think the liquidity of your operators. So I'm curious what you make of the Erickson bankruptcy, and I'm curious with respect to your operators that we're headed on, it's FAD, if not for the rent deferral?", "George Chapman", "We're very unhappy to see the Erickson bankruptcy because John and Erickson have been leaders in the sector. The model is really quite different from ours in a lot of respects, in the sense that there's a bifurcated involvement between a non-profit and a developer and some of the funds go to different buckets, and therefore, may or may not be accessible by the residents under certain circumstances. While John develops and manages very large communities at a middle market price point, but there are certainly a lot more marketing and sales that have to occur.", "I will say this that Erickson was very aggressive about expanding, Jim, and probably was out there was out there with too many projects at a time that the markets just crashed on him and for that matter all of us. So I don't see that as frankly much more than the typical headline risk that we all face from time to time when any particular sector that we invest in has sort of a problem. Our sales are slower as you know and rental is pretty good. So I guess one of the reasons we diversify is that there's going to be something that's a little more difficult with respect to one of our segments from time to time and then it shifts from time to time. John just had a huge development pipeline and I think ours is much more manageable.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Then on a separate topic, cap rates being 11% to 13%, were you referring to cap rates or lease yields?", "George Chapman", "Cap rates.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "So what were the lease yields?", "George Chapman", "It depends on the property. We typically underwrite skilled nursing assets to stabilized coverages of 1.5 to 1. So if you had a 12% cap rate at an 8% initial yield then that would be the concept. We haven't been doing as many of those lately.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.", "George Chapman", "Okay. Well, let me wrap up just by thanking everybody for participating and per usual, Scott and his team are available for follow-up questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.

Farrar - EVP", "Analysts", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Health Care REIT Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. And again, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call is being recorded.", "And I would like to now turn the conference over to Ms. Katherine Shipstead [ph] of the Financial Relations Board. Please go ahead, ma'am.", "Unidentified Company Representative - Financial Relations Board", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's fourth quarter 2007 conference call. In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the company's website at healthcarereit.com.", "I would like to remind everyone that we're holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website as well. At this time, management would like me to inform you that certain statement made during this conference call are not historical and may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its expectations will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in the news release and from time-to-time in the company's filings with the SEC.", "Having said that, I would like to now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman and CEO of Health Care REIT, for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, sir.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Katherine. First, I will briefly go through our achievements for 2007, as this is the year-end call. One, we received... we were very pleased to receive debt upgrades from Moody's and Fitch to Baa2 and BBB flat respectively. And we're also very, very pleased at our timing in expanding and extending our unsecured lines of credit to $1.15 billion while at the same time reducing our interest cost 20 basis points to LIBOR plus 60. It gives us quite a bit of dry powder in what is becoming a very interesting investment environment.", "I'm very pleased to be added to the S&P Midcap 400 Index in November. And again, we were very successful in raising $900 million of capital through three transactions as well as through our dividend reinvestment plan. Our solid 6% FFO per share growth provided in\u2026 the shareholder return of 9% in a very down year for rates, again was a very welcome.", "I want to talk mainly today though about our growth platform and our portfolio. So clearly, people have an understanding of how our portfolio is changing\u2026 how it has changed and how it is going to change in the next year or so. One, last year our growth platform drove net investments of $1.1 billion, and at the end of 2007 we had one of the most diversified portfolios in this sector with 65% of our revenues derived from private pay. And in terms of skilled nursing and assisted living, especially standalones, we continue to drive that percentage down. At year-end, our total skilled nursing and assisted living concentrations constituted 32% and 21% of our portfolio respectively, down from 44% and 34% two years ago. And unlike some of the analysts, we do believe skilled nursing and assisted living, especially assisted living, are attractive investments, but we've taken the approach of that they are most effective in combination projects or in CCRC platforms.", "As I mentioned in our last quarter call, we continued to report our portfolio breakdowns in a manner that approximates functional groupings. Example, independent living and CCRCs, Continuing Care Retirement Communities, are grouped together and properties are characterized as independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing based upon the predominant service type.", "At year-end, CCRCs together with other combination facilities, i.e. those facilities with one or more combinations of skilled nursing, assisted living, independent living and dementia, comprise approximately 27% of our portfolio or approximately 40% of our senior care portfolio. Viewed in this manner, our standalone skilled nursing and assisted living would represent only 24% and 10% of the portfolio respectively.", "Portfolio performance is quite good, as we've driven coverage at the facility level to 1.99 to 1. Occupancy trends have also been strong quarter-to-quarter with IL/CCRC moving up to\u2026 up 1% to 93%. Assisted living up 1% to 89%, and skilled nursing up 1% to 85%. And while medical office buildings remained flat at 90%, we believe we have an excellent opportunity to drive up occupancy... occupancies by the fourth quarter of 2008 that should enhance our returns, again primarily in 2009.", "We have high expectations for investments in 2008. Our guidance, as you\u2019ve read, is $900 million to $1.2 billion, including $500 million to $700 million of acquisitions and $400 million to $500 million of development. While we are conservative with respect to our underwriting and portfolio management, we believe that we have the best growth platform in the sector. The platform has been successful, primarily as a result of our marketing team that we believe is the deepest and most productive in seniors' housing and health care. And the relationship programs as that we have developed have created a shadow pipeline of approximately $3 billion. This gives us a great deal more certainty of investments than if we were simply trying to find acquisitions in the general market.", "If you\u2019d refer to Exhibit 9 of our earnings release, you would see that we have $800 million of unfunded development commitments. This number relates to projects that have commenced construction and we expect approximately $400 million or a bit more of the $800 million to be advanced in 2008 and the remainder thereafter. You should also know that we expect $360 million of our current development projects to convert to stable projects in 2008, which allows us to discontinue capitalizing interest at our average cost of debt, which is approximately 6%, and begin recognizing yields at stated rates that average 9.1% per leased properties. We expect that the conversions in 2009 and 2010 respectively would be $400 million and $327 million, and as each development project converts to a stable asset there is a positive impact to our FFO.", "We've mentioned before that real estate platforms must change over time to address customer preferences. That can occur through renovations of existing facilities, purchasing new facilities or development. I also noted our preference for a combination, or CCRC properties and senior housing and care. In the medical office building and acute care space, we believe that many of the new medical office buildings and acute care assets will be much more customer-friendly and will stress wellness and one-stop shop.", "Our unfunded developments commitments going into 2008, the $800 million that I mentioned previously, include $448 million in CCRCs and a $140 million for new medical office buildings. And while only $24 million relates to acute care, we are making great progress with health systems providers and developers to invest in new acute care facilities and anticipate that amount will increase over time.", "We, again as I've indicated earlier, believe that with our relationship program and our $3 billion or so of shadow pipeline, that we have a much higher probability of investment success than simply finding investments in the markets. The investment guideline for 2008, I should note, together with our other budgeted assumptions produce a projected FFO range of $3.27 to $3.37 per share, which is an FFO growth rate of 5% to 8%. And we believe that this FFO growth together with our current dividend should produce an excellent total return, assuming multiples remained constant. And I must say that while I don't want to get into predicting whether multiples will go up or go down, we believe that our profile and our full spectrum platform presents a very strong case for multiple expansion.", "With that, I will turn to Ray Braun and Scott Estes for additional comments on our portfolio and financial results. Ray?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "Good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our fourth quarter investments, discuss current market conditions, and then finish with a discussion on our portfolio and reimbursement outlook.", "During the fourth quarter, we completed a total of $298 billion of gross investments. This included senior housing acquisitions of $21 million at an average initial yield of 7.5% with an expected yield of 10.2%, MOB acquisitions of $31 million at an average yield of 7.5%, capital expenditures and loans of a $127 million at an average yield of 10.1%, and funded CIP of a $118 million with an expected average initial yield upon conversion of 9%.", "Our development activity, which is presented in detail in Exhibit 9 of the earnings release, currently includes 37 projects and a total commitment of $1.1 billion. We started an additional $292 million of development projects this quarter and have 34 million of projects completed with an average initial yield of 9.8%. These include a commitment amount of over 200 million for the construction of several [inaudible] and two medical office buildings, reflecting the extension of our programmatic financing strategy to medical facilities.", "On the disposition front, we had $25 million of asset sales and loan payoffs during the quarter that we sold at an average cap rate of 6.6%. In terms of market conditions, we're seeing some slowing of volume in the second half of 2007. Cap rates appear to be increasing across asset types with a credit market dislocation and our ability to finance transactions via considerable investment opportunities for this year.", "Turning to the portfolio, our portfolio composition is included in Exhibit 1 of the earnings release. At December 31, 68% of our portfolio was invested in senior housing and care and 32% of the portfolio was invested in medic facilities. We currently have 495 properties in our senior housing and care portfolio with 55 operators in 37 states, and they have a stable payment coverage of approximately 1.5 times. 36 properties are in fill-ups with an investment balance of 454 million.", "You'll note a couple of new names in our top five operators. Signature Healthcare acquired and recapitalized Home Quality Management and is now our second large operator. We have 34 properties with 4582 units and an investment balance of 326 million with Signature. In connection with the recapitalization, we extended our $110 million real estate loan with a six-year term and a 10% initial rate. We also recognized a $3.9 million gain on our [inaudible] position in Home Quality Management. Signature now has enhanced liquidity with a strong platform for growth and an experienced management team. Our portfolio for Signature has excellent lease payment coverage in excess of two times.", "Another new operators is a top five senior living communities, a regional operator with eight CCRC campuses with a total capacity of 695 cottages, 590 independent living units, 309 assisted living units, 107 dementia care units, and 81 skilled nursing beds. They operate facilities with roughly 200-plus units on 30 acres to 50 acres of land with large clubhouses and fitness rooms, library and other gathering areas.", "Our medical facilities include 121 medical office buildings and 22 specialty care facilities in 23 states, encompassing over 5 billion square feet. Our specialty facilities payment coverage increased this quarter to 2.7 times. We currently have three specialty care properties and fill-ups with an investment balance of 51 million.", "The medical office net operating income was 20 million for the fourth quarter and 75 million for the year as outlined in Exhibit 4 of the earnings release. Occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 90%.", "Turning now to our outlook for Medicare and Medicaid, in 2008 nursing homes we see the full market basket, increase of 3.3% under Medicare. CMS is currently considering an administrative fix to the Medicare '08 that may result in a reduction. The proposal is a cut of approximately $4.7 billion over five years or roughly 3.5% to offset increased utilization of nine new RUGs categories created in 2006. We expect CMS to issue a proposal for fiscal year 2009 by early May.", "To give you an idea what impact that could have on our portfolio, for each one percent change in Medicare rates, our nursing portfolio payment coverage declines by roughly 3.5 basis points. We had a very strong payment coverage in the portfolio and do not anticipate any material increase in payment risk as a result of this change. Many States are also facing [inaudible] shortfalls as a result of reduced tax revenue collections and weakening consumption. This could result in Medicaid rates being cut, but historically state legislators have avoided payment cuts to nursing homes. Florida has been a particular concern in a special session with the legislature. Florida passed a 3% rate cut effective January 1, 2008. This also appears in the Governor's 2009 budget as proposed for the first six months of the 2009 fiscal year. A 3% decrease in the Florida Medicaid rate would reduce our payment coverage by 5 basis points. Again, we do not anticipate any material increase in payment risk as a result of this change.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Scott Estes for the financial update.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Ray. Good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter normalized FFO per fully diluted share increased 4% to $0.80 from $0.77 in 2006. Normalized FAD per fully diluted share increased 1% to $0.75 from $0.74 in the comparable quarter last year. Please refer to the earnings release for a detailed reconciliation of FFO and FAD to net income per common share.", "We paid a dividend for the quarter ended December 31 of $0.66 per share, the company\u2019s 147th consecutive quarterly dividend. The Board also approved a new quarterly dividend rate of $0.68 per share or $2.72 annually commencing with the May 2008 dividend, which represents a 3% increase above last year's rate.", "Our gross revenues totaled $133.5 million for the fourth quarter, up 56% versus the same quarter last year with 89% of gross revenues coming from rental income.", "Our interest expense increased to $35.5 million from $24.4 million last year, primarily as a result of debt assumed through Windrose and Rendina/Paramount transactions, interest from our convertible debt offerings completed in November of '06 and July of '07, and slightly higher average borrowings on our line of credit.", "Fourth quarter G&A came in at $9.3 million, representing 7% of quarterly revenues. We also remain comfortable with the improved quality of our loan portfolio and made no addition to the $7.4 million loan loss reserves during the quarter. There were several other items of note during the quarter. In particular, first, other income of $6.1 million in the quarter included a benefit from $3.9 million in income from [inaudible] equity provision, which was received as a part of the recapitalization transaction with Signature Healthcare that Ray previously mentioned. One other item of note in the quarter was that we recorded $11.7 million in gains on the sale of assets, which are recognized as a result of the sale of one independent living facility, one assisted living facility, and five skilled nursing assets during the quarter.", "I'm moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net real estate investments of $5 billion. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. Its leverage at the end of the year stood at 48% on a debt-to-undepreciated book capitalization basis within our targeted range of 45% to 50%. During the fourth quarter, our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage increased to 3.2 times and 2.6 times respectively.", "As of December 31, we had only $307 million drawn on our $1.15 billion line of credit leaving $843 million in availability. Combining this availability with our DRIP, which has raised nearly $70 million in each of the last two years, and $30 million in cash on hand, we have considerable flexibility in financing our anticipated investments this year. Our debt maturity schedule is also in great shape as we find the useful line of credit to repay both the $42 million in senior notes, which come due in March, and the $28 million in secured debt, which also comes due this year.", "In terms of capital for the quarter, we completed 3.5 million share offering in December with net proceeds of 147 million, which were used to pay down our line of credit. Our dividend reinvestment plan also continues to generate solid interest as we issued approximately 371,000 shares for roughly 16 million in net proceeds during the quarter.", "Now, I am going to discuss our 2008 guidance. As detailed in the earnings release, we expect to report net income available to common stockholders in a range of $1.55 to $1.65 per diluted share, FFO in a range of $3.27 to $3.37 per diluted share, and FAD in a range of $3.01 to $3.11 per diluted share. As always, our FAD guidance excludes any cash proceeds, which we may receive during calendar '08 related to prepaid rent or straight-line receivable payoffs.", "Our assumptions are discussed in detail on page 3 of our earnings release. I would like to point out a few items in particular. First, as George mentioned, our FFO per share guidance represents strong growth in a range of 5% to 8% over normalized 2007 results. Our normalized FAD guidance represents a solid 3% to 7% potential year-over-year growth.", "Our G&A forecast of $40 million to $42 million is primarily a result of further investment in our infrastructure including a significant commitment to expand what we believe to be the deepest origination scheme in the sector. Similar to the last two years, I would point out that our G&A expense in the first quarter of 2008 will include the impact of $2.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of stock and options for certain officers and directors.", "I would like to provide some additional perspective regarding how our development pipelines relates to earnings. Our 2008 investment guidance includes funded development in a range of $400 million to $500 million, representing an increase relative to the $307 million of development we funded during 2007. However, [inaudible] larger amount of construction funding projected in 2008, we also have a large number of projects, which are expected to open up our convert this year. As you can see in Exhibit 9 of our earnings release, we are forecasting $361 million of development conversions at an initial yield of 9.1%, which would represent a significant increase of about $132 million in conversions we declared during 2007.", "Finally, I will conclude with the topic at the forefront of everyone's mind, which is how do we intend to finance our growth pipeline in 2008. I think for guidance and internal modeling purposes, we believe that we\u2019ve taken a more conservative approach to how we finance our growth [inaudible] we are able to raise a combination of debt and equity, consistent with our long-term goal of maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet. However, we are also evaluating alternative capital raising options, which are available to us including potential asset sales, joint venture opportunities, bridge financing, as well as the convertible debt and preferred markets. Most importantly, I think what everyone should expect is for us to look to move opportunistically in this more difficult capital environment. Given our considerable capital availability entering the year, we do remain comfortable that we'll be able to raise the necessary capital to take advantage of the significant investment opportunities we are seeing today at cap rates, which are becoming increasingly attractive.", "With that, I turn the call back to you, George.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Scott. Let me wrap up briefly and then we will open for questions. About five years ago, we made a very strong commitment to full spectrum investing and during the last 15 months we completed our platform that contains development and property management capabilities. The results have been gratifying as we've increased our medical office building portfolio percentage to 25% and we're also quite optimistic that our efforts to grow our acute care investment will continue to gain traction as we are beginning to make inroads with strong systems providers and development groups throughout the nation.", "Let me give you a few examples of medical facility investments. One is in January of this year, we purchased a 40-bed all-private suite acute care hospital with an attached 40,000 square foot medical office building. These facilities are on a 6.3-acre site, which should allow expansion for the development of additional health care or senior housing facilities. The facility is operated by physicians and the management company. As an example of where Health Care is going, meals are available from a gourmet menu and robots deliver lab samples equipment and prescriptions anywhere in the building.", "In the East, we're investing in a new 246,000-square foot medical office building within a 40-acre site anchored by a major health system that will offer customer focused health and wellness services, providing a continuum of care including traditional medical services, wellness, radiology, therapy, lab testing, fitness, [inaudible]. And we also expect to complete investments in two new hospitals with attached MOBs, medical office buildings; one in the Midwest and one on the West Coast. Both would be projects in rapidly growing areas. Both hospital systems are academic and medical centers, which are joint venturing with physician groups and it is attempting to extend their reach out to the customer. And we are also evaluating additional hospital medical office building, cancer centers, standalone emergency departments, and combination rehab site facility. So there is quite a... there are quite a number of projects that we are evaluating at the moment.", "In the senior housing and care sector, the following are just two examples of combination facilities or CCFCs that we have added to our portfolio. In the Midwest, we've invested in a 216-unit campus that includes apartments, cottages, independent and assisted living units. Amenities include a full fitness room, hospitality center, library, theatre, billiard room, clubroom, Internet cafe, and [inaudible], and this project is part of a 700-acre planned community.", "A somewhat similar facility in the Southeast includes a 316-unit campus with a full continuum of care from cottages to skilled nursing to services. There is a full range of recreational, wellness, and social programs, and amenities include a 52,000-square foot clubhouse, ballroom and movie theatre. This project is part of an 1100-acre planned community that includes retail, office and multi-family, residential with [inaudible]. And I should say that we currently have investments in 13 projects that meet the [inaudible], and I see definition of CCRC that includes AL, assisted living, independent living and skilled nursing. Once built out in full, our investments in these 13 CCRCs will total $509 million.", "And if one were to include campuses, regardless of whether skilled nursing was a part of the project, our large combination CCRC projects would increase to 24 with a total built out commitment of $968 million. The point of this is that we believe we've made very good progress in diversifying our portfolio with 25% medical office buildings, a growing segment of combination facilities in CCRCs and some real traction in the acute care space. The quality of our real estate is improving markedly as we add state-of-the-art medical office buildings and acute care facilities as well as larger combination facilities, CCRCs, in attractive campus settings.", "Now, just on another topic, let me take a moment to acknowledge Jeff Otten as the new member of our Board. Jeff was elected to our Board on January 23, 2008. He is an experienced executive who has operated health systems including serving as CEO at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He's also run medical technology and biotech companies. He adds great depth and judgment to our team. And as I've said many times before, we believe that the capabilities of our management team and the Board of Directors are keys to the success of HCN as a leader in the senior housing and health care sectors.", "And with that, we're open for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi. Thank you, and good morning everybody.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Rich.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I guess the... just first, you mentioned the shadow pipeline of $3 billion. Did you mention\u2026 and I might have missed this, like what\u2019s sort of the source of that? Where is all that coming from? Why is it off market to you?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, a lot of it, Rich, when we are mainly doing long-term care, came out of our relationship programs, lines of credit where people commit\u2026 once we do the first projects, they commit to bringing us virtually all of their projects over a multi-year period. We have extended that to some degree in perhaps a different day by... in the acute care space and then we\u2019ll lease space by forming relationships both with health systems and developers and other providers. So it's maybe a little looser than our lines of credit in the long-term care space, but we think that in both cases we add to the predictability the certainty of doing investments.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, fair enough. When you talk about what\u2026 you said your sort of standalone SNF exposure, did you say it was 10%, I can't remember the percentage now.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It is right now the way we reported. It is at 32%... and 21%, but when we take out... when we really consider combination facilities, which we think are stronger assets generally, we drive these standalone SNFs, skilled nursing, and assisted living down to 24% and 10% respectively.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So 24% SNF and 10% assisted living?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. And I would expect that to\u2026 over the next three to five years to\u2026 at least in the SNF area to continue to go down as we do more combination facilities and frankly do a few more standalone SNFs. But that's sporadic, so you have to look at it over a longer period.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I guess that was the question. I mean where do you see those percentages going, but I guess clearly it's a push downward but...?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would hope to get SNFs... skilled nursing down to 15% on a standalone basis at some point. About the time I tell you that, I then find a really attractive set of skilled nursing or assisted living, maybe some of those are right for adding other facilities to sites and making them into combination facilities. So we start down and we go up and we go down, but it's going to ratchet down toward 15% over the next three years or so.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. You say that in the same breadth of how insensitive your coverage are to changes in Medicare reimbursement. So it's sort of like you like it but you don't like it, and I'm trying to reconcile that.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, to some degree we are dealing with the perceptions of the capital markets. We tend not to agree with many of the analysts in terms of skilled nursing. Skilled nursing in fact has been a winner in the Medicare rationalization process. They're very much favored because they provide good effective care. On the other hand, we tend to like campuses because we think over time that's going to be a much more sustainable platform than standalone any things, okay. So we just think diversification of a balanced portfolio is the best way to go.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. On cap rates, can you sort of quantify the rise you're seeing and maybe break it out amongst your key property type?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "As I indicated in the call last quarter, we think cap rates were at the lowest in mid 2007. And what we're seeing now are deals coming back to us that we previously quoted on and they didn't get done and they're coming back to us with higher cap rates. If you look at the NIC key financial indicators and their mean cap rates, the most recent data that they had with a little bit mix. IL was 7.4%, AL 9%, SNFs 12%, and CCLCs 9.1%, and that was for the third quarter of '07, reflecting deals that were negotiated several months earlier.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. So maybe a rise in the 50 basis points to 75 basis points range?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "I'd say 25 to 50 jointly.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "25 to 50. Last question, Scott, you mentioned the word bridge in your financing alternatives. And obviously that's not a really great word these days. So maybe you can sort of talk about your thought process behind considering bridge Financing.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess I just used that as a generalization to make the point that I think our model is conservative in that we assume the traditional blend of debt and equity but we're looking at all the options available to us and I think you can assume we'll be intelligent in making our decision.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. It sounds good. Thanks, Scott.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go to Kristen Brown [ph] with Deutsche Bank.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Kristen.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscaping and how it might vary by asset type in terms of acquisitions?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll start but then Ray will then jump in too. I think it's frankly a lot less competitive than it was because of the capital constraints that we have a lot\u2026 few early financial buyers going in. If they're coming in, they\u2019re still perhaps coming in more on the MOB side, medical office building side and more assisted living and the independent living I suppose, because those are more of a real estate component. But we've seen a diminution of competition. So our job and those of our colleges I guess and the other health care REITs who have funds is to make the best allocation of those funds and trust that over time, given the defensive nature of healthcare, the inelastic demand for healthcare, that reasonably priced funds will be made available to all of us to continue pursuing very good investment opportunities. Ray, you want to add something?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "Yes. Kristen, I would think that this is a very good time for us because as George alluded to, financing options are more limited than they were even six, nine months ago, so that's good news. The negative is that we anticipate transaction volumes will be down because a lot of the acquisition and refinancing activity occurred at the market peak in 2007. However, as mentioned earlier in the call, we approach our investment strategy a little bit differently using a programmatic relationship oriented approach and given the size shadow pipeline we\u2019re very bullish about the opportunity to invest this year.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "I mean you seem pretty confident in terms of volumes, but just if you don't close the volumes that you\u2019re looking at, what's the earnings impact there?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "I didn't quite hear all of that.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You\u2019re breaking up, Kristen. Did you say basically the volumes will impact their earnings this year?", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "If you don't meet your targets.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess that the point would be would be more backing [inaudible] the guidance that we gave and you can see it would be consistent with the volume we saw in 2007. And I think we're very comfortable in attaining the guidance buffers we put out at this point given the potential deal volume we are seeing.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then what do you estimate the interest savings will be with the ratings upgrade?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "[inaudible].", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "Sorry. I just asked what do you estimate your interest savings to be from the ratings upgrade?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "From our ratings upgrade? I think when we saw a relative improvement in our debt cost to capital of approximately 20 basis points.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That's it, thanks.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "We will go to Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Good morning.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jerry.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "I had a couple of things. Just one specific beforehand, non-cash comp for the quarter, do you have that and is that going to be good run rate to go forward? I know you mentioned the $2.3 million or whatever it was in 1Q, but what was it for the quarter?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "$1.3 million, it\u2019s in Exhibit 13.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was $1.298 million in the fourth quarter, and I think generally that\u2019s a reasonable run rate, again adding that $2.3 million one-time in number to that in the first quarter or '08.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay, thanks. [inaudible] dismissed I guess last night. Getting broader, you\u2019re obviously stepping up the development. I kind of have a couple of questions there. One, I don't know if you can give us a sense of sort of when that\u2026 the $360 million and the $400 million are kind of going to deliver? Is it sort of spread over the year or is it weighted [ph] one way the other? And you might want to think about putting out a quarterly schedule just to help us do the modeling because it could make a meaningful difference quarter-to-quarter depending on how the deliveries are at timed.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. We agree, Jerry. We are actually\u2026 for everyone's benefit, we are working on an enhanced supplement and hopefully if we get our act together we will get it done in this first quarter. The number, the $361 million as we looked at it, it is more heavily backend loaded in the year.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "If you had to model, I would assume that fairly two-thirds of it would be in the latter half of the year.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay and then any color on '09, it\u2019s further away obviously, but...?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "At that point it\u2019s pretty variable. We include in our\u2026 that exhibit the mandatory conversion date. So projects tend to move. It could be earlier, occasionally it can get pushed back later if there is weather delays or permitting delays. We\u2019ve had a few instances, but...", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. We will take a look at the detail. And then you are doing a lot of funding of AL, IL, CCRCs, your occupancy numbers were up, which is good, but there's obviously been a lot of nervousness in the market about impact of the housing market and those things. So I was wondering if you could just give me any color\u2026 more color from your portfolio about how you think that business is doing, risk from the housing market, and kind of your confidence in going ahead and ramping up development at this point?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Clearly, any residential projects have had some effect from these housing issues. But we've really been very pleasantly surprised to see that the... especially in the buy-in projects that we are doing quite well and we are moving ahead very steadily. It's sort of hard to know exactly whether the projects are being impacted. They're moving ahead at a reasonable pace to give us the right results. So much of it is anecdotal. I just read something about one of our projects down in the Southeast yesterday that came out that suggested that the project was not at all being affected by the housing market. That happened to be in a particularly strong housing area generally. I mean I can't help\u2026 we haven't really noticed material effects on our CCRCs. I might add to that, about half of the... more than half of our CCRCs, at least the way we're looking at them, are rental and even if we extend it to campuses, which might not have the SNF component, Jerry, we're about half rental as opposed to the buy-in. So the thought would be if there are any that are going to be affected somewhat it would be the buy-in. And again, we've been pretty pleased with the success to date. We're watching it clearly.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "But even in your buy-in you're saying you're really not seeing an impact in terms of occupancy slippage or slower lease subs.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "If anything, one project in the Midwest is somewhat behind budget, but it's actually making up for lost time. What we are finding is, anecdotally\u2026 again, what we are finding is that sometimes the buy-in doesn't happen the way it was budgeted. In other words, if you are just in early stage construction, it seems as though people aren't quite that eager to move and now that we're almost ready to open that particular Midwest facility, it appears that there is an uptick in the purchases. So I think we're going to probably have a little bit more feel for the CCRC market in the buy-in and the timing of the same as each quarter unfolds. We are happy to do that. Scott, did you want to answer?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I just wanted to maybe give everyone a little bit more color. I think entrance fee communities represent currently about 5% of our portfolio. There's actually 12 communities in the portfolio today. Seven of those are under construction, four aren't still up. Of the four that aren\u2019t still up, three of the four are actually on budget. The one as George mentioned that is slightly behind is actually meeting absorption expectations, but having a little bit higher expenses ,and then the one that is stabilized actually has coverage after management fees of 1.7 times and occupancy of about little over 90% for the last 12 months. So that's the perspective on the portfolio today, which is pretty reasonable I think.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "And obviously you've got confidence going forward you wouldn't be funding more development.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. We actually think these are going to be very, very strong properties and if any of them fill a little more slowly because of the housing crisis, we don't think it's a long-term effect whatsoever. And as Scott indicated to, as we look at the CCRCs the way we're looking at it, 9 out of 13 are stable and as we extend that to campuses that don't have the SNF component but those are the larger CCRC combination projects, 16 out of 24 are stable. So I think we're really being very careful about taking on development risk, but we will continue to do that with the operators have proved that they do a great job of looking at the markets, building, and then filling in facilities. We think these are clearly better platforms in the long run.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Okay. And just... and on the\u2026 my last question, on the sort of acute care side, which is as you\u2019d indicated it's kind of a growing business for you. Anything you're doing there to kind of differentiate yourself from your competitors, I mean it\u2019s a handful of other REITs that are sort of out there in that niche?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think so, Jerry. I think for one thing, we've been in\u2026 we have a full service platform, as you know. So we can do the development or we can interface appropriately with some other developer that we work with and we can do the property management on their medical office buildings. And as you well know that some of the hospital systems like to have a buffer between themselves and their key doctors so that they don't have to worry about stark or fraud and abuse kind of issues. But I think finally\u2026 I think that our experience in the healthcare arena for all these years, in my experience for nine years being on the Board of an academic medical center together with the experience of our acute care people means that we can bring a lot of ideas to the health systems, what we're seeing around the country, what we think might be appropriate for them in their particular market. And we really expect to continue to add to our infrastructure in that space because we don't think that marketing to the acute care space is done the same way you do long-term care. You have to... one has to bring ideas, experience, be able to deal with doctors and hospital administrators, and I think we have some capabilities there that others may not.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We'll go to Philip Martin with Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Yes, good morning.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Phil.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Phil.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Yes. Just following up a little bit on Jerry's question there, George, certainly the health systems are probably attracted to Health Care REIT as a capital source or an alternative. How much of the decision to maybe work with the Health Care REIT is driven by the need for these health systems to expand and maybe bring in other long-term care alternatives such as more of a campus style CCRC program, etcetera?", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think\u2026 and I want Fred Farrar to feel free to step in after I'm done as well. But I think that the health systems are looking hard right now for all kinds of ideas, okay. The world is changing rather dramatically for them, and the slow moving not-for-profit systems could actually find themselves in a bit of trouble several years down the road if they don't begin to move, because there is, one, an outreach sort of movement so that some of the hospitals that I mentioned\u2026 hospital MOBs that I mentioned that are going out to the suburbs to chase customers, to go where the customer is. That is so different than say, five or six years ago when the only MOBs that really made sense to a lot of the analysts, right on the campus attached to the hospital or whatever, but the fact that there is sponsorship by the hospital system, the health system is maybe building an MOB out of the suburbs to be followed by a smaller hospital or they\u2019re building an emergency department to be followed by other types of health facilities suggest that the world is very dynamic.", "So more to your question, Philip, we've had some success, especially in I suppose planned communities out away from the central core and talking to hospital systems about our ability to bring CCRCs and other types of long-term care assets, senior care assets to them because those can be viewed as you well know as a feeder to that health system. So it can very favorable. Some like that, some don't. Obviously, it depends on the size of the property, but it could well be that we could do some things for the health systems if they have the particularly good site, but it's way too many acres for them. We could also not only bring them the feeder system, but we in fact can facilitate completion of purchase and the build-out and development of that larger community.", "Fred, do you want to add anything?", "Frederick L. Farrar - Executive Vice President", "I think your focus on outreach facilities is very apropos as systems look to go where the patients want their treatment. And also our development pipeline through developer partners give us access into those systems that\u2026 or relationships that could take years to develop.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Do you find, Fred, that a lot of these health systems are lacking enough long-term care or senior living services and benefit by some programs that a health care REIT could bring?", "Frederick L. Farrar - Executive Vice President", "It really varies by market. Some of these systems aren't particularly focused on that and others are. But we're seeing more of these, as George mentioned, these planned communities that include a medical component as well as a long-term senior housing component.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay. As the... maybe this is for Ray, but margins at the operator level, can you talk a little bit about what's happening at the operator level in terms of margin, rent growth, and even in terms of supply-demand fundamentals, which I think are pretty good, but again are these operators seeing what they need to see at the operator level and the demand level for their services to justify their development programs showing forward?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "Let me break that down into a couple of components. I think in terms of existing facilities and their operating performance as reflected by the payment coverages we're seeing and by the industry statistics being published by NIC in both their key financial indicators and their MAP data, the long-term care and senior housing industries are operating at a very high level, some of the best operating performance we'd ever see. So the operating fundamentals continue to remain strong.", "In terms of new development, that is a market-by-market analysis. In some markets, the rental rates paid by building occupants will not justify development costs and in others they will. So you really have to look that in a market-by-market basis.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Do you find that the majority of our portfolio is located in above average growth markets, which I know can be defined any number of ways, but...?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "Well, roughly two-thirds of our portfolio is located in the top 100 MFAs. So as the MFAs go, so go the opportunities for us.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Yes, good morning. Couple of clarification questions on number, my others have been answered. On the other income line, I understand the 3.9 million comes out. The figures still comes out about 1 million higher than it's been in other quarters. Is that a reasonable run rate to use for next year?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It does run between probably 1 million and 2 million. One thing we did do this quarter is we moved the property management income from Paramount. Our property management businesses, MOBs that they manage for third parties, up into that line, previously it was reduction in property operating expenses that was about 500,000 this quarter.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, I'll give modeling somewhere between 1.5 million, 2 million would probably be about right.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay, fair enough. And just wanted... the guidance for depreciation is kind of\u2026 for the full year will be flat compared to where it was in the fourth quarter, am I missing something? I think guidance is 160?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That is correct. We obviously have a very detailed model with estimates of timing of everything. So maybe we could look at that and if I notice anything I'll give you a ring, but...", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay. It comes down the wash [ph] with FFO anyway, but I was just curious about that. And then\u2026 all my other stuff has been answered. Thanks a lot.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Omotayo Okusanya with UBS.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Yes, good morning. Just going back to the development, going on back to what Jerry was talking about earlier on, just 2009, the conversion, I noticed that the yield has come down from where you had them at third quarter. You have them at 8.7 this quarter versus 9.9 last quarter. Just wondering if there was anything specific going in with those properties that caused the change?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It\u2019s Scott. I think on that\u2026 with\u2026 in regards to that number specifically, the biggest factor is the fact that we've added, I think it\u2019s a little over $70 million MOB construction that is expected to converge in 2009 that will squeeze [ph] that number from the number that would have been reported last quarter. That's something that we started in the fourth quarter.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Okay.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And that is actually the most significant factor. Otherwise, those numbers tend to move around slightly, treasuries may move around but we do have floors on [inaudible].", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "And with the ramp up in development activity across the CCRCs, the assisted living facilities, and you mentioned the medical office buildings, just with the big ramp up in fourth quarter of '07 do you still expect that you should be able to convert quite a lot of those properties in '08 so you\u2019re pretty much going to have them constructed and ready to go by the end of '08 within a year? Am I reading that right?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I guess I don't have the number for what we had in the last quarter, but that number\u2026 no, we would have had projects that would have been underway before this, the numbers that we would have started in the fourth quarter, in addition to I would think most of the projects that we would have started in the fourth quarter would be out and\u2026 further than that. Generally speaking, you probably average\u2026 you look at\u2026 it ranges from 12 months at the short end to 24 to 36 months for a larger campus project.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "So that's what I was thinking\u2026 the CCRC balance, you have committed balances of about $614 million as of fourth quarter.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Third quarter that balance was 464, for assisted living it was 218 this quarter versus 156 last quarter, but in general you have your conversions going up for 2008 from 270 last quarter to 360 this quarter just this stuff is expected to come on really fast and I thought it took longer to develop some of these projects.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The one other impact, Omotayo, is we had about 40 million to 50 million of projects run over that were previously expected to convert in the fourth quarter of this year, they've rolled over into...", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Okay. That explains quiet a bit I think.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "There was some weather delays and some permitting delays on several of our projects that pushed them into 2008.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Okay, that is helpful. And then going back to the whole idea of raising capital this year, could you talk a little bit about kind of with all the different alternatives you may have, kind of listing preference what you would like to do first versus what you would like to do least of the four, five options that you stated earlier on?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It is obviously difficult to answer [inaudible] issue common stock of 55 bucks a share, right? We have to basically\u2026 I think the way we intended it\u2026 and we are a little different, we talked about it in July. We prefer to give guidance including investments because I think it is important to give color on the investment growth we are seeing, but I think we've assumed the traditional kind of 50-50 debt and equity structure. Obviously, the unsecured market is horrible right now. I don\u2019t think we will be inclined to do anything there, given where spreads are. So we will actually be watching all the markets opportunistically. We actually are looking at some potential for recycling capital in an environment like this. We think that is a good option available to us. And then, obviously we are watching the equity markets closely and we'll be as opportunistic as we can.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS Securities", "Great. Thank you.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Pike with Merrill Lynch.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, everybody.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, just a follow-up somewhat on that question, I guess back to Kristen\u2019s question. I think you quoted the 20 basis points saving, that is on the line, correct? But if you were forced to issue unsecured at this point, given the re-rating upward from the agencies, where do you think the market is at this point?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We've looked as recently as the ... no, we watch it everybody. It's ugly, I mean our spreads and for everyone in the REIT land has gone up very significantly. There are... I don't think there has been any REIT on securities you\u2019ve got to try to get estimated pricing today [inaudible] exercising utility, but I think five-year unsecured will be as high as 7.25 and all-in costs in 10 years...", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Probably it's 50 up from there, right?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. it's even a 100 [inaudible] order. So obviously those are prohibitive and then you say\u2026 we obviously think about what our long-term cost of capital is and I think it is somewhat less than that. We don't obviously feel like the markets will stay there for ever, but we don't anticipate doing anything in either those two markets until the conditions improve.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I guess back to the line, understanding you pushed it out this quarter, at what point do you guys feel comfortable and where should we expect you folks to start to look to term out some of the short-term debt into longer-term financing alternatives? 307 at the end of the quarter, right?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. The $843 million available on our $1.15 billion lines, and yes, there is potential for a DRIP in cash on hand. We basically did hit the mid-point of our investment guidance and we wouldn't need to access the capital markets very much. On the other hand, the way we looked at it and the way we looked at our equity deal in December, we have to be opportunistic as we really see it's kind of a good investment opportunity. So we look at it everyday.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I'm sorry I missed this, Ray, but the yields on the sales and payoffs... I'm sorry, not so much the payoffs, but the yields on the acquisitions and the loans in the quarter and the timing, can you provide that for modeling purposes?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "I would just assume mid-quarter, the new investment guidance.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "No, what you guys...", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "The fourth quarter we had 21 senior housing at 7.5, average expected yield at 10.2, MOBs 31 million at 7.5, CapEx and loans of 127 million at 10.1, and funded CIP of $119 million with yield upon high convergence of 9%.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "And you guys provided the timing in the previous press release when you walked through that stuff because I couldn't get it.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We don't have it here, Chris. I mean...", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "That's what I'm really concerned about, the timing.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The acquisitions\u2026 add those two numbers up, the $52 million or so in the mid-quarter, the loans were basically almost mid-quarter as well. So both of those you should model like mid-quarter.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then I guess back to Ray. From the cap rate... the cap rate question earlier, can you just run through coverages on those caps to get back the lease yields?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "Well, I quoted the NIC industry cap rates and those don't come along with coverages. You can sort of look at our portfolio and what its coverages are to get a sense for it.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Fine.", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "But we're seeing\u2026 I'd say, generally we're seeing lease yields on MOBs in the 7 to 8, and on seniors housing in the 8 to 9 category.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And I guess, George, back to your comments regarding MOBs, I guess on the Tenet call yesterday management spoke to potentially an MOB divestiture. I'm just wondering if you guys know any specifics about that portfolio, how big it is and any kind of market chatter on it?", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "No, we get some market intelligence, but we don't know enough to weigh in here.", "Christopher Pike - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Raymond W. Braun - President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We will go to a follow-up question from Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Yes, Scott, one more question on modeling. I might have missed this if it was earlier\u2026 you ended the year with shares outstanding of $85.4 million. How do you get the $92 million guidance for diluted?", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That was my point, Rob. When we model guidance we include financing or generic financing assumptions, which include a blend of debt and equity.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay. So... all right. So that would also imply that if I'm not going to assume\u2026 if one doesn't assume an equity offering, one would also probably have a slightly higher interest expense number. I know you don't give it, but that would sort of\u2026 that would come on the model.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, and you could run out higher on the line and that would positively impact earnings relative to what we gave in our guidance.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Co.", "Okay, I understand that now. Okay, good enough. Thanks.", "Scott A. Estes - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we have no other questions at this time.", "George L. Chapman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Well, we appreciate everybody participating in the call, and Scott will be available for follow-up calls. So that's it.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. And that does conclude today's conference call.

This is Lisa Mayr, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Sunrise. Joining me today are Paul Klaassen, Sunrise's Founder and CEO; Tiffany Tomasso, our Chief Operating Officer; Mark Ordan, our Chief Investment and Administrative Officer; and Rick Nadeau, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being recorded and that the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 applies to this conference call. During the course of this call, the company will make various remarks concerning management's expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors including those identified in our 2006 Form 10-K that we filed with SEC on March 24, 2008. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future. For further discussion on the company's forward-looking statements, we refer you to our 2006 Form 10-K.", "During this call we will be discussing certain comparative preliminary financial data and operating metrics for the first quarter of 2008 and 2007, including total revenue under management and revenues, average daily rate, expenses and occupancy for our same community portfolio, consolidated communities and unconsolidated ventures. While we believe these metrics are useful indicators of trends in our management business, they should not be considered indicative of the results of operations of the company for the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2007.", "Also, please refer to our May 8 press release and related Form 8-K filing for additional information regarding these metrics and to our 2006 Form 10-K for significant developments that are expected to have a financial impact, a financial statement impact during 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. Any financial information discussed during the call regarding 2007 and the first quarter of 2008 is preliminary and remains subject to review. As such, this information is not final or complete and remains subject to change, possibly materially.", "I would like to now turn the call over to Paul Klaassen.", "Paul Klaassen", "Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. As you know, this is our first conference call since completing our restatement, and hopefully the last one where we don't have current financial statements to discuss. Our plan for today's conference call is to review four areas. First, our operations and results for the quarter. Second, our business model. Next, our views on capital markets. And finally, to share some insight into our financial statement filing status and our balance sheet.", "So, first, I'd like to have Tiffany, our Chief Operating Officer review with you what our operating results looks like this quarter. Tiffany?", "Tiffany Tomasso", "Thanks, Paul. Hello, everyone. Our operating teams have been working hard not only serving our residents, but also continuing to drive the positive revenue and expense trends [we saw] over the second half of last year. We are pleased with what they accomplished this past quarter.", "As you saw in today's press release, the same community revenues grew about 8% for the quarter or about 7% if you adjust for the extra day of leap year. Approximately, half of this increase came from base rate increases and another third of the increase came from extended care revenues. We charge our residence a base room rate and then based on regular needs assessment developed by our resident care team, and in conjunction with the resident and family, we develop an individualized service plan.", "As you know, we have different levels of pricing depending on the care level each resident needs. This past quarter we saw an increase in both rates for extended care, as well an increase in the utilization of these services. On the same community occupancy side, we saw a slight decline year-over-year from 90.6% to 90.3%. The good news is that, we saw an increase in our occupancy on the consolidated portfolio of 1% due to the strategies we began implementing last year to drive occupancy and mix, particularly in skilled nursing.", "While we did see an occupancy decline of a little over 1% for the communities and ventures, almost all of this is attributable to eight communities; they are having various operational challenges. We are focused on resolving these issues and seeing the occupancy results improve. The remaining 139 JV communities saw sequential decline of only 0.2%.", "We are asked regularly if we are seeing an impact of the housing market on the occupancy, and I can't say that we are. We continue to see new leads consistent with prior year levels and the percentage of leads that are converted to move in is in line with previous trends. We did see a slight increase in move outs primarily due to [debt]. Going forward, we see the opportunity to drive improvement in occupancy by focusing our efforts to reduce our vacant inventory which is primarily in our assisted living product line, and in our smaller studio style units.", "We are looking at this closely by community and by market, and we are implementing a variety of strategies to accomplish this.", "Next, I'd like to discuss same community operating expenses. As I shared in previous calls, this has been an increased focus of ours through the last 12 months, and we saw the positive trend from the previous two quarters continue this quarter as well. Our key controllable expenses are labor, food, repair and maintenance, utilities and insurance.", "Labor makes up about 60% of our operating expenses. While we saw an increase in labor hours, primarily due to the increases in extended care medication fees, other salary increases were moderate as we effectively managed both wage increases and overtime. Our next largest operating expenses are food, utilities, repair and maintenance and insurance which make up about 20% of the same community expenses. These categories combined for only 2% over the prior year.", "Our purchasing group has been working over the last year to increase the companywide contracts and to improve compliance with our contracts at a community level. In a period of increasing food costs, we have seen increases below the current inflation rate, while at the same time we have enhanced the quality of these programs for our residence.", "Despite recent cost increases in the utilities area, we continue to benefit from the energy contracts we have, as well as the reduced consumption attributable to our 2007 energy efficient lighting retrofit that we did in the first quarter of last year.", "On repair and maintenance, we saw a very modest increase over the year ago quarter. In this area we continue to focus on leveraging our purchasing power through both national as well as regional service agreements, and instituting tighter budgeting and expense controls. Additionally, we are benefiting from the implementation of an enterprise wide present at maintenance and reporting system. We believe this will continue to pay-off in future periods.", "Finally, on the workers comp and liability insurance, we are renewing premiums at levels slightly below last year. To summarize, we are pleased with the results of our operating team that they delivered this past quarter. Our teams love improving the quality of life for the seniors they serve while also improving the profitability of our [company]. Paul?", "Paul Klaassen", "Thanks, Tiffany. Now I'd like to take a minute and discuss our business model from a cash flow perspective. And also touch on our strategy of building our core assisted living with memory care model. We have built over 200 of these buildings and they are the most successful communities in our portfolio. This model, which we have been refining for many years now, is very popular with consumers and serves a need-driven segment of the market, difficult for others to replicate and it produces very high customer satisfaction and excellent return.", "Building new Sunrise communities is our primary growth engine and with 40 projects under construction and over 100 additional properties under contract, our development pipeline is clearly, very important to our business model and growth strategy and getting lots of attention. Of course, before we can build our prototype assisted living and memory care mansion model, we need to identify a site. We have identified over 350 zip codes in North America where we next want to build. These sites are primarily in the 30 major metropolitan markets of North America and then the United Kingdom; we have a similar process in place. We have a highly developed zip code and site identification process which includes everything from a detailed economic metric modeling to having our own development officers driving around neighborhoods.", "Because we are building in market clusters where we are already operating, we have the experience of our other communities in the same geographic area to draw from us well. A typical US Sunrise mansion costs about $25 million to develop, and each mansion serves about 95 to 100 residents in about 80 units. We also build larger campus mansions and they include some independent living units as well.", "Development costs vary of course, depending on land values and where we are building. We just develop our communities and ventures where typically our capital partner will own and invest 80% of the project, and we will invest and own 20%. Typically, the projects are financed with 25% equity and the venture obtains a construction loan for the other 75%. Today, because of the tightening of the credit markets, we are actually modeling a 72.5% construction loan and 27.5% equity. Sunrise does not guarantee the principal of the debt and is secured by the communities and venture. So, for a $25 million project, about $7 million of equity is invested and our 20% portion of that will be about 1.4 million.", "A typical venture that we are structuring today will produce four different cash flow streams to Sunrise. I will briefly review those. The first are the professional fees that we receive for design, development, preopening sales and marketing, financing, licensing of the building and training. This is typically 7 to 8% of project cost. The second cash flow stream is the 5 to 7% revenue management fee that we receive from the long-term, typically 30-year, management contract. If a community is operating above certain benchmarks, we are sometimes able to receive incentive management fees as well.", "The third source of cash flow from each new community is the prorata share of cash flow distributions after debt service that we receive from our ownership percentage which is, as I mentioned earlier, typically 20%. And the fourth source of cash flow is from recapitalizations. While a community is sold to another party or refinanced, we receive our prorata share of the distributions. In addition, we often get what we call a promote. This was the additional amount that we receive above our prorata share if the capital partner's return exceeds a predetermined their predetermined threshold. It is important to note that in the event of the sale to another party, are our management remains nice as does typically our ownership percentage.", "Because all of our development activity consumes a great deal of capital, we regularly get questions on what the capital markets are like right now in terms of the availability of debt and equity for our projects. And clearly, these are the most turbulent capital markets in many years. However, the positive aspect of tight credit markets is that it helps ensure that only well-capitalized and well-conceived projects by experienced providers can get funding. This in turn serves as an effective barrier entry and protects against over building.", "Because we have about a $1 billion of new constructs underway right now, and we expect to do another billion in the next 12 months, I have asked Mark Ordan, our Chief Investment and Administrative Officer, to comment on capital availability. Mark has only been at Sunrise for a short time, but he has considerable experience in the real estate and capital markets business. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks, Paul. I'd like to share what I've seen in the months I've been here and where we're focused. On the capital market side, we have seen clear interest in financing the growth of our core business, both from debt and equity sources. I expect to be closer to turbulent capital markets, our expanding development base, and just good corporate finance reasons, we will look to broaden our array of financial partners and financing options. For debt, we have generally been at 70% to 75% loan to total cost ratio.", "Spreads of course have widened but with lower base rates we are borrowing in line with last year. We have to work harder than we used to and there is some compression on loan to cost ratios, but lenders who know senior housing and want to continue to do business in the sector. On our current pipeline, we have closed loans or identified lenders for all those projects currently under construction. For those starts that we have slated for the rest of the year, we are working hard to raise debt capital one community at a time and we remain cautiously optimistic. We often do not receive final debt commitments until just before construction start dates, so our visibility is somewhat limited.", "While we remain cautiously optimistic on our starts for this year, we do want to remind everyone that our pipeline is scalable and flexible. We are not required to begin construction just because we may own the land.", "Now, let me step back and assure you that we are driven to strengthen our core, employ our capital very smartly, and work closely with our capital partners. We are considering all ways to increase our profitability and maximize the value of our portfolio. We are determined to review and control all components of G&A and expenses to enhance profitability. As you know, expenses related to our investigation and restatement were very substantial. Of course, this is overwhelmingly a non-recurring expense but we will have to work hard to offset the ongoing costs from some of the changes we have made. We look forward in the coming months to reporting to you on the result of this work. Now, I have the pleasure of turning the conference call over to your Chief Financial Officer, Rick Nadeau?", "Rick Nadeau", "Thanks, Mark. I am going to briefly explain a change in our disclosure, review some financial information related to our balance sheet. And finally, I will provide an update on our status to become a current filer.", "First, regarding the disclosure you found in today's press release. You will note that we changed our community count retroactively. Previously, there were a few legacy communities that had multiple licenses and multiple buildings. We are managing these campuses as one community and the new counts reflect that. This did not change the unit or the resident counts. We also decided to provide you with units as well as residents. We have included a separate line for Greystone communities. Greystone management contracts generally earn a flat fee of about $20,000 per month.", "In 2007, we provided professional services for approximately 50 different projects. We also deployed $11 million in seed capital to six projects in 2007 and we expect to receive very good returns on that investment. We plan to provide more information on Greystone when we complete our 2007 financial statements.", "The final change we made this quarter was in our calculation of average daily rate for the same community portfolio. We are now including community fees, which is a one-time fee usually representing about one month's rent. The impact on the ADR is about $3.50 in both periods. Each of these changes was made for all periods presented.", "Now, let's talk about the balance sheet. We had unrestricted cash of about $80 million at March 31, 2008, down from $150 million in December 2007. In addition, we borrowed another $28 million under our bank credit facility for a net decrease of $98 million. We have used $20 million of this cash on the completion of the restatement, $35 million to pay for our cost over runs for our remaining condo project, and another $8 million for loans to our German venture.", "We have also significantly invested in our pipeline. In fact, for the 40 communities currently under construction, Sunrise's remaining equity commitment is only $6 million. We are still in the process of auditing our 2007 numbers and we are not yet able to give you the numbers related to our construction and progress balance, but it has increased.", "We are developing five communities on balance sheets and we have purchased a number of land parcels, all of which we expect to move to joint ventures. We did not have much borrowing capacity at March 31, 2008, under our current bank credit facility because we are limited at the $160 million maximum until we file our 2007 financial statements. However, yesterday we received net proceeds of approximately $103 million related to the debt financing of 16 previously unlevered properties owned by Sunrise. We plan to use most of this to pay down our balance on our bank credit facility. We feel comfortable with our current liquidity levels.", "There are a handful of other pressing issues we have been hearing about when we talk to our investors. And I would like to address a few of them now. First is G&A. As you heard from Mark, we are focusing our attention on reducing our G&A costs. There are really two components of G&A that you see on Sunrise's financial statements, corporate G&A and regional.", "For 2008, we are budgeting approximately 40% of our G&A as regional support for our communities, and the other 60% in corporate and IT costs. During 2008, we do not expect to see any G&A savings as we are in the process of the implementing our remediation plan and ensuring that we have adequate controls in place. Going forward, however, we want to make our corporate G&A structure more scalable and this is our focus in 2008.", "Another question we have been asked about lately is capital expenditures. For 2008 maintenance CapEx, we are budgeting from less than $1,000 to $3,000 per unit. The amounts will vary significantly with the age of the community. For communities in ventures, CapEx for the first four years is typically under $1,000 per unit, but for some of our older communities, especially the acquired ones, we can spend up to $3,000 per unit. For our consolidated portfolio, we plan to spend about $24 million on community related CapEx in 2008.", "Finally, what I think everyone wants to hear about is when we will be current. We are still targeting completion the 2007 Form 10-K by the bank deadline of July 31, 2008. As I mentioned on our last call, the 2008 quarters will shortly follow the filing of the 2007 10-K. We have made a few steps this quarter to provide additional information in our disclosure, and you will see more coming as we become current. We recognize you are frustrated; we are frustrated that we have been unable to provide you all the tools you need to value our business. We are committed to getting current and bringing fully, and becoming fully transparent in our financial reporting.", "We appreciate your patience and your feedback. Now, I will turn it back to Paul for some concluding remarks.", "Paul Klaassen", "Thanks, Rick. In summary, we are focused on getting our extended pipeline finance and build, improving operate trends and controlling overhead costs, as well as becoming a current financial filer. We are watching our capital allocation carefully and focusing on growing our core businesses. With strong underlying demographic and sector fundamentals and a solid development pipeline now, we are looking forward to the rest of 2008.", "I will now like to open the call to any questions that you might have. Operator, you can proceed.", "Questions and Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, Mr. Klaassen. (Operator Instructions). We will go to Doug Rothschild of [Garden]. Please go ahead, sir.", "Doug Rothschild", "Hi, guys. I don't know it became the first question but -- the occupancy for the joint ventures, you mentioned eight facilities that had specific problems. Can you expand a little bit on what the problems are and were and how you intend on fixing them?", "Tiffany Tomasso", "Okay. Hi, it's Tiffany. I would say some are market specific, but obviously given the labor intensive nature of what we do, there is always a people component to it as well. So, it could be turnover in our Executive Director Positions or [GCRs], but we're focused on it, we're watching it and expect to see that that will improve in those communities over the course of this year.", "Doug Rothschild", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We will go to Derrick Dagnan of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead, sir.", "Derrick Dagnan - Avondale Partners", "Good afternoon. Some of your peers have talked about general economic weakness hitting the business and causing a higher level of move outs, and in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you feel good about the housing market, but could you talk a little bit to maybe just general economic weakness, things like job losses or maybe seniors who look at their portfolios and watch their investment balances dwindle or things like that? Is that having an impact at all, do you think, on move out rates?", "Tiffany Tomasso", "Well, just to clarify what I said specifically was -- we are asked regularly if we are seeing an impact of the housing market on our occupancy. I can't say definitively that we are or we aren't. The trends would not indicate that, so we are still seeing good leads year over year. We are still seeing good closing ratios year over year. Primarily our business is need driven. The bulk of our units are assisted living, memory care versus independent living and we didn't see a big decline in that portfolio. We continue to see good rate growth. We did see a spiking move out primarily attributable to Jeff, I think there is this typical seasonality that we experienced.", "Paul Klaassen", "Derrick, your question was very specifically but also with early move outs related to the economy, and I cannot, I've not heard anecdotally much less in any other evidence that we are having move outs because of the economy. I also have been around here long enough to remember the last recession and I can't remember then seeing any of that. So whether or not it's making people cautious, we'll see that 30 basis points in the past year reduction while we have achieved good revenue and ADR growth, I think, and we are monitoring it very closely. But at this stage I would be more concerned if I were not seeing good pricing power because we are seeing good revenue growth. We are monitoring it. We have indicated earlier one of our portfolios we saw an increase in our consolidated portfolio that did see a decrease in our same community and that was somewhat isolated to a group of properties. And we are seeing a little bit more down, a little bit more evidence of softness in Florida, for example. That might be housing related.", "Derrick Dagnan - Avondale Partners", "Okay. Thanks. And one follow-up if I could. On the margin, the contribution of margin, it looked like you had expansion year-over-year, I was wondering on the same store basis, and I think the same store is a little different this quarter than how you reported it in the fourth quarter of '07. Back of the envelope, I am calculating, there is kind of a significant decline in that margin. Could you add any color there?", "Tiffany Tomasso", "A significant decline in which portfolio?", "Derrick Dagnan - Avondale Partners", "The same store, was it consolidated? In general, the same store contribution margin in the first quarter of '08 versus the fourth quarter of '07. I realize that the unit counts are little different. So I know that the same store portfolio has changed a little bit but I am seeing kind of a larger change there sequentially than I would expect to see.", "Tiffany Tomasso", "Why don't we get back to you on that one?", "Derrick Dagnan - Avondale Partners", "I maybe mistaken. Thanks, that's all I have.", "Tiffany Tomasso", "Okay, we'll get back to you on that.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We will go to Frank Morgan of Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.", "Frank Morgan - Jefferies & Company", "Good afternoon, two questions here. In terms of your remaining unencumbered assets, how much additional capital you think you could pull out from that if, I know you said you just completed about $100 million? That's my first question. And then second question kind of comes back to the issue of rates, Paul talked about the healthy rate growth that you've had, but I'm just curious, are any concerns about just how far you can push rates? And have you seen any evidence so far out in the marketplace about people starting to discount to in order to build occupancies? Thanks.", "Rick Nadeau", "I will take the first part of that question. This is Rick. The 16 consolidated properties that we did finance were the 16 properties that we're having good NOI experience and that made the most sense for us to lever. We don't have a significant amount of completely unlevered assets at this particular time, but we are looking at all of our assets constantly to understand their fair values and whether it would make a financial sense to lever them up. But, yeah, we do have some unlevered communities but we really went in and pulled out the better ones and did the financing than I announced that we closed yesterday. Paul or Tiffany?", "Paul Klaassen", "On the discounting question, you can have discounting and also the healthy rate growth that we have had over the last several years. So I think, frankly, just we've been focused on that and maintaining that. We are already the price leader and if you got a great product and people want it. Now we will selectively for the smaller rooms, units, the least attractive units in building, take a look at our pricing and may, on occasion, in fact do some incentivizing to move though. But overall, you can see from the history, the last year and the last three or four years now, I think our pricing power has been very good and we are not, we are not buying occupancy. We see a little bit of it out there in the sector in general, but it is usually for supply that is older and less attractively positioned.", "Frank Morgan - Jefferies & Company", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we'll take an additional moment for questions to queue.", "Tiffany Tomasso", "While we are waiting for that, Derrick, it's Tiffany. I just want to get back to on the sequential margin issue on, I think the consolidated portfolio. We believe it's due to the health and dental expense credits in Q4 of '07. So they were onetime, we disclosed them. And if you look at Q1 of '08 versus Q3 of '07, probably a better comparison.", "Operator", "We will go to [Zayed Hamam] of STS Management. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, how are you? My question is regarding, I guess it would seem that at least until the end of 2009, assuming that that the restatement goes as planned, you're going to have plenty of -- I guess lets called it standby liquidity with that facility. So, I guess my question is, what was the purpose for the logic behind doing the mortgage financing if you felt like, assuming that there was plenty of liquidity there?", "Rick Nadeau", "That financing will save us about 50 basis points right now compared to the rate that's on the bank credit facility. Plus I thought that it made sense to, since I'm held at $160 million right now, I wanted to improve our liquidity, but you are correct in your observation that once we get current with the financial statements our line will spring back the $250 million. At that time I will evaluate whether it makes sense to keep it at 250 or to actually ask for a reduction.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. So, the other thing I wanted to ask you is, by the way, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the half chance if something goes wrong with the restatement you can buy yourself a little bit of time. The next question I have is regarding the cash flows in the quarter. So I am just sort of trying to guess here, so lets say there was about $100 million decrease in net cash over the quarter, $20 million went to the restatement and $35 million was cost over run, so let's call that $50 million, and then $8 million -- so, let's call it about $60 million. So that means that, about $40 million was committed to the pipeline, or $40 million or $50 million was committed to the pipeline. How quick does that come back? I mean is that a sort of thing where, I know that you are doing some things. I call it on spec but it is really not spec because I think you have some agreements there, so how quickly does it come back out?", "Rick Nadeau", "It is on spec for a very short period of time. We don't speculate. We don't let ourselves get it too far ahead on the activities. But there will be circumstance where the land is ready to be settled and it makes sense for us to buy it or it will make sense for us to make a few expenditures before we have a joint venture partner or in very limited circumstances before we have construction debt. I think we managed that CIP exactly the way a manufacture would the inventory. They will use it to work on the efficiency of our organization. So, we are a little long on CIP at this point and we are working diligently to get that put into joint ventures, as I said. So I do think that as that occurs, that will bring cash back to us as we push it out in accordance with our business model to develop most of our communities in joint ventures. We also did have in net cash of; we announced back in 2007 that we had some insurance credits to give back to the communities based on some positive experience that we were seeing in health and dental and some positive experience that we were seeing in other insurance lines. Those are also being credited back to the communities in the first quarter, so that's also caused some cash drain during this period.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. So --", "Paul Klaassen", "One item on that. Of course the 20% equity, you put into our projects, into our community for the 20% ownership, that's an investment we are making in the long run. And we don't get that back quickly. We get it back through returns, recapitalization through financing. And we like owing that 20%, that's a, we talked around here about that should go to 25 or 30%. That's a very attractive long-term investment for the company and its shareholders and that's the primary use of our operating cash.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Got it. And then I guess my -- I am just trying to fully understand there. I guess if we normalize out all these onetime costs, restructuring plus pipeline. Is it cash flow; operationally is there cash flow positive or neutral. What was it for the quarter?", "Rick Nadeau", "We haven't closed the books and I can't give that to you at this time.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Rick Nadeau", "We are managing off of cash forecast and --", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Well, thanks a lot guys. This is a good call.", "Paul Klaassen", "Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). At this time we have no further questions. For closing remarks, I will turn it back over to Mr. Paul Klaassen.", "Paul Klaassen", "Once again, thank you for joining us. We look forward to updating you again in just a few months.

My name is Ashley and I will be your conference operator today. (Operator Instructions)  Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Bow, Vice President of Communications of Health Care REIT.", "", "Jim Bow", "", "Thank you Ashley, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2008 Conference Call.  In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at www.hctreit.com.  I would like to remind everyone that we are holding a live webcast on today\u2019s call which may be accessed on the company\u2019s website as well.", "Certain statements made during the conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.", "I would not like to turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks.   Please go ahead George.", "George Chapman", "", "Thank you, Jim.  I will spend the first portion of my comments briefly reviewing our 2008 highlights and then address how we are positioned to weather the storm that unfortunately we are all facing.  Finally I will discuss our plans for the future once the markets reopen.", "First I would like to tell you that in one of the toughest years on record for rates in the broader equity markets we\u2019re very proud of generating a positive 0.5% total return for our stockholders.  Hopefully we\u2019ll be much greater in ensuing years, but given the trials that we all suffered in 2008, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance.  ", "On the investment side we generated gross investments of $1.2 billion, of which 85% related to our preferred investments which are a combination of senior housing and customer focused medical facilities.   At year-end payment coverage stood at 1.96:1 and we continue to avoid concentration risk as our top five operators comprised only 25% of the portfolio with our largest operator comprising only 6% of the portfolio and we believe both of these metrics are best in our peer group and are extremely important in times such as these.", "On the dividend side we paid our 151st consecutive dividend in February and we have decided, and we previously announced, that we will pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 commencing with our May 2009 dividend payment.  Although the unsecured notes market was effectively closed in 2008, we did manage to raise a total of over $775 million of equity at attractive prices.", "I do believe that our strong 2008 performance contributed to our conclusion in the S&P 500 on January 29, 2009 and it is certainly an honor to be included in this group.  I would like to take a moment to congratulate Deb Cafaro, Ray Lewis, and Rick Schweinhart in the Ventas team on the announcement that Ventas will soon be joining us in the S&P 500.  We view these accomplishments, along with HCP\u2019s earlier inclusion, as a win for all of the Health Care REIT\u2019s.  I should add that we\u2019re also very pleased to be able to raise $211 million in an equity offering in connection with our inclusion in the S&P index. We\u2019re always looking for additional liquidity in these times.", "Despite our relative success in 2008 we must continue to plan for an economic and a market downturn.  In a sense, we are planning for the worst case while preparing for future opportunities.  We will continue to monitor operator and facility performance in our usual thorough manner.  We will also assume that the capital markets will remain extremely difficult for the foreseeable future.  We view ourselves as risk managers, how our particular enterprise and in times like this portfolio management processings\u2019 are even more critical in light of the enhanced risks.   ", "Our portfolio management program begins with strong industry research, origination and underwriting and then rigorous monitoring of our portfolio by our portfolio by our asset management group.  At the same time we know we need to manage financial risk as well in these tough economic times.  In normal times our conservative balance sheet management is largely assumed, because it has been our trademark for 38 years, but in today\u2019s capital constrained marketplace where cash is king and balance sheet conservatism is imperative, this focus is even more important.", "As a result of this comprehensive portfolio management program and conservative balance sheet management, we have a strong, diverse, resilient portfolio as well as excellent liquidity.  Yet the question for us as we enter 2009 is what our approach should be going forward in the face of a recessionary economy and lowered housing and capital markets.  While we believe our growth platform is second to none in our space, this is not a time for significant additional investment commitments.  We will finish funding development projects under way, but we will only consider additional investments very selectively and then only with an identified source of funding.", "In 2008 we continued our practice of recycling assets, acquiring or developing desirable asset types and disclosing of assets that do not have the same long-term appeal in light of health care or senior housing trends.  We are focused on investing in combination facilities and CCRCs in the senior housing sector and more modern MOBs, hospitals and other medical facilities in the acute care space.  Conversely we are disposing of stand-alone senior housing facilities and smaller MOBs with limited medical services.  ", "In 2008 we were very successful in executing our game plan as 85% of our investment activity related to modern medical facilities and combination senior housing facilities.  In turn we received $287 million of disposition proceeds of which 80% were from freestanding properties.  We\u2019re going to continue that process in 2009 and currently anticipate disposing of between $200 and $300 million of assets.  In the event we can dispose of even more than $300 million in assets we will be inclined to do so in order to improve liquidity and also accelerate our portfolio repositioning.  In a sense, we would welcome the opportunity to collapse what we consider to be a four to five year process into a much shorter time path.", "While there is likely to be less investment activity in the short-term, we will continue to spend time and money in meeting with existing and prospective operators.  We are a key player in the space and want to maintain our visibility and leadership, especially in these times.  Once the markets reopen and stabilize, we believe that the combination of our access to capital and relationships with operators and systems should lead to a period of unprecedented investment opportunity.  Cap rates are moving upward, marginal investors in our space are gone, and our full-spectrum investing platform gives us a multitude of different ways to invest successfully.  ", "We are being conservative now, as is mandated by these times, yet we are positioned in the company for a period of excellent investment opportunities that will further strengthen our portfolio.", "Now I would like to give you an update on management. Every year we experience changes in personnel, as we attract new talent to the company, and some colleagues decide to move on or to reduce their time commitments due to their desire to commit to other endeavors.  This year my colleague Ray Braun had decided to move on to a third career.  After serving with him as a partner at a law firm and as a key executive at the company, I will miss his experience and intelligence, but I understand the allure of taking on a new career challenge.  Fortunately, Ray will remain a consultant during 2009 transitioning his responsibilities and relationships to others and continuing to train our talented young people.  We truly thank him for his service and wish him only the best.", "Another colleague, Fred Farrar, must reduce his time commitment to the company, as he needs to expend more time on his obligations at Klipsch Group an international audio products company.  We appreciate Fred\u2019s willingness to continue as a consultant, maintaining his close relationships with developers and operators and his availability as a mentor to John Thomas, our new head of Acute Care Services will be invaluable to John and the company.  ", "John Thomas joined our company on January 19 of this year, adding his extensive knowledge, experience, and relationships in the acute care sector.  Before joining us John was President and Chief Development Officer of Cirrus Health, a Dallas based owner and operator of hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other healthcare facilities. His responsibilities included all aspects of their development activities.  Previously he served as Senior Vice President, General Counsel for Baylor Health Care System Dallas, and General Counsel, Secretary for the St. Louis division of the Sisters of Mercy health system in St. Louis.  We welcome John and look forward to his successful efforts to take a top-flight team with a full spectrum of capabilities to the next level.", "John is based in Toledo and is on the call today, as is Jay Morgan, also in the medical facilities group, who is located in our national office.   I should say that I\u2019m quite proud of all of our people and understand that in the last analysis intellectual capital is our most important resource.  We have built a great team that will change from time to time, but will always provide leadership with in health care and senior housing.", "With those comments, Scott, I will turn the call over to you to take us through the remainder of the presentation.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks George and good morning everybody.  In my comments this morning I will discuss recent investment activity and portfolio.  Next I will highlight the strength of our year-end balance sheet, which currently reflects low leverage and adequate liquidity to meet our obligations beyond year-end 2010 and finally I will discuss our recent financial results in 2009 guidance, which reflects our emphasis on maintaining adequate liquidity in the current environment.", "First regarding 2008 investment activity, we completed $1.2 billion of gross investments offset by dispositions of $194 million resulting in net investments in excess of $1 billion.  A $215 million of gross investments in the fourth quarter were primarily related to ongoing development projects.  We did complete one acquisition during the quarter of a newly developed LTAC in Ohio with an existing operator at an initial yield of 11%.", "Our portfolio which now includes over 600 properties with an investment balance of $5.9 billion remains among the most diverse and secure in our industry.  As George mentioned, our senior housing and specialty care portfolio continues to generate strong rent payment coverage.  Our same store revenue for the senior housing and specialty care portfolio increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter versus last year.", "Regarding our medical office-building portfolio, I will talk generally in terms of our core medical office building portfolio, which excludes assets held for sale, and is detailed on page 30 of our supplement. ", "The core medical office portfolio generated $21.4 million in NOI for the fourth quarter with an occupancy rate of 90.4%.  Of the 188,000 square feet in expirations in the fourth quarter we retained 145,000 square feet for a renewal rate of 77%.  Our same store core medical office building NOI declined 2% in the fourth quarter versus last year, primarily as a result of a 1.8% year-over-year decline in occupancy.", "As George mentioned, we are facing a challenging operating environment and we have seen a couple areas of our portfolio that have been more impacted than others.  The first is in the senior housing area.  Within senior housing our independent living properties have been impacted by the economy and the housing market, yet all of our IO occupancy and coverage remain quite strong.  ", "More specifically, during the third quarter same store IO occupancy declined 140 basis points year-over-year to 91.8%.  We have also seen slight additional declines into the fourth quarter based on data received through November.  Importantly, a third quarter occupancy of 91.8% stands 140 basis points above the NIC industry average. ", "In our assisted living portfolio we have actually seen some firming of trends over the last several quarters.  The same store assisted living occupancy rose 110 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter to 88.9% and has remained flat during the first two months of the fourth quarter.  Despite these fluctuations our independent living/assisted living portfolios continue to generate strong payment coverage of 1.31x and 1.55x respectively.", "We have also seen the economy impact our entrance fee communities a bit.  We currently have 15 entrance fee properties that are managed by five different operators, with an investment balance of $591 million representing approximately 10% of the portfolio.  ", "It is important to note that not all of the units within these communities require a buy-in or entrance fee.   We\u2019ve done the calculation and it\u2019s approximately 40% of the units in our entrance fee communities are actually rental in nature.  They would generally include the assisted living, skilled nursing, and dementia care service components.  The rental components of our entrance fees are generally filling in line with our budget expectations.  Of the remaining 60% entrance fee component, which generally consists of cottages, or independent living apartments, saw a general slow down in activity during the first three quarters of 2008.  ", "The fourth quarter saw even less activity when the economy worsened considerably.  We spent some time working with our operators to reforecast 2009 budgets and what we have done is we have decreased our sales forecasts by roughly 20% for existing campuses and 33% for new campuses.  Assuming our operators are able to meet our revised budgets, we believe there should be sufficient liquidity and little to no impact on our forecasted yields.  At this point, we believe the next 12 to 24 months are really a crucial period for sales and deposits at our entrance fee facilities.  ", "Turning now to our development portfolio, we continue to build out existing projects, but have generally restricted new development and chosen not to proceed with projects where practical.  We continue to ramp up deliveries with $295 million in conversions in 2008 and over $500 million of conversions are projected in both 2009 and 2010. With less construction activity across the country we believe these new assets should be well positioned in their respective markets and should really benefit from strong pricing power once stabilized.  I think this particularly applies to many of our CCRCs that will be some of the newest, most modern state of the art properties once they\u2019re completed.", "Now I will turn to liquidity.  As many of you know we had $137 million in restricted cash that was tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings for Land America Exchange Services, our qualified 10-31 intermediary.  We have some good news to report on this front, in that we reached a settlement last week and the settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court on Monday. At this time we have been wired our entire $137 million in exchange funds. ", "As consideration for the immediate return of our funds we made a $2 million settlement payment to the debtors\u2019 estate and we also incurred about $500,000 in expenses associated with the proceedings.  Although we were confident that we would prevail based on the merits of our case, the certainty of receiving the cash and avoiding further court proceedings substantially out weighed the minor settlement costs.", "By the end of 2009 we have approximately $950 million in available cash and line availability compared to $691 million in unfunded development from projects underway and only $55 million in debt maturity through year-end 2010.  Our $950 million in availability is comprised of $580 million available on our line of credit as of December 31; cash and cash equivalents of $23 million and formerly restricted cash that\u2019s now available to invest of $135 million.  In addition, as George mentioned, we received $211 million in net proceeds through our January equity offering in connection with our inclusion in the S&P 500 index.  We continue to evaluate additional capital raising options that I\u2019ll touch on in greater detail during our guidance section.", "Turning now to the financial results, fourth quarter normalized FFO of $0.83 per share was up 4% versus the previous year, while normalized FAD of $0.77 per share represented a 3% increase.  For the full year normalized FFO rose a strong 8% to $3.38, while normalized FAD increased 9% to $3.16 per share.", "We did have a number of one-time items for the quarter and full year, which I would like to highlight.", "First are our gains on the $194 million of full year dispositions were $164 million.  Our average yield on sales averaged 6.6 % for the full year 2008.  The Land America Settlement and expenses of an aggregate $2.5 million were netted against the gains on sales during the fourth quarter.  In addition, we also recognized $2.5 million of income in the fourth quarter related to the release of a personal guarantee associated with the lease termination and that number is included in our other income line. ", "Fourth quarter G&A was $213.5 million, but it did include $2.3 million in terminated transaction costs primarily associated with the termination of the Arcapita/Sunrise deal.  ", "As part of our medical office portfolio upgrade program we have identified 14 buildings for disposition that have been classified as held for sale at December 31.  These buildings have very low occupancy, are much smaller in size, at an average 20,000 square feet, and generally not affiliated with a health system or hospital.  In addition these facilities had negative NOI in the most recent quarter and are not a good strategic fit within our portfolio.  I would also point out that by removing these assets from our core medical office building portfolio our occupancy increased from 87% to over 90% this quarter.  We did recognize $32.6 million in impairment charges related to these assets.", "The last item is due to the severe dislocation in the debt market; we terminated $250 million in swaps during November of 2008 and did record a $23.4 million loss for the full year.", "Next, regarding our dividend, we recently paid the 151st consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31 of $0.68 per share.  The board of directors also approved a 2009 quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.68 per share, or $2.72 annually, commencing with the May dividend.", "In addition to the $211 million raised through our January equity offering, during the fourth quarter we raised a total of $44.7 million in net proceeds from equity transactions at an average price of $38.00 per share. T his is comprised of some activity under our dividend reinvestment plan where we issued approximately 381,000 shares for $14.4 million in net proceeds, while under our equity shelf program we issued approximately 794,00 shares for $30.3 million.", "Looking now at our credit profile, our debt to undepreciated book capitalization was only 42.9% at the end of the year and our interest and fixed charge coverage were 3.8x and 3.2x respectively.", "Pro forma for the January offering, our debt to undepreciated book capitalization was further reduced to 40%, its lowest level since 2002.  In addition, our secured debt currently stands at only 7% of total assets providing additional flexibility as we evaluate additional means of raising capital going forward.", "The last item I would like to discuss today is 2009 guidance.  As detailed in the release, we expect to report net income available to common stockholders in a range of $1.59 to $1.68 per diluted share.  Normalized FFO in a range of $3.20 to $3.30 per diluted share, and normalized FAD in a range of $3.08 to $3.18 per diluted share.  FFO guidance should be compared to the normalized $3.33 per diluted share actual 2008 results as restated for the convertible debt accounting change.  ", "Our assumptions are discussed in detail on our earnings release, but I would like to point out a few items in particular.", "I think first is that our normalized FFO per share guidance of $3.20 to $3.30 does reflect a projected 1% to 4% decline compared to our $3.33 restated 2008 results.  Generally speaking I think this decline is a result of moving to more conservative assumptions, which place a greater emphasis on liquidity than the last several years.  In particular, 2009 FFO will be impacted by the significant equity offerings we completed in July 2008, September 2008, as well as January 2009; also by the planned dispositions of $200 to $300 million at 10% to 11% yields; and by the assumption of zero acquisitions in our 2009 forecast.", "We have also assumed that we will receive no increasers on any leases tied to CPI in 2009.  I would also note that we have already completed one disposition of a surgical hospital in January for proceeds of $41 million which resulted in the $13.5 million gain and represented a yield on sale of 9.8%.", "We are forecasting same store NOIs for the senior housing and specialty care portfolios, which represent approximately \u00be of our investment balance, to increase 1% during 2009.  This includes our assumption of zero rent growth related to the approximate 70% of senior housing and specialty care portfolio increasers based on CPI.  ", "It is important to note that we do have cath up provisions, in most all of these leases, which would allow us to recover the majority of lost rent if CPI increases at a greater rate in the future. ", "Regarding our core medical office building portfolio, which represents the remaining \u00bc of our investment balance, we\u2019re forecasting NOI to decline approximately 1% this year.  This is primarily a function of our assumption of flat occupancy combined with lower rents on our renewing and new leases using more conservative rent assumptions to appropriately reflect market rents in the current economy.  Only 8% of our medical office building contractual rents are subject to CTI increasers and have also been assumed at 0%.", "Our G&A forecast is approximately $46 million for 2009.  This forecast includes $2.9 million in accelerated expensing with stock and options for certain officers and directors, but excludes the $3.9 million expected charge associated with the departure of Ray Braun.  Both of these items will be included in first quarter G&A.  Excluding these items, we would expect a quarterly G&A run rate of $10.5 to $11 million entering 2009.", "As I mentioned previously, we will continue to place a significant premium on maintaining adequate liquidity.  At this point we anticipate evaluating additional capital sources including secured debt, additional equity, and incremental asset sales, beyond the $200 to $300 million in our current forecast.  We are also evaluating buying back a small portion of our debt with near term maturities.  Again, none of these potential incremental capital sources and their uses are included in our current guidance.", "With that, George, I will wrap it up and turn it back over to you.", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Scott.  Our message is pretty clear. We are very well positioned to weather the current economic storm and secondly, we\u2019re prepared to move very quickly and effectively once the markets reopen and pricing is stabilized to further strengthen an already strong, diverse, portfolio.  ", "With that we are now open for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc. ", "", "On the asset sales, listening to Scott\u2019s description, smaller MOBs, negative NOI, low occupancy, what confidence level do you have that you can actually sell the stuff that\u2019s held for sale in this market?", "George Chapman", "Well we\u2019re working pretty hard on it, Jerry.  Jay Morgan is running that program and he should feel free to comment further on it and Chris [Dizel] is working with him and we\u2019ve enlisted our origination team and I think we\u2019re making headway. But, if the pricing is not sufficient we really don\u2019t have to complete those sales this year.  If there is not enough money, or not enough liquidity in certain cases, again, we\u2019re not going to be compelled to go forward.  But, we think we\u2019re making some progress.", "Jay, do you want to add anything to that?", "Jay Morgan", "Sure. Given the profile of the asset we think the likely buyer is probably a user or an occupant.  What we\u2019ve seen out there is that those types of buyers still have access to local financing. We have received a tremendous amount of activity.  There are a lot of people looking at the assets, so we\u2019re pretty optimistic, given the efforts that are in place, that we would be able to move the assets over the next 12 months. ", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "Okay and you talked some about more sales.  Would that be more MOBs or senior housing, or just what other kinds of stuff are in the potential pipeline?", "George Chapman", "It could be any particular category.  It could be freestanding senior housing and there are some real possibilities there that we\u2019ve discussed with existing operators who appear to have some financing, or it could be additional MOBs.  It\u2019s just going to be opportunistic, but it\u2019s definitely going to be within the profile of those assets that we wish to dispose of.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "Okay and then just shifting to the secured debt market.  Obviously a number of your peers have done that already.  Somebody was on a call yesterday, one of the operators, talking about Freddie Mac sort of tightening up some criteria and stuff.  So, would we likely see debt on senior housing and a sense of what kind of terms and stuff are out there at this point?", "Scott Estes", "I think, as you would suspect we are pursuing all of the typical suspects including the government-sponsored entities.  I still feel like the market is fairly robust.  I don\u2019t think the terms have changed that much.  It all depends on term, but if you talk a general five to ten year type term, typical 60% to 65% leverage, again, we\u2019ve been evaluating probably more of the senior housing assets as the more likely candidates, IL/AL type properties; I think you could potentially get something done in the 6.5% to 7% type range. ", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "On the development stuff, I just wanted to clarify.  I think the yields you put out are the cash or GAAP yields.  I wanted to clarify that issue for straight line going forward.", "George Chapman", "They\u2019re cash yields, Jerry.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "", "Is there straight line on a lot of that development?  Is it going to move the number just in terms of FAD for next year materially?  I think you\u2019re running about $15 million this year. Is that kind of the right range, or is straight line going to move as you\u2019re moving on a fair amount of development.  I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s going to happen to the impact on straight lines.", "Scott Estes", "All of the new ones are, yes, generally CPI based, so it wouldn\u2019t have a straight-line component on any of the new ones coming in.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with Keybanc Capital Markets. ", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "", "I want to ask a question on your development pipeline.  You said that you\u2019re going to not be looking to add to that development pipeline unless you have identified specific financing for that.  Can you just talk about what potential financing is for, you know, what secured debt and construction debt is available potentially that would cause you to maybe add a development down the line?", "George Chapman", "The sources of capital are excess cash at the moment.  Two of the governments that we were just talking to Jerry about, as well as disposition on proceeds primarily.  They could be used for either further acquisitions or development, as we see appropriate investments.  But, we are going to be very, very circumspect about making new investments, because we have a methodology, really, that looks out at least two years to ensure that we have adequate capital, not only to invest in development in any agreed upon acquisitions, but also to cover any note maturities.  That\u2019s sort of a moving target, so we have to be very, very careful about that, but those are generally the sources of capital.  Frankly, we\u2019re much more inclined for the remainder of these very tough economic times to do acquisitions of modern facilities than do development.", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "", "Okay that makes sense.  Are there any tenants that you\u2019re worried about today?", "George Chapman", "You know, I keep telling people I\u2019m a fully recovered lawyer, but I guess I never will be.  We always worry about things. Chris Simon, who runs our Asset Management group, is sitting in the room and we\u2019re always looking at people or companies that fall back from projected returns or construction.  But, I would say that even with the stress of these economic times, we feel that any problem children, any folks that are off target, are relatively minor.  We\u2019re dealing with a couple of them right now.  We\u2019re probably going to move one portfolio in the Midwest to two operators who seem to be a little bit more liquid and are handling the marketing better, but I frankly find this to be just typical.  It is what we do.  It is just portfolio management.", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "", "If you moved that portfolio to the new operator would there be any impact on earnings?", "George Chapman", "In part and we think very little, if any.  On, I think, two of the development projects there we might have at least a preliminarily 100 or 200 basis points hit to our returns, but we haven\u2019t finalized that at the moment.  Generally as you look back over our history, and you\u2019ve followed us for years now as well, we generate out about even or just down a bit.  The reality is that when we move properties it\u2019s not just what our absolute return is; it is how the operator performs, so that we have good coverages and therefore can make the most compelling case to the waiting agencies.  ", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "", "That\u2019s helpful.  My last question is on the medical office portfolio.  You said you\u2019re expecting rents down this year.  Can you just put an order of magnitude on that?", "Scott Estes", " I think it is really the best we can do on all the moving parts of our portfolio.  You have about 80% of the medical office leases are just normally rolling over; 10% of the portfolio is vacant and as you can see in the supplement about 10% is up for renewal.  I think where the only variability is on our assumptions for how we\u2019re going to fill new space; we\u2019re forecasting a retention rate of approximately 70% next year.  Again, with occupancies flat, I think it\u2019s really a market-by-market basis.  They have all went into our combined estimate of -1% core medical office building, NOI decline forecast next year.", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "", "So maybe on the 10% that\u2019s rolling, the 70% that you retain will rents be flat on those and then the remaining 30% will be down, call it, 5%.  Does that sound right to you or?", "Scott Estes", "It\u2019s too different. Actually if you look through every single asset you could be filling some space that was currently vacant as well.  Again, we have really done a detailed assessment.  Mike, John Thomas, and the team are very much on top of leasing activity.  It\u2019s a big focus for us.  I think we needed to more appropriately reflect the market rents as well as the state of the economy and that\u2019s really how we put our forecast together.  ", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital Markets ", "", "Okay, thanks very much. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Mains at Morgan, Keegan & Company. ", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company ", "", "I have a follow up on the MOB question.  You parceled your portfolio into the hospital on campus, hospital affiliated, and non-hospital affiliated.  In your projections are you seeing any difference in renewal rates between those three asset types?", "John Thomas", "The on campus space is stronger. There is a move in what we\u2019ve seen recently from larger physician groups moving into new space on campus, but fro a total NOI perspective it\u2019s not a material distinction between the two.  So again, as we talked about the dispositions being smaller, facilities not really associated with the hospital system, or healthcare system, and really over time improving the portfolio to be hospital affiliated on campus, or off campus, but with physician groups tied to those strong hospital affiliations. ", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company ", "", "If you got any sense of the sense of the ceiling with these, you\u2019ve got the hospital affiliation then there wouldn\u2019t be a big difference between you ability to renew rents?", "John Thomas", "Correct.", "George Chapman", "", "In fact Rob, I would like to just address that as well.  What we\u2019re really finding as a trend is the outreach by really good hospital systems to the suburbs, to extend their brand.  That move means that many times they\u2019re leading with a larger MOB with more medical services.  That change is something that John and I are looking at right now and we\u2019re very comfortable with the affiliation off campus.  That seems to be the way the healthcare systems are evolving. ", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company ", "", "Okay, thanks.  That\u2019s a good explanation.  ", "Scott, I have two number questions for you.  One is in prior quarters you\u2019ve broken out your loan expense.  Do I assume that that\u2019s folded into interest expense now?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.  The loan expense line is on the interest expense line in the income statement now.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company ", "", "Okay and then in your FAD guidance, you had a straight line down a good chunk from the fourth quarter run rate.  Do I surmise that a lot of this stuff that you\u2019re selling has straight-line rents or is [interposing].", "Scott Estes", "It was actually a lot of the Ameritas sales that we had in the fourth quarter had straight-line rents, so that\u2019s kind of a rebasing after those sales were done.", "Robert Mains - Morgan, Keegan & Company ", "", "Okay that makes sense. That\u2019s all I had, thanks a lot. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Stephen Mead at Anchor Capital Advisors.", "Stephen Mead, Jr., - Anchor Capital Advisors", "", "Just philosophically, how do you guys view the issue that has kind of gone through the REIT world in terms of the payment of the dividend in stock versus cash?  I wanted to get your feeling and your attitude towards the continued payment in cash versus stock.", "George Chapman", "Steve, as I mentioned in my remarks, the board agreed to $0.68 of quarterly payments.  My own philosophy and I think this management teams philosophy is that to the extent that we\u2019re capable of paying in cash, that\u2019s a bargain we\u2019ve made with our shareholders and we intend to continue that unless the economic times become so bad that we have to consider doing otherwise.  Right now, though, and given our situation in terms of liquidity, we\u2019re very much committed to paying cash dividends.", "Stephen Mead, Jr., - Anchor Capital Advisors", "", "Okay and then how much flex to do you have on the development portfolio and the flow of cash into the development properties?", "George Chapman", "I\u2019m sorry did you say flexibility or?", "Stephen Mead, Jr., - Anchor Capital Advisors", "", "Just flexibility in terms of pushing out the delivery date or the discontinuance of some of the development sides of what you said you were going to develop in 2009 and finish up in 2010.", "George Chapman", "Steve, virtually everything in development right now are projects already underway and they were just going to finish them.  Frankly, we\u2019d rather finish them early if at all possible and start recognizing higher income.   We think they are terrific projects.   But, I would say, too, that we did kill a number of development projects as the economy got worse.  We picked the best ones and I think ones that are going to stand the test of time, be very, very sustainable, wonderful assets.  For what you are seeing and perceiving on our books, those are going to proceed.  They\u2019re going to be very, very good assets. ", "", "Stephen Mead, Jr., - Anchor Capital Advisors", "", "So the impact on 2010\u2019s numbers in terms of what you would expect in a tougher environment as far as the sales and also the income stream from those properties relative to the debt service on those properties, how does it shape up looking into 2010?", "Scott Estes", "I think if you look at our aggregate development pipeline, the projected average initial yield, when they convert to full yielding assets, is about 9%. So, you obviously have somewhat of an earnings benefit as we move those from only capitalizing interest at our average cost of debt of about 5.7% to those higher yields.  George and I have talked, obviously inherently these projects were priced, and stuff began construction generally one to two years ago.  Also, they have actually been financed using capital at cost a couple of years ago in part.  I think you can never perfectly time the yields of ultimately when these assets open, but we feel like we\u2019re getting very good assets at a reasonable yield in light of the current capital markets environment. ", "Stephen Mead, Jr., - Anchor Capital Advisors", "", "Okay, thanks. ", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Rosemary Pugh at Green Street Advisors. ", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors   ", "", "You spoke about for CCRCs and the entrance fee communities, that there was less activity in the fourth quarter in terms of lease up.  I wonder if you can provide a little bit more detail.  It looks like your communities assume about 20 to 30 move ins per quarter and I was wondering how the lease up was in the fourth quarter. ", "Scott Estes", "", "The activity was very nominal in the fourth quarter.  If you think about the magnitude of what was going on in the economy, I think we have to view that as an aberration.  In several of our communities that are open you did start to see a bit of a rebound in January. So, again, we did see very little activity just specifically in the fourth quarter.  We are watching it very closely.  We watch it really every week.  Again, as we said, we\u2019ve made what we think are appropriately conservative assumptions and again, just have to really be watching them over the next one to two years and hope that they continue to lease up based on our revised projections.", "George Chapman", "", "Our experience, Rosemary, was that throughout our portfolio there was just a slamming into the wall for virtually all of the senior housing operators that had a housing component and we\u2019re closer to having a housing component.  So far, and about the time, I think, we met out in California in January; we were seeing people who were like a deer in the headlight who were starting to see some increasing optimism.  We do think that the fourth quarter was an aberration, as Scott indicated.  We are seeing more optimism and we\u2019ll be reporting to you in virtually every call the momentum that we hopefully will see coming back into senior housing, Chattaroy and specifically on the CCRCs which have the largest housing components.  ", "I should add something that we have said before, and that is, we\u2019re certainly watching these.  On the other hand if and when there is some rebound in the economy, we think that these assets in particular are going to be the best positioned to take advantage of pricing power given what they give the consumer; given what they do for the customer.  So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about what\u2019s going to happen with respect to this part of our portfolio.", "Rosemary Pugh - Green Street Advisors    ", "", "Thank you.  ", " ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya at UBS. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS ", "", "I would like to follow up on Rosemary\u2019s question in regards to CCRCs and development. Scott, I know you talked about this earlier on, but I happened to miss it. The revised assumptions you guys are making in regards to those assets.  Could you just run us through them again?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. Again, it\u2019s a work in progress and the work we\u2019ve done to reforecast our aggregate 2009 budgets, as a company, we\u2019ve decreased our sales forecast by roughly 20% for our existing campuses and it\u2019s about by 1/3 for the new campuses. ", "Again, this isn\u2019t that large of a universe.  You remember that this is only 10% of the portfolio.  Many of these are just very recently opened, so again, it\u2019s appropriate to revise the budgets as we have. But, again, as George said, it\u2019s really in the next year or two of leasing activity will tell the tale. ", "George Chapman", "Omotayo, just to be clear, even with a 20%, for existing, reduction in sales or 33% for new, this does not necessarily mean we will take a lower yield.  That\u2019s the next step if the economy stays down for another year or two years, I suppose.  Built into our structure is a lot of flexibility in terms of return to us, so we\u2019re still cautiously optimistic that we\u2019re going to have the same returns on these assets over time.", "Scott Estes", "Particularly rental coverage George is, in part, referencing too, Omotayo.  We underwrite the CCRCs to an approximate, depending upon the asset, 1.3 to 1.4 times rent payment coverage in mix as well.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS ", "", " But if it is still down 20% you wouldn\u2019t expect the operator, at that point, so kind of raise a red flag and save some help in regards to rent relief?", "George Chapman", "No. Right now it would not have an affect on the rent, okay.  It depends on the duration of the economy downturn, the housing problems; at some point, as we get out another year or so we will have more color on it.  Right now we would not take a rental hit.", "", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS ", "", "Generally you are repositioning your portfolio that being the same things; Jay\u2019s doing the same thing. I guess everyone is talking about what a tough market it is to sell assets, but across the entire universe in seems like $1 billion of repositioning everyone wants to do and I just kind of wonder, who is buying this stuff?  You guys are not buying, so they\u2019re all trying to sell.  Who exactly is out there buying this stuff?", "Scott Estes", " It is interesting, if you look at our assumptions on our dispositions this year, we are actually very confident that we will get a very good percentage, if not all of them, completed.  Generally speaking it is operators looking to repurchase the assets from us.  Banks, a bridge to HUD is still available, in smaller size.  Generally speaking none of our single dispositions are greater than really $30 to $40 million.  So, smaller sizing gets deals done and those are really the ones we included in our assumptions this year.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS ", "", "Then one last question, the catch up on the CCI, could you explain that again to me?", "Scott Estes", "Sure.  They basically have two different structures. If you have a CCI based increase, say in a year your rent was supposed to be 8% moving to 8 \u00bc% in that second year CPI was zero, so 8% stated 8.0% in the second year.  During the third year if CCI were significantly large, say increased 5% or more; in that third year we would actually bump back our rent up to the 8.5%.  So instead of going 8.0, 8 \u00bc, 8.5 you would catch up that factor and some could even go up more to catch the lost year of rent as well.  That is generally how the CCI catch up features work.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Sevina Patia] at [Faso] Capital.", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "", "As far as buying back short-term debt, as you mentioned in the conference call, what part of the capital structure would you be looking at?  I presume it would be the converts because it is a 2011 maturity unless you have some other parts on that?", "Scott Estes", "I think we basically have been looking more closely at our 2012 unsecured notes as probably one of the more likely candidates in terms of repurchase.  We\u2019re not talking about anything too large at this point. We\u2019re evaluating maybe $25 to $50 million type numbers that could make some sense.  I mean we obviously have some capital available.", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "", "What would the time frame for that be?  Is it something that you guys would do immediately or next\u2026?", "Scott Estes", "We don\u2019t know.  We\u2019re still evaluating it.  It depends what the price of the bonds are, other uses of capital, all of the factors you would typically expect us to look at.  I think we just wanted to make the point that we\u2019re evaluating it.", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "", "Okay and as far as your credit facility is concerned, the credit line, you have a one year extension options, so I guess it can be extended to August 2012, is that correct?", "Scott Estes", "That is correct. ", "", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "", "Now is that the company\u2019s option and under what conditions might this not be extended?", "Scott Estes", " It is at the company\u2019s option.", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "", "Okay, so you are basically just saying [interposing].", "Scott Estes", "As long as we\u2019re in compliance, so we can extend it at our option.", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "", "And the term is definitely a one year extension option as the term is defined?", "Scott Estes", "Yes. ", "[Sevina Patia] - [Faso] Capital", "Okay, great.  Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dustin Pizzo with Banc of America Securities.", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "", "Scott, I have a follow up question on the Fannie/Freddie stuff.  What percentages of the senior housing assets are unencumbered today?  Then also, how much capacity do you guys have to go out and do debt with the agencies before some of the covenants will become an issue?", "Scott Estes", "Our encumbered assets are about $850 million this quarter; about 80% of those are medical office buildings.  So, only about, again, 20% of our encumbered assets are related to senior housing.  We\u2019re in good shape, with secured debt at only 7% of total assets and our covenants in the line and the notes are basically not a practical stopping point.  They are 30% and 40% respectively and we are more concerned with at what point the rating agencies may start to be concerned with our level of secured debt.  I think that would be more in the 15% to 18% range.  We\u2019ve always kind of thought that would be more of a realistic cap on where we would ever want secured to go.  ", "Again, a lot of our secured debt we have recycled over time. As soon as we can pay it off we do and in many cases roll releases into mass releases.  I think there is a reasonable flexibility there.  ", "Dustin Pizzo - Banc of America Securities", "", "Okay, thank you. ", "", "Operator", "", "There are not more questions.

At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mark Ordan, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, Sir. ", "Mark Ordan", "", "Thank you. Welcome to Sunrise Senior Living\u2019s Investor Conference Call. This is Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Joining me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Nadeau. ", "Before we being, let me remind you that this call is being recorded and the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call. During the course of this call the company will make various remarks concerning management's expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors including those identified in our 2008 Form 10K.", "Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future. For a further discussion on the company's forward-looking statements please refer you to our 2008 Form 10K which we filed with the SEC earlier this morning.", "I would like to start the call by turning it over to Rick who will review our financial results and some other key areas of our 2008 form 10K. I will then give you an overview of the steps we are taking currently to address our liquidity and strategic issues. Some questions you might logically have tie to discussions we are engaging in concerning liquidity and restructuring initiatives that are neither public nor definitive and we will not take questions on these topics. ", "Rick Nadeau ", "", "Thanks Mark. While 2008 was a very difficult year for Sunrise, as a whole our revenues have remained relatively stable throughout the year. Our full year occupancy revenues were up 7.1%. Operating revenues were up 7.1%. Management fees were up 9% and overall occupancy remained flat for the year in one of the worst housing markets in U.S. history. ", "With respect to occupancy calculations, the company has traditionally calculated resident occupancy by taking the number of resident days for the time period and dividing that figure by the resident day capacity for the same time period. Resident capacity is equal to the number of units plus a factor for the percentage of units designed to be sold as shared units. ", "Beginning in the first quarter of 2009 we will begin reporting additional operating metrics including unit occupancy and revenue per unit. Let me talk to the income statement broadly. I would also like to point you to page one of the press release or to the MD&A section of the 2008 form 10K. In it you will see a chart that discloses some of the large and unusual items included in our net loss figure. I will address the more significant of these items as I go through the income statement. ", "The operating results for the fourth quarter 2008 were $435.6 million as compared to $403 million for the fourth quarter 2007. As I just stated, management fees were also up for the year by 9% as compared to 2007 but management fees were flat in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Resident fees were up 13% for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. This increase is due in large part to three consolidated communities in French speaking Canada we opened in 2008, the consolidation of our German communities on September 1, 2008 and some rate growth. ", "Our rates for consolidated communities were up 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2008 as part of our annual evaluation of the realizability of goodwill we recorded an impairment of goodwill of $122 million related to our North American business. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we wrote off $11.6 million of costs related to abandoned projects. The amount written off for the full year was $96 million. Our remaining balance of construction in progress at December 31, 2008 is $88.9 million consisting of $82.9 million related to three wholly owned projects under construction and $6 million relating to a condominium renovation project called The Carlisle. ", "Of the three wholly owned projects under construction one of them opened in January 2009 in Monterrey, California. The other two projects which have a carrying value of $38 million are in California and are suspended until we receive suitable construction financing. We do not anticipate any additional equity contributions for these projects nor do we anticipate any new construction starts in the United States in 2009. We expect only two construction starts in the United Kingdom this year. ", "In the fourth quarter of 2008 we had write down\u2019s of $34.2 million for impairments of operating properties and undeveloped land. The amount of write down\u2019s for the full year was $36.5 million. The full amount was comprised of $19.3 million for operating properties in the United States, $5.2 million in the fourth quarter for our German communities and $12 million related to undeveloped land. ", "In the fourth quarter of 2008 and for the full year we incurred $3.7 million and $30.2 million respectively for expenses related to the accounting restatement, special independent committee investigation, the SEC investigation and the shareholder litigation. As reported on February 19, 2009 the company and certain of its current and former officers and directors entered into an agreement to settle the company\u2019s two stockholder derivative actions. ", "In addition, as of Friday, February 27, 2009 we have also settled the pending Class Action shareholder lawsuit. All of these settlements are subject to Court approval. We are pleased that this shareholder litigation is resolved. These are significant steps to putting many of our legal issues that arose from the accounting restatement behind us. ", "Also, if you look at item 9 in our 2008 10K you will see that the company disclosed it has successfully remediated the material weaknesses and internal controls that were disclosed in the 2006 form 10K and the 2007 form 10K. This is also an important step for the company to have addressed. The SEC investigation is now the only unresolved matter relating to this difficult part of Sunrise\u2019s history. ", "At the end of the third quarter of 2008 we reported we had purchased an option to acquire the remaining stake in our German venture and that we intended to exercise that option. Accordingly we are consolidating those communities. Prior to that purchase our minority ownership position left us with no control over the portfolio but exposed us to all of the financial risk associated with the portfolio. When we consolidate these communities into our financial results the account results require that assets and liabilities of the German venture be consolidated at estimated current fair value. ", "Because our liabilities in the German venture exceeded our assets we recorded a non-cash extraordinary pre-tax loss for 2008 of $22 million. We have also taken steps to reduce the amount we are spending on G&A and that includes reducing some non-care related positions and non-payroll expenses. Throughout 2008 we eliminated 165 positions from our corporate and development groups. The severance charges were $15.2 million for the full year of 2008 and $9.7 million for the fourth quarter 2008. ", "Based on our actions to date we expect severance costs of $2 million in 2009 but we expect further restructuring and severance costs will be required in 2009 and that these costs may be significant. We do not expect these changes to impact the care we provide to any of our residents. ", "We recorded $15.9 million in foreign exchange losses in 2008. More specifically we had $14.2 million in losses related to foreign exchange rates for the Canadian dollar and $1.7 million in losses related to foreign exchange rates for the Euro and British Pound. This is compared to a $2.3 million loss due to exchange rates in 2007. ", "Now let me give you a brief overview of our balance sheet. At December 31, 2008 we had stockholder\u2019s equity of $139 million which reflects the difference between our reported assets and liabilities. Included in our liabilities is $636 million of consolidated debt. On page four of the 2008 form 10K you will see a chart that lists the components of our debt. $472 million of the consolidated debt is classified as current either based on scheduled maturities or because of covenant or payment defaults. ", "As Mark will describe we are working with our lenders to restructure some of our more significant obligations. We have explained to our lenders and our venture partners it is our firm belief that it is in their best interest to continue funding construction and lease-up activities as their collateral is worth more if projects under construction are completed and filled with residents. ", "We are also engaged in discussions with various venture partners and third parties regarding the possible sale of certain assets with the purpose of increasing liquidity and reducing obligations to enable us to continue operations. In the form 10Q for the third quarter of 2008 we discussed the debt default for The Fountains portfolio and the fact that we were making payments under the related operating deficit guarantee to the lenders. The operating performance of these communities continued to deteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in January 2009. ", "We have been unable to restructure this debt. In January 2009 we determined that we would be unable to continue funding this significant cash outflow required by the operating deficit guarantee to our lender and the income support obligation to our venture partner. We informed our venture partner we would cease income support payments in January 2009. Also in January 2009 we informed the lender that we would not honor our operating deficit agreement to the extent of shortfalls resulting from penalty interest being charged to the venture. ", "We are in discussions with our venture partner and our lenders to attempt to resolve these matters. ", "Our cash flow from operating activities was negative $124 million in 2008. A large portion of this was due to poor operating results but there was also a significant impact from the reduction of accounts payable and accruals which had built up during the accounting restatement due to large billings from outside professionals. ", "Now I would like to take a few minutes to review some operating metrics for the quarter. ", "For the fourth quarter of 2008 same store revenues were up 1.7% to $366 million and revenue in the U.S. was up 2.4%. Average daily rate also grew by 1.7% as compared to the prior year. Both same store revenues and fourth quarter ADR growth were suppressed in part due to the unfavorable exchange rates for our Canadian, U.K. and German communities. You should remember that beginning in 2007 we raised rates on January 1 for the majority of our new assisted living and memory care move-ins. This change resulted in a much higher than expected ADR and revenue growth in Q1 2008 which had an impact on Q4 2008. ", "A third factor impacting year-over-year ADR growth in Q4 was the pricing incentives offered on select inventory in several markets to support our move-in pace in light of the tightened economic conditions. Occupancy in our same store portfolio was 89.9% at December 31, 2008. This is the same figure as the prior period. Last quarter we talked about the continued opportunity in the same store assisted living portfolio in North America. That grouping continues to do well at 92% occupancy in Q4 which was up 0.7% from the prior period. ", "While difficult to quantify the economy is having a significant negative impact on the decision to move into senior living as seniors and their families face declining savings and challenges in selling their homes. In particular, our independent living segment is most impacted by the housing market exhibiting year-over-year decline in occupancy of 2.7 points. Since independent living apartments are usually populated by residents who require little care it makes sense that they are more likely to delay a move than ones who need more assistance. ", "Going forward in 2009 we would expect maintaining occupancy to be extremely challenging and we anticipate very modest rate growth during these economic times. You will also see in the press release we reported that same community operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased to $262 million as compared to $234 million for the prior year fourth quarter. These results include $19.6 million for insurance credits due to favorable loss experience in 2007. Excluding this adjustment our same community expenses increased 3.5% over the fourth quarter of the prior year. ", "Further, for same store consolidated communities expenses increased 9% year-over-year after excluding the insurance credits. We do continue to focus on managing all expenses more prudently. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mark. ", "Mark Ordan", "", "Thanks Rick. We are fully engaged in a process to restructure Sunrise, our obligations and how we operate. While we clearly think all of our stakeholders benefit from such restructuring we don\u2019t control this process and we cannot assure anyone we will succeed. Of course people listening to this call in this economic environment are wondering if we can successfully restructure this company without filing for bankruptcy protection. Let me assure you that as of now we believe we are working on viable initiatives to accomplish an out of court restructuring. We will keep you informed of any material changes. ", "We are engaged in active discussions with our largest lenders and our capital partners to restructure our debt and to provide additional liquidity to Sunrise. We are also continuing to downsize the company to reverse cash drain and restore a then smaller Sunrise to profitability. I have been meeting continually with many of our stakeholders who see that an in-court process would be extremely expensive and potentially volatile. They are also aware of our liquidity constraints and timing under our ten bank amendment. We hope that this understanding will prompt parties to do all that is necessary to accomplish this restructuring in the coming weeks. ", "This restructuring would not be an end of a process but the beginning of one that would later address future maturities in place, operating deficit agreements, defaults and completion guarantees. You should also be assured we are actively managing our core operations through this period. As Rick noted, our occupancy remains roughly flat overall without a decline in ADR. Our communities are led by passionate managers who as I meet them continue to reinforce what a special culture exists at Sunrise. ", "We still have a lot of progress to make on expense reductions and controls and I look forward to returning Sunrise to a company whose profitability matches its reputation for resident care. In this economy however, I do not perceive progress as a straight line and maintaining occupancy will be a challenge. ", "In our back office we are working hard to control our processes, measure our business results and to make sure that our very important vendors see how committed we are to working through this period. On behalf of my fellow board members I am grateful to everyone inside and outside Sunrise who is working hard to get through this period. We are comforted that while the outcome is uncertain and out of our control that many people are determined to do all they can to achieve a positive result. ", "Finally, I hope you can appreciate that through my prepared remarks and Rick\u2019s we have given you as full an update as possible on our restructuring activities. As I mentioned earlier we will not be taking questions on this topic. Now Rick and I will take questions that you may have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", " ", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I appreciate there are things you can\u2019t talk about. I just wanted to focus on the expense controls. We just got off the Brookdale call where they are making some good progress on that and talking about more going on. Do you have any additional color you can give us there? Any sense of maybe where you see expense growth coming or more on the initiatives? ", "Mark Ordan ", "", "I probably couldn\u2019t be more specific except to tell you that I think that Sunrise, as I said, what we foresee is a very broad restructuring of what we do. I think there are many elements of expense control that go into that really across the board. I think like any company, and I know what Brookdale said earlier, any company at a time like this you look at every area you possibly can and you just want to make obviously sure that you are not doing anything that could affect resident care and we don\u2019t think that we have a risk of that at all. ", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Maybe just a little more color then on discounting? How much are you using? Where do you see it headed? ", "Mark Ordan", "", "As Rick said it is done selectively. I think like any normal company you price relative to the market or you don\u2019t succeed. We are careful about that. As Rick noted we have more issues in our independent living than assisted living area. I can\u2019t be more specific than that but it is selective and we are very careful of that. ", "It looks to me like there are no other questions at this time. Again I thank everybody for participating this morning and for listening to us. I look forward to being in touch as there are material changes as I said earlier. Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "This does conclude our call. We would like to thank everyone for their participation.

My name is Allison and I will be your operator today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this presentation. (Operator instructions) ", "Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jim Bowe, Vice President of Communications for Health Care REIT. Please go ahead, sir.", "", "Jim Bowe", "", "Thank you, Allison. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT\u2019s first quarter 2009 conference call. In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at www.hcreit.com.", "I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website as well. Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that it\u2019s projected results will be obtained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time-to-time in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.", "I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks. Please go ahead George.", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Jim. My comments today will center around the execution of our current game plan and also address briefly, how we are positioning the company in long term. First, I\u2019ll deal with liquidity, which is foremost in everybody\u2019s mind in today\u2019s marketplace.", "During the 15 months through the end of the first quarter \u201809 we raised approximately $1 billion of equity capital, including $211 million in the first quarter of this year in an inclusion trade and as we previously reported, we recently closed on a $133 million debt transaction with Freddie Mac and expect additional secured debt proceeds of between $200 million and $300 million later this summer.", "In addition, in the first quarter we generated $63 million in cash from asset sales as we continue our long standing practice of recycling assets to attain a portfolio with the most modern compelling senior housing and medical properties. We believe we are on track to reach our goal of $200 million to $300 million of assets sales this year. I should point out that in 2008 we received proceeds of approximately $350 million as well, due to recycling of assets.", "As a result, all of these capital raises and sales, we currently have over $300 million of cash surplus even after funding our development pipeline and debt maturities through 2010 and with our planned additional debt transactions this summer we expect to have adequate liquidity into the mid 2012.", "As it relates to the portfolio, I should note that Scott will go into more detail relating to portfolio performance, yet I did want to make a few broad comments. First on the MOB portfolio, the medical office building portfolio, it is performing as expected with a number of new leases with even longer than expected terms.", "Moreover, with some new MOBs with strong health system sponsorship opening in the next several quarters and with the ongoing disposition of our MOBs held for sale, the quality of our MOB portfolio will be substantially enhanced and we expect a very strong occupancy by year end.", "On the senior housing and care side, there are some challenges pose by the housing market crisis and yet hopefully the pending home sale increase in March is our harbinger of better times ahead. Within our portfolio, our assisted-living portfolio occupancy increased, while the independent living portfolio saw only a modest decrease.", "In the CCRC entrance fee communities of which we have 15, sales continue to be somewhat slow. However, we are seeing an increase in presales and move-ins in the first quarter with an up-tick certainly in operator optimism. Clearly, the stock market improvement has had a very positive effect on customer\u2019s attitudes.", "Although, we are cautiously optimistic, we continue to monitor each community with weekly reporting to senior management regarding sales and lease-up. We continue to believe that overtime seniors will be more attracted to larger communities with more amenities, such as combination facilities and full blown CCRCs.", "In fact, the recently published independent living report by OSHM that came out this week found that larger communities received higher satisfaction ratings from residents than smaller communities and we also believe in the long term, with the very low rate of development of that is ongoing. We believe these combination assets will face a limited additional competition for at least three to four years with very strong pricing power.", "So, in the short run, we are dedicated to continuing to enhance our liquidity, maintain our low leverage and dispose of non-core assets. At the same time, we are working to strengthen all of our capabilities and we have been taking advantage of these troubled times to add new, experienced personnel in order to strengthen every part of our business. There is a tremendous talent pool available that would only enhance our capabilities. ", "Eventually and perhaps a bit sooner than many expect the markets will reopen. HCN will be very well positioned to execute on the well thought out investment programs at that time and with that I\u2019ll turn over the presentation to Scott Estes, our CFO, to discuss financial and portfolio matters. Scott.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, George. Good morning everybody. I think my main message today is that the portfolio and financial results continue to perform inline with our expectations and that we\u2019re up to a nice start to the year.", "Thus far in 2009, we successfully raised over $400 million in capital through a combination of equity, secured debt and asset sales. We\u2019ve invested $174 million, we lowered our March 31, leverage below 39% debt to un-depreciated book capitalization. We\u2019ve retired $22 million of near term debt maturities and are maintaining our quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 per share.", "As a result of adding both the $133 million of secured debt raised in April and another $200 million to $300 million of secured debt later this year to our guidance. We\u2019ve lowered our normalized FFO estimate by $0.10 per share. More importantly, however, the liquidity provided by this attractively priced debt plus additional asset sales through the rest of the year should provide us with adequate liquidity into the middle of 2012. ", "Turning now to the details of first quarter performance, we completed a $130 million of net investments during the quarter. Gross investment activity of $174 million was primarily ongoing development funding with some other minor amounts for capital improvements and loans.", "Dispositions of $44 million related to two specialty care facilities and one small freestanding assisted living facilities generating $17 million of gains on sales during the quarter. Regarding our portfolio, I believe it\u2019s generally performing as anticipated in today\u2019s more challenging environment.", "In our senior housing, skilled nursing and specialty care portfolio, same-store revenue increased 2.5% in the first quarter versus last year. These operators generated strong payment coverage of 1.97 times. As the lack of CTI based rate increases potentially impact performance through the remainder of the year. We do expect the same-store revenue growth rate in this portion of the portfolio will average 1% to 2% for the full year.", "Our core medical office portfolio, which excludes assets held for sale, also performed inline with expectations. During the quarter, we generated $21.4 million in NOI, had a tenant retention rate of 72% and ended with occupancy of 90.2%. We continue to project that our core MOB portfolio will generate NOI of approximately $85 million for 2009, down about 1% versus last year.", "Our MOB portfolio did see one potential benefit of the tougher economy in the first quarter as both new tenants and renewals signed leases that were roughly two years longer than our budget. More specifically, during the quarter new tenants signed leases with terms in excess of seven years, while renewal tenants signed leases with terms of over five years.", "We\u2019re also seeing strong new leasing activity, as our pipeline has an additional 25,000 square feet under letters of intent, plus we had another 51 active term sheets outstanding, totaling over 200,000 square feet of space. As a result of our solid leasing expectations, we currently estimate that our occupancy in our core MOB portfolio will finish 2009 above 91%.", "Next, I\u2019d like to spend a little more time. This quarter highlighting our senior housing and long term care performance, including some specific comments on our entrance fee communities. First in our senior housing and long term care portfolio, our independent living portfolio continued to see some occupancy pressure in the fourth quarter, declining about 80 to 90 basis points sequentially.", "However, it\u2019s important to point out; our same-store occupancy at 91% continues to compare favorably with the NIC industry average of 90%. Our stable independent living portfolio payment coverage declined by three basis points, but remains solid at 1.29 times.", "In assisted living, our stable and same-store occupancy saw an increase of about 40 basis points sequentially to 89% and continue to generate solid stable portfolio payment coverage of 1.56 times and in our skilled nursing portfolio occupancy also remained flat at the 84% level, while stable coverage remained very strong at 2.25 times.", "Turning now to our entrance fee communities, most of our entrance fee projects just continue to struggle somewhat with sales, due to the slow economy. However, as George mentioned, we did see a slight up tick in activity during the first quarter. As of March 31, all our entrance fee operators were current on their rental payments.", "I think it\u2019s also important to remember that about 40% of the unit mix on these campuses is rental in nature as opposed to buy in and that these rental units have generally continued to fill according to budget. We\u2019ve been very proactive in monitoring this portion of our portfolio and also we\u2019re reviewing performance data on our entrance fee communities on a weekly basis.", "Over the past two months, we\u2019ve been on site at every one of these communities and believe they\u2019re among the best positioned in their respective markets and also, as George mentioned, I do think it\u2019s very important that we feel that our entrance fee communities that are likely to encounter no new competition for at least three to four years due to the lack of new construction currently nationwide.", "At the end of April, currently 10 of our 15 total entrance fee communities were opened and over the last several months, we have seen a nice number of move-ins at several facilities, which have recently opened. For these operators, we hope to see a continuation of this positive momentum over the next 12 to 18 months as the initial move-in periods of sites and we work towards stabilizing the campuses.", "Now before moving onto financial results, I\u2019d like to also highlight our continued progress toward moving assets at our un-stabilized or fill up portfolio. Last year in 2008, we stabilized a total of 17 properties, another six properties stabilized during the first quarter of 2009 and we\u2019re currently projecting four additional stabilizations during the second quarter.", "Of note, we had one combination assisted living and dementia property that stabilized in the first quarter that was 100% pre-sold and essentially moved directly from under construction to stable status. I think we point this out just that it speaks not only to the strength of demand for senior housing in certain markets, but also the importance of picking the right operators, who know their respective business models.", "Turning to financial results, first quarter normalized FFO of $0.81 per share increased 3% versus previous year. While normalized FAD of $0.76 per share represented 1% increase. I would remind everyone that first quarter normalized numbers include the impact of $2.9 million in accelerated expensing of stock and options for certain officers and directors, but excludes the $3.9 million associated with the departure of Ray Braun. Both of these items are included in our $17.4 million of total G&A this quarter, resulting in a run rate of approximately $10.5 million to $11 million for the remainder of the year.", "Regarding our dividends, we recently declared the 152 consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended March 31, of $0.68 per share. As I mentioned last quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 2009 quarterly cash dividend rate of this $0.68 per share or $2.72 annually beginning with this payment.", "Our capital activity year-to-date really has been very positive. On April 7, we closed $133 million of debt financing with Freddie Mac secured by 12 senior housing properties. The 10 year debt matures on April of 2019 with an attractive 6.1% interest rate. We were pleased to work with both Freddie Mac and KeyBanc on this transaction and believe this highlights the strength of the company and our ability to access multiple markets at reasonable rates.", "In terms of equity, in addition to our $211 million January equity offering, we issued 376,000 shares under our thrift program, generating $12.5 million and we chose not to issue any new shares under our equity shelf program during the quarter.", "We also did take the opportunity to retire $22 million in future debt maturities during the quarter, which included $12 million of our 2012 senior notes, $5 million of our 2026 convertible debt and $5 million of our 2027 convertible debt at a blended yield to maturity just under 10% and we recorded a gain of about $2 million. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to buyback near term debt maturities when feasible.", "Turning to liquidity, pro forma for our April secured debt issuance, we had $967 million in available cash and line of credit availability, compared to $593 million in unfunded development and $53 million in debt maturity through year end 2010. This results in the cash surplus of $321 million.", "To further enhance our liquidity, we continued to pursue additional tranches of secured debt. Although the terms have not yet been determined, we\u2019re modeling additional proceeds of $200 million to $300 million of secured debt in the second half of the year at approximate 6% to 6.5% rates.", "Obviously, terms are subject to the final properties selected, debt structure and underwriting, but we did feel that it was important to include it in our current forecast. Combining this debt with additional asset sales in our forecast through the remainder of the year provides sufficient liquidity to meet all capital obligations through the middle of 2012.", "Our credit profile remains very strong with debt to un-depreciated book capitalization at only 38.8% at the end of the quarter and interest in fixed charge coverage of 4.1 times and 3.4 times, respectively. Our secured debt stood at 7% of total assets at the end of the quarter and will increase to 9% pro forma for the secured debt transaction closed in April.", "We estimate secured debt could increase to 14% of total assets, if we did add as much as $300 million of additional secured debt later this year. We do remain comfortable with these levels, however and I would point out that we discussed our capital plan in detail with each of the rating agencies as well.", "Finally, we have updated our normalized FFO and FAD guidance, primarily to reflect both the recently executed and pending secured debt transactions which were not in our previous public forecast.", "As a result, we now expect to report normalized FFO in a range of $3.10 to $3.20 per diluted share, normalized FAD in the range of $2.96 to $3.06 per diluted share. Net income available to common stockholders has been increased to $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted share from $1.59 to $1.69 as detailed in our press release.", "Now, with that my report has concluded and I\u2019ll turn it back to you, George. ", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Scott. We now will open for questions ", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) your first question comes from Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital. ", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital ", "Question first just on the healthier tenants. Have you been hearing any issues with coverages or anything on the health of your particular tenants or are you hearing anything within your operators on the development pipeline that causes you any concern? ", "George Chapman", "Well, for usual, there are always operators who are watching more carefully than others. One operator that we\u2019ve been talking to you about recently, we took away assets from that operator and moved it to a two different operators very successfully, I think, constructively and another operator who has been paying us is relatively small operator, went through bankruptcy and we recently received a bid from a substitute operator and we\u2019ve done that pretty much unscathed.", "Karin, as you know, we\u2019ve been reporting that sales in the buy in CCRCs have been moving slower than we would like, but frankly they\u2019ve picked up a bit at the first quarter, as Scott and I each indicated. Again, we have some cautious optimism, but frankly despite the market and despite the economy; we\u2019re finding that our operators are holding in there quite well, a modest increase in ALFA or assisted living occupancy, modest decline in independent living.", "We\u2019re thinking that our operators are holding up quite well and as we look ahead for two to three, four years, with the lack of development we feel that we\u2019re going to be in very good shape. Scott, did you want to add anything? ", "Scott Estes", "No, I think it\u2019s a good summary. ", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital ", "Next question just on asset sales, can you just talk about pricing trends you are seeing there and just update us on the status of the MOB portfolio for sale? ", "Scott Estes", "Actually, in general our asset sales program overall this year is progressing very well. I think we obviously made some nice headway to start off the year at a price that was able to generate some gains as well. I think, as you think for towards the rest of the year in terms of the senior housing portfolio component and I\u2019ll pass it on to John Thomas to talk about the medical office disposition progress.", "We are still very comfortable that we can continue to get north of $200 million of dispositions done this year. Again, timing is probably skewed a little bit more toward the latter half of the year. We have no individual disposition in senior housing that\u2019s more than really, $20 million or $30 million. So, again, these are smaller deals that we feel comfortable that can get generally local regional bank financing or potentially bridge to HUD and get completed.", "John, maybe you comment on the success we are having on the MOB disposition front. ", "John Thomas ", "Yes, Scott. Consistent with our expectations and our plans, we are very pleased with the results first quarter of our MOB disposition activity. Jay Morgan has been leading that proportion and I\u2019d ask him to add just a little color to that, but as Scott just mentioned, the local buyers with local financing options has been very active and positive result for us.", " ", "Jay Morgan", "Yes, the specifics of the 14 we\u2019d classified as held for sale, we have 11 either under or close to signing contracts on. Pricing is a little difficult because these assets, some of them had some occupancy challenged to more of a price per pound type of thing, but the pricing is coming inline with our expectation on the deals that we\u2019re close to signing contracts on. As Scott and John said, local investors, some user investors, as I mentioned last quarter, and by and large, they\u2019re leveraging local bank relationships for financing.", "Karin Ford - Keybanc Capital", "Just one final one, on your continuous equity program, I know you said you didn\u2019t utilize that this quarter. Can you just talk about, whether or not you have utilized it since quarter end and what your thoughts are using it for the balance of the year?", "Scott Estes", "Karin, this is Scott. We have not used it at all this year. Again, I think it\u2019s an appropriate tool to have in our toolbox. I think we will again, as with the rest of our view of equity, view it as opportunistic capital, we\u2019re clearly price sensitive the equity shelf program in particular, is one efficient way, given that we only pay roughly a 2% discount or fee in terms of that cost of equity. So it\u2019s pretty efficient for us, but again, now we haven\u2019t used it yet at the current stock prices.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "When you talk about your cash surplus number of $321 million, do the math for me, $966 million on cash outstanding on your line. Is that you have $586 million unfunded development? Is that the number you are using? ", "Scott Estes", "Yes. I think, to get to the cash availability, we have $815 million available on our line. We have about $19 million of cash on our balance sheet and we are including the $133 million of unsecured debt. So that gets to the $967 million of capital and we have remaining development funding really all the way through 2011, if you look there at $593 million, plus some minor $50 million to $65 million or so of secured debt maturing over that period as well.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "If you would have sort of peel back the onion I guess, right now on a year-over-year basis you\u2019re looking at a negative FFO growth, but there\u2019s been a lot of activity to create that. If you would have sort of pullout all the financing activities that you\u2019ve done, are we looking at sort of apples-to-apples FFO for 2009 as it sort of like a mid single digit type of number? I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what the impact of all the financing activity is, in the aggregate to the growth rate? ", "Scott Estes", "Well, I clearly think the financing activity is the vast majority of the impact of the year-over-year decline as we ended. We start to think if we had more of a standalone growth rate. I would say that earnings this year are slightly impacted by our expectations in the senior housing, long term care and specialty care component of the portfolio. We are assuming, again, the lack of CPI growth this year.", "So, you\u2019re probably seeing a little bit less internal growth, our 1% to 2% forecast in that portion of the portfolio. Again, MOB is about at 25% or roughly flat, maybe down a percent as we indicated in terms of NOI this year. So, I guess as looking more toward next year, one, we have the ability to catch up a lot of those potential, a lot of CPI increases this year to the extent, if CPI does turn more positive next year.", "I would think, generally, the run rate in concept is probably longer term, still the 2% to 4% internal growth plus any net incremental acquisitions that we would hopefully be making accretive acquisitions.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "This question on the CCRCs and the 40%, which is rental and the 60%, which is buy-in, those numbers that you gave us? I just don\u2019t know this, but mechanically, do the residents on the 60% side, the buy-in model, what is their claim on the asset? I\u2019m just trying to understand how that works. Could you give us some color on that? ", "George Chapman", "The 60% have access to the health care services, the higher acuity services, but they would have to at the appropriate time, pay for those services. I mean this is as you know Rich, from years ago, the biggest problem with CCRCs, 25, 30 years ago was that there was one price for everything, every service and that\u2019s not the case right now; they\u2019re definitely unbundled and with space available it would be a natural move into the health care component.", " ", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So what do you prefer? Do you prefer there to be a greater degree of rental, I assume? ", "George Chapman", "Well, I don\u2019t think so, necessarily. Right now, with the CCRCs that we are seeing and that we think that the customer is going to demand. All of these have a great deal of common space and amenities and grounds and to make those work as well as they can, it means that a buy in has to take place.", "With the service fee income they are after taking care of the month-to-month kind of return. So, generally you would see a rental CCRC being somewhat smaller, perhaps more normal nice, but without some of the amenities and the common space that\u2019s for each, different customer to decide, what the price point is and what amenities he or she wants.", " ", "Scott Estes", "This is Scott. Another thing I think we find that\u2019s interesting or important is that a lot of the perspective residents like the concept of ownership. I think it\u2019s important for them to feel like they own the community or their respective unit within the community. George didn\u2019t point out; I guess I don\u2019t know if your original question was about the re-fundability of that entrance fee.", "Generally, the resident or the resident\u2019s estate would receive roughly 60% to 90% of their entrance fee back upon leaving the community or passing away.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "You may have touched on this a little bit in your commentary, but you show a sort of an elevated level of expenses in your ILF, CCRC portfolio data. Can you just sort of characterize what that is? It\u2019s sort of bid into your coverages. ", "Scott Estes", "I think if you look at the expense per occupied unit there, it\u2019s probably most impacted in occupancy was down a little bit year-over-year and if you look, you generally a large portion of fixed expenses in running communities like that. So, when you have occupancy decline slightly, as it did, you have a little bit higher expenses on a percentage basis. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus ", "I wanted to just come back and ask maybe a little bit broader question about access to capital. Obviously, you\u2019ve gone through the numbers and you say with using secured debt and asset sales, you\u2019ve got plenty of money to fund development pipeline and a chunk left over.", "Obviously, a number of REITs both inside health care and outside health care have decided to raise capital equity and in some cases unsecured debt and partly that\u2019s being done for defensive reasons; partly it\u2019s being done, because people think there may be more opportunities.", "I guess I was sort of just curious, given that debt costs are coming down, given that credit lines, as they get renewed, people will think they\u2019re going to be more expensive, maybe smaller.", "How are you thinking about that? I mean I assume you don\u2019t want to run the line the whole way up to the end, even though that\u2019s kind of what the math implies. So how are you thinking more broadly about capital markets now? What would be those things you might need to do or might prompt you to raise capital? Are there any opportunities out there that might prompt you to raise capital? ", "George Chapman", "A very general question Jerry; one, we do not have to raise capital at the moment, as we\u2019ve said. We do not have a leverage issue and currently we have adequate liquidity. We are seeing some opportunities in the acute care side, as well as the senior housing side and there could come a time when we would look seriously at putting some money to use for an accretive acquisition, but we haven\u2019t been terribly eager to go out and either raise money on an unsecured note deal at a very high cost, although pricing is coming in, as you suggest.", "Moreover, we think that at $33, $34 that there\u2019s a pretty good chance that we can do better in the next quarter or two, we\u2019re certainly hopeful of that. We would take advantage of it at a certain price, but this is still a time for caution. It is a time to perhaps take opportunistic capital, when the pricing is a touch better, as we\u2019ve done with the secured side and we\u2019ll continue to do that in the summer. Mike Crabtree is running that program.", "We\u2019re hoping that equity and unsecured debt will free up and we\u2019ll take advantage of it when we think the pricing is appropriate. Just to finish the thought, we are all over the country in terms of forming new relationships and solidifying existing relationships with the best operators in senior housing in the medical facility side and we will have more than ample opportunities to put money to work once it\u2019s priced appropriately.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "Just on the pricing, I think you did like an 11.5% mortgage, if I remember seeing that correctly. So, where would you see pricing on new stuff you might be doing today that would get you interested?", "George Chapman", "That would probably, to a certain extent depend on the asset class. We are right now passing on the pool of pretty good medical office building assets that are probably in AIDS, but 8% level and part of that is our assessment of the overall quality. It\u2019s always going to be dependent on a particular portfolio. We\u2019re seeing some acute care assets that could be done at 9.5% up to about 11%. Some senior housing that is 9.5%, 10% and we are thinking, what our ability to raise secured debt and with our equity starting to move up a little bit that might become interesting at the right time with the right operator with the right quality asset.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "You feel comfortable enough that you could deploy some capital even now without basically coming back to the markets for anything beyond what you\u2019ve already outlined?", "George Chapman", "We said that, we have $300 million right now of so-called surplus capital, but 2011, \u201812 and \u201813 sneak up on you before it. I think, if we get the additional agency paper done, we would feel better about putting out some modest level, making some modest levels of investment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird.", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "I had a question about your medical office portfolio. Scott, I think you gave an outline what you expect the total amount of NOI to be for the year, but can you address your expectations for the same store growth in that portfolio? Because year-over-year it looks like the NOI declined just a tad under 8%.", "John Thomas", "This is John Thomas. Most of the same-store that negative decline at same-store was attributable to a couple of assets and one in particular. We have already replaced the major portion of that space with a new tenant at very attractive rates and also that tenant is an AFC space, which is attracting more of the physician partners from that AFC to the building.", "So, we\u2019re very comfortable with where that\u2019s going to be at the end of the year and the AFC lease is executed at less of the total space that expired at the end of last year, but at a very attractive rate and also it\u2019s attracting physicians back to the building. So, it\u2019s a good long term asset for us and will be cleaned up this year.", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "So, ex-those two assets, the same-store growth would have been much better?", "John Thomas", "Yes. It\u2019s attributable primarily to that space and again, some small tenancies in a couple of locations. Our core properties and our leasing activity total for the year, we\u2019re very pleased about that. ", "For our total leasing budget, including month-to-month, we\u2019re already in excess of 64% of our branded target amount and both the renewals and new leasing, we\u2019re targeting about 200,000 feet first in budget, and we\u2019ve got over 500,000 feet in either term sheets, LOI\u2019s or active lease negotiations. The numbers that Scott referenced at the beginning was focused on our renewals, which we are well ahead of pace for annual targets. ", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "General rent growth you expect it to still be positive across the board? ", "John Thomas", "Yes, again this economy, it\u2019s been tough, but we did have in our core properties a 3% increase in our core revenue, slight I guess a 1% overall decline is still inline with the expectation for the year over the total portfolio. Again, we\u2019re focusing a lot of efforts on the expense side as well and trying to get that down inline with both tenant expectations and our own expectations. ", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "Can you review the debt ratios relative to your covenants, assuming you execute the secured financing, I just didn\u2019t catch them?", " ", "Scott Estes", "Sure, debt to underappreciated book, debt to book cap in the covenant is 42.9% at the end of the quarter and if you add the $133 million of secured debt that we completed subsequent to the quarter, I think it goes up about 1.1%. Again, pro forma for as much as the $300 million of additional secured debt, it would again move, I think another 2% to 2.5% from there, but again, that assumes all else being equal as well. ", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "How much more active should we expect you to be regarding any debt repurchasing? ", "Scott Estes", "I think we\u2019ll definitely look at it. It\u2019s really just a sense of what\u2019s going on in pricing in the market and, as you would expect, we would have more of a focus and emphasis on the near-term maturities would be more appealing to us, and really just watching those closely, as you would expect.", " ", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "But assuming you are seeing a bigger discount on the exchangeable notes? ", "Scott Estes", "At the right price, sure, we would be interested. Are you talking about the convertible debt? ", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "Right, exactly. ", "Scott Estes", "Yes, those are in our portable in 2011 and 2012. ", "Dave AuBuchon - Robert Baird", "But I\u2019m assuming that you are seeing a bigger discount there relative to your other unsecured paper that\u2019s trading in the market? ", "Scott Estes", "Well, actually no. As of yesterday, I looked our convertible notes are trading pretty well. If you look, the two issues are roughly 91 which I think north of 94% or 95% of par and the other was 97%, 98% or actually, unlike a lot of our REIT peers at least within on the map in terms of relative price versus our conversion price.", "One was, I think, $47.81 at issuance and the other was $50. So in the mid-30s, there is still at least some value to the equity component of those securities. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan. ", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan ", "I just got a couple of portfolio questions for you Scott. First one, I think you said that you sold two specialty care facilities. The number of facilities went down by three. What happened to the other one? ", "Scott Estes", "We reclassified one of the assets out of that portfolio based on unit mix. It was a combined LTAC SNF that really had a lot more SNF beds and moved to a SNF in the quarter. ", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan ", "Then, this may actually answer the question and I know we\u2019re talking real small numbers here. But I noticed in the SNF portfolio, sequentially you had occupancy and Q mix were both up, coverage was down just a little bit. What\u2019s that a reflection of? ", "Scott Estes", "If anything, if I\u2019m looking at least on a year-over-year basis; there\u2019s a slight decline in margins. It\u2019s such a small number, Rob it could be balances and what\u2019s going on with individual assets that make up a larger writing. I\u2019m not sure I know that right off the top of my head. It\u2019s only, what 1 basis point, so.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan ", "So it\u2019s kind of rounding-error type of stuff, more than anything else? ", "Scott Estes", "If there\u2019s anything, I\u2019ll give you a call. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya \u2013 UBS.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "Could you just talk a little bit about this development pipeline? I noticed that the development yields for your combination rentals being down slightly from last quarter. Could you also talk about for development projects that are going to be going live very soon, the operators that have to lease up those facilities, kind of what they are seeing at this point?", "Scott Estes", "I\u2019ll first take the slight decline in our combination rentals yields. Last quarter, we were projecting an average 8.4% initial yield on those assets under development and now we\u2019re only slightly lower at 8.0% and the reason, there were two conversions in the quarter of assets out of the construction portfolio at 9% initial yields.", "We also had, through this transfer of operators that George referenced, we had about a 100 to 125 basis point reduction in initial yield forecast as a part of that transition. So, those two factors were the slight decline only in the combination rental initial yield projections.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "What about in regards to the operators that are taking up lease up on the facilities? What they are seeing at this point? Is lease up kind of going according to their schedule? Is it a little bit slower than they were expecting? ", "Scott Estes", "Our fill up portfolio or un-stabilized portfolio is currently about $817 million, it is down to 13.8% of the total portfolio from a little over 14% last quarter. I\u2019d always point out that the development portfolio is very diverse with no individual component of it more than, really $300 million or so of the total committed balance.", "I think clearly, as I mentioned in the call, we saw good movement of getting assets out of that component of the portfolio with six assets stabilizing in the quarter and another four projected to stabilize. Really, the only other thing I guess I would point out is, on average, we saw, I think roughly, my numbers are four to six units per facility were absorbed during the quarter, leased in the fill up portfolio.", "So, as I think about how our assets moved from development into the fill up phase. I still think we\u2019re optimistic and really, as we mentioned, having the right operator in the right market is the way we look at that part of the portfolio as being the most important factor.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "Last question; your hospital portfolio, which is about 10% of your overall portfolio, could you give us a better sense of the mix between general and acute care hospitals, LTACs and inpatient rehab facilities?", " ", "Scott Estes", "If you look at that breakdown again, we have 28 properties. LTACs are 15 properties. It\u2019s about $200 million investment balance. So, roughly only 3% of the total company, total committed balance is $6.5 billion. I think I\u2019d point out there is that our stable coverage for that portion of the portfolio is about two times, as of trailing 12 months ended 4Q.", "Inpatient rehab, there has been some rhetoric, obviously about all the various health care sectors of late and inpatient rehab we have five properties. It\u2019s about $136 million investment balance or only 2% of the total portfolio. They\u2019re covering, after management fees fairly well as well, I think 1.6 times. Again, acute care facilities we really have about five facilities in the portfolio, some acute care, orthopedic facilities, neuro, ortho type hospitals.", "Omotayo Okusanya - UBS", "Was the acute care total investment dollars on the coverage ratio?", "Scott Estes", "I don\u2019t have the coverage the investment balance. I figured we\u2019d be more focusing on the reimbursement stuff. It\u2019s a little under $200 million; $190 million I believe is our acute care balance.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Scott, you talked about a reduction in the initial yield on the property that transferred from the original operator to the replacement operator on the pretty developments. What extent were those projects unusual or perhaps an aberration? Or might you experience something similar on the pretty material amount of development you have coming up for completion later this year and into \u201810?", "Scott Estes", "I\u2019d first comment that we had been watching those assets for awhile and as George mentioned, you do a lot of work to try to transition assets to a different operator. Again, the transition was two assets that were under development and four assets that were in fill-up that were transitioned to a separate operator.", "The operator that we did get to take the development properties we\u2019re very excited to have in the portfolio; it\u2019s someone we\u2019ve known for a long time and have a 20 plus year of history in the senior housing business and really maybe, George, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019d comment on any of the negotiation aspects of what the slight reduction and initial yield through that transition.", "George Chapman", "Well, first of all, on the four that were moved, there is very little reduction and we\u2019ll make up for that reduction in later years. So that\u2019s more of the standard, Jim. We\u2019ve based upon our many years of experience. The other ones were more troublesome and I don\u2019t know whether it was just the particular community or that our old operator did not do a good enough job of preparing before they opened.", "But for whatever reason, we brought in another operator and needed a reduction and I think the only aberrational aspect to it is, that usually doesn\u2019t happen to us and we had to take a bit of a reduction and that\u2019s an oddity in our experience, but we are fine with them because they\u2019re very good operators and the care will be very good and it\u2019s certainly something we can handle very easily.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "When you say, you\u2019re accepting a reduction initially, but you\u2019ll make it up in later years, so you are reducing the initial rent, but you are getting a higher growth rate in that rent agreement?", "George Chapman", "With the four, there is a chance that we will make up for it in the other two, but we\u2019re not necessarily counting on it.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "You\u2019ve talked qualitatively about your entrance fee move-ins and the pace of move-ins, and we\u2019re especially concerned about the entrance fee communities that are coming towards completion in markets that have experienced the most stress in terms of the traditional housing market.", "You\u2019ve talked qualitatively, I think you said last quarter that things were slower than you expected. You said on this call that things picked up a bit in the first quarter. Can you quantify at all those qualitative comments with respect to the entrance fee move-ins and the pace that you\u2019re seeing?", "George Chapman", "Let me give you an aggregate couple numbers to give you a feel for it. But it\u2019s clear that; we have one case where the sales are slower than the others. Our largest operator, frankly, in the Southeast is ahead of his projections, which really helps us quite a bit. He has the greatest number.", "As you look at the aggregate move-ins and presales for our 10 communities which are open, those totaled 67 through the end of April versus our budget of 71. So, we are running a little behind, but in the aggregate we are starting to feel better, pretty good, about where we are right now and that\u2019s a result of a lot of hard work and follow-up and really working the traffic.", "So, I think we are seeing some pretty good signs and that isn\u2019t to say, though, that there aren\u2019t going to be one or two that keep us preoccupied. Scott, did you want to add anything?", "Scott Estes", "No, I think that\u2019s a good perspective in aggregate terms of how we are doing on presales and move-ins even that\u2019s all the way through the end of April.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Then switching gears, Scott, last quarter you disclosed that $73 million of your total loans are now on non-accrual. That struck me as a pretty high number in an absolute sense and a very high number as a percentage of your total loans. Can you talk about the nature of the loans that are currently on non-accrual and then with respect to the non-accrual assets, what you\u2019re thinking in terms of your actual loan loss reserve?", "Scott Estes", "Sure, the loans on non-accrual were $72.7 million last quarter. There were no additions to that number in the first quarter. Again, as we think about it, one way I looked at it, if you look at our aggregate loan portfolio, excluding the loans that are on non-accrual, we are still generating about an 8.5% to 9% return on our aggregate loan portfolio.", "I think we\u2019ve been pretty conservative, historically from a recognition perspective. As I look back to our history of loans on non-accrual, the last time we had a little bit of a higher number was in 2004, where we had, I think it was as high as $35 million to $36 million of aggregate loans on non-accrual at that point. That was even a bit of a higher percentage of the portfolio at that time and when you look at that pool of loans, we had only $55,000 of write-offs from that portfolio since 2004.", "So, I think we try to be conservative from a recognition perspective. As it relates to our reserve, we look at the aggregate pool of loans that were determine to be at risk every quarter and again make any adjustments as necessary to move the aggregate reserve to a level we deem adequate based on a collateral analysis. ", "Generally speaking, smaller operators, very small percentage of the portfolio, I think are anywhere near the top 20 or even 30 or so of our operators. It\u2019s more skewed toward the independent living component of our business.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Finally, is Health Care REIT a participant in the newly cast Brookdale line of credit?", "George Chapman", "I didn\u2019t hear that, Jim. Would you repeat that?", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Yes, you guys are a participant. Brookdale REIT did its line of credit. Are you guys are participating that?", "George Chapman", "Yes, we are.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Can you help me understand or can you tell us how much?", "George Chapman", "It\u2019s relatively small and it was done in conjunction with two other financial partners of Brookdale\u2019s. I think the message I\u2019d like to give to the street is that it shows our confidence in Bill Sheriff and what he\u2019s doing and we\u2019re happy to be in it.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Why did Brookdale need to go outside of its traditional sources of line of credit capital, i.e. the banks and have to reach out to you as a participant?", "George Chapman", "I think that they had a number in mind. I also believe that we sort of know the answer why people have had to go outside of traditional sources. The banks have not been fun to work with lately and anybody who has had to deal with liquidity issues or has had to deal with some of the housing issues impacting some of the coverage\u2019s knows that it\u2019s not at all atypical.", "Frankly, I think that Bill and Brookdale should be complimented on getting a bank deal done in these times. By the way, he and his team are doing a great job in terms of operations. So, we\u2019re happy to be in it.", "Operator", "At this time there are no further questions. Mr. Chapman, you may proceed with your closing remarks.", "George Chapman", "I have no closing remarks, but we would like to thank all of you for your participation. Scott and the team will be available for any follow-up questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s Health Care REIT conference call.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bowe", "Thank you, Brandy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's second quarter 2009 conference call. In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the Company's website at www.hcreit.com.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we are holding a live webcast of today's call which maybe accessed through the Company's website as well.

I'd like to now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, George.", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much, Jim. I want to spend my time today commenting generally on our execution during these tough economic times. First, on capital rising, we raised in excess of $1.7 billion of capital during the last 18 months. The amounts included $1 billion of equity, $133 million of secured debt and $525 million of non-core asset sales. The average price per share on the equity raises was $42.77. The rate on the secured debt was 6.1%. And the asset sales produced $192 million of gains. ", "We are very pleased with our ability to raise this attractively priced capital in these times. There are obviously certain important implications. One, we enhanced our liquidity. We delevered our balance sheet and from a portfolio standpoint, the sales of non-core assets together with strategic acquisitions and developments allowed us to continue repositioning the portfolio for the future in new, customer-centric properties. We also continue within the portfolio to benefit from strong portfolio management.", "One of the really important factors for us, so we have maintained our diversification with our top five operators comprising only 24.2% of the portfolio and the top 10 comprising only 37%. Scott will discuss performance more specifically within the senior housing and care sector, but I'll make this general comment, that operators have performed very well in this tough environment. The recent results from Brookdale were quite impressive.", "Our operators are optimistic about future occupancy trends in light of the very limited construction activity. I think the message is quite clear, that the senior housing and care sector has been very resilient in the face of significant economic and housing difficulties. To the CCRC area, we reported in our last call an increase in presales and move-ins in the first quarter, with an uptick in operator optimism. At that time, the stock market improvement appeared to be the key driver.", "Today, the stock market improvement continues with some signs of a housing market recovery and while no one expect the housing markets to improve rapidly, given the unemployment numbers, the increase in sales and prices of new single family homes and housing starts are very positive data points.", "Let me mention a few positive signs within our entrance fee CCRC portfolio. Currently within our open CCRCs, there have been 97 move-ins in 2009 versus a budget of 96. Tours and attendants at other educational and marketing meetings have picked up noticeably. Many earlier prospects who had walked away from these facilities have come back for a second, third and fourth look. We believe that our operators have in place solid marketing and sales efforts, so that increased volumes should translate into sales momentum in the next several months, absent a further economic correction.", "With respect to these open CCRC projects, deposits and move-ins were up in the second quarter, a trend that continued, if not increased in July. Our largest operator has 23 move-ins scheduled for the next six months with an additional four or five in the process of scheduling. This appears to be a trend that is occurring throughout the CCR portfolio. We are awaiting additional data in the next several months to confirm this trend.", "Finally, the rental component within CCRCs is doing quite well. Overall, the rental components' occupancy is 68%, with our largest operator's rental occupancy currently standing at 76% and I should point out that this particular operator believes that the rental occupancy will be over 90% by year end.", "As I said earlier, we're not suggesting that the housing market issues have been resolved or that sales of entrance fee units will accelerate rapidly. However, there is a large increase in traffic and a strong sense of optimism within our operator base. As you know, we believe that overtime seniors will be more attracted to larger communities with more amenities such as CCRCs. Moreover, the pricing power for attractive high-end senior housing should be very strong in the next three to four years. ", "Just a word on medical office buildings. In the MOB space, we did experience some integration pains during 2007. But we've added key personnel to our property management team, refocused the organizational structure to add more accountability, commenced an effort to sell certain non-core MOBs and acquired or developed state-of-the-art larger medical office buildings.", "And John Thomas, head of the Medical Facilities group will be available to discuss the MOB space during this call. Again, briefly on development, our development projects are proceeding quite well with many coming in below budget and ahead of schedule. These high quality assets will be great additions to our portfolio and carry an average initial rate of 8.8% and we believe that these returns are solid in light of the stickiness of cap rates during the last years, as well as a relatively small number of acquisition opportunities during that period.", "I would also add that we match funded, if you will, this development with attractively priced capital as well during this period. So general comments on the portfolio. We're pleased with our efforts in repositioning the portfolio. We have always focused on the drivers of change in healthcare and senior housing and the results and changes to the real estate platforms that are required.", "Next up for us, as the markets have improved, our liquidity has largely been assured and the capital markets are clearly strengthening. We believe we are moving beyond the inflexion point between preserving liquidity versus deploying capital. For the last 24 months, we have maintained dialogue with excellent existing and future operators in health systems, waiting for the capital to become more readily available at reasonable prices.", "We are now actively seeking selective, high quality investments with seasoned operators. We have positioned the Company carefully during these difficult times and are prepared to be very active as we enter the new growth phase, as we were in 2001. At this time, I will now turn the podium over to Scott Estes, our CFO, for a brief financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, George and good morning everyone. Second quarter earnings were in line with expectations and the Company's current liquidity position remained strong. Our $888 million of cash and line of credit availability is enough to fund all of our current development and debt maturities through mid-2012.", "I would point out that we are managing our debt maturities under the conservative assumption that both our $340 million convertible debt, putable in December 2011, and our $395 million convertible putable in July 2012 are put to us, although by no means is this a foregone conclusion with our stock now trading only 10% to 15% below the respective conversion prices. If our converts are not put, the current $888 million of availability covers virtually all of our unfunded development and debt maturities through year-end 2012.", "We have also increased our secured debt expectations for the remainder of 2009 to approximately $300 million which remains an important source of attractively priced capital. This secured debt plus additional asset sales later this year should further enhance our liquidity and position us to begin to capitalize on select senior housing and medical facility investments, should they become available. ", "Turning to the details of the quarter, we completed a total of $99 million of net investments. Gross investment activity of $178 million was primarily ongoing development funding with minor capital improvements and some funding on existing loans. This positions a $79million or a combination of loan payoffs in 13 property sales.", "Prior to these disposals were freestanding assets as we continue to prefer combination properties with multiple service types on the same campus. These sales generated $11 million of gains during the quarter and as George mentions, we've now generated nearly $200 million of gains on asset sales over the last 18 months.", "Turning to our current portfolio, it is performing well in a challenging environment. I will start off today talking about our development projects. We now anticipate completing a number of projects earlier than previously expected, and have increased our projected development completions by an additional $125 million during 2009 to a total of $662 million. Our current amount of unfunded development has declined to only $459 million, as we converted another $175 million of construction projects in the quarter.", "I would also like to highlight what we believe to be significant security supporting our development pipeline. First, I'll comment on the security behind the $565 million of acute care and medical office projects which represent 47% of our $1.2 billion in projects under way. Importantly, 91% of this balance is invested in projects sponsored by investment grade rated health systems and our medical office buildings that are currently 87% pre-leased.", "The remaining $624 million or 53% in the development pipeline is comprised of senior housing assets. 100% of these projects have either a personal or corporate guarantee and over 80% will roll into master leases. So, with nearly $700 million in expected project completions this year, and over $500 million expected to be completed next year, our development exposure should decline significantly.", "We remain excited about the quality of these assets and believe our overall portfolio in terms of asset quality and longevity will be greatly enhanced as a result. Now, in regards to our senior housing and nursing portfolio, payment coverage remained relatively constant in the most recent quarter. Our assisted living and independent living coverage came in within 1 basis point of prior quarter levels while skilled nursing coverage declined 3 basis points, but remains quite strong at 1.6 times after management fees.", "I think this is very positive news in the current environment. On the occupancy front, we continue to see declines in independent and assisted living with current occupancy at 89% and 88% respectively. Skilled nursing occupancy stands at 84%, but did increase slightly from the prior quarter. Despite the occupancy declines in independent and assisted living, several of our larger operators have increased profitability through price increases and expense reduction initiatives. Importantly, this has resulted in a sequential increase in EBITDA margin versus the prior quarter for both our stable independent and assisted living portfolios resulting in the fairly consistent property level rent coverages.", "For our entrance fee communities, some operators are faring better than others, but in aggregate we are still on track with our revised move-in budget for 2009. As I mentioned last quarter, we have dedicated analysts monitoring this portfolio and reporting to management on a weekly basis. As George discussed year-to-date through July 31, for our open entrance fee communities we now have a total of 97 move-ins versus our revised budget of 96.", "A non-entrance fee or rental component of these buildings continue to fill and on average are 68% occupied as of July 31. We are encouraged by this news as well as by the positive data emerging regarding the economy, housing market and the stock market. Finally, I will provide a brief comment on our unstabilized or fill-up portfolio. During the second quarter, we had four properties move out of the fill-up portfolio to stabilized assets.", "And at this point, we expect to move another five projects to stable from fill-up during the third quarter, with an investment balance in excess of $80 million. Turning to our specialty care and medical office portfolios, our specialty care portfolio continues to perform well with payment coverage over two times after management fees. Portfolio coverage, occupancy and payor mix changes this quarter were primarily due to payoffs we've had thus far in 2009.", "I would also highlight that on page 19 of the supplement, we have changed the presentation of the specialty care assets to provide some additional detail on our 14 long-term acute care hospitals, seven acute care hospitals and five in-patient rehab facilities. Our core medical office portfolio, which excludes assets held for sale, also performed in line with expectations.", "During the quarter, our core MOB portfolio generated $20.7 million in NOI, had strong tenant retention of 83%, and ended with occupancy of 90.6%, representing a 40 basis point increase versus the prior quarter. We now project that our core MOB portfolio will generate NOI of approximately $84 million to $85 million for 2009, representing a decline of 1% to 2% versus last year.", "Our tenants continue to sign leases with terms that are approximately one to two years longer than we had budgeted for this year and our future leasing prospects remain encouraging. Driven by our incremental leasing expectations through year end, we're estimating that our core MOB portfolio occupancy will finish 2009 between 91% and 92%.", "Lastly, turning to financial results, second quarter normalized FFO of $0.80 per share declined 6% versus the previous year, but was in line with the Wall Street consensus forecast. Normalized FAD of $0.76 per share declined 7%. These declines are generally a result of the significant capital activity completed over the last 12 months, which included $874 million in equity and $133 million of secured debt issued in April.", "Regarding our dividend, we recently declared the 153rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30 of $0.68 per share. As I mentioned last quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 2009 quarterly cash dividend rate of $2.72 annually. Our capital activity during the second quarter included the previously announced $133 million ten-year secured debt with Freddie Mac at an attractive 6.1% rate.", "We also issued 365,000 shares under our DRIP program, generating $12.1 million. Last, we did issue 400,000 shares under our equity shelf program at an average price of $36.05 generating proceeds of $14.4 million.", "Turning to liquidity, as of June 30, we had $888 million in available cash and line availability, compared to only $459 million of unfunded development and $86 million of secured debt maturities through the middle of 2012. We expect to add further flexibility over the remainder of the year, through additional asset sales, plus the $300 million of additional secured debt at an attractive rate of approximately 6.5%.", "Our credit profile at this time remains very strong. Our debt-to-undepreciated book capitalization is 39.7% at the quarter end, while our interest and fixed charge coverage were 3.5 times and 2.9 times respectively. Our secured debt stood at 9% of total assets at the end of the quarter and will increase to 14% pro forma for the secured debt transactions forecast in the second half of the year.", "We remain comfortable with these levels and note that we had discussed our capital plan in detail with the rating agencies. Finally, we have updated our normalized FFO and FAD guidance primarily to reflect the increase to our secured debt forecast to the rest of the year. As a result, we now expect to report normalized FFO in a range of $3.11 to $3.18 per diluted share and normalized FAD in a range of $2.95 to $3.02 per diluted share.", "Our expectation for net income available to common stockholders has been increased to $1.81 to $1.88 per diluted share, from $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted share detailed in our press release. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back to you, George.", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much, Scott and we're now open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from Karin Ford with KeyBanc.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "George, your comment earlier about seeing the inflexion point where you were getting comfortable to be more active on the investment front. What have you seen that gives you that view and what we could expect from an investment standpoint volumes and categories of assets going forward?", "George Chapman", "First of all, everybody is just trying to make the best balanced judgment as to when to make investments and what kind. We'll be limiting any investments to very high quality, selective portfolios and frankly, there have not been a lot of really good, high quality packages yet in the senior housing area.", "We are seeing more opportunities perhaps in the medical facilities arena. What has made us feel more comfortable? One, we funded everything through 2012 and that assumes we have to pay off all of our convertible debt which is becoming perhaps less likely as our stock price moves up.", "Two, the strength of the capital markets, the improvement in the unsecured note arena that we've seen in the last couple of days. Stock prices have moved and so there are certainly signs out there that it's time for companies to be looking much harder at investments and when we do, we'll be looking for hopefully acquisitions if we can find them. But in any event, combination facilities within senior housing and customer-centric acute care facilities, both hospitals and larger, better, nicer MOBs as well.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Along those lines, we had seen articles that you guys had been selected as the winning bidder on a $1 billion development project in Nassau County in Long Island. Can you just talk about that project and timing and scope and what your capital commitment will likely be? ", "George Chapman", "I'll turn this over to John Thomas in just a minute, but let me say that perhaps we have to coordinate a little bit more closely with some of the health systems. They were enthusiastic in terms of getting out their release. We're very enthusiastic about working with them, but that charge so far is to be the master developer and if we can provide other services and provide capital later at some point, that would be great as well.", "John Thomas", "We couldn't be more pleased about the relationship with Nassau. It's really a reflection of the full spectrum of what Health Care REIT is across the senior housing, acute care, medical office building and amateur care environment with our development capabilities, access to capital and really strategic planning expertise that we have.", "The engagement is a fee-for-service engagement at this point with a prospect over a number of years for significant development opportunities, both in the fee-for-service delivery on the development side as well as the investment for acute care and medical office building space. I think you'll see some exciting things coming out of Nassau in the near term. They've got great ambitions and we couldn't be more pleased about the relationship.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Whether or not HCN will actually end up providing capital is still to be determined?", "John Thomas", "It's still to be determined and frankly that's what the engagement is about. It's helping them identify the best opportunities for the use of their land and the redevelopment of existing facilities. So, on the fee-for-servicing consulting engagement will determine what's the best source of capital and whether or not it's an appropriate use of our capital and their appropriate use of our capital.", "George Chapman", "In the senior housing and care side, we've always been a relationship financier and we have thought we brought a lot of experience to the table for the benefit of our operators. In the acute care space, the medical facility side, one brings a good partnership in perhaps different ways and it might be in terms of providing property management services for medical office buildings, but more often than not, one leads with development and planning when one forms a relationship with a high-end [whole] system and we think this is a very positive news for us that we are there, we're valued as a partner. We bring a lot to the table and this will be the analogous to our relationship programs in senior housing.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc", "Same-store revenue growth this quarter was 1.3%. That's a little lower than you guys are normally in the mid-twos there. Can you just talk about why that number was a little lower?", "Scott Estes", "You're probably starting to see a little bit of the impact of some of the lack of [CCI] based increases in some of the senior housing categories. And that's probably the biggest factor as to why we always had forecast 1% to 2% same-store revenue growth for the full year. So that's why it's crept down a little bit over the last quarter or two.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "It looked like the yield on 2Q '09 conversions was dropping. I think it's just because you've shifted some of the stuff that was coming on in 3Q that was already set as kind of a lower yield. There's been no change in sort of the return on those properties, it's just a timing issue?", "Scott Estes", "That's correct. The projected initial yield in our aggregate development pipeline has been consistent at 8.8%. It's really just a function of the composition of the projects that converted in the quarter. We had just a couple larger ones that were closer to 8% initial yields this quarter, but the overall is unchanged.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "And remind me, those shift around based on like LIBOR or something it's just a debt clause? They don't really move based on your equity?", "Scott Estes", "That's right. They're generally set at certificate of occupancy based on a spread over the comparable Treasury and there's always floors.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess what I want to do is come back to the capital. Obviously, things have dramatically improved from even a quarter ago. How are you thinking about equity here? You obviously have a number of different ways to just bleed some out. Obviously one of your competitors did an overnight deal last night. Stock price is back up to close to 52-week highs I think. Does that start making more sense in terms of your scheme going forward?", "George Chapman", "I think I mentioned, Jerry, that our prices during the last couple of years have been averaging about almost 42 to 43, and we're up that way. So it does make one pause. We're evaluating it now and we certainly congratulate Jay and HCP on a very successful offering for them. Clearly it's made all of us sit up and re-evaluate.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "George, you touched on this already, but just to kind of reconfirm. I would categorize the feedback we've gotten so far from the public operators as kind of a bit mixed. Occupancy was kind of weaker a little bit this quarter, people are sort of talking about it popping up June, July, August, sounding a little more optimistic, but it's kind of a mixed bag in terms of how much people have slipped. It sounds like you're feeling decidedly more confident in terms of where we go on kind of private pay senior housing occupancy.", "George Chapman", "Jerry, I am more optimistic. The signs in housing, the continuous strength within the stock market has really made people look at the world a little differently than they were three, six, nine months ago even. We think that maybe what will happen is that a number of the existing contacts, existing prospects are coming back to a number of these facilities.", "So there is some chance to have some pretty good news over the next six months, will they re-evaluate and come back in. In senior housing, especially when you're selling units, entrance fee units, there's a lot of blocking and tackling, but I am a more bullish than I had been and I must say too that we worked with the operators.", "We've helped them look at their marketing and sales programs and I think that they are really good right now and with the opportunities we expect to see more volume over the next six to nine months. Now, when that will occur and how consistent that will be, that's anybody's guess.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "In terms of prospects for new investments, are you starting to see anything more in terms of packages coming to market, either distress driven or consolidation driven, particularly in senior housing?", "Scott Estes", "We are not seeing a lot. We are perhaps seeing a slight uptick in the number of packages we've seen, but it's been a surprise to all of us in this space as to how few have really come to market. We are seeing a few more at the moment.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "George and team, you're talking about opportunities and the inflexion point, all that good stuff and yet at the same time you're talking about how despite the Nassau news, you talked about how your development exposure will decline. Obviously, you're getting the same message maybe from investors that we do, what about their development exposure in this market?", "So in light of that, will development be a part of this sort of inflexion point movement or is it going to be mainly acquisitions?", "George Chapman", "Well, we would certainly rather buy the new state-of-the-art facilities that gives us immediate earnings. The question will be whether or not they are really available. And in terms of maybe a longer term view, Rich, we have always through our 38, 39 years thought that development was a part of our investment program.", "And again, I take you back to the '70s when skilled nursing were the new modern plans coming off of the three storey manor facilities, from independent living with [Tudd Hill & Colson] and the rest in the '90s when we were the leader in assisted living.", "So would we rather buy? Yes. Are we going to find acquisitions? Some. Are we going to prioritize for acquisition? Yes. But are we going to completely move away from development if we can do those with top end health systems or top end senior housing? We're not going to say no to those. We're going to keep it very balanced.", "The reality, Rich, is that our development percentage popped up a bit because when one is a third or a half of the way through development, you don't stop. You get them done. You get them open. And you do pretty well. And as I said, we match funded during that period.", "The projects that you do not close on are those that were potential acquisitions. So I think you'll see us being more moderate in terms of our percentage of development. And I think over time, as you see some of these high-end assets open, I think our portfolio will be viewed as one of the premier real estate platforms in the space.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Right now, zero acquisitions in your official guidance. Would you expect that any new acquisition activity would be immediately accretive?", "George Chapman", "I would think that any acquisitions would be accretive at this point.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Does this inflexion point give rise to some consideration to utilizing the flexibility of RIDEA?", "George Chapman", "We've been very clear that we don't view RIDEA structures as binding as Panacea. They can be used in some really unique situations where perhaps there are turnarounds or new assets that have been undermanaged, so that one can align interests of the management company and Health Care REIT appropriately, so we're both running in the same direction.", "We would have many more incentives and disincentives for the management team in place, if we did RIDEA deal and many times it just depends on the particular opportunity and the particular operator as to whether or not we do RIDEA.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Just looking at the coverage for your CCRC portfolio, independent living/CCRC, after management is 1.08 times, year ago it was 1.23 times. Obviously, trending down, no surprise there, but are you concerned at all that you get to a level below parity there?", "Scott Estes", "The answer to that would be no. I think you've seen some indications of stabilization over the last quarter or two, as you look at the sequential results were within a basis point or so of the prior quarter. I would also say that it's trailing 12 months as of March. I know that one of our largest independent living operators saw some reasonable occupancy improvements in May, at least a percent.", "So at least latest data is encouraging and again, they're focusing on profitability through rate increases and expense control and I would again point out, it's encouraging to see that margins increased over the last quarter, which ultimately as occupancy hopefully comes back, you set pricing appropriately in your facilities, that will just further enhance coverages.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question is from [Hert Kinner] with Morgan Keegan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Scott, you mentioned that you expect MOB NOI to run about $84 million to $85 million for the year. Could we then take that to mean that Q2 probably marks the low end and we'll see slight improvements in the next two quarters?", "Scott Estes", "That would be correct if that's the way the numbers fall out. Yes, $84 million to $85 million is the annualized core MOB guidance. So, we did 21.4 in the first quarter and 20.7 in the second.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And a follow-up on an earlier question regarding the same store revenue growth. In the specialty care segment, it was down about 2.6%. Was there anything to that, other than lack of CPI based increases that accounted for that decline?", "Scott Estes", "Actually, in specialty care there was a minor factor. There's 17 assets in that bucket and there was one single asset where we gave one hospital a minor rent and interest accommodation of about $250,000 a quarter. So, that single change resulted in the entire specialty care decline. If you took that one single asset out, specialty care would have been actually up 1% and the overall would have been up 1.6% instead of 1.3.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And will that accommodation be effected in the next several quarters as well?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, it's going forward and we're actually still earning about 10% on that asset. It's just a reduction versus last year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "On the development assets, you talked about properties that had been in fill-up that are converting to stabilized in 2Q and 3Q. Sounds like you're getting your triple-net rent as expected.", "If you look at your rent and look to the cash flow at the property level, how those assets are doing relative to the original underwriting, obviously they filled up during a very challenging time. I'm just curious how the performance stacks up to your original underwriting.", "George Chapman", "We have metrics that look at how construction goes and then we have a fill-up schedule that we evaluate every month as well and to date, we're pretty much right on target.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Despite the headwinds, particularly in the senior housing?", "George Chapman", "Well, we've had some really striking examples that are just the opposite of what one might expect. A couple of our operators, one operator opened with essentially the building filled and we've had a number of buildings, and this is assisted living and dementia, without the IL component, but we've had a number of them fill in six to eight months.", "Some have even been filling ahead of schedule, but usually that's a result of a really seasoned operator who has done a great job, free marketing and knows a particular space. We've really seen some really good examples of just good, tough operators who know how to do the blocking and tackling and fill up their buildings.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Switching to your loans receivable. Last quarter, 15% of the portfolio was on non-accrual. Has there been any meaningful change in a positive or negative way with respect to the non-accruals in your loan portfolio.", "Scott Estes", "That number is essentially unchanged. It's $72.5 million from $72.7 million in the prior quarter. So, it's down about $200,000 due to some minor principal payments we had in the second quarter and the composition of those loans is unchanged.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "And during 2Q, it looked like you advanced about $30 million to operators. I'm curious, when you make loans to operators, are they typically using the money to enhance the physical asset or are there circumstances where those loans are being advanced to support the operating business of that operator in a tough time?", "George Chapman", "Our loan packages have been for any number of reasons. One that we've talked about earlier had been when [Ameritas] repurchased some of our facilities, giving us a large gain and we took back financing as did NHP and I think HCP, doing very similar things. Others related to a very substantial company on the East Coast that helped more with the corporate infrastructure as well as particular improvements to facilities. So, they're all over the board, Jim.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "The one loan George was referencing this quarter, it was a little north of $20 million of the $31 million total. Outside of that one larger loan to that East Coast operator George mentioned, the amounts were fairly small and I would characterize them as routine this quarter.", "George Chapman", "Just on issue of loans, our loans are probably a little higher than they have been at certain times. I think 55% to 60% of them relate to three very substantial operators and they were to accommodate a sale, as I mentioned earlier, in the Ameritas case and to two other substantial operators who are very important to us within our portfolio and we find them to be very secure. You're really talking about 40% of that number and I don't have it in front of me being the standard loans that, again, address an array of different situations.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "Scott, you touched on CPI escalators before. Can you shed a little more light on how those work, when do they kick in? What CPI period is measured in determining what those rent increases will be?", "Scott Estes", "Sure, the senior housing and about 70% of the specialty care increasers in that portfolio are based on CPI. And in the medical office portfolio, it's a much lesser component, it's only about 8% of the medical office building increasers. ", "The way it works, basically I believe the official index is the urban wage and clerical workers index in some cases, but essentially upon the first anniversary of a lease, whatever the rate of CPI growth is in the preceding month is the basis for the increaser on the lease with generally a maximum of 25 or 30 basis points from the prior year's rate.", "So they can never go down. If CPI were negative like it's been since December of 2008, you would basically be in a situation where you keep rent the same and then we actually have the ability to catch up in future periods to the extent that CPI increases at a greater rate.", "So we think that the impact this year as they kind of blend through this year ultimately result in 1% to 2% same-store NOI growth in our senior housing and specialty care portfolios and we looked at the number even just as recently as this week and we're optimistic, but we will see obviously, we could be in a position where toward the end of the year where in the CPI indexes we may actually start to see some increasers again.", "Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors", "There's a lot of moving pieces on the revenue side with respect to your medical office building portfolio, but my specific question is what are you seeing in terms of market rents and market rent trends within the medical office building portfolio? Are you still seeing market rent increases or have those really flattened out at this point?", "John Thomas", "On new leases and renewals it's been a compressed market this year. We're having better than expected and strong renewal leasing and the terms of both our new leases and our renewal leases are longer than historical norms, but there has been some rent compression this year. We see that improving in the second half of the year and going forward.", "On our own portfolio, we've had a couple of master leases from hospitals that rolled off. They were long-term with CPI increases that are not being replaced at the same rate. In those couple of instances, which is a very small amount of square footage. We've talked about this before in Los Gatos where El Camino hospital [district] has taken over for tenant there and there's a substantially renewed interest in that hospital from the community and the physicians and we've seen a real uptick in leasing activity for the facility that the MOB that will be on there which is really the prime MOB on that campus. El Camino has reopened that hospital and we are actually managing a couple of the other MOBs on the campus and leasing activity is very strong and expect to get rent improvements over the near term.", "Operator", "There are no further questions.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Ordan, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, Sir.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you. Welcome to Sunrise Senior Living\u2019s Investor Conference Call. This is Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Julie Pangelinan, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being recorded and the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call. During the course of this call the company will make various remarks concerning management's expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors including those identified in our 2009 second quarter Form 10-Q.", "Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future. For a further discussion on the company's forward-looking statements please refer to our 2008 Form 10-Q, which we filed earlier today.", "Before I turn the call over to Julie, for a review of our results for the quarter, I will first review some of the progress we have made over the last quarter.", "In my last report to you, I expressed cautious optimism that we would continue our restructuring process to return our focus to our core operations. I also said that we would turn our attention to anything that detracts from profitability. We have been progressing on these fronts. As we reported in our 10-Q, we have continued to make progress in our restructuring efforts. In the quarter, we announced a restructuring plan to reduce overhead spending by $20 million. Under the plan, approximately 150 positions will be eliminated. As of June 30, 2009, we have eliminated 71 positions, and will be eliminating an additional 77 positions by the early 2010.", "We have not just been cutting. We have been strengthening. Everybody knows that Sunrise has an extraordinary team of 38,000 people who give all they have for our residents. While streamlining, we have been steadily strengthening leadership in scores of key positions. Among our changes recently, we announced the promotion of Julie Pangelinan to Chief Financial Officer, and recently appointed Marc Richards as our new chief counting officer.", "I'm also pleased to share that Lou Ferguson, a seasoned attorney, who bring years of experience to the company is serving as our general council, who has been deeply involved in our restructuring efforts, and is an important partner working very closely with me, Greg Neeb, Julie and our team.", "We have reduced overheads steadily and have taken steps to improve our overall efficiency. We have reduced discretionary spending and we have already seen our G&A drop significantly due to our efforts in just one quarter. We predict that our 2009 annual run rate of 120 million is now reduced to approximately 109.6 million. We believe we are still on track to reduce our annual run rate to less than 100 million in 2010.", "We are reducing spending in areas like consulting, temporary health, travel, information technology, and any other big or small category we can find. We have improved our cash position and we have strengthened our cash management processes. On July 31, 2009 our cash balance was approximately $25 million. We received approximately $9.8 million as a settlement agreement, as part of a settlement agreement with the former majority stockholders of Trinity Hospice. We also sold our ownership interest in Aston Gardens. We received 4.8 million of net proceeds for our equity interest.", "We also announced that we are marketing a portfolio of 22 owned and 5 leased communities in which Sunrise is also the manager. These 27 communities have a book value of 185.4 million and related debt of 173.6 million. We are in the early stages of the sales process, but have already received strong interest in these properties. And we intend to sell 16 land parcels, which have a carrying value of 62.7 million and a related debt of 34.3 million.", "I have heard that some are puzzled as to how our cash position has risen during this time. Not that hard, it is the result of non-recurring sales, holding certain debt payments, clearly improved cash management, and relatively steady cash flow from core operations. That is how.", "In addition to improving our liquidity, we are also working to eliminate outstanding liabilities. As we announced in the first quarter, we hired a broker to market and sell all nine of our German communities. We have begun receiving bids. The cash from these sales will go directly to the lender of our German communities. We are also working to secure additional liquidity to satisfy the remaining German debt.", "We are also working to resolve matters related to our Fountains venture, which is currently in default, and we believe we have made significant progress to this end with our venture partner and venture lender and the end result will have little cash exposure to Sunrise.", "We have strengthened our vendor relationships and our accounts payable process restoring confidence in this vital part of Sunrise. We have worked hard to restore our credibility with our lenders. We have and continue to struggle with debts which are out of compliance, operating deficit guarantees, and loans on underperforming assets. We are dealing with many of these issues and we continue to hope that the lenders agree that they are best served in an out of court process. However, as we wrote in our 10-Q, this is a process whose outcome is not totally under our control. We look awfully hard at this, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful. As detailed in our 10-Q, we do have several upcoming financing deadlines to address.", "We are very disappointed to announce a 270 basis points decline in occupancy for the second quarter. That are likely several factors that contribute to this, and in early June we enacted a determined program to reverse this slide. We have begun to see a reversal in our occupancy numbers, so far we attribute to a combination of this program that we enacted and an expected seasonal lift.", "We have been working to improve our relationship with our capital partners. Our portfolio includes positives and challenges and we like working closely with our partners to play to our strength, while recognizing and addressing our weaknesses. I believe for example, that our relationship with Ventas is an eyes wide-open constructive one, where we consider strategies, tactics, and obligations that maximize returns for both organizations.", "In one case, where we thought we had such a relationship we roughly learned that we are apparently wrong. Since joining Sunrise, I have enjoyed my frequent interactions with HCP leadership and hope that we would continue to work on ways to benefit both companies. HCP comments along the way, let me to think, we're on a positive path.", "While the pending litigation suggests a very different situation, I certainly hope that we can return to a constructive relationship with HCP. We received the HCP lawsuit in June, which made serious, but we believe false accusations about our contractual relationship. We have fulfilled our obligations under these management contract and expect HCP to do the same. Furthermore, the management contracts themselves are legally sound and all of our actions have been and continue to be totally appropriate and consistent with both our contractual obligations and best practices in the industry.", "Let me assure you that we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this action. I heard some outside commentaries that Sunrise would lose sight of improving the business because of these matters. That will not happen. If anything, this sort of thing can galvanize our organization.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Julie, who will review our operating metrics and financial results in greater detail.", "Julie Pangelinan", "Thanks, Mark. I would like to start by review our operating performance in our comparable communities for the quarter and the measures we took for addressing a difficult operating environment.", "As we discussed in the first quarter, we expected the economy would continue putting pressure on community profitability due to its impact on occupancy and our ability to grow rate and revenue. We knew this would require us to place greater emphasis on improving our expense management and counteracting the potential decline in occupancy. Our efforts proved to be the right course of action given the challenges this quarter.", "As we stated on our last earnings call, if we look at our results with and without the impact of foreign exchange rates, you'll get a better sense of how we actually performed. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, also presents our data in a manner consistent with others in the industry that operate predominantly in the US.", "In the second quarter of 2009, we experienced a decrease in expenses of 1.8% as compared to the second quarter of 2008. When we exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates, in addition to excluding a $5 million health and dental credit we received in the prior year, our expenses decreased year-over-year by 1.7%. These expense reductions are the results of a number of cost containment and reduction measures implemented by management, including reinforcing our variable labor guidelines, decreasing overtime, and focusing on cost reductions that do not affect resident care such as supplies, repairs and maintenance, advertising and other controllable costs.", "There are some areas of our expenses that were lower in the second quarter such as repairs and maintenance and utilities that historically have increased towards the end of the year. We expect a similar trend in these categories later this year, but we anticipate that more than half of our expense savings will be sustained. As for our revenue this quarter, we reported a decline of 1.4%.", "However, if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates revenue remained flat year-over-year. Specifically the decline in occupancy was offset in full by rate growth and increased extended care revenues.", "Unit occupancy this quarter declined 270 basis points from 89.6% to 86.9% year-over-year. Our average daily revenue per occupied unit increased by 2%, and if we exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates it increased 3.5%. We do offer limited pricing incentives tailored to local competitive dynamics to sustain or expenses.", "Now I would like to review our financial results for the quarter. We reported revenues of $380.9 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to $411.3 million for the second quarter of 2008. Net loss for the second quarter was $81.8 million or $1.62 per fully diluted share as compared to net loss of $31.8 million or $0.63 per fully diluted share for the second quarter of 2008.", "Included in the loss from discontinued operations of $46.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2009, is an operating loss of approximately $8 million from our nine German communities, and an impairment loss relating to the nine German communities of $52.4 million. As the communities are now considered held for sale, the results from the communities for the current and prior periods are included in discontinued operations. The fair value of the assets based on the average bid, price of initial bids received was less than the recorded book value and we accorded a charge of $52.4 million.", "We expect to settle the German debt for an amount that is less than the recorded amount of 190 million as the debt is only partially recourse to us. Any difference between the recorded amount and the amount ultimately paid to the lenders to settle the debt will be recorded as gain on the extinguishment of debt on the date it is legally satisfied.", "Also included in discontinued operations is a $7.1 million gain from the settlement between us and the previous owners of Trinity. Cost from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $43.2 million. Excluding SEC investigation costs, restructuring costs, and non-cash charges including depreciation and amortization, the provision for doubtful accounts, write-off of capitalized project costs, and impairment of long-lived assets, adjusted income from ongoing operations is 10 million.", "Adjusted income from operations is a measure of operating performance that is not calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for income or loss from operations or net income or loss. Adjusted income from operations is used by management to focus on cash generated from the ongoing operations of the company, and to help management assess its adjustments to current spending decisions as needed.", "Now I would like to address certain income statement line items with material fluctuations between the three months ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008. The decrease in management fees of $2.2 million or 7% for the three months ended June 30, 2009 is primarily due to a decrease in the management fees for the Fountains venture and the loss of fees from terminated management contracts.", "The decrease in professional fees from development, marketing and other of 9.3 million or 71% for the three months ended June 30, 2009 is due to the decrease in our development pipeline. There are currently only nine communities under development in the US and the UK and there is a corresponding decrease in development expense.", "The decrease in general and administrative expenses of 17.5 million or 39% for the three months ended June 30, 2009, as Mark stated, is primarily due to the implementation of our cost-cutting plan. We have reduced spending through a number of cost containment initiatives. Our G&A for the quarter of 27.4 million indicates an annual run rate of approximately 109.6 million, down from an annual run rate of approximately 120 million based on first-quarter results.", "There will continue to be a decrease in this annual run rate as we continue to execute on our 2009 restructuring plan. Restructuring costs of 9.2 million were incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2009 with no comparable expense in the prior year. This amount represents severance costs incurred related to the execution of our 2008 and 2009 restructuring plans as well as legal and professional fees relating to corporate restructuring.", "Impairment of long-lived assets was 25 million for the quarter relating to 6 operating communities and 9 land parcels.", "Finally turning to cash flows, we had 37 million of cash at June 30, 2009 compared to 29.5 million of unrestricted cash at December 31, 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities was 29.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 18.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008, an increase in cash of 47.7 million. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in our loss before non-cash impairment charges and working capital changes. Changes in working capital provided cash of 19.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to only 3.8 million in the corresponding period in 2008.", "Net cash provided by investing activities was 4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 172.9 million for the six months ended 2008, an increase in cash of 177.7 million. The change was primarily due to a decrease of 116.4 million in net advances to communities under development and net receivable, a decrease in 81.4 million in capital expenditures and a 15.7 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets.", "Finally, net cash used in financing activities was 26.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 128.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008, a decrease in cash of 154.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of 150 million.", "Now I will turn the call back over to Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks, Julie. The turnarounds and workouts are tough on everybody, perhaps especially on our team who lives it 24 x 7. I'm so grateful to peoples\u2019 professionalism and endurance and to those who have chosen to join us recently to build Sunrise\u2019s future. We will now open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And we will move to Roth Sharack [ph].", "Roth Sharack", "Hi. I live in a Sunrise residence in May, and have for seven years. I followed Sunrise for years, and I guess, I'm the cheerleader of sorts. So I want to offer this friendly comment. I'm curious about the new silence or maybe even the headline silence from the New York Times and the Washington Post. Times was brutal to Sunrise as opposed to highly critical, some appropriate. When the over expense and problems were hurting the company, but now that we have a new aggressive management that has cut projects and cut back expenses et cetera, I have seen no good news stories or analysis by either newspaper. The recent profile of Mr. Ordan looked very nice, doesn't really qualify, was more of a puff piece and didn\u2019t express the progress that has been made by him.", "Now, I don't know what you can do about it, how about some fairness in reporting if not analysis. Thanks.", "Mark Ordan", "This is Mark. First of all the person who just spoke is not related to me in any way. But I like it. We have been frustrated, I guess bad news helps more newspapers than good news, but we have been frustrated by the newspapers, certainly our hometown paper, but I can't control your editorial decisions. But thank you very much. I'm glad you are a happy resident of Sunrise.", "Operator", "And we will move next to Larry Levy [ph] with High Capital [ph].", "Larry Levy \u2013 High Capital", "Hi, you mentioned your problems with HCP. Do you have any comments on the recent Green Street [ph] report they put out about to the HCP litigation?", "Mark Ordan", "Actually, we were very puzzled by that piece, and what I've heard from others unrelated to Sunrise where too. Apparently they had no consideration to what the judge in the case said even though a transcript was and is readily available for anybody who wants it. Clearly the writer read neither the court filings nor the agreements he opined on. It looks like the information came from only one source. But we have already spoken to this writer, who by the way has a great reputation, and since then we have been assured that in the future he will talk with us whenever he talks about us.", "And I would also add, we spend a lot of time on this. This is not a groundbreaking case. The contract case where one party, HCP, is unhappy with the contracts it bought, and is looking for a free or cheap way out. You know the judge ruled in part of this matter and said that this is not going to be an expedited case. So it is likely this will go on for years. Not that we hope that, but that is where we are.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Next, we will move next to Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hello all. I just had a couple of things Mark in that I'm sure some of the specifics, you know, are still obviously in negotiations, but just wanted to think about it. You identified I think 360 million or so of debt that is in default. And I just wanted to understand sort of the big buckets there. I am assuming about 200 million or so, 190 million is the German, can you just sort of touch on what else there is?", "Mark Ordan", "I will let Julie go through that and then I may comment a little bit further.", "Julie Pangelinan", "Okay, so included in the debt, you are right. There is 190 million of debt on our books relating to the German communities. We are obviously working with those lenders to restructure. We also have debt relating to a portfolio of properties that is being currently marketed for sale, and we have a debt relating to some land parcels, and those of the primary pieces of our corporate debt.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And so, Fountains is not in that category?", "Julie Pangelinan", "No, Fountains is a venture for us, so that debt is not on our balance sheet.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great.", "Mark Ordan", "Referring to that earlier that we have been working very closely with our bank and our capital partner, and I am confident that we will have a solution, which again would have minimal cost to Sunrise. So that is on the Fountains. The only thing I would just comment Jerry that it is just to say a complicated company with many pieces. So it takes time working with lots of different banks and different ventures to sort through this to come up with a solution that is comfortable for everybody, and so we have to treat everybody fairly and that is what we are doing.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And just in terms of the process obviously, it is not exactly predictable, it is about how it all plays out, but you know is thinking about the December 2 I think expiration date if I remember correctly on the bank line, kind of target for getting it kind of settled, hopefully out of court in one way or the other.", "Mark Ordan", "Sure. We spend a great deal of time until December 2. We have many maturities over the next many months, and our relationship with our line group is extremely important to us. So we are very mindful, and we said it several times that this company is to be refinanced and restructured. So we keep that date in mind, but don't anticipate on November 30, scratching the head and saying what are we going to do. So we're working on this now. A little hot in August in Washington, but we're here.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Of course they have conditioning, but are there any other buckets, major buckets of things, you know you have talked about the properties and parcels to be sold. You touched on France, you touched on Germany. You know I guess the other thing that I heard was negotiating with a variety of partners to perhaps raise some additional capital. Are there other sorts of kind of just major chunks of his that you know we should be keeping in mind, just trying to think through what might play out?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, just the ones you mentioned, you know we have ownership interest in some of our ventures, and it is not obviously completely up to us whether they can be turned into cash. I do think and I think we commented recently that we do discuss these matters with our capital partners, and as I said earlier, if there were things that we can do that are good for us and our cash position that still represents a fair value, that are also good for our capital partners, and then we look for ways to do that. So, you know, with Ventas or anybody, we work closely with them and we do try to find ways that can help us and help them.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great thanks.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Jerry.", "Operator", "And Mr. Ordan, there are no further questions at this time.", "Mark Ordan", "Okay, great. Everybody enjoy your summer, and thank you very much for your support.", "Operator", "That concludes this conference.

For further discussions on the company\u2019s forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2009 Form 10-K, that we filed earlier today.", "Before I make my remarks this morning about our fourth quarter and the coming year, you will first hear from Julie, who will provide highlights and commentary on our operating and financial results, and then from Greg Neeb, for an update on our restructuring progress and other corporate updates. ", "Julie Pangelinan", "Thank you, Mark. I will start by reviewing our comparable community operating performance for the quarter, first on occupancy. Our occupancy for the quarter in our comparable communities was 86.5%, which is a decline of 350 basis points from the fourth quarter 2008 and down 10 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2009.", "If we exclude the results from the Fountains portfolio, 16 communities that we have or will discontinue managing in the coming months, our occupancy was 87.2% for the fourth quarter. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2009. We believe this number provides a better indication of how our go forward business performed. We attribute this quarter-over-quarter increase to a series of efforts including more targeted marketing and instituting corrective rate changes.", "Our average daily revenue per occupied unit in our comparable communities increased by 2.5% to $190.56, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, it was $189.22, an increase of 1.8% year-over-year.", "Looking at our results with and without the impact of foreign exchange rates presents our data in a manner consistent with others in the industry that operate predominantly in the U.S. Our comparable community revenues were $517 million this quarter, a decline of 1.6% as compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, revenues of $513 million was a decrease of 2.3% year-over-year.", "With respect to our comparable community expenses, we experienced a decrease of 3.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and certain health and general expenses experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008, these operating expenses decreased 4.8% year-over-year.", "In my role as CFO, I have become heavily involved in identifying ways to reduce expenses in our communities without impacting the excellent service our residents receive. I'm personally responsible for overseeing all of our purchasing initiatives and worked to engage in more natural purchasing contracts to take advantage of our buying power as a larger organization.", "Moreover, much of my efforts are now focused directly with our operations leaders throughout Sunrise to ensure that everyone understands how all of the pieces fit together. We have seen success from these national agreements, particularly in the area of food cost and supplies.", "With respect to food, which was one of our largest area of savings, we also have been more effective in reducing food waste. Other areas where we have seen expense reduction include non-productive labor, marketing, utilities, liability insurance and workers\u2019 comp plan.", "Now, I will review our financial results for the quarter and the year. Note that revenues on loss before income taxes and discontinued operations previously reported for 2008 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The amounts were reclassified to include the results of our German communities, our former Greystone subsidiary, 22 communities which were sold in 2009 and one community which was closed in 2009 in discontinued operations.", "For the fourth quarter, Sunrise reported revenues of $364.4 million in 2009 as compared to $398.4 million in 2008. Net income attributable to common shareholders for 2009 was $10.4 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share as compared to net loss of $305.6 million or $6.07 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Of the net income attributable to common shareholders per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009, $0.77 came from discontinued operations, which was offset by a loss of $0.58 from continuing operations. That compares to a loss of $1.38 from discontinued operations and $4.69 from continuing operations in 2008.", "During the fourth quarter of 2009, we sold 21 properties and recognized a gain of $48.9 million, which is included in discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $121.8 million related to all of the goodwill for our North American business segment and we also determined that evaluation allowance from the net deferred tax assets as required.", "For the year, Sunrise reported revenues of $1.464 billion for 2009 as compared to $1.571 billion for 2008. Net loss attributable to common shareholders for 2009 was $133.9 million or $2.61 per fully diluted share as compared to a net loss of $439.2 million or $8.72 per fully diluted share in 2008.", "Loss from operations for 2009 was $132 million. Excluding SEC investigation costs, restructuring costs for non-cash charges including depreciation and amortization, the provision for doubtful accounts, write-off of capitalized project costs, and impairment of long lived assets, adjusted income from ongoing operations is $15 million in both 2009 and 2008.", "Adjusted income from ongoing operations is a measure of operating performance that is not calculated in accordance with U.S GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for income or loss from operations or net income or loss. ", "Adjusted income from ongoing operations is used by management to focus on cash generated from the ongoing operations of the company and to help management assess if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed.", "Now I would like to adjust certain income statement line items with material fluctuations between years. Management fees were $112.5 million for 2009, a decrease of $19.1 million or 14.5% from 2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the management fees from our Fountains venture, a loss of fees from terminated management contracts and a reduction in fees due to lower community occupancy.", "Professional fees from development marketing and other were $13.2 million in 2009, a decrease of $31.2 million or 70.3%. The decrease is due to the decrease in our development pipeline. As of the end of 2009, there are no communities under development and we currently do not have plans to commence any new projects. Related development expense decreased by $21.6 million, resulting in a net reduction of $9.6 million in cash flows from development.", "General and administrative expenses for the year were $119.9 million, a decrease of $37.6 million or 23.9% from 2008. Through year-end, we have eliminated 154 physicians under the 2009 restructuring plan, in addition 182 physicians eliminated under the 2008 plan in both development and corporate overhead.", "There are an additional 30 physicians that will be eliminated by early 2010. In addition to the reduction in salary and bonus costs, we also saw significant reductions in general corporate expenses including information technology costs, travel, training and education and temporary. ", "Loss from discontinued operations in 2009 was $20.3 million, a decrease of $97.3 million or 82.8% from 2008. Discontinued operations consists of the results from our German communities, which we are marketing for sale, our Greystone subsidiary sold in early 2009, 22 communities sold in 2009, one community closed in 2009, our Trinity subsidiary, which ceased operations in 2008 and two communities, which were sold in 2008. ", "In 2009, we recorded a loss of $81.8 million for our German operations, which included an impairment charge of $49.9 million to record the communities at fair market value. We have $23.7 million gain related to the sale of Greystone and finally we had a $48.9 million gain from the sale of the 21 communities to Brookdale in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Turning to cash flows, we had $39.3 million and $29.5 million of unrestricted cash at December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively. We have financed our operations in 2009 primarily with cash generated from operations and sale of assets, including the sale of our Greystone subsidiary, the sale of our Aston Gardens\u2019 equity interest and the sale of 21 communities to Brookdale. ", "We have $440.2 million of debt at December 31, 2009, compared to $636.1 million at December 31, 2008, a decrease of $195.9 million. All of our debt is either due in 2010 or in default. We eliminated approximately $140 million of mortgage debt in conjunction with the sale of the underlying assets during 2009 and made principal payments of $61.3 million on our bank credit facilities. We have reduced the outstanding balance on our bank credit facility from $95 million at the beginning of the year to $33.6 million at the end of 2009.", "The balance is due on December 02, 2010. At December 31, 2009, $317.2 million of debt is in default, of which $224.3 million is due to the lenders of our nine German communities. Greg will provide an update on our restructuring agreement with the lenders, the seven of our nine German communities in a moment.", "On February 12, 2010, we extended the maturity dates of $56.9 million of debt that was in default at December 31, 2009 to December 02, 2010. We will continue to work with the remaining lenders to reschedule current maturities and obtain waivers. I will now turn the call over to Greg.", "Greg Neeb", "Thank you, Julie. As I said on our last call, the process of restructuring the balance sheet is ongoing. We have completed a number of large transactions since the process began in mid-2008, and we are in better shape as a result, although the substantial work remains to be done in order to significantly reduce our financial risk. On this call, I will only update the recent restructuring events since the last call.", "I will update you on the seven primary focus areas. Item one is to extend consolidated debt maturities and obligations with respect to certain recourse loans using the $20 million of escrow funds generated from the sale of 21 assets we completed last year to mature with our credit line on December 02, 2010. Specifically we paid down the lender on our Connecticut Avenue property in Washington D.C by $5 million on a loan with a principle balance of $35 million after the repayment.", "Also, we paid down Wells Fargo $5 million on two land loans and a construction loan with a total balance of $52 million after the repayment. Finally, we paid an additional lender $1 million on two land loans with the balance of the $6.2 million after the repayment.", "We are working with our two remaining German lenders who have not yet elected to participate in our German restructuring agreement to utilize a portion of the remaining $20 million escrow along with other consideration to sell our recourse obligations to them.", "Item two, is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the guarantee of $58.2 million to three of our German lenders that we agreed to as part of our German restructuring agreement. Under that agreement, we created a liquidating trust of 21 properties to be sold for the benefit of the participating lenders.", "The appraised value of these 21 properties was $72.8 million. We also agreed to guarantee the electing lenders a minimum payment of $58.2 million at the end of 30 months commencing on the date of the definitive documents reduced by asset sales from the liquidating trust. As we have not yet signed these agreements and are operating under a binding term sheet, the 30-month clock has not yet commenced.", "To-date, we have closed three properties and reduced our guarantee by $10.5 million. We have six additional non-binding transactions moving through documentation and due-diligence that would if they close as currently contemplated reduce our guarantee by another $19 million. It is too early for us to form an opinion about any exposure we may have under the remaining guarantee and market conditions are difficult for asset sales of this variety.", "Item three, is to reduce the remaining balance of defaulted loans in our joint ventures and extend our maturities. These loans are not principle recourse to Sunrise, but loss to the properties could eliminate our ownership interest in these properties and could result in the loss of management fee revenue derived from these properties and we may have obligations under operating deficit agreements.", "Specifically, there are 42 loans in nine different ventures with total principal balances of approximately 700 million that are in default. This creates rate risk and funding risk. In addition, there are 23 loans in five different ventures maturing in 2010 with total principle balances of approximately 300 million that we will be seeking extensions for. ", "Since we cannot fund our share of any pay downs that may be required to restructure or extend these loans, we are at risk for full or partial dilution of our interest in these ventures. Item four, is to continue to stabilize the U.K.", "Our venture with Morgan Stanley that had an obligation to purchase certain properties we developed in our venture with Primerica, a Prudential affiliate, has now completed its purchase obligations when it closed on the final three assets.", "Sunrise has a 10% interest in the Morgan Stanley venture and a 20% interest in the Primerica venture. While these closings have substantially increased the stability of our platform in the U.K, we still have risks including the potential breach of a loan-to-value covenant and the bank loans to the Morgan Stanley venture.", "We also have continued operating deficit agreements for five stabilizing properties in our Primerica ventures, two which are capped and three are uncapped. Item five relates to reducing our management contract termination risks. As disclosed in our 10-K, certain of our management contracts contain termination provisions that can be triggered by failures to meet operating performance targets, regulatory compliance failures and certain significant agreement defaults among others.", "We have six significant concentrations of fees with three owners totaling approximately $62 million of fee revenue in 2009 or 55% of our total fees. Two owners alone, HCP and Ventas represent a total of $48 million or 43% of our total management fees in 2009. As you know, we are currently engaged in lawsuits in Delaware and Virginia with HCP in which among other things, HCP is seeking the right to terminate 64 of these contracts. ", "We are vigorously defending these lawsuits and have filed counter claims. We believe that only one HCP portfolio, the four asset portfolio that is in the subject of the Virginia lawsuit is subject to termination risk for a failure to achieve certain monetary performance thresholds and Sunrise can make a cash payment to cure this default at its option.", "No other HCP portfolios are at risk of termination in our opinion under the current contracts. Interestingly, from what we can see from the public disclosure of HCP, our Sunrise Managed Assets performed quite well and outperformed other operators at HCP property for the last several years on an NOI basis. ", "Adjusting for certain refunds and credits paid by Sunrise in 2008 to drive adjusted NOI, our HCP same property NOI increased 5.5% at 2009. Yes, occupancy was down 3%, but rate was up 4% and the expense statements accounted for the balance.", "Turning now to Ventas, our management contract with them have a combined performance termination test to permit Ventas to terminate our contract for all communities doing a targeted NOI if there was a failure by more than 25% of the communities we managed for them, we may have failed this test in 2009.", "Under the agreements, a 25% failure would also eliminate certain of our cure rights on the balance of the assets. We are working closely with Ventas today to restructure these contracts and have considered selling our joint venture interest in these assets to them.", "Item six is to contemplate our transition obligations primarily at the Fountains in Germany. At the Fountains, eight properties have moved over to the new operator and we expect a balance to occur between now and July.", "In Germany, our agreements require us to manage the properties through 2010 and diligently pursue to sell the assets. We have kept the German operating team in tact and continue to manage the properties and are obligated to pay any operating expenses that exceed revenues from the properties through the end of 2010.", "Item seven involves a larger recapitalization whereby we are looking to infuse capital into the business and eliminate portions of our remaining recourse obligations. This goes hand-in-hand with the steps outlined above and our overall goal of cost reduction becoming more profitable. Mark will update you on this in a moment.", "In addition to our restructuring program, we continue to focus on and respond to our asset management efforts. We have spotted a seasoned real estate veteran for our transaction team to run asset management and will work closely with our new heads of operation to create transparency for our capital partners. Group efforts commence with an ongoing review of our agreements in contracts to ensure we are and will continue to be compliant with their terms. ", "The goal of this mission is to increase revenue earnings and value in the real-estate. Techniques employed include utilizing our knowledge for managing our 400 assets to employ best in practice techniques across all of our properties, understanding keen differences in markets we operate, better understanding practices of our competitors and key distinctions in approach and formulating new business approaches to drive value and higher profitability.", "With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Greg. As Greg has just described, Sunrise is in the middle of a restructuring process which began with a focus on our balance sheet imperatives and importantly includes all of our operations.", "First, let me provide some detail on the state of our restructuring efforts. As you may recall, our board launched a strategic alternatives process two years ago which frankly has never ceased, I have said publicly and repeatedly that Sunrise must be recapitalized in some form and Greg\u2019s comments hopefully continue to point to the reasons why.", "Along with many other activities, we have looked at different recapitalization proposals; while none of these have been enacted, we are continuing this effort and we believe it\u2019s a necessary part of a going forward Sunrise. We have been making many changes throughout our organization over the past month which we believe are strengthening our team and will provide a foundation for future profitability; we are actually very excited about these changes.", "Both Julie and Greg just described the operation side of their responsibilities and as I\u2019ve discussed on our last earnings call, operations now reports directly to me. We are doing all we can to be sure we are the senior living employer of choice; we believe that this reputation over the years provided Sunrise with a great competitive edge.", "In recent weeks, people who previously left Sunrise for presumably greener pastures have happily found their way back to our meadows and we hope this continues. We are of course disappointed that we have not recovered the occupancy losses that we reported in the past quarters, but we are pleased that at least for now we have seen stability. We\u2019re also pleased that we do seem to be doing well versus the recently published NIC averages.", "We are the largest premium price provider in our segment, operating in the very difficult economy. We are encouraged that with this backdrop we are still able to continue growing rate and attracting customers who appreciate what has always made Sunrise the leader in Senior Living.", "Investors should remember that Sunrise is not a monolith. We operated markets with varying economic strength and as we outlined in our 10-K, the portfolios we manage are different as well. We generally enjoy a strong working relationship with our capital partners and we work hard to make that better and better.", "Let me size Ventas as a prime example of this. We have positives and shortcomings in this venture. The Ventas team is tough and vigilant in the oversight of their properties. However, we work together virtually on a daily basis to stay on track for producing increasingly positive results. Ventas is always careful to invest in our venture assets because they know that this always pays off in earnings and future value.", "Let me now take a few minutes to tell you specifically what we at Sunrise are focusing on, because again the reorganization of Sunrise has broadly two components, one is our financial restructuring and the other is operational. Those of us with operations leader roles which by the way includes me, Julie, Greg, our clinical team, our asset management team, communications, legal and sales and marketing have been and will continue to spend much of our time in the field. ", "We believe our style at Sunrise is both very hands-on and based on very open and frequent communications and feedback, and of course based on the mission that has sustained Sunrise for almost 30 years.", "Some of the initiatives that have come from this working relationship include simplifying our sales process, reinforcing our management ratio of eight communities for every director of operations to ensure close monitoring of results and the ability to react quickly to the market.", "Three, providing each region with the necessary support in clinical operations, sales and communications matters to ensure consistency and to provide the backup required for our important 24/7 business, enhancing our human resources team to both to recruiting, hiring and our evaluating practices. We are determined to have a very best team in Senior Living.", "We're insisting that when properly managed, our mission of championing the quality of life of our seniors is fully compatible with the expectations of responsible capital partners and we are identifying more ways to operate as efficiently and profitably if possible at all levels, all the while as we continue to provide consistent sector leading care.", "In addition, five people who report directly to me are entirely focused on driving these initiatives. They are our two new co-heads of operations, our head of care and clinical services and our head of sales and marketing along with our head of human resources.", "Our heads of operations are Sunrise veterans with both extensive field and capital partner portfolio experience. Our head of sales joined Sunrise with a long track record of success in multi-site operation. Our head of care and clinical services came to us through our Marriott acquisition many years ago and is a real gem in the Sunrise crown. And our head of human resources, who worked with me before brings an amazing level of dedication and professionalism to our 38,000 team member organization. ", "We continue to reorganize and right size the organization, which is a difficult, and in many cases a painful process, however, we hope that everyone understands that any organization must operate with a team that matches the current size and needs of the company. We\u2019re also undertaking many initiatives in 2010 to bolster occupancy and show that we continue to provide sector leading care and to demonstrate our appreciation of the vital contribution made by our team members.", "We\u2019re very focused on accelerating our moving pace in building a strong foundation, so that we may return to our industry leading occupancy position. I know many of you must be asking yourselves, when will we see the results of these changes? While I don't foresee a big jump in occupancy immediately, I do believe that if the economy remains stable that the efforts we have undertaken along with tight management controls and full transparency will lift results. 2010, we all expect to be a rebuilding year, but we stand both determined and very optimistic about Sunrise in the future.", "In summary, on this call, we have tried to consistently remind you that this is a great platform, but one with many embedded risks. We have a determined, and I'm happy to say thus far, a very successful de-risking team, but as always elements of this de-risking are out of our control. We\u2019re very exited about the strengths we have and very optimistic about the changes we are making. And while we don't see rebuilding as a quick process, we certainly think it will lead to a stronger and stronger company with stronger results.", "We have an extraordinary team of people who are working hard to build a very strong future for Sunrise and all of its stakeholders. And I want to take a minute to thank them for the efforts that they are expending 24/7 on behalf of all of our stakeholders.", "Now, I'd love to open the call for any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "This is Dan filling in for Jerry Doctrow. I guess the first question I have is, I'm trying to reconcile some comments from two different REITs that commented on Sunrise portfolios. One, had some pretty good comments about Sunrise performance and the other not so good comments about Sunrise performance. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences between those portfolios and just your general thoughts about the performance of those portfolios?", "Mark Ordan", "We were puzzled also by some of the things we heard, not actually on the part of Ventas, I think the comment that we made on the Ventas call were fairly straight forward and talked about the fact that we\u2019ve seen improvements in results in the Ventas portfolio and they commented rightly, so that we have terrific assets that look great and are very attractive to potential residents.", "So we are not surprised that we are seeing a lift in Ventas portfolio and as I mentioned before, we have a strong relationship and I think the numbers they reported and the attitude they used made sense to us and we are happy that we have the kind of relationship that we have.", "In the case of HCP, I would say over time their comments are always eloquent, but sometimes confusing. We see some sort of a pattern of different tone when we\u2019re in litigation or not in litigation. So it seems that when we are not in litigation, the comments are fairly positive and then suddenly they turned negative. There was an implication, as Greg pointed out in you\u2019re their comments that we underperformed our peers, yet in the numbers they provide, it seems we can\u2019t fully decide for what they report. But it seems that we actually outperformed, and so not really quite sure that\u2019s been the basis of that.", "We noticed that they comment on the difference in performance, but not performance, but the income they drive from Sunrise based on where LIBOR is which we also were confused about, so but that\u2019s an accounting question, I guess I would ask them.", "As I have said on many calls, we like the people at HCP and we regret the fact we are in litigation. Litigation in new to me in my career and we have done everything that we can do to end it and I think this is a perfect example here in litigation and suddenly the tone changes, every comments seems to change. I don\u2019t think the facts changed, but the tone seems to have changed. So I did scratch my head at the end of that call, as I guess you did too there.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Are there actual portfolio differences between the two, looks like quality differences, maybe not quality, but big differences in the size of the properties or locations?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, there are differences in size of the properties, but it consistently, since Sunrise, and no pride of authorship, and Sunrise took over the HCP portfolio, since HCP has been a partner of ours. NOI has consistently increased and it\u2019s been a strong performing portfolio. They are mostly Marriott built properties that are larger than a typical Sunrise mansion, but I would say that any property of capital partners investing responsibly in CapEx, those are great building that really could look terrific. It\u2019s been unfortunate that there has been less investment in that than we would like, but there is no reason that those properties shouldn\u2019t do very well and they have done well. ", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "I think I have a very broad question here, and I kind of sense from both the press release and the comments you\u2019ve made that you are getting more optimistic and more focused on the operations. So in terms of tone, are you still thinking -- and you said in the past is like a triage, if it is still triage or are you now moving more towards the recovery room, is the way you are thinking about the company or the turnaround, is that changing at all?", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah, it\u2019s both. I think the answer to that is yes. We are more optimistic, I mean just being straight by the fact, the list of things that we had to accomplish from a financial restructuring point of view has diminished and we\u2019ve done well and we hoped really on that lenders and partners would see that working with us was better than working against us and for the most part with the exception probably of HCP that seems to be the case.", "So we do feel better, Greg was absolutely right to point out that we still have many hurdles to get over and we can\u2019t be assured of our success in those and they are not immaterial. So, it will be a long time before we are completely out of triage, but I do think that the more you succeed at these things, I think the more you have a reputation for being straight shooters who are adding value.", "Certainly on the operations side, we are much more optimistic. We are optimistic because we see stability in the economy. We see continued demand for the Sunrise difference and we have a great group of managers who are working very closely with the field to make sure that we\u2019ve given the support they need. So, I think when you do things like that, it tends to payoff. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re immediate payoffs, but I do think that, we feel like we are in our rising tide if all else stays the same.", "Daniel Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "And just one real quick question on operations, do you need to add any back office systems or labor management service management computer systems to, I guess, improve your operational results, all things equal?", "Mark Ordan", "We are always looking at ways, there is no broad initiative that we have planned, that we think we need to plan to accomplish what you said, I think we are trying to improve our systems and we are constantly rolling out new systems. We recently added a new head of IT to our organization to help bolster our strength in that area. As I mentioned earlier, in the last several months, both in the field and in our corporate office, we have recruited some terrific new talent. We have also promoted new talent. More than anything Dan, I would say that what Sunrise has been doing and will continue to do is become more efficient. Make sure that we are spending our precious dollars very wisely.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). ", "Mark Ordan", "It seems that, Dan, you did such an effective job of asking the questions that are on people\u2019s mind that it looks like there are no other question, right? We\u2019ve been so comprehensive.", "Well, with that then, I thank everybody for taking the time out this morning and we will go back to building Sunrise and we thank you for your confidence in our company.

My name is Christie and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Bowe, Vice President of Communications for Health Care REIT. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bowe", "Thank you, Christie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's fourth quarter 2009 conference call. In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the company's website at www.hcreit.com.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we are holding a live webcast of today's call which may be accessed through the company's website as well. Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that projected results will be obtained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I would now like to turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, George.", "George Chapman", "Thanks Jim. Before discussing our successful efforts to position the company for the future, let me review a few 2009 highlights leaving the more detailed commentary to Scott Estes. First, in light of a difficult economic times, we were quite pleased with the one and three-year total stock holder returns of 12% and 21% respectively and our inclusion in the S&P 500 index in January of last year in ranking as one of the top ten total return performers for the decade. Among our rates we're also very gratifying to management. ", "Secondly, while the unsecured note markets remained effectively closed at least through to the first half in 2009, we were able to opportunistically raise nearly $1.3 billion of capital to $700 million of equity, $266 million of Freddie Mac secured debt at an average rate of 6% and so of non-core assets that generated over a $325 million of proceeds. ", "Thirdly, we completed gross investments in $717 million of which nearly 90% related to our preferred investments in combination senior housing facilities and customer focused medical facilities. But today I want to focus my remarks on what we've accomplished during the last several years to position and competing for success. As we've reported, we've taken advantage of these difficult economics times to restructure the balance sheet by enhancing liquidity, lengthening maturities and deleveraging. ", "With only a $140 million drawn against our $1.15 billion line of credit at the end of the last year and with that equity markets open, we are in a great position to take advantage of investment opportunities. We have also methodically positioned our portfolio and corporate infrastructure to meet the challenges ahead and to take advantage of opportunities even during the last several years of difficulties we chose to bolster our capabilities through to numerous key hires that are providing significant competitive advantages for Health Care REIT. ", "Our portfolio has proved to be quite resilient through these challenging times as our payment coverages at the property level remained at two to one. We continue to emphasize portfolio diversification as our top five and ten operators comprised only 24% and 37% of the portfolio respectively. We are also quite pleased with the performance of our medical office building portfolio that finished the year over 91% occupied with an average 2009 tenet retention rate of 75%. ", "You will recall that we acquired a two large MOB portfolios as well as our property management capabilities several years and embarked on a process to produce the best MOB portfolio as well as the best most talented property management company in the sector, and we've made great progress as we've added and are continuing to add modern larger customer focused MOB's medical office buildings while at the same time disposing off non-core medical office buildings. We are making great progress in reducing smaller unaffiliated off campus medical office buildings and expect that percentage to decline to 10% in another three to five years. We expect our occupancy to be at least at 93% by year end 2010 and on the management side, our personnel additions have strengthen an already strong property management group led by Mike Noto.", "As I mentioned earlier, we've been emphasizing investments in combination projects and senior housing and medical facilities that were customer friendly and all of them being appropriately real estate platforms for the future. At the same time, we've been very aggressive about disposing of non-core assets such as standalone, skilled nursing facilities, independent living facilities, assisted living facilities and certain medical office buildings even when the near term effect was somewhat dilutive. ", "Let me quickly summarize some of the changes that we've made in our portfolio during the last five years and expect to make in the next five. In 2005, freestanding skilled nursing were at 38% of our portfolio and at the end of 2009, it was down to 17%. We expect that percentage to be driven down to approximately 10% by the end of 2014. Our freestanding independent living, assisted living and dementia facilities stood at 26% of our portfolio in 2005 and were down to 8% at the end of 2009 and should move to about 5% by the end of 2014. ", "Our medical facilities that are comprised of medical office buildings and hospitals stood at 4% of our portfolio in 2005 and it were at 36% at the end of 2009, and should be in the 40% to 50% range by the end of 2014. As a part of this portfolio repositioning efforts, we have in the sense contains five years to seven years of portfolio repositioning into two with the effect that gains as well as loan losses and the impairments have been larger than normal for 2008 and 2009. We've been aggressive in writing down loans and investments even though our goal remains to collect a substantial portion of such amounts. In 2008 and 2009, we had a net gain of approximately $126 million when assets sales, impairments and losses are considered together. ", "We are now taking advantage of our positioning to grow our portfolio across the full spectrum of senior housing and healthcare. We believe our ability to invest knowledgeably across the full spectrum constitutes a tremendous competitive advantage, and being able to provide full services such as consulting, advising, development and property management in addition to being a capital partner are equally important. These advantages however can only be leveraged by a team of dedicated seasoned professionals who understand the needs who partner with operators and health systems.", "Let me be clear, apart from the inherent benefit of appropriate portfolio diversification, the obvious benefit of full spectrum investment is the expanded scope of investment opportunities. By being able to invest responsively in each segment, we can pursue the best risk reward opportunities as markets change. We entered 2010 focused on growth and we begun that process very effectively by being in the process of closing $568 million of investments including our portfolio of medical office buildings with our existing customers of were our health system. Senior housing assets with the capital senior living and our life sciences joint venture with Forest City. $490 million has been closed at this day.", "We are very pleased to expand our relationship with Aurora, an A rated not for profit health system with 13 hospitals and over 3,000 affiliated physicians in Wisconsin. This portfolio has an attractive initial yield of 9.1% and on a pro forma basis what immediately increased our overall medical office occupancy like 2% to 93% and our on campus and affiliated mix to 80% of the portfolio.

So as we enter 2010, we are very optimistic that our people and platform can and will drive strong investment volumes and earnings growth going forward.", "And with that, I'll now turn to John Thomas to expand on the Forest City investment and then John will turn the program over to Scott Estes, our CFO for a brief financial and portfolio overview. John?", "John Thomas", "Thank you, George. We are pleased to talk about our new strategic investment, the University Park at MIT and Cambridge, Massachusetts and our new partner Forest City Enterprises. Forest City developed University Park in cooperation with MIT over a 25 year period providing research and laboratory facilities for leading life science companies and healthcare institutions seeking a campus environment providing scientific and clinical collaboration and the successful commercialization of that research and that clinical work.

This $668 million joint venture includes all seven of cities [ph] wholly on life science buildings with two attached parking garages with more than 1,700 spaces. The joint venture was formed February 22 with approximately 1.2 million rentable square feet, 100% occupied and projected 2010 cash net operating income of $51 million.", "Please note $4.7 million of the projected NOI is contributed by the garages. The joint venture acquired 6 of the 7 buildings this past Monday, but these numbers are inclusive of the 7th building which we expect will be contributed in the second quarter.", "The average age of these buildings is 11 years and backing up the value of the garages the investment preferred is about $510 per rentable square foot well below today's replacement cost.", "The joint venture has no preferred or promoted returns to foresee the health care and the projected 51 million in net operating income is net of all ground lease payments to MIT and property management fees payable by the tenants to Forest City which will continue to manage the properties for the joint venture.", "Forest City will receive an annual asset management fee from the joint venture equal to 50 basis points of the net operating income for managing the joint venture the future annual increases subject to a CTI adjustment. The joint venture assumed $321 million of non-recourse debt with the weighted average interest rate of 7.1% and an average term of 4 years remaining.", "Forest City has maintained a 100% occupancy consistently for over 11 years and has renewed or released spaces then current market rates with minimal downturns. First innovation leases in place typically are 10 years with second generation at five years on average.", "All of these buildings have been very well maintained and are built out fully. Thus in the rare situations when space has been available new tenants have been able to move into ready space without additional tenant improvement cost or delay for build out. This is a very attractive asset for both investment and tenants alike.", "We are able to determine [ph] market and build our costs for new land space far in excess and typical landlord allowances in the market.

Thank you for your time.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, John, and good morning everybody. The company ended 2009 in a very strong position with a solid balance sheet, low leverage and liquidity that will provide important flexibility as we begin our next phase of growth. We\u2019ve continued to diversify and enhance the quality of assets is our portfolio, with most asset classes performing fairly well through year end 2009.", "Regarding investment activity, we completed $717 million of growth investments during 2009, including $209 million in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter acquisitions of $68 million included a skilled nursing property in LTAC and a master leased on campus medical office building at a blended initial yield of 8.3%.", "Turning to portfolio performance, I'll first review our development progress. For 2009, we originally anticipated $536 million of completions for the year, that ultimately delivered $734 million of new projects. We now have $660 million of projects under construction with only $212 million left to fund.", "Regarding lease up, approximately $185 million of our 2009 development completions were medical office buildings. Upon completion, these projects were 89% pre leased on average and moved directly to the stable portfolio.", "In addition I think we made good progress with our senior housing and hospital assets, stabilizing nearly $200 million during the year. In our stable portfolio all three of our senior housing asset classes generated occupancy improvements versus the prior quarter. ", "Sequential quarterly occupancy increased 60 basis points in our independent living portfolio, 80 basis points in our assisted living portfolio and 40 basis points in our skilled nursing portfolio.", "Payment coverage also remained strong, with results generally flat versus the prior quarter, with independent living at 1.27 times and assisted living at 1.58 times and skilled nursing at 2.29 times.", "Fourth quarter performance thus far suggest continued improvement in occupancy and steady payment coverage across the senior housing portfolio.", "I'll now provide an update on our entrance fee communities. We currently have 14 properties with $748 million investment balance as of December 31, representing 12% of the portfolio. Through December, two of these communities were still under construction, while the 12 open communities continue to meet revised entrance fee move-in budgets with 220 total move-ins versus a budget of 221 during 2009.", "During the fourth quarter, there were three additional entrance fee properties that converted from construction representing a total investment of $179 million. We are currently recognizing a blended rental yield of 7% on these recent conversions. And as a result for our 12 open communities with an investment balance of $590 million we continue to recognize an average yield of approximately 6%.", "Now turning to our Hospital and MOB portfolios; I can say that our hospitals continue to report stable to growing volumes in revenue as the increase in our stable payment coverage by 10 basis points sequentially to 2.47 times, and as George discussed our medical office portfolio also finished the year on a high note with occupancy increasing to over 91% and tenant retention of 87% through the quarter and 75% for the year.", "Overall, NOI for the year was $87.1 million while same-store NOI for the quarter was $20.8 million, down 1.3% year-over-year, but up 1.2% sequentially. I would also point out that we have less than 7% of portfolio leases expiring in 2010 and only 43% expiring over the next five years. Our same-store revenue growth as presented on page 23 of our supplement declined 2.4% in the fourth quarter. The decline is primarily a result of two specific factors.", "Now first the 13.9% decline we saw in our independent CCRC portfolio was again a result of the yield reduction of several entrance fee communities on a year-over-year basis. The second factor was the 0.3% decline we saw in our skilled nursing portfolio. This was a result of transitioning one small portfolio to a new operator plus the restructuring of another master lease portfolio and slightly lower yields compared to last year. Excluding the impact of these operators, fourth quarter same store IL/CCRC revenue increased 1.8%. Skilled nursing portfolio revenue increased 0.8% and our overall fourth quarter same-store revenue would increase nearly 1%. ", "I will turn now to financial results, fourth quarter normalized FFO of $0.75 per share and normalized FAD of $0.70 per share both declined 9% versus the previous year. As we mentioned last quarter, per share results were impacted by the nearly $1 billion in equity and debt capital rate throughout the year. I'll think more importantly fourth quarter FFO results were in line with consensus estimates and exceeded our published FFO guidance.", "Next I'd like to provide some additional detail on the non-recurring items that impacted fourth quarter results. As a reminder, these items are excluded from normalized FFO and FAD. First, we recognized $2.4 million of income from a prepayment fee associated with the pay-off of our first mortgage loan and two skilled nursing facilities. The loan repayment here reduced our overall loan portfolio by $33 million.", "Next, we reported a net gain of $16.5 million on fourth quarter dispositions which included a small scale nursing portfolio, two assisted living properties and several medical office buildings. During the quarter, we terminated a lease with the hospital operator. As part of this transaction, we recorded $8.1 million of fee income from the lease termination which was offset by an impairment of $10.3 million on the building which we continue to hold, resulting in a net loss of a little over $2 million. Overall, however this is a very positive outcome for us. I think as a result of this transaction; $32 million of loans were repaid in full [ph]. I would point out that these items are contained in discontinued operations as this building is now held for sale at yearend.", "We recorded an additional $13.1 million in impairments mainly related to five medical office buildings that were moved to help for sale during the fourth quarter. These buildings are generally not affiliated with the health system, are only 80% occupied and are fairly small in size averaging only 24,000 square feet. At this point, we now believe that we've completed the primary repositioning of the MOB portfolio, and do not expect any more impairments near term outside of minor potential sales price adjustment as these facilities are ultimately sold. ", "Last, we recognized the $23.1 million provision for loan losses that was primarily related to the write-off of loans to several early stage senior housing operators. Primarily as a result of the combination of $73 million in fourth quarter loan repayments and this write-off, our overall loan portfolio declined to $427 million at yearend representing only 7% of the portfolio. Our balance of loans on a non-accrual at year ended at $67 million with a loan loss reserve balance of $5.2 million. Additionally, I point out that the balance of the loans that we consider at risk has declined to $83 million compared to $123 million last quarter.", "As George discussed, we really have been focused on accelerating five to seven years of portfolio repositioning into the last several years. I think at yearend we take a more conservative approach regarding collectibility and valuation assumptions related to certain loans despite the short-term earnings impact. And at this point, we feel that we\u2019ve substantially taken care of the majority of problems in our loan portfolio as a result of these divisions.", "I think we're pleased with our overall repositioning efforts and believe the quality of our remaining loan portfolio is incrementally stronger. To further elaborate, $256 million of our $427 million current loan portfolio are loans to three of our strongest operators who all have a significant master lease to debt as well. The remaining $171 million generally consists of smaller loans with an average balance of approximately $5 million to $10 million each.", "I will now move on to our dividend. We recently paid the 155th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31st at $0.68 per share representing an annualized rate of $2.72. The Board of Directors also approved the 2010 quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.68 per share commencing with the May dividend. We did have a light quarter in terms of capital activity. There were no shares issued under the equity shelf program and we received $17 million from our dividend reinvestment program to the issuance of 400,000 shares at an average gross price of $43.21.", "I think our credit profile remains excellent with debt to undepreciated books cap at 35%. Interest in fixed charge coverage of 3.8 times and 3.1 times respectively, and net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA 4.5 times. Secured debt remained very low at only 9.8% of total assets at the end of the year.", "Finally a review of our 2010 guidance and assumptions. As detailed in the earnings release, we expect to report net income available to commons stockholders in a range of $1.43 to a $1.58 per diluted share. Normalized FFO in the range of $3.10 to $3.25 per diluted share and normalized FAD in a range to $2.87 to $3.02 per diluted share.", "I think given the significant capital we raised in 2009, but particularly the large equity offering completed last September, we believe that the fourth quarter of 2009 will be an inflexion point in terms of future earnings growth. I would note that our 2010 normalized FFO and FAD guidance represents 3% to 8% growth above fourth quarter annualized level. I think we're also very optimistic about our investment opportunities this year and it included $1 billion to $1.2 billion of growth investments in our forecast.", "This includes $700 million to $800 million of new investments and $300 million to $400 million of funded development. We also forecast development conversions of approximately $450 million which is heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect to continue enhancing our portfolio through non-core asset sales and project approximately $300 million of dispositions this year which are primarily comprised to freestanding skilled nursing assets.", "I would like to take a minute to discuss the accounting and reporting of our $668 million joint venture with Forest City Enterprises. Our total investment will be $327 million and will be listed as a new asset class under life sciences in our portfolio composition. Our pro forma for year-end, life sciences would represent approximately 5% of our investment portfolio. For the balance sheet, there will be an increase in equity investments of $170 million which will represent our cash investment in the joint venture.", "And the remaining $157 million of our investment which represents a pro rata share of the secured debt to be assumed by the joint venture will not show up on our balance sheet, but will be listed in our supplements. Regarding the income statement, we will record our share of the joint venture net income on our other income line.", "And now turning to our senior housing and hospital portfolios which represent 75% of our total investment balance, we're forecasting same store NOI growth of positive 2% in 2010 excluding again the impact of the deferrals previously discussed. ", "As a reminder roughly 70% of the leases in this portfolio are contingent on TPI growth and I do think this forecast could prove conservative to the extent TPI increases at a greater rate in 2010 as we have the right to recover loss due to the previous lack of TPI growth.", "Regarding our medical office portfolio, which represents the remaining 25% of our investment balance, we're pleased with our overall performance and are very optimistic about our future prospects and the quality of our portfolio. Only 349,000 square feet or 6.7% of the portfolio is rolling over in 2010 and we are forecasting solid tenant retention of at least 75% this year. Driven by the strong retention and leasing expectations in the existing portfolio plus the addition of the 122 million square foot Aurora portfolio which is a 100% occupied we expect to end 2010 with very strong occupancy of at least 93%.", "For the properties in our MOB portfolio as of December 31 we are forecasting NOI of $98 million. I think despite the strong retention in occupancy forecast we anticipate same store NOI will decline about 1% in 2010 and primary reason for this slight decline is the lease is signed through last year and expected to be signed this year are slightly below in placed rents in light of the economy and current market conditions. Finally, we do anticipate investing $17 million in capital expenditure and tenant improvement in MOB portfolio primarily to enhance our existing buildings, increasing leasing activity and maintain desired retention levels.", "Our G&A forecast is approximately $50 million for 2010. This includes $3 million in accelerated expensing of stock and options for certain officers and directors in the first quarter that\u2019s actually a $2.6 million one-time performance based stock award. As a result we expect to report G&A of approximately $14 million to $15 million in the first quarter and then expect the quarterly run rate of roughly $11 million to $12 million through the remainder of the year.", "Finally I will finish by taking a minute to discuss our capital plans for 2010 as we discuss we are projecting growth and investments of $1 billion to $1.2 billion this year and we currently anticipate financing these investment through a combination of the following. $300 million of asset sales, $85 million of secured debt through HUD, $60 million through our dividend reinvestment plan, $117 million of assumed debt through the Aurora and capital senior living acquisitions. The pro forma assumption of a $157 million in secured debt through our joint venture with Forest City and approximately $280 million to $480 million cash from their alliance. Based on the current $1 billion of cash in line of credit availability and only $25 million of debt maturities prior to year end 2011 we believe we are in an excellent capital position and should have sufficient liquidity to meet our current 2010 investment targets.", "With that, that concludes my report and operator I guess now we would like to open it up for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Ryu of Banc of America Merrill Lynch.", "Andrew Ryu - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Just to go to same-store revenue growth of minus 2.4 I just wanted to confirm the independent living CCRC rent deferral these are these all part of what was announced last quarter or is there something new incremental and new this quarter as well.", "Scott Estes", "No that\u2019s correct that\u2019s the same operator and same amount as last quarter. There\u2019s no change in that number. It will take obviously another couple of quarters through that to flow through the same store results.", "Andrew Ryu - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay and then for the skilled nursing that you guys also reported was impacted by the transition of one portfolio to new operator. How big the investment developer is for your skilled nursing portfolio and can you give us a little more color on that?", "Scott Estes", "Sure in the skilled nursing portfolio the slight decline there are two items as I mentioned the portfolio transition with a pretty small portfolio is a little bit less than $20 million and it was transferred actually out of bankruptcy last July and we now have a new 15 year mastered lease at lower rent than pre-bankruptcy level. So we are happy with the new operator is in place as a part of that transition but I guess slightly lower rents.", "And I think another example is the restructuring transaction. We actually were able to extend a $106 million master lease term by five years through these negotiations and provides us with an opportunity to acquire additional properties and actually wanted the property skilled nursing we did acquire in the fourth quarter is only one year old and has a very high quality mix I think its 60% in that asset so there is some positives to add to that transfer and just a slightly lower yield than last year.", "Andrew Ryu - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "And then switching gears to your disposition guidance of $300 million is there a particular asset type you are looking to dispose and can you guys guide us to what the timing is, is it going to be more like the first half of 2010 or do you think it goes like the second half.", "Scott Estes", "Sure again $300 million is the guidance. Its virtually at least 85% of the dispositions in our assumptions, their free standing skilled nursing assets and really the timing is roughly in the middle of the year. I think that\u2019s probably the best assumption and generally the degree of variance in our guidance really is continued upon ultimately their ability to get financing several trying to go through the HUD process which can take a long time. So that will be the color on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible) with Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was wondering if you can talk a bit more about your entries in life science and whether you see this latest acquisition as a one off or if you can see that space taking up a larger share of your portfolio in the long term.", "John Thomas", "This is John thanks for the question. No we see this as a strategic investment and initiative so I would not characterize it as a one off I think its about 5% of our total portfolio today and we look to grow that over time with Forest City and with our other medical center clients and new clients. So you know it will be a measured growth and strategic growth but now we continue, we do expect to grow it.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And would you look to develop as well.", "John Thomas", "We would in the right circumstances you know a lot of our development with our hospital systems are kind of 100% or largely pre-leased facilities and we would look to again to have conservative development metrics in place as we expand and develop.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And in terms of the JV itself there were 10 available life science buildings why were three of them excluded from this JV.", "John Thomas", "Really nine potentially available for the joint venture we acquired the joint venture acquired all of the wholly owned facilities that Forest City wholly owned. They have partners in two of the facilities and assets that we would like to acquire and may acquire some future date but today we start with the seven.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "On Forest City so basically right now you are basically a financial partner old you have plans to sort of grow your internal life science capabilities through hirings and what not over the next few years.", "John Thomas", "This is John Thomas. As a part of this acquisition one important thing to us was the experience and really the history and philosophy of Forest City and particularly their life sciences management team which is based in Cambridge and frankly couldn\u2019t have found a better fit and expertise. So I\u2019ve got experience we may grow experience internally and may add additional expertise inhouse but we partnered with excellent resources and team and they are dedicated team within the Forest City organization and as I mentioned based here in Cambridge so we expect to grow together with Forest City.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Alright but for the foreseeable future you are hanging your hat on their life science capabilities.", "John Thomas", "That\u2019s right in my own experience and we expect mutual client opportunities we\u2019ve got clients we expect to take them us to for development opportunities and acquisition opportunities.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. How broadly was this opportunity marketed to other potential bidders?", "John Thomas", "We don\u2019t know for sure but we do know Forest City was looking for a strategic partner as well and I think identified us as a through with their advisors identified us as a strategic partner. So if the joint ventures actively remains in a government structure where we are actively participating governance and continued management of the Cambridge facilities but again as I mentioned this is the future in working together with them.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "And just another $51 million you mentioned that\u2019s the total portfolio right?", "John Thomas", "That's the 7 buildings so one building will be added in\u2026", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "But not your share I mean.", "John Thomas", "No that\u2019s correct. That\u2019s the total joint venture. I would like to I made one slight correction in my prepared comments that half the management team at Forest City will assume [ph] for managing the joint venture is based upon the assets of the joint venture not net operating income.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And future growth with them would take on a similar form of joint venture type structure or would there be some sort of nuances the future transaction?", "John Thomas", "I think it'd be fair to say it would be the consistent structure into the joint venture, but each building each opportunity may take different forms but we would expect again keep it as simple as possible and coordinate the growth together.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, turning to more broader question aside of that for the guidance may be Scot to you the guidance range how much of it influence was the $1 and plus investment program on guidance in other words what would your guidance range or give me some color on in the absence of this heavy dose of acquisition activity for this year.", "Scott Estes", "I think Rich as we built the model and drive out the guidance of the year you probably the biggest factor going into the process was the equity we raised last year really going into the year lower run rate I think really its your starting point and then we are happy to grow that run rate via the acquisitions we made early in the year. I think the other factor that its impacting numbers really is the timing of those disposition. You know $300 million at 11% obviously is roughly $33 million of impact that they have [ph] in the first phase 0 if it happens in the last day of the year. So, we said in our guidance and I think that's kind of a picture how we started to build an ultimately what we came out with.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "But the vast a matter or all of the acquisition activity of $700 to $800 million I think you said would be immediately accretive in the first year.", "Scott Estes", "Kind of our generalization obviously yes we are not assuming any incremental capital from the deals that we are talking about here, but yes that the yields they are adding immediately to earnings once they come on.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "George when you went through your looks [ph] into 2015 what percentage of the portfolio do you think will be entrance fee and what percentage do you think will be pure hospital as opposed to the medical office component?", "George Chapman", "Rich I think said to the end of 2014, but entrance fees will probably be around 5% it will be my guess at this point given our growth and we\u2019ve always thought that larger combination facilities, we probably favor rental and we just add some opportunities to do a lot of entrance phase during the last two or three years, so we\u2019ve figure probably the combination would be much, much greater than entrance fees so we also I think entrance fees as I said before are going to be very valuable pieces of our portfolio.", "So I guess 4% or 5% by four or five years out. In terms of hospitals Rich we really couldn't say. I mean within that category of course we have (inaudible), we have IRS and a lot of other types of properties and part of that answer relates to how the medical facilities evolves increasingly MOBs are larger with more medical services within them. If that continues or if the bond markets come back to the hospitals and there is more stability in the revenue bonds but I'd say that the MOB growth would be the most significant than the hospitals but there are lot of variables. So John I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on that further.", "John Thomas", "No I think that\u2019s right and our things like global and the university medical center that were building out (inaudible) they are already projecting for the future growth I think a lot of the growth in the hospital investments will be with existing clients and going existing assets its hard to say how much that growth over time is. Our original project or investment that we developed last year with Hamas has substantial services included as (inaudible) mentioned so the hospital is really evolving to a large ambulatory care centers.", "George Chapman", "", "Rich the first one just picking up on your point John on the first (inaudible) last year you know we had a cancer center in an MOB connecting to the hospital and where one ends and the other begins is becoming increasingly interesting to watch its not unlike how senior housing has evolved where the different types account patients and different characteristics so again to answer the question we are certainly not shying away from doing a modern customer centric hospital, so especially those out in the suburbs and those that are branded by a great system that is forward-looking.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Right its getting blurry between the two.", "George Chapman", "This is something like you know.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo of UBS Securities.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS Securities", "Jim or George was there any opportunity to own a 100% of Life Science assets.", "John Thomas", "This is John Dustin I think the what Forest City was looking for was a strategic partner and a partner to grow with outside of Cambridge and so there was a discussion about it but again usually the joint venture decision was the best one for us.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS Securities", "Okay and then John can you also just dig a bit further into the various pieces behind the forecasted 4% to 5% NOI growth. I may have missed it but specifically what is these roll like over the next few years and where are the end placed rents relative to where you guys think the market rents are today?", "John Thomas", "Yeah the current market rents as it opposed to the existing facility and existing spaces in the $55 to $60 range, a lot of that is not built out. So as leases expire in the Forest City and the University Park range we expect those type of market rents to be available to the joint venture so, and again the competitive advantages leave building [ph] already built out and the lapse spaces is excellent, so tenants are looking for and trying to get into those buildings today so the near term expirations are they are not a lot of near term expirations but over the next 4 to 5 years there will be a measured amounts and market rent should be available.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS Securities", "I am sorry, so the market the current market rent is $55 to $60 and where are the end placements today?", "John Thomas", "I think the kind of the average across the portfolio is around $40.", "Dustin Pizzo - UBS Securities", "And then just finally George following up on some of the bigger picture questions for Life Science I know John talked a bit about the strategy for the platform longer term and I understand the attractiveness of capitalizing on the strength of the Forest City near term, but if I were a shareholder in HCN why should I be happy today with the minority interest in the portfolio that kind of essentially be externally managed by another public company when I could at the end of the day just going back in one of the other short Life Science but its not to say any additional management based on the full portfolio of the asset [ph].", "George Chapman", "I think there are a lot of reasons to be very supportive of this investment. One is relates to the quality of the real estate and I really hope that a number of fund managers and analysts get a chance to visit these are the premier Life Sciences some of the premier Life Science assets in the country and it is therefore consistent with goal of having the best quality real estate assets in the sector.", "Two, we have a strategy of big partners where some of the best academic medical centers in the country and clearly Life Sciences is a critical part of that. We do think that Forest City as a joint venture partner is very attractive and its not just in the Life Sciences area either. Forest City adds a lot of development expertise in the commercial area, in the residential area. And so it\u2019s not just expanding into health care and life sciences, it could well be that being able to have a Forest City join us in some of our ventures and in purchasing certain communities that we can really take advantage of what we have told the street is happening around the country, which is that multiple types of services are coming together in a village, in a community and we will have the ability to make some great investments together. We really had to evaluate one another, Forest City and Health Care REIT came to the conclusion that we think a lot alike about how we treat operators and tenants. We found that to be very positive. In terms of making sure that we could be involved in the critical decisions, we're going to be very active players with Forest City on the major decisions as well. John, you want to add any\u2026 ", "John Thomas ", "I think that again the attractiveness of these assets and these buildings and these tenants, as we mentioned, Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's Hospital's clinical operations are on this campus and we have other academic medical centers. We believe we will be attractive to again the life science community, the quality that's in University Park, and all of them, almost all of them are large publicly traded investment grade organizations, and they are looking for access to the academic medical centers and the clinical material and physicians and vice versa. ", "So, we think it's a very strategic growth initiative both for ambulatory care, medical office facilities and life sciences should be very attractive for our shareholders. ", "George Chapman", "So when you really come down to it, even though you raised the issue, the so called minority interest, we are protected from a governance standpoint and the advantages going forward far outweigh that concern in our minds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains of Morgan Keegan. ", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "John, I want to make sure I heard this right. The $51 million that's after the management fee?", "John Thomas", "The $51 million is, after property management fees which are paid to -- the tenant paid the property managements. The $51 million is net of those fees and net of the ground rent payable to MIT. It is not net of the asset management fee of 50 basis points, and again that is 50 basis points of the assets in the joint venture.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "And then this is where I got the decimal point from. The Aurora deal 9.1% cash yield, haven\u2019t heard a lot of folks talking about any kind of MOB deal for that sort of yield, is there anything different about this portfolio to get that type of yield?", "John Thomas", "Just persistence and growing the relationship with Aurora and with our partners Hammes in the joint venture. And you know, it\u2019s a large portfolio, Rob, a great portion of it is in Milwaukee and attached on campus and attached to their hospitals. Some of it is in some smaller buildings and some older buildings in the rural markets, but I think ultimately Aurora and Hammes were looking for a good partner. They needed to grow some of these facilities and we will work with them to grow these facilities over time, but other wise it's just a mutually beneficial relationship.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "Right, and it's on the press release that this is a joint venture, $192 million though is your slice?", "John Thomas", "That's all inclusive third of [ph] the joint venture. ", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "But the $192 million is your $192 million, the 9.1% yield will accrue to you, right?", "Scott Estes", "That's correct. ", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "And just in general, when you're looking at MOB investment opportunities, I'm assuming you're not seeing a lot of 9s out there?", "John Thomas", "Now I think the markets has been pretty strong for one building at a time, two buildings at a time. Some of those are trading in the 8s and even premiums to that, but for portfolios of this size, there just haven\u2019t been many opportunities and again hospital systems are looking for a relationship out of this investment of this size. Rob, so that's, we think these kind of opportunities, the one-off trades are priced in that 8 to 8.5 range and some are getting below eight today. ", "George Chapman", "Rob, but I think you should emphasize John's point about being a flexible partner and understanding the acute care business is telling here. We know that a lot of these facilities may need additions, may need to be reconfigured, may need new capital, and as we've talked at length, the acute care space is changing, the MOB space is changing. So I think the ability to interface with us and we have a pretty good feeling for where the acute care space is going, makes us hopefully a very good partner for Aurora.", "Rob Mains - Morgan Keegan", "And then George in your initial comments, when you talked about reducing your exposure to single function buildings and particularly skilled nursing, there\u2019s been a fair amount of speculation obviously about private equity sponsored skilled nursing that could be up for sale, some of it may be even Toledo and I just want to know kind of your appetite which preceded very high quality nursing home assets even if it is just sniff and nothing else combined with it. ", "George Chapman", "Rob, we are very supportive of the higher end standalone skilled nursing assets. We probably prefer sniffs in combination, but I think it was just fourth quarter we bought a brand new skilled nursing facility down in Texas I believe, and so we are not adverse to it. Now whether we would go after a whole portfolio or large portfolio, I really couldn't say. When we talk about what our plans are, and where we are going to go by 2014 about the time we think that's what's going to happen (inaudible) 2011, and the whole world changes and we have a great opportunity. And if you are talking about a quality company and a quality set of assets such as Toledo, then it would be hard to turn down a good investment and some thing like that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Co.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "Couple of quick questions back to the JV, thanks for giving us detail about expected NOI growth and on the lease roll, but to just to get to your overall, I think John you mentioned 9% to 10% IRR calculation on the deal, could you talk a little bit about assumptions you're making about exit value on the deal and also in regards to the long-term financing on it?", "John Thomas", "Our assumption again is a long-term role, but looking at about ten-year IRR assumption is going on or coming out cap rate about the same as the going in cap rate, that\u2019s how our model works, but again it's really the substantial growth in NOI over that ten-year period. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "What about on the funding side? Right now I think $170 million is just going to come from the line of credit, correct?", "Scott Estes", "That is correct. And we generally do that as a part of our overall capital plan where we think we are adequately capitalized given the aggregate investment volumes we see, but you should always expect us to consider raising capital, should we see an incremental amount of investment business from the levels there included in our guidance, which we do think is an opportunity.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "So just to make sure I'm getting this right, so you\u2019re kind of assuming the $170 million kind of space on the line of over that 10-year period to get the 9% to 10% IRR calculation?", "Scott Estes", "We are speaking big picture, you are talking about the specific IRR calculation. It's an unlevered IRR calculation. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "Just another quick question, on the 2010 guidance, you talk about new development funding of $300 million to $400 million, but when I look in the supplement on page two, when you talk about your development funding, there is a $168 million targeted for 2010. I might assume there\u2019s going to be more developments coming up in 2010?", "Scott Estes", "That is implied. You can see on the page two, Omotayo, that's right. There is a $168 million of funding from existing projects and given the guidance it would imply another $130 million to $230 million of fundings from projects that hadn\u2019t started at the beginning of the year. So we do expect and see some great development opportunities, but that would be a supplement to our acquisition growth which we think at this point will be more significant than additional development. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "And then on the development side, it\u2019d seem like in fourth quarter, you kind of had more conversions than I think you were expecting as of third quarter and even on the 2010 side, it seems like more conversions been moved into first quarter than what you were projecting last quarter? Could you talk a little bit about what's changing from that perspective?", "Scott Estes", "I think it is actually people focused on buildings. John, correct me if you feel differently, but are focused on the projects that are underway. There is not a lot of construction going on and you're seeing full attention in projects they are getting completed on time, on budget and often early. ", "John Thomas", "Yeah Omotayo, that's correct. We've got no shortage of contractors and subs available to work on these projects and most of them, actually all of them are moving ahead of schedule and also oddly enough because of favorable weather in the construction sites where we are actively working, so things have moved along very well in our development pipeline. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "That's helpful. And then on the skilled nursing side within your portfolio, could you talk a little bit about kind of the states you're in and any concerns you may have about Medicaid reimbursement going forward, given some of the states have cut Medicaid rather significantly?", "Scott Estes", "I'll try to take that one. I think our skilled nursing portfolio has been quite stable. If you look at our occupancy trend over the last really three years to five years it\u2019s been flat. If you look over five years again, we've received a lot of benefits from the favorable reimbursement environment, five, four and three years ago such that our coverage increased from about two times up to the current 2.3 and we were watching obviously I think you are entering a period where you may see Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement not quite match the rate of expense growth, but given the buffer in terms of coverage we are not spending a lot of time if any at all worrying about the coverage of risk in our skilled nursing portfolio. So we are watching like everybody else in regards to health, reform and again that's probably already there. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "And then just the last question before I hop off, fourth quarter operating trends, I know you mentioned that you thought they were stabilizing or getting better across many property types, can you give us a little bit more detail about what you are seeing with regards to improvement occupancies or rental rate increases?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. The comment was really in senior housing, so it would be on skilled nursing and generally somewhere in this 20 to 50 basis improvement range for all three, and recall [ph] 0 to 51 was between 0 and 30 was our preliminary guess, so it\u2019s basically flat up maybe half a percent through the first couple of months of what we received so far in the fourth quarter. And coverage would be that flat. ", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Co", "Are you seeing further improvement into January/February from the fourth quarter?", "Scott Estes", "We don't have that info, sorry (inaudible) things we received from our operators today, but if anything, one or two I think talked about would be our division. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo Securities. ", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "For your disposition guidance, how much of that is related tenant purchase options? I think it going to be one-off sales to third parties are the tenants\u2026", "Scott Estes", "There are skilled nursing operators, Todd, and I think a couple of them are purchase options. The key really is getting the financing on the other end is people would like to evaluate repurchasing the buildings that's generally been in our portfolio for a while and hence the free standing field nursing are generally fine with them refinancing (inaudible) if they are able to get it. So a couple of these I would say in general in size, there are two that are approximately $80 million to $100 million, that are skilled nursing portfolios that are contingent in timing and going through the high process in one case I know in particular. So, and then the rest of the other $100 million would generally be smaller pieces of assets. ", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Are you willing to provide seller financing on these to just facilitate the sales?", "George Chapman", "", "Not on these portfolios. ", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. And just with your guidance, do you have any debt repurchase activity included in the guidance?", "George Chapman ", "No. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. This is actually Dan Bernstein filling in for Jerry. I guess I had a question maybe everybody spoken about the JV, so I want to switch topics to the dividend policy and you may have addressed this earlier. I actually jumped on the call late. The dividend was kept flat with the current quarter and I guess we're trying to reconcile our thoughts with you're very positive about the acquisitions and stabilizations of some of the portfolios and development, but you didn't raise the dividend. So we want try to get some thoughts on your management board thoughts on why the dividend was kept flat and what that says about how you feel about the company?", "George Chapman", "", "I think that we are a little conservative in that regard. We knew we're going to have a pretty good year in terms of volume of investments, but also look at coverage, FFO and Fab and thought for now at least, we'd see how the year played out. I suppose even within this year that we can revaluate that record. I think that was a consensus view of the board and management it might just reflect our basic financial conservatism and we are certainly very optimistic about our ability to do excellent acquisitions and to a lesser degree really quality development. You shouldn\u2019t read any concerns into it, it's just perhaps our approach doing business. ", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "And historically, you've been in the low 80% I guess FFO payout ratio. Is that where you'd like to be going forward? It seems like you're higher than that now, and does that play part in the decision?", "George Chapman", "We had historically been in the low 80s as we see the market place evolve. We're going to have to evaluate exactly where we want to be. It's been a great change in the leverage percentages with a wide array of feelings about low leverage versus running at 45% or even as high as 50%. So, we'd like to check out all the, and look at it and come to a conclusion over the next quarter or two as to where we want to go and therefore, re-evaluate whether or not we should increase our dividend. ", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "That seems pretty reasonable to me. And the other question I had was on the development. And again you may have spoken about this earlier, you didn't list any development that was expected to come online in the out year spoke [ph] out 2012 to 2014. Are you strategically thinking about pulling back on development some versus acquisitions? It seems like that in some of your comments, but I might have missed the beginning where you talked about the overall strategy for development?", "George Chapman", "", "I believe that development is a critical part of our program going forward. We've talked about the changes in the acute care space, even at medical office buildings are changing dramatically, larger, more customer centric, more medical services, more one stop shop. We've talked about senior housing projects getting larger and better and more common space. So, it's going to be have to a critical part of anybody's portfolio if they are going to continue to have the most modern portfolio, but I think to some degree, the economics times allowed our development to become a higher percentage perhaps than we would have liked during the last year or two because we are a quarter, a third, a halfway through development, and you don't stop good developments.", "So, I think we've always had the approach and we maintain that development should be a key part of our future. We're going to continue doing that where we begun a new cancer center down in Florida. We're doing another high end medical office building out in California and we have others on the drawing boards, but I think that as Scott pointed out we have some great acquisitions and to the extent that we can focus on acquisitions, but not be concerned about proceeding with a great state-of-the-art development, so that's our approach to business. ", "Operator", "And will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Chapman for any closing remarks. ", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much.

My name is Tina and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Bowe, Vice President of Communications for Health Care REIT. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jim Bowe", "Thank you, Tina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's first quarter 2010 conference call. In the event you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed late yesterday afternoon, you may access it via the company's website at www.hcreit.com.", "I'd like to remind everyone that we are holding a live webcast of today's call which maybe accessed through the company's website as well. Certain statements made during this conference call maybe deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that projected results will be obtained.", "Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. I'd like to now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks. Please go ahead, George.", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Jim. This morning I will discuss our current portfolio and its performance, our success in positioning the portfolio to meet the needs of our customers going forward as well as the progress with our entrance fee communities. I will then focus on the growth platform that we have built. Our portfolio is strong and diverse with coverages of about two to one and our top five and 10 operators comprise only 25% and 37% of our portfolio respectively. More importantly in medical facilities that is hospital's medical office buildings and life science buildings have become a very significant part of the portfolio currently comprising 40%.", "We are establishing important relationships with health systems resulting in investments in modern customer-centric hospitals and medical office buildings and our life sciences and investments have added another property type that enhances our diversification as well as our offerings to health systems. Clearly these investments provide meaningful portfolio diversification as well as investment opportunity. We have acquired the Windrose and Rendina MOBs several years ago. We also acquired property management capabilities and we made it clear at that time that we will produce a very strong MOB portfolio and property management team. And we are very pleased with our progress in doing so. As we have culled through the MOB portfolio, eliminating smaller unaffiliated MOBs while at the same time investing in larger customer-friendly MOBs affiliated with excellent health systems.", "With our recent Aurora acquisition, our MOB occupancy now stands at 93%. The percentage of on-campus and affiliated MOBs was up to 80% and heading toward our near term goal of 90%. The average size of our MOB portfolio has increased from 39,000 square feet in 2006 to 52,000 square feet today and is continuing to increase. Generally we believe that MOBs will be even more critical elements in the health care sectors as health systems extend their reach and branding efforts through these facilities and also provide more health services such as outpatient surgery and testing. At that same time the facilities are better designed and focused on the customer. We believe that MOBs are generally favored by those healthcare reform that John will discuss later and have benefited from those dramatic shift to outpatient services.", "I might point out before leaving this topic as well that Mike noticed property management team has added key personal and is hitting on all cylinders. So we thank him and all of them for their efforts. In the senior housing sector, we are successful moving our facility mix from freestanding facilities to facilities that offer multiple services and place more emphasis on wellness. Our freestanding SNIPs skilled nursing facilities now comprise only 15.5% of the portfolio and could be as well as 12 to 13% by year end. Generally we believe we have a portfolio that is comprised of best-in-class assets that give us great confidence in future performance.", "Now that we will continue to position our portfolio to minimize the possibility of functional obsolescence and maximize performance and quality care. Let me say a few words about independent living facilities and CCRCs. It is clear at least on our portfolio and I think well supported nationally that occupancies and our independent living facilities are bottoming out and while CCRC fillip and sales are more complex, we are certainly seeing better volumes and fillips as well and with minimal development activity, we believe the favorable demand supply relationship should produce significant value in this space over the next several year.", "Scott Estes will share some additional information regarding our CCRC progress later in his remarks. But I would say that we are very pleased with our progress as an example our largest CCRC operator senior living communities has entrance fee and rental occupancies of 55% and 82% respectively inclusive of the newest CCRC that opened a month or so ago. Those operators being successful even in these tough markets because it pays close attention to every aspect of its business including running at terrific wellness program and a noted dementia program.", "I should note with endless CCRC space, there has been a change in our operator base. Relating to the acquisition of (inaudible) senior living communities and this was a beneficial transaction for all of us. As it allowed our largest operator to expand the Indus region and for Banyan [ph] it permitted its founder and principal to begin his retirement process, but continue to provide ongoing support and consulting for a period of time.", "We did incur an expense of $5 million that includes a balance of the development fees over to Banyan [ph] and all these termination fee paid for the value equated by Banyan [ph] as well as to facilitate the transaction. Let me turn to our growth platforms. In 2008 and 2009 when the economy was in some difficulty and when the capital markets were troublesome, we enhanced our capabilities through key hires and re-possession our structure and team for our competitive advantage.", "In 2009 we raised approximately $700 million of equity and $260 million of secured debt and as we enter 2010 we further improved our liquidity and lengthened our debt maturity through successful offerings of convertible debt and unsecured notes. We are quite pleased with our investment results year to date of $700 million. And as a result of this great start and our optimism regarding our ability to close additional attractive investments, we have increased the high end of our acquisition guidance by $200 million. We believe that our full spectrum investment platform, property management development capabilities and relationship approach to investing provide tremendous competitive advantages for Health Care REIT. The ability to pursue and capture investments across the whole spectrum does contribute to portfolio diversification, a full year focus for us. yet the other clear benefit is the expanded investment opportunity. By being capable of investing responsibly in each segment in each sector, we can select the best risk reward opportunities as markets change. So we remain enthusiastic about our ability to capture excellent new investments, driving strong earnings growth going forward.", "Now at this time I will turn to John Thomas, Head of our Medical Facilities Group to comment on healthcare reform and give you an update on our life sciences investments and in turn John will introduce Scott Estes, our CFO for a financial and portfolio review. John?", "John Thomas", "Thank you, George. Before I begin, we would like to recognize the dedicated members of the health care team located in international office. As many of you know the region has been devastated over the weekend by flooding. While our office and MOBs in the area are all fine, we have been able to and we both have been able to account all of our associates and they are fine. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them and the people of Nashville as they work through their painful losses and recovery. (Inaudible) healthcare reforms, the healthcare reform margin historically been we've been following the legislated discussions closely for over a year to access the information from a number of Washington insiders including members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, (inaudible) consultants and a close of Health Care REIT former Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tommy Thompson. We believe the new laws will have a favorable impact in our portfolio and opportunities for growth where we all agree with the years before you know with the laws of expense and exactly who has been affected most.", "Perhaps the best thing about the legislation for now is certainty and a move from debate toward implementation. I would like to take a few minutes to discuss specific implications on our portfolio. Medical office buildings in hospitals, we anticipate a continued evolution of medical office space away from office buildings towards larger ambulatory care centers. But it's not clear that there's will necessarily be a demand for more total office space. While Congress and the administration estimates $30 million more insured over the next five or 10 years, the number of positions is not changing.", "With the current and growing charge of divisions, hospitals will continue to recruit available physicians aggressively while striving to lower the cost of care continuum and thus more and more physicians will either be employed by hospitals or large groups that will contract the hospital systems. This should benefit Health Care REIT and reinforce our business strategy of aligning with larger academic medical centers and other hospital systems aggressively recruiting physicians.", "The loss reimbursement changes emphasize the relative performance and bundling demonstrations will strive to eliminate today's solidify care that's forcing greater cognitive care between providers and increased transparency. We believe this will lead to more comprehensive and more efficient out-patient and in-patient facilities aligned with other specialized facilities for the necessary patient care. Generally key care hospitals will work even harder to transition patients out of the general acute setting as quickly as possible and this will benefit our host to acute facilities particularly in patient rehab facilities and long-term acute care hospitals.", "Overtime is slight neutral where payment becomes more prevalent, we believe skilled nursing facilities will also become an even more integral part of the hospital as opposed to acute care settings. In the near term, the law directly benefits the large [Elpac] operators by continuing the extension of the [Elpac] moratorium for any new [Elpac] development until after December 31, 2011. Alpha, the [Elpac] industry trade group believes this may be the last expansion.", "There trends will have a significant impact on half the alignment strategies with physicians, in patient rehab, long-term acute care and skilled nursing facilities in and near the hospital campus. The hospital will control the bundle payment and have responsibility for both the financial and close result of care all of which is driving health care real estate development led by forward taking health system.", "For skilled nursing, the market basket will undergo productivity adjustments beginning in fiscal year 2012 and running through 2019. While negative, we anticipate these adjustments have a minimal impact on our lease coverage as our skilled nursing portfolio has as strong coverage before management fees of 3.4 to one times.", "In a positive development, the RevPAR payment system implement has been deluded to a fiscal 2012.", "The life sciences, the load of benefit near and long-term life science investments. The industry agreed to $80 billion in currency over 10 years and reimbursement but the (inaudible) correspond with a reduction in the Donut Hole in Medicare Part D aforementioned that part D is an effective and popular benefit increased long term certainty for the pharma industry. While 30 million more insurance may not lead to the demand for more immediate medical office space, Medicaid and near insurance products for the uninsured will provide prescription benefits and thus large volumes of sales.", "Biologics also received a new intellectual twelve year property protection which eliminated the long running concern over these important products and that promotes new sign development and investment. Doctor reformed did not open up the market for re-importation of more priced drugs. All these factors combine to drive more long-term R&D investment despite because the new taxes on the industry. And we believe continued growth of our life sciences facilities. We continue to see opportunities to provide life-science research and clinical trial and education facilities to our academic medical center partners.", "More and more hospitals are seeking up pharma to align with their researches and physicians on the campuses and we will have an excellent opportunity to acquire and develop these facilities to our new nursing growing number of health customer relationships.", "In summary health care reform has significant implications for our country and the health care REIT portfolio. As we believe there will be continued demand and more opportunities for new types of healthcare facilities. You can't assess the impact of the law without also evaluating the Medicaid expansion and the ability to state budgets to fund their portion of these programs.", "We will be watching those state budgets and otherwise keep well informed and evolve our portfolio accordingly. We are also monitoring the imaging powers and legislation discussions. Hospitals simply are the largest users of the utilities and the community and we will continue to assess the impact of energy legislation on our senior housing and hospital partners. We are already investing in people and solutions to help us deliver value added energy management and cost reduction strategies for our building and clients. We are charter members of the US Department of Energy Hospital Energy Alliance and have five projects under development that will qualify so at least leave a silver status consistent with our policy of building healthy and sustainable buildings. We will report on these legislative efforts and our proactive efforts to lower the energy calls of occupancy to our tender partners on future calls.", "For the life sciences now I'd like to give you a brief update on our life science joint venture with Forest City. The joint venture has moved forward in a very productive manner. We have been working (inaudible) accounting and property management systems while also looking for additional facilities to pursue with our Forest City partners. We recently had our first joint venture governance meeting, we have had a very productive review of all assets included in our joint venture as well as moving forward with plan to add the seventh university part building by mid May which would create an additional Health Care REIT investment of $28.3 million. We continue to look to expand our life science investments in a measured and conservative manner but have nothing more to report at this time.", "I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Estes and will be happy to answer any questions you may have later. Thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks John. Good morning everyone. As George mentioned we've been one of the most active REITs in our sector in terms of new investments. Our current portfolio performance has been steady through the economic downturn, while our liquidity, credit metrics and debt maturity schedule remain strong and put us in position to continue to grow the portfolio.", "Turning to the details of the quarter, we completed $585 million of growth investments which included the acquisition of medical office building leased to Aurora healthcare and our life sciences joint venture with Forest City Enterprises. We had $33 million of dispositions and loan payouts resulting in net new investment of $552 million. We also started two excellent development projects during the quarter, the first is 153,000 square foot, 72% pre-leased, on-campus medical office building in Murrieta, California providing such services as radiation oncology, cardiology and neurosurgery. This will be the only MOB on the campus that the HCN owned hospital sponsored by Loma Linda University Medical Center. Our second project is the 52,000 square foot 100% pre-leased medical office building that the cancer center on the campus is Tallahassee Memorial Hospital in Tallahassee, Florida.", "Including these new projects, we have only $193 million of unfunded development commitments and that we successfully delivered another $164 million of development during the first quarter. I'll now touch on the acquisitions which have closed or expected to close subsequent to quarter end. In April we completed two acquisitions of capital senior living totaling $85 million. This includes the previously announced $49 million portfolio consisting of five assisted living facilities in Nebraska and Iowa and then near $36 million portfolio consisting of three assisted living in dimension care facilities in Indiana. These assets are leased under a 15 year initial term at a starting rental yield of 8.25%. And lastly as John mentioned we do expect to close the seventh and final building in our life science (inaudible) with Forest City in May.", "Our expected investment of $28.3 million represents a 49% interest in its $58 million property and the joint venture will assume a little less than $30 million of secured debt on the property with the rate of 6.4%. Before turning the portfolio results I would take a moment to mention some of the changes we made to our sub-line and disclosure this quarter. First our income statement now includes the line in continuing operations labeled income from unconsolidated joint ventures and this represents our share of the university product life science joint venture net income. Second, in the investment in portfolio sections of the supplement, we report both independent living and assisted living properties under a combined senior housing category. We have also added some disclosure on our entrance fee communities that you can see on page 23 of the supplement. And last we have included additional disclosure regarding our life science investment on page 30 of the supplement.", "So turning now to the portfolio, as I mentioned we did complete a $164 million of development projects during the quarter which included one entrance fee property, one medical office building, one debenture care facility and four rental senior housing properties.", "Regarding lease up, we did see continued progress moving assets out of our unstable bucket with 7 properties moving to our stable portfolio this quarter. I note this three of the first quarter stabilizations were entrance fee communities which each have an aggregate occupancy in excess of 85%.", "For our senior housing and care portfolio, our performance remained steady and occupancy continued to improve versus the prior quarter. Our stable senior housing payment coverage comprised of the former IL and AL categories has been in a very tight range or in 1.5 times over the last eight quarters, while our stable senior housing occupancy for the quarter increased 20 basis points sequentially to 89.4%.", "Our skilled nursing has also performed well with stable payment coverage there consistently in a range right around 2.3 times over the last eight quarters and skilled nursing stable occupancy also improved by 40 basis points sequentially this quarter to 84.2%", "Now I would like to provide an update on our entrance fee communities. We currently have 14 properties with an investment balance $759 million at the end of March representing 11% of the portfolio. During the quarter, we completed the construction of one entrance fee property with an investment balance of $55 million on which we are currently recognizing the yield of 6%. The current rental yield for 13 open communities remains at blended 6%. And I point out that they were no adjustments made this quarter.", "We did expand our disclosure as I mentioned on page 23 of the supplement and there you can see that the aggregate entrance fee occupancy for our open facilities at the end of March was 46% while rental occupancy within these communities stayed 79%. We are pleased with the progress of our open communities as they continue to meet moving budgets. Year-to-date through April 23, we have had 66 entrance fee move-ins versus our budget of 64.", "You know in effort to get some additional perspective regarding historical occupancy trends here. If you look at the twelve entrance fee properties which have been opened since August of 2009. Total occupancy within these communities has increased from 50% to 62% through April of 2010. This was comprised on an increase in the entrance fee unit occupancy from 39% to 50% over this period and an increase in rental unit occupancy from 66% to 80% over this period. And most importantly I think as a result of these improvements we are able to move three of entrance fee properties to our stable portfolio this quarter.", "Now moving over to medical facilities, our hospitals continue to report stable performance with an eight basis point improvement in year-over-year payment coverage that is 2.3 times before management fees. Our medical office portfolio also had a solid quarter with an increase in occupancy to 93% and the strong quarterly retention rate of 93% as well.", "Our overall NOI for the first quarter was $27 million which is up 13% sequentially due to recent acquisitions and development completions. And thanks to our NOI for the quarter it was $19.9 million which was down 5% year-over-year, I would say this result was in alignment of our internal budget and we do continue to forecast same store NOI of approximately negative 1% for the full year. The first quarter really should be our weakest quarterly results as we expect same store NOI in a range of plus or minus 1% for each of the remaining three quarters of 2010.", "Last during the first quarter, we did spend $3.8 million in CapEx in our MOB portfolio and continue to anticipate $17 million for the full year. Our life science assets were in our portfolio for 38 days in the first quarter as we close the first six buildings in our joint venture with Forest City on February 22. Results are in line with underwritten expectations and we are pleased with the communication and information flow between our life science team, Forest City's executive management and their asset management group on the ground in Cambridge.", "Looking now at our same store revenue growth in our senior housing skill nursing and hospital portfolios as presented on page 23 of the supplement was a decline of 1.5% in the quarter. This was again a result of the yield reduction at several entrance fee communities on year-over-year basis along with two minor reductions in our skilled nursing portfolio due to some restructuring which occur in the second half of 2009", "Excluding the impact of these operators, same store senior housing revenue increased 2.4%, skilled nursing revenue increased 1.6% and overall same store revenue increased 1.9% for the quarter. We have actually seen some higher than budgeted increases thus far in 2010 generally driven by CTI increases which have been in 3% range for each of this first three months of the year. We do remain comfortable of our full year forecast for positive 2% same store NOI growth in our senior housing and care and hospital portfolios excluding the impact of the reductions previously discussed.", "Turning now to the financial results, we reported normalized FFO per share at $0.75 and normalized FAD per share of $0.70 for the quarter. Earnings results decline versus last year as anticipated due to the impact of the significant balance sheet de-leveraging completed during 2009.", "And now I would like to provide a few details and some of the normalizing and unusual items this quarter. The first is we did record a net gain of 6.7 million on first quarter dispositions which included two skilled nursing facilities and two medical office buildings and these sales generated growth proceeds of nearly $40 million for the quarter.", "Next as previously disclosed, we have repurchased $302 million of our existing convertible senior notes in the quarter which resulted in an $18 million debt extinguishment charge. Also during the quarter we recorded transaction cost of $7.7 million consisting of the $5 million lease termination fee that George discussed earlier and $2.7 million of acquisition cost associated with first quarter investment activity that are now required to be expensed and incurred. As a majority of these acquisition costs relate to debt prepayment fees in connection with our MOB portfolio acquisition.", "Our G&A expense was $16.8 million for the first quarter, slightly below the $17 million to $18 million first quarter guidance we provided on our last call. This includes $3.7 million of accelerated expensing of stock and options for certain employees and directors which normally occurs in the first quarter every year and the $2.9 million investing of our performance-based stock award.", "After the remaining three quarters of the year, we continue to expect the G&A run rate of approximately $11 million to $12 million. As we discussed on the last call the $2.9 million performance-based stock award would be excluded from our normalized results, this payments represents the performance based grand page that George Chapman for meeting performance based criteria over the year's 2007 to 2009. And this was the payment that was made at the discretion of the board in January this year and thus was expense when paid and we believe not appropriate part of our normalized quarterly results.", "And regarding our dividends we have recently declared the 156 consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended March 31 of $0.68 per share and which represents a rate of 2.72 annually.", "As I mentioned last quarter the board approved the 2010 quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.68 per share beginning with this quarter. In terms of capital activity I think our capital activity has been very positive as we successfully issued 342 million of 3% convertibles notes during the quarter which allowed us to repurchase portion of our existing four and three quarters convertible notes. By completing this transaction we extended approximately $300 million of near term debt maturities to release 2014 and reduce current cash interest expense. Now we also raised $300 million of unsecured senior notes that closed in April at an attractive 6.2% yield.", "As this transaction did close subsequent to quarter end on a pro forma basis on March 31 line of credit balance was reduced to 130 million. In terms of equity this quarter we received $16 million from our drift program to the issuance of $386,000 shares at an average gross price of 40 to 50 and we issued no shares under our equity shell program this quarter. Think our credit profile also remained strong, currently our debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio is 39%. Our interest in fixed charge coverage stands at 3.7 times and 3.0 times respectively. And net debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA is 5.4 times. Secured debt remains low at only 10.7% of total assets at the end of March.", "Last of this review our 2010 guidance and assumptions, we are increasing the high end of our acquisition guidance as George mentioned by $200 million this quarter as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities. This increase brings our growth investment guidance to a range of 1.0 to 1.4 billion for the full year. This includes $700 million to $1 billion of acquisition in joint venture investments and $300 million to $400 million of quantitative development.", "We continue to forecast $450 million of development conversions and $300 million this dispositions which will primarily consist a [free spending] skilled nursing assets. In addition, we expect that our previously announced secured debt transaction with HUD should close late in the second quarter generating $80 million of proceeds in an attractive rate of approximately 5%. As a result of our unsecured debt issuance April, we've lowered the high end of our normalized FFO and FAD guidance by $0.05. We now expect to report normalized FFO in a range of 310 to 320 per diluted share, and normalized that in the range of 287 to 297 per diluted share.", "Our expectation for net income available to common stock holders has been updated to range of $36 to $46 per diluted share as detailed in our press release. That concludes my prepared remarks. And I think operator we'd now like to open the call up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) First question will come from the line of Craig Schmidt with Banc of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Craig Schmidt - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Tell me your outlook for acquisitions, the total market for the remainder of 2010, I see that you have raised your upper end but now it is the four months that we have seen a good indication of activity for the rest of the year? Or do you actually expect the entire market to pick up in activity?", "George Chapman", "That's a difficult question to answer. We had a very good first quarter and I don't think that can be indicative of our year at least. Our benefit really comes from our full spectrum investing and John and his team are finding a lot of great health system related investments and Chuck side, Chuck Hermon side, we really cover the country and are finding our share of investments. So no cap rates are pretty low as frankly. There hasn't been much of an adjustment. So we have to work hard to find the right risk adjusted investment. So I mean I think people are working hard in our REIT and other REITs and others specialty lenders and there is a lot of competition, and I think we are going to get more than our share. I wouldn't want to say anything more at this stage.", "Craig Schmidt - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "And your acquisitions directors and they focus on a certain type of health care asset or they work the entire breadth of the area.", "George Chapman", "And Chuck is responsible for senior housing which encompasses independent living all the way through skilled nursing and more often than not, his team can end up finding investments that can be turned over to John's team and vice versa. It really is very much opportunistic. On the other hand, I would not at all be surprised to see as a gravity towards nearly 50-50 split over time between the medical facilities area on one hand and our senior housing on the other.", "But it is very much opportunistic. We are looking for good and very good buildings that are future oriented that take into account the customer preferences that are being asserted even more strongly as each year ensues. And we are looking for the best operators and the best health systems because we really found that by finding the good grade health systems that we want to bring the best care and by looking to operators who have a history of delivering cost effective attrition to services that we do pretty well.", "And one of the things we found is that we are 60 or more operators that are part of our sort of ongoing relationship groups in the senior housing that we have recurring business that some people may or may not have with good relationships with health systems. We think we will get recurring business but it is really hard to say exactly what ratio they will come under in the remainder of the year or for two year period. I think we are going to move towards about 50-50 split over time.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jay Haberman with Goldman Sachs.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "Just want to focus on the joint venture relationship or partnership that you have now at Forest City in the life sciences side. Can you speak to opportunities you mentioned looking for some acquisitions. I am just wondering, can you talk about your conversations with Forest City and perhaps what you are seeing at this point in the market, cause this is a fairly competitive landscape at this point I would say in that segment?", "John Thomas", "Jay this is John Thomas, I think that's the fair assumption about the market we are seeing some, the way our relationship works with Forest City is very collaborative we are not obligated to take the opportunities we find and vice versa but that is in fact how we're operating in the partnership really across the country and some of the major life science markets and communities. We are seeing some uptick in activity with kind of corporate campuses and again some hospital-related development opportunities. So we are seeing more activity in seeing some competitive things and again some of the things we are looking at our, I would say some one-off market and being brought to us by through our relationships", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs", "And I just want to switch back to senior housing for a moment in the CCRCs they clearly have been impacted by the downturn thus far, I know you have talked in the past about reducing your exposure but I am just wondering if you think this might be an opportunity in the next two and three years as you start to see the housing markets recover.", "George Chapman", "In my opening comments I think I have confirmed your view that we believe that our independent living and maybe to a lesser extent CCRCs will benefit from the uptick in the economy and the improving housing market and maybe more importantly the demand supply relationship. So we re bullish, on the other hand, we have to see our performance in our CCRC ranks and there is always a possibility that we will find an opportunity for one of our good operators or have an opportunity with another operator that we like to do something it can do a CCRC type of investment or something, we have got those at the right price and with the right operator and the right market. I can't say we wouldn't do that. But right now we are looking for performance and we will make those assessments as opportunities incur.", "Just I think a year or so ago, we purchased a distressed CCRC for Donald Thompson senior living communities at what we thought was $0.50 on the dollar and the fill up in the sales have been slow. It just hasn't anticipated but we think it was very good value. So we never say never.", "Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs ", "Okay lastly you didn't change the disposition guidance I mean should we take this is just not a good time to sell or why not take advantage of the capital on the sidelines and you will continue to reposition the portfolio in your underperforming assets.", "George Chapman", "Right now our disposition guidance remains the same, many of the folks that buy us out go to the agencies. The agency re-financings tend to move on very slowly. There are other ways to do those re-financing seems specially lenders, to some degree bonds and all of those take some time and we will also be by year-end whether or not they will get done.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "I guess the kind of make sure is it maybe semantics George but you said you're combing the market, 50% of your interest potentially could be in the MOB area. But the comment was made that maybe the office business would not see infiltration of interest from reform. It will be more on the ambulatory side, are you just using MOB as more of the broader term including the ambulatory care or how do you.", "George Chapman", "More and more (Inaudible) its hard to tell a difference doing it in most of our we probably prefer to have ASCs or Ambulatory Surgery Centers in most of our medical office buildings and today you can't even see the differences between the old 30,000 and 40,000 square foot MOBs without ASCs and today's so called MOBs that could be 150,000 or 250,000 square feet with an ASC with lowness, with full spectrum of testing, it's just night and day. John you want to add anything?", "John Thomas", "I would just add that we're using this somewhat generically to include early a 50-50 split from senior housing and chief medical including hospitals and life sciences as well. So again as George said before, it's really opportunistic and where we see the biggest, the best and kind of brightest opportunities been. The emerging opportunities across the spectrum and most of our development stars are exactly as George described larger on campus, ambulatory care centers that are very integral to them (inaudible).", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay I understood, want to clarify that. You mentioned also investment enthusiasm and its big team in this call today and how reform again getting back to that could play a positive role but it seems to me that's a very long-term factor and maybe the shorter term factor from an investment standpoint for you might be hospitals getting squeezed from Medicaid getting pull back on them and hence having to seek out third parties. Do you think that that's the right way to think about in terms of how you get involved in the near term, is it more of Medicaid squeezing phenomenon or is it really reform this year that will drive investment.", "John Thomas", "This is John again, across our portfolio in our government payer as part of our percentage of payer mixes is relatively low and Medicaid is even very small portion of that. So, again in the near term the opportunity is in the health system building larger building institutes capture the physicians supplied us out there and the higher quality physicians and again that's part of our life sciences thesis as well because those physicians are looking for not only clinical opportunities but research and clinical development opportunities as well. That's really the near-term but again as suite of Medicaid will have some impact on mid lower and skilled nursing but in longer term we see the up take picking up the hospital system is trying to attract the highest in best demographic patients.", "George Chapman", "We see the evolution, the change in Health Care is being the market driving different types of buildings real estate platforms, out patient surgeries today you get systems that are doing 60% or 65% in some systems out patient procedures as opposed to in-patient. With customers demanding different and better care and a better environment frankly the hospitals and the health systems have to build or substantially renovate to have better space to perform and that's where we position ourselves, wanted helps a little bit that some of the foundation's firms are down a bit because of the market. It hopes I guess that bonds have been somewhat less predictable the last two or three years for the systems. But maybe more important in the long run is our ability to go to systems and provide solutions and that can be development, it can be consultative, it can be managing the MOB to separate the hospital from any possible fraud and abuse issues and ultimately then to provide the funds and built of the new customer centric facilities. That is really the trend that we're on, just which is analogous to what we're doing in senior housing. So we're very bullish about our opportunity to make new investments.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Could you comment on your CapEx exposure for life science in the joint venture if its material?", "John Thomas", "No (inaudible) material, we have set a reserve for none of leases there, the tenants. These are more or like absolute net leases where we're responsible for kind of core and roof and that the tenant's responsible for everything else. We have an appropriate reserve there but in the long-term need and frankly most of the buildings are newer. We feel like we're being conservative but not a high exposure to CapEx there.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Unfunded development you mentioned $193 million of unfunded development commitments right now but that number grows right over the course of the year. So if you're considering $300 to $400 million new store. Where do you think that that unfunded development commitment number goes to over the course of the year?", "Scott Estes", "You're correct. It necessary to get to the $300 to $400 million guidance, it does imply a few new starts and I think we said we are selectively looking at development that again is supplement to our acquisition growth this year, so I guess its tough to take a number but probably maybe another $100 to $200 million is the number that would be necessary to get to the aggregate $300 million to $400 million of funding this year.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, so it's simple math really. And then finally you mentioned the housing market impact on CCRCs and senior housing, but can you make that same analogy to the entrance to the model? In another words are you willing to start looking at that area as a place to invest as you are with CCRCs in the more generic product.", "George Chapman", "We think the rental units are going to come back faster. Okay we think that there is real opportunity in the dementia space. And that's going to be more of our priority because we think its going to take our first. We will look very carefully at potential of buying opportunities but there are going to have to be awfully good for us to be looking at them seriously during the next quarter or so. But you never know.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi guys, first question just on the new construction to facilities that you broke ground on in the quarter. What's the impact of the economy having on your decision to break ground? Were these on schedule? Have they been delayed and what's the timing look like in the stuff you will break ground on for the remainder of the year?", "John Thomas", "The two medical office buildings we announced, one is cancer center on Tallahassee memorial campus. This is one where it's a 100% mass released to the hospital and you know frankly that the economy is allowing us to get building materials and other construction cost at lower than would have been two years ago. So its excellent timing from a cost perspective and the hospital systems related for small period of time. But really no expectation or there's no real impact in the economy on that project.", "The on campus building for low ma Linda is attached to the hospitals that we are building Loma Linda University of Medical Center, Murrieta. Very large projects again if you know California hospitals and hospital construction. You try and need as much outside of the hospital building yourself into medical office buildings today because of the hospice requirements and just a cost per foot of the hospital versus medical office building. And completion of that building near the same time as opening of the hospital is discreetly important and we've had tremendous success in pre leasing with positions, the hospital and other kind of institutional tenants in that building that are synergistic with the hospital there. So again, same result in the economy we were able to lower our budgeted cost on steel and concrete and other supplies and frankly in that community and providing a lot of jobs that or otherwise needed so we are very well received in that community.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "And Scott for the HUD financing you are expecting later this quarter, I think it started at $85 million. Could that come in still? Is that number moving around at all?", "Scott Estes ", "I think it's moving around a little bit Ted, I think we're pretty comfortable that 80 is going to be closer to the final number and right around the 5% range. That should happen we think right before the end of the second quarter.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "And how many skilled nursing facilities will secure that debt?", "Scott Estes", "Its fixed.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "And how long is that for, is that 10 year paper?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, it is.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Just a couple of quick questions. In the supplemental page, I believe the conversion estimates for 2Q 10, you mentioned that there is one fairly large CCRC project of $111 million and you haven't been able to determine the yield on yet?", "Scott Estes", "I will take that one Tayo, I think we are trying to be just more practical contractually that yield initially was scheduled to be 10% and that's how we were listening it in the supplement previously. And I think we have been pretty transparent in the likelihood that we think in a more like 6% it should be the average start rate for most of our entrance fee communities. And so until we actually determine the rate and its not finalized at this point we felt more appropriate just to be determined as opposed to higher unrealistic rate.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "But you do expect that kind of will come in around the 6% of all the others have been coming in at this point.", "Scott Estes ", "Our average is fixed and we still haven't finalized this one yet.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "That's the first things and then kind of thing about your growth strategy, one of the few companies, you are not only one now who is actively making acquisitions and you have also begun some development as well and your guidance seems to imply yet another $100 million to $200 million of development? I guess the way you are approaching things seems to be fairly different from what we have seen from some of your other counterparts except say maybe NHP in regards to how quickly you are moving versus your growth engines versus some people who think its still be a bit more gun shy, I don't know just curious you feel it's the right time to be as aggressive when some of your peers still seem to be backing off.", "George Chapman", "I want John and Scott to come on in this too but we've used virtually every down period, whether it was the old change to SNIP reimbursement years ago to this period, to really plan for additional acquisitions and development coming out, out of the bad period. So I think that we have done a pretty good job over the years of planning for being prepared to move forward and we have a lot over relationships both within the senior housing and the acute care space so that when we are ready to go, when we can alert our operators. And to that point they find great deals for us, I mean they are an important part of John and Chuck's marketing team if you will.", "And I think it's just as the ability to invest across a full spectrum to provide other services and because of the relationships that go back decades in some cases allows us to come out of the gate pretty quickly. We think there are some very good volumes there. We think we are building some awfully good facilities that will stand the test of time and so this has just been our approach to doing business I think its going to pay off very handsomely first. John you want to add-in.", "John Thomas", "I think I mentioned this in my comment as before, they certainly of health care reform has kind of unleashed hospitals to move forward projects that they had attended last year due to both the economy and trying to assess what the health care reform legislation is going to look like. So we had a fairly deep of a pipeline of projects that were somewhat on hold with the hospitals I mentioned the Tallahassee cancer center has somewhat been an example of that.", "And so again with certainly reformed the opening of the capital markets and still working with hospitals that see a necessity of moving forward more aggressively now, than they were six months ago.", "So we get its really very opportunistic and strong occupancy on the development and strong, strong yields in this market.", "Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company", "Okay just one other question, in regards to health care reform I would appreciate that if guys could touch a little bit on how you think bundling may end up impacting the post of acute care world especially with the [L-tax], and as well as skilled nursing if you are getting any indication of that at this point.", "John Thomas", "That's a great question I think the legislation has written is provided for demonstration projects that you know will last three to four years. I think the hospital system see some certainty that bundling will occur between the hospital and the (Inaudible) settings as I mentioned before. Certainly aligning within patient rehab aligning with long-term acute care and then over time reestablishing alignment with certain skilled nursing facilities as well, the bonding will take a few years to work to do demonstrations but, again the people primarily, depending our office of the legislation believe in bundling is a future necessity of controlling both the cost of care but quality of care. And so hospital systems are seeing that necessity and trying to align with those both acute care providers. As I mentioned before, side servicing neutrality is build within a concept of bundling about the payment systems where if the patient could be treated in and in patient rehab for long-term acute care facility or skill nursing facility eventually decide a service neutrality will pay each of those three facilities the same amount for that patient something that the skill nursing facility has been pushing forward for sometime and has some success in establishing that as a long term objective of the reform legislation.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael (inaudible) with AIG Asset Management.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Just of the due disclosure on page 23 of supplemental, could you give us a sense as to the thought process one around, up the one of breaking out since the (inaudible) and to removing the interest fee portfolio. And then also the coverage metrics of the operator level basis other than due disclosure, can you tell us what that would have been maybe 4Q and then 4Q of last year?", "Scott Estes", "You're breaking up a little bit I think I got the gist of your question. In regards to our decision to consolidate the (inaudible) buckets into the senior housing methodology, if you look at it, it's actually about 80% of our assets there, our combination thereof, so and it's generally similar disclosure in the industry. I think you can look a few pages later we did give the restated trends on senior housing. You can see the trailing results on a combined basis, over a number of quarters and to answer your coverage question, I think coverage is down one or two basis points sequentially this quarter in the senior housing area.", "Unidentified Analyst ", "And then just of the equity interest investments on consolidated JVs. You reported the $298 million, how is that flowing through to the balance sheet in terms of where does it be accounted for because the equity investments are actually showing 165 of (inaudible)?", "Scott Estes", "Right and the equity investment line is our equity component is about $160 million is new year there this quarter and these secured debt is about $142 million and that is off balance sheet but disclosed elsewhere in the supplement.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "This is Dan Bernstein going in for Jerry. I wanted to go back to the deferred rent on the lease up properties. Now that you have disclosed in the occupancy and the entrance CCRC, do you have a general range of where that occupancy has to go before your operators will feel comfortable payment the deferred rent?", "Scott Estes", "I think the perspective there as we look at that, you have to look at the aggregate portfolio with each operator but if you look at an individual facility and the decision to stabilize the three entrance fees that were stabilized this quarter all have over 85% occupancy. Once we get to that 80% aggregate occupancy we think you can support a rental yield of at least 8%. So that maybe a metric you could think of in terms of watching aggregate occupancy in terms of our ability to potentially start to recover some of these deferred rents over time.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "And also want a more general question on the acquisitions, are you seeing any pick up in interest from the health systems to monetize our assets post healthcare reform?", "John Thomas", "I would say yes, there was not a lot of system monetization last year but I think fair to say we're in discussions with a number of health systems today looking for either monetizing existing assets or looking at refinancing in new and different ways for begin to move forth with existing projects that they put on hold standing legislation but the number of calls and the number of hour, the amount of activity has increased dramatically over the last 90 days.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "Is it mostly focused on MOBs, are they also looking to sell part of their hospital campus (inaudible).", "John Thomas", "Yeah I think we're very reluctant to sell hospitals that are looking at alternative financing for either hospital expansions or new hospitals. (Inaudible) bond market is still somewhat a disruption and again I think they are looking for different and creative ways to finance their hospital expansions but on the post acute care facilities again, many of them are aligning with operators. Fair to say all of our operators are working hard to joint venture or otherwise establish relationships with hospitals systems, in a kind of bundled environment or future so there is more monetization and development opportunity for hospitals in that context.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel Nicolaus", "And George you mentioned that pricing is kind of a low for acquisitions. Do you see the cap rates coming down at all over the next say 12 months given where cost of capital is today?", "George Chapman", "It's been really difficult to figure out how cost of capital and cap rates relate if at all during the last some of these periods of exuberance, irrational or otherwise so that's hard to answer. I do not see cap rates going up at all. There is a lot of competition out there and I am glad we have a very broad reach to be and a great", "Relationships formed over many years or this could be a fairly difficult senior housing acquisition marketplace.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from the line Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael Mueller - JPMorgan", "Actually most of my questions have been answered but just one in terms of just the presentation of normalized FFO. You have acquisition in the guidance but doesn't appear that you're putting the acquisition cost or factoring that into normalized FFO. Two questions, number one what you see is a general rule of thumb for the acquisition cost on a go forward basis and then secondly, why are you guys excluding that from normalized FFO.", "Scott Estes", "I think you know this is the first quarter you're required to expense these transaction acquisition costs as they are incurred. And I think if we said the majority of the cost this quarter were actually related to buying back the debt associated with this or Aurora portfolio and some of those charges. So, exclusive of that, I don't the numbers is very large and we'll basically will provide it for you, we'll break it out and is very hard to predict because we don't know what we're going to have from quarter-to-quarter if any and we'll continue to disclose it and in our opinion we'll back it out of normalized numbers. No additional costs there are included in our guidance.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from the line of Dustin Pizzo with UBS", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "Hi Ross Nussbaum here with Dustin. I am looking for a supplemental on page six of the balance sheet, can you help me get my arms around the $78 million of loan receivable that's on non-accrual. What's going to be resolution of that?", "John Thomas", "The number is least over the last year so has remained at about that level. And I think we are providing everybody get in general disclosure on our loan portfolio. If you look at our loan portfolio in aggregate it's down about 6% or 7% of our whole company. It's $444 million this quarter, as we said there is actually three of our operators that are in our Top 10 actually make up about $260 million of that $444 million total about 60% of that. And we are very comfortable with those loans. And of the rest, really, what's happened over the last year, we generally get our hands full of loans the primary composition of the loans that are on non-accrual or the early stage senior housing operators, more the independent living or have a sale component to them and the number really hasn't changed too much.", "So I guess as you do your quarterly accrual investment and lone lost reserve analysis it's really contingent upon forward-looking and looking out often times as many as five to seven years to assess the value of those loans. And we think we are being conservative by not accruing any interest there and unfortunately take a little bit of time and to assess the ultimate value of the principal there. So we choose to put them on non-accrual and as those sales in projects will take some time to revolve that's why it stated at the level it has been there for a while.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "I wonder those loans technically mature.", "George Chapman", "I don't have the average for that in front me, you guys know that?", "John Thomas", "No I have to get that one for you.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "I think where I am going with this is it would be great if we could get a page on the supplemental that maybe raise out the credit staffs for that loan receivable category did go through, what's the debt service coverage, what's the loan to value, what rate again, when do they mature? What's in there because other than that one number on the balance sheet there is really no disclosure on it?", "George Chapman", "We received the question and I guess I just pointed out that it is 1% of the portfolio but we do receive questions so we try to evaluate that as best we can.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Chapman for closing remarks.", "George Chapman", "Thank you for your participation and note that Scott will be available today for any follow-up questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's teleconference. You may all disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Miller", "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT\u2019s second quarter 2010 conference call.

With that, I will turn the call over to George Chapman, our Chairman, CEO and President, George.", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much, Jeff, good morning. Needless to say, the Management Team was quite pleased with our quarter. We\u2019re on track to record the highest annual investment volume in our history. We are also very pleased to announce the partnership with Merrill Gardens. As you know, in the last couple of years, we\u2019ve managed the company in a conservative fashion during the capital-constrained downturns in the economy. Yet, even during that time as we reported, we used this time to strengthen all of our capabilities and add key personnel. We also maintained dialogue with excellent, existing and new operators in health systems as we awaited economic improvement and reasonably-priced capital.", "And now, we\u2019re here. And we\u2019re pleased that our investment platform is operating as planned. We now expect to make investments in excess of $2 billion this year, with strong investment performance continuing in 2011 and beyond. In turn, these investments should drive, and are driving, significant earnings growth as well. And we are quite pleased to raise our dividend and would expect continued increases going forward. Not surprisingly this morning, our primary focus will be on our investment success, as well as the reasons for the success and the reasons for our confidence going forward.", "In virtually every call, I have emphasized the critical importance of our full-spectrum investment platform. This platform permits us to knowledgeably invest in facilities from early stage senior housing to hospitals. In doing so, we can pick the best risk reward, the best projects, the best operators. We are capable of doing so due to our team that has expertise across that entire spectrum. We benefit as well from our development and property management capabilities that permit us to provide solutions to operators and systems. In short, we are much more than simply a capital source.", "They key to our success continues to be our relationship approach to investing. We looked back at our five years and found that 80% or more of our investments came from existing relationships, off-market opportunities. We know the operators and systems and have confidence in their ability to deliver quality care in an efficient manner. They know our commitment and in turn to them, in our flexibility. Moreover, they have witnessed, firsthand, our ability to add value to their projects and programs. And you should note that we, regularly, add new operators to our relationship programs.", "Due to this relationship approach, we generally do not need to pursue auction transactions to make our year. We believe that too often, these situations tend to price at high levels and do not necessarily engender the relationships that produce future success. Moreover, these large transactions entail concentration risk which we work hard to avoid.", "Year after year, we have recurring business with our operator and health system base and that provides a predictable, high level of investment support, while maintaining our sector-best diversification. Last night, we are very pleased to announce our expanded, deepened relationship with Merrill Gardens. Our $817 million, 38-community venture with Merrill Gardens has all of that element we believe are important for any greater (ph) partnership, first-class operator, quality real estate in attractive markets, greater growth potential than our typical rental escalators and a very strong alignment of interest.", "In this case, we have been doing business with Bill Patent (ph) and his team for nearly 15 years. They have operated in good and bad times and have the seasoning that comes from those experiences. The real estate is high quality and, generally, in a high (ph) entry markets in Washington and California. And we believe that this should provide strong pricing power as the economy continues to improve. Moreover, with our 80/20 ownership structure at HCN\u2019s (ph) and Merrill Gardens interests are very well aligned. This is a venture, we believe, should provide excellent growth opportunities for both of us going forward.", "I\u2019m also confident that beyond the Merrill Gardens transaction, we will continue to develop or expand the relationships with other high-quality operators and systems. Some will be in the radio structure, others won\u2019t. But in all cases, those relationships are important due to the quality of operator and assets. They also provide, will provide, future portfolio of growth opportunities as well.", "Our investment activity has only enhanced our portfolio performance. Let me give you some data points. At the end of the second quarter, approximately 75% of our portfolio-committed balances were co-termination facilities and senior housing space and modern customer-focused medical office buildings and cube-care facilities. These numbers should approach 80% by year end. On the other hand, Freestanding skilled nursing and Freestanding senior housing facilities are now down to 14 \u00bd % and 5.1% of our total assets, respectively.", "And we expect the freestanding skill nursing to be in the 12% range, area, by year end. Very importantly, after Merrill Gardens closing, our private-pay percentage was up to 73%. We\u2019ve also maintained our historical commitment to portfolio diversification with our top five and 10 operators comprising only 24% and 36% respectively of the portfolio. And I should point out that after the Merrill Gardens investment, Merrill Gardens becomes our largest operator at 8.8% of the portfolio and our top five and 10 operators comprise only 28% and 40% respectively of the portfolio, but they\u2019re still the best in sector diversification. Our facility coverage split at two at .03 to 1 the highest coverage in our history. Entrance fee momentum is picking up with the expectation of rate increases beginning in 2011. And our medical office building occupancy remained at a sector-high of 93%.", "I want to put our program and performs in a historical perspective for everybody. I looked back at my comments from May 2007. In a call, I\u2019m referring to our shadow pipeline of $2 billion. The vast majority of which were in the long-term care space. I suggested then that as our medical facilities platform was strengthened, the pipeline would become even stronger and more certain. And now after a couple of years of tough economic times, we entered 2010 with optimism and an even better platform due to key personnel additions and a strong medical facilities team. And today, the platform is working.", "Today, our so called shadow pipelines stands at approximately $6 billion. Within that pipeline, approximately 60% are senior housing and 40% are medical facilities, more than 80% of acquisitions. While there is no certainty that we will close all, or even substantially, all of the transactions in such pipeline, our success with our relationship program does enhance the possibilities of substantial, additional investments going forward.", "Today, because of the focus on our strong investment strategy and our success, I\u2019m going to, first, turn the call over to Chuck Herman who was Head of our Senior Housing Group and then John Thomas, Head of the Medical Facilities Group, to provide more in depth information and color on their spaces. Then the discussion will be turned over to Scott Estes, who will review our financial results, and Chuck.", "Charles Herman", "Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide an update on the senior housing and care investment environment, our deal at pipeline and portfolio performance.", "Health Care REIT is known for its strong investment platform. Our senior housing team is topnotch and well net worth. We are in leadership positions in the industry trade associations and are viewed as a partner by many companies in the sector. We currently have over 51 active senior housing in long-term care operators in our portfolio because of our reputation as a partner, we are able to leverage those relationships into a very strong deal-sourcing network.", "Historically, over 80% of our transactions were off-market. One of our very strong relationships is the one with Merrill Gardens. George has already discussed the recent venture. We have worked with Merrill Gardens since the late \u201890s, when they took over the portfolio of assets that were at least to another operator. Since that time, we have completed several others successful transactions and developed a very strong relationship. We look forward to continuing that great relationship in the future with Merrill Gardens.", "Currently, we have a very robust investment pipeline in Senior Living. We\u2019re actually reviewing our 3.5 billion of new Senior Living in Care transactions with close to 90% being acquisitions. We are finding that many companies are looking for long-term financial partners with good reputations versus just chasing the lowest priced capital.", "Health Care REIT is very well-positioned to help companies recapitalized or provide growth capital for the futures. Since we are well capitalized and are known as a good partner, we have added six new relationships in the last year or so, with several more relationship in the works. This new relationships along with our existing ones have allowed us to be in track to have our highest investment volume in the company\u2019s history.", "Currently, there are two active sources of capital for the Senior Housing and Care industry, REIT and GSCs. We feel that the limited amount of capital in the marketplace as is a good time for knowledgeable investors to be active. The fundamentals of the Senior Housing and Care industry have held recently firm and there are strong demographic trends.", "We believe the current environment, with the current environment, it\u2019s an ideal time for us to invest. In order to cash your high quality assisted living, independent living and combination assets, we are finding cap rates need to be in the mid 7 to mid 8% range and skilled nursing home cap rates need to be in the low double digits to meet teams (ph) depending upon the quality of the asset.", "Turning to portfolio performance, at the end of the second quarter, our Senior Housing and Care portfolio included 445 properties within investment balances, 4.1 billion. Our Senior Housing portfolio continues to perform well with payment carriage of 1.5 times and occupancy of 89%. Same store results were as expected with city payment coverage and a 70-basis point increase in occupancy versus last year.", "Our Skilled Nursing Home portfolio payment coverage increased to 2.3 times, which was the highest level in the company\u2019s history.", "On the same store basis, coverage and occupancy increased seven basis points and 40 basis points respectively.", "Regarding lease up, we are starting to see an increase in monthly absorption rate at our communities. We give you some perspective. Our average rate of fill-up had nearly doubled this year to 3.6 residents per month per community versus last year\u2019s average of 2.0 residents per month.", "At the end of June, our entrance fee portfolio included 13 communities within investment balance of 651 million representing 9% of the total portfolio.", "With the new investment activity that is anticipated, we expect pension fees communities to account for approximately only 8% of the total portfolio by year end. The current aggregate rental yields were at the 13 open communities\u2019 remains at approximately 6%.", "Most importantly, we expect to be able to receive higher yield commencing in 2011.", "There is nice progress in the fill-up of these communities. The entrance fee component increased 49%, up 3% quarter over quarter, while the same store (inaudible) component increased 3% to 82% occupancy. The aggregate entrance fee move-ins year-to-date through July 2nd totaled 107 versus our budget of 98.", "It should be noted that the reported rental occupancy of 79% in our supplement, reflects the fact that we added 48 new rental units during the quarter.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Thomas to discuss the medical facility. John?", "John Thomas", "So, thank you. Good morning. Like for Senior Housing, the medical facility side is also seeing excellent activity and momentum. Some of which is driven by healthcare reform legislation. The impact of the legislation continues to evolve as providers in the market analyze the legislation and plan for the implications.", "The pace of health systems beginning new development projects, both in-patient and outpatient has accelerated. As evidenced by the number of health systems talking to us directly or indirectly through our development partners and the number of RPs for new projects hitting the market.", "The paces of modernization and efforts to raise capital have also increased by providers and developers alike. Like Senior Housing, we are managing a very active pipeline of medical office buildings, hospitals, and lifetime opportunities of nearly $2.5 billion. With at least 2/3 or 1.8 billion in potential acquisitions and 1.3 or 700 million in new development projects for leading healthcare systems.", "The competition for high quality, high occupancy facility has increased but we\u2019ve been able to maintain appropriate pricing discipline and remain very competitive.", "During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of two medical office buildings. One, 85% occupied on campus with major healthcare system and another affiliated and anchored by leading healthcare system that is 100% occupied. This brings our total 2010 annual (inaudible) investments to 213 million in 19 properties, a total of 1.3 million square feet with an overall occupancy of 98% and initial average yield of approximately 9%.", "Also during the second quarter, we began construction of an in-patient rehab hospital for a joint venture between Harris Methodist Hospital and Sincere (ph) on the Harris Methodist Hospital Campus in Fort Worth, Texas.", "We also began two free standing emergency room ambulatory care centers for a leading healthcare system in the Pacific Northwest with one of our development partners.", "Turning to a general update on our portfolio, payment coverage for our same store hospitals saw a strong 45 basis point increase in year-over-year payment coverage to 2.8 times before management fees. This is largely driven by largest (inaudible) in-patient rehab hospital operators, which saw significant year-over-year and sequential increase in coverage.", "Our medical office portfolio had another strong quarter with the occupancy of 93% and a solid year-to-date retention of 83%.", "Overall, NOI continues to increase of 9% quarter over quarter to 29.5 million to quarter as a result of our acquisitions and very positive leasing activity lead by (inaudible).", "We continue to expect the occupancy above 93% at year end and a full year retention rate of approximately 75 to 80%. Same store NOI increased 0.2% versus the second quarter last year and was up 2.2 sequentially. It was a nice improvement and was a bit above internal forecast.", "Also there in the second quarter, we invested 5 million in CapEx bringing our year-to-date total to $8.8 million.", "In Life Sciences, we closed on the seventh building through our joint venture with Forest city on June 30th. We now have more than 353 million invested through our joint venture with Forest City. Our Life Science investment is performing in line with Forest City\u2019s projections and our underwriting assumptions and we are seeing very positive data on the current market price.", "We remain very pleased with performance of Forest City\u2019s Life Science property management and development team and the property management services to our joint ventures University Park at MIT campus. And as mentioned, recent leasing has validated our expectation of red growth in that market.", "I\u2019d like to take a minute to give you a little more background with the strategy behind our joint venture with Forest City. As we explained, this partnership has equal governance, but more importantly the communication and collaboration of our management team\u2019s has far exceeded expectations. We are working through a pipeline of more than 1 billion in new acquisitions and develop an opportunity with Forest City, many off market and anticipate growing our investments within the joint venture.", "Capitalization of these and opportunities will be determined on a case by case basis, but we anticipate no less than equal participation in the ownership and governance with these assets.", "Life Sciences, research in last phases clear (ph) the authority with our academic medical center clients. And we believe the partnership at Forest City provides us a strategic advantage to meet those needs and as a natural extension of medical facility business leverage. With Forest City\u2019s 25-year history in Life Sciences and Life Science development, and national footprint of mixed used developments, we are very optimistic about the future of this partnership and adding to our medical facilities and life size platform and perhaps generating additional Senior Housing opportunities as well.", "Finally, you may have seen our recent announcement about joining Energy Star. Under George\u2019s leadership and the excellent work of Rick Ambry (ph) on our team, we have initiated a number of programs to manage and lower the pastor utility cost of our clients. We have developed a more sophisticated energy procurement process and in-depth data and reporting capability that will assist healthcare staff to identify energy savings opportunities and cost outliers.", "End result, would be lower operating cost that will benefit our tenant and distinguish our properties in their local markets, we believe it\u2019s very important to build and maintain our facilities in a sustainable energy conscious manner to lower the cost of occupancy for our clients. We are in the act of discussions with a number of our clients about energy management tools and experience with alternative energy sources.", "Thank you, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Estes and will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, John, and good morning everybody.", "Before getting to the details, I would like to say that the investment success that George, Chuck and John have discussed this morning have put us in a national and financial position.", "We built a predictable future income strain with attractive returns. I point out that the average initial yield on the acquisitions completed thus far in 2010 is in excess of 8%. With a strong capital position to support our significant investment pipeline, which should in turn position the company to generate more significant earnings and dividend growth over the next several years.", "Turning now to the details, we completed just under 300 million of new investments during the second quarter and have announced over 650 million of investments subsequent to quarter end. This makes total investment announce year-to-date to 1.5 billion.", "I\u2019ll review the positive impact of these investments on our guidance in a moment, but we believe that our ability to source investments is a direct result of our relationship approach and its estimates to the quality and depth of our origination team. Transactions closed during the quarter, included the previously announced Capital Senior Living portfolios, two rental Senior Housing Communities, two health system affiliated medical office buildings and the seventh Life Sciences property with Forest City Enterprises through our joint venture.", "I would also announce two significant transactions anticipated to close subsequent to quarter end. First, we expect to close our recently announced partnership with Merrill Gardens in September. The partnership will consist of 13 communities currently owned by Health Care REIT, valued at 307 million and an additional 25 communities currently owned by Merrill Gardens, valued at 510 million.", "Our 80% interest in the 510 million of additional communities will be paid through a combination of 209 million in cash and the pro rata assumption of 249 million of totaled secured debt on the communities, which I have an average interest rate of 5.0%.", "NOI management fees for the total portfolio in 2011 are projected in the range of 60 to 63 million and occupancy is currently a solid 92%. As George mentioned, we anticipate the portfolio will generate average annual NOI growth after management fees of approximately 5%.", "I\u2019d like to take a minute to explain how the rent we were receiving on the 13 existing Health Care REIT communities being contributed to the partnership compared to the NOI we received post transaction. Our annualized rent on these 13 existing HTN communities is approximately 20 million. This compares to our estimated pro rata share of 2011 NOI on these communities of approximately 19 million.", "We arrived at approximately 19 million of pro rata NOI by taking our 80% interest in the 23.5 million of 2011 NOI projected at these 13 communities. So, effectively we will trade approximately 20 million in annual rent for approximately 19 million of NOI. But most importantly, this NOI is expected to grow at a considerably faster rate at an estimated 5% per year versus the typical 2.5% annual rent increase we have received under a triple med lease structure.", "Also, today, we announced the acquisition of a $143-million portfolio with a new senior housing operator. The portfolio includes six combination senior communities located in Indiana, New York and Connecticut. This transaction will occur in phases, we\u2019ll acquire the first two communities in August for 47 million, three more communities in September for 70 million and the final community is expected to close in the first quarter of next year for 26 million.", "We will assume 14 million of secured debt as a part of the September posing with an interest rate of 6.8%. This match release has a 15-year initial term and an initial yield of 8%.", "Moving out to development, we delivered 217 million of development projects this quarter and started six new projects with a total of, minimum (ph), amount of 221 million. Three of these new projects are medical office buildings, which on average are 76% pre-leased, average 150,000 square feet in size and are projected to have a blinded stabilize yield of 8.5%.", "We also started two combination rental senior housing projects with an expected average initial yield of 8.8% and one hospital for a new leading health fit care system with an expected initial yield of 9.9%. Including in these new projects, we currently have only 309 million of unfunded development commitments.", "We believe our current development pipeline is comprised of high quality assets, which carry relatively little risk. More specifically, our current development pipeline is primarily comprised of six medical office buildings, which are 81% pre-leads, two medical facilities backed by investment grade health systems and three rental senior housing projects that will roll directly into multi-asset master leases secured by personal and corporate guarantees.", "And now, before moving to financial results, I would like to touch on our same store performance. As John mentioned, our same store MOB NOI increased 0.2% in the quarter versus last year. Our same store revenue growth for the senior housing skilled nursing hospital segments increased to blinded 0.1% in the second quarter. This will be the last quarter that this number is impacted by few of the rent referrals and concessions provided last July. I think most importantly, excluding the impact from these operators, we had a strong quarter with same store revenue increasing 2.6% for senior housing, 3.4% for skilled nursing, 2% for hospitals and were up 2.9% for these groups combined.", "These results were above our expectations, and I would point out, they were generally driven by some catch up in rents we receive due to positive CPI increases due the first half of this year.", "Turning now to financial results, we saw strong sequential growth this quarter with normalize FFO per share increasing $0.05 sequentially to $0.80 and normalized FAD per share increasing $0.03 to $0.73.", "Earnings on year-over-year basis were flat to slightly down as we continue to see the impact of our capital raising and de-leveraging efforts over the last 12 months. And I think most importantly, as I mentioned, as we move towards 2011, we believe our strong investment prospects put us in an excellent position to generate more significant earnings growth next year.", "I will just briefly provide a few details on some of the normalizing and unusual items this quarter. First, we recorded a net gain of 3.3 million second quarter asset sales, which included three skilled nursing facilities, one medical office building and one senior housing community. These sales generated gross proceeds of 17 million for the quarter. We did incur a $7 million debt extinguishment charge as a result of our 139 million convertible senior note repurchase.", "We reported 752,000 of transaction cost associated with the 293 million of completed investments and we incurred 150,000 of property operating expenses associated with the hospital health for sale that we expect to sell by year end.", "And finally, we recognize 1 million of other income as a fee to this page of what\u2019s related to an expected disposition that ultimately did not occur. I know regarding our dividend, as previously announced, the Board of Directors did approve an increase to the cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30th of $0.69 per share, which is a 1.5% increase versus the prior rate. This will be our 157th consecutive quarterly dividend payment.", "In terms of our capital activity, we successfully issued an additional 152 million of 3% convertible notes during the quarter, which allowed us to repurchase more of our existing four and three quarters percent convertible notes, which were (inaudible) in 2011 and 2012. This transaction along with our first quarter convertible repurchased has enabled us to extend a total of 441 million of near-term convertible debt maturities through at least 2014. These convertible debt exchanges also reduce current cash interest expense and (inaudible) capital to make additional investments over the next few years.", "Also, in June, we reopened our April unsecured senior note offering adding 150 million of notes priced deal, 6%. And finally, at the end of June, we completed our previously discussed HUD transaction generating 82 million of proceeds and an attractive rate of 5.1%.", "As a result of all these activity, we had extended our average debt maturity from 4.4 years at the end of last year to 6.2 years today.", "In terms of equity, we received over 19 million from our dividend reinvestment program this quarter to the issuance of 469,000 shares at an average gross price of about $42 and no shares are issued under equity shelf program this quarter. Our cash and liability now are over $1 billion at quarter-end. We are in excellent position to meet our near-term maturities and fund our remaining 2010 investment projections net of assumed debt.", "Our credit profile remains strong. Currently debt-to-undepreciated book capitalization is 41%. And interest in fixed charge coverage are at 3.7 times and 3.0 times respectively. Secured debt remains low at only 11.5% of total assets at the end of June.", "I will take just a brief minute now to discuss the accounting and reporting of our $817 million partnership with Merrill Gardens which we find to consolidate on our financial statements. Merrill Gardens\u2019 20% interest will be treated as non-controlling interest on the balance sheet and income statement. The additional 25 communities valued at $510 million that we will be adding to the portfolio, will be added to our real estate investments on the balance sheet. And we do anticipate providing a separate page in the supplement detailing the necessary components to arrive at NOI after management fees to everyone.", "I will just briefly our 2010 guidance and assumptions. In light of the investments announced subsequent to quarter-end and the attractive opportunities, we continue to pursue, we are increasing our 2010 acquisition guidance by $800 million. This increase brings our gross investment guidance to a range of $1.8 to $2.2 billion for the full year. This included $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of acquisition and joint venture investments, and $300 million to $400 million of funded developments.", "We continue to forecast $300 million of dispositions, resulting in a new net investment forecast of $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion. As a result of our investment momentum and capital activity to-date, we are increasing the midpoint of our normalized FFO and FAD guidance and now expect to report normalized FFO in the range of $3.13 to $3.20 per diluted share, and normalized FAD in the range of $2.89 to $2.96 per diluted share.", "Our expectation for net available to common stockholders has been updated to a range of $1.33 to $1.40 per diluted share as detailed in our press release. That concludes my prepared remarks. And operator, I think we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Jerrall Gialty (ph) with Morgan Stanley).", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Gentleman, I wanted to get a better sense of the performance that you are seeing in your housing portfolio, specifically, I wanted to see what the occupancy trends had been for independent living versus assisted living?", "Scott Estes", "Hi (Jerrall) it\u2019s Scott Estes. Breaking up a little bit, I think your question was general performance in the senior housing sector and independent living in particular. You know, we report senior housing on a combined basis since the majority of these facilities are combination independent living, assisted living et cetera. The answer is, the performance has been fairly stable. I think through the economic downturn, you saw a little bit of impact on occupancy but overall coverages have been very tight actually over the last two years. So, I think the senior housing portfolio has proven to be fairly resilient even through the downturn. We are optimistic about the growth potential as the economy hopefully continues to recover. And I think you can see the metrics in our supplement.", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Well, the question also involved assisted living. So, is assisting living turning better, or is it about the same as independent?", "Scott Estes", "I guess that the assisted living is probably marginally better, but again so many of our facilities are combinations, and operators have combinations of independent and assisted living. There\u2019s not too much of a distinction.", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Got it. And the other question I had was, I was wondering if you can comment the lease spreads you are currently seeing for the MOB space?", "John Thomas", "I didn\u2019t understand your question. This is John.", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I am trying to get a sense of like where the leasing spreads are trending for the medical office building space.", "John Thomas", "They\u2019ve been better than expected this year, actually much better from budget and what we were seeing last year early in the market, but still lot of pressure in the economy.", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And my last question is \u2013 so you had \u2013 you bought two MOBs this quarter for an initial cash yield of 8.6% and in the first quarter you bought a portfolio of MOBs for 9.1%. So, I was wondering is this a reflection of your yields for MOBs are generally trending to, or is this more having to do with the quality, location of the assets?", "John Thomas", "These are high quality assets and again they are, I think all of the \u2013 well I think these are all off-market deals and built through relationships. There is a lot of competition out there for the auction, transaction, you know, the cap rates are running kind of \u2013 7.5 to 8.5 cap rates, kind of all market transactions. But again these are reflections of high quality systems, long-term leasing in place and really just the efforts of our origination team.", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I guess going forward, have you seen more of a cap rate compression as the year has gone by?", "John Thomas", "Yes absolutely. There is a lot of capital out there facing medical office.", "Jerrall Gialty \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Well that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s from me, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo with UBS.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Hey good morning guys. Ross Nussbaum as well with me. Just looking at the Merrill Gardens deal, can you provide additional color on the terms of the management contract and perhaps what the fee is based of, how much it is? And then just also some of the assumptions behind the 5% projected NOI growth you guys talked about?", "Scott Estes", "Sure Dustin, and Ross. I think the pertinent items in terms of the management arrangement are the fee is essentially 5% of revenues and the initial term is seven years. And trying to think the \u2013 what\u2019s your other question?", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "The assumptions to get to the 5% projected NOI growth?", "Scott Estes", "Sorry, I think the basic assumption is our portfolio has been a strong portfolio over time. We believe that the current occupancy is running a little bit below where it can trend over the next few years. So, we think that there\u2019s an opportunity for some occupancy in margin expansion and you know we arrived at 5% NOI growth long term through what we believe is our moderate assumption case.", "George Chapman", "Dustin I would also add, Chapman here, that there is some pretty good pricing power in general in these high-end markets that go on with occupancy improvements. So, we are pretty bullish on it.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Okay, so there is not specific run rate for the assumptions that are behind that.", "George Chapman", "You know, it\u2019s incorporated in our detailed models on a facility by facility basis, then I think the main point is we are comfortable saying we think the facilities will generate 5% NOI growth over time.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and then it looks like Merrill Gardens I guess in total owns or operates or manages about 56 properties. So, there\u2019s 38 in the JV. What\u2019s going on the 18 others? Are they going to find out another REIT or are those potential acquisition opportunities down the road that you talked about?", "George Chapman", "Some are in development, some are relatively new and occupancy is increasing. We hope all of them will \u2013 virtually all of them will end up being in our venture.", "John Thomas", "And I know that\u2019s in their nine communities currently under development, and we do have exclusive rights to look at those and I believe their projected completions are over the next one to three years. If I could put the aggregate value, I think it\u2019s about $300 million to $350 million of community value.", "Dustin Pizzo \u2013 UBS", "Okay, perfect. And I believe Ross has a follow-up.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Hi guys, have you mentioned the pricing contractually on that potential pipeline?", "Scott Estes", "No we have ranges.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "On a yield\u2019s perspective.", "Scott Estes", "We\u2019ve talked in ranges, Ross. We will have to look at each asset, but we really are pretty confident that we are going to be Bill\u2019s partner, Merrill Garden\u2019s partner, for virtually all of the future development yields.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "And on the management fee. I know you said 5% of revenues. How are they incentivized to keep their eye on expenses and is there any bumps to NOI?", "Scott Estes", "We think that the 80:20 partnership, both at a real estate and at the tenant level provides more than sufficient alignment. We think it\u2019s some of the best alignment that we have seen actually for (inaudible) structures.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "And then Scott, on a different topic, this is the same question I had asked you last quarter, I wanted to see if I can get some clarity. On the balance sheet, you have a real estate loan receivable $471 million, I know $78 million of that is on non-accrual. I guess we\u2019re really trying to get our arms around whether or not at the end of the day, there is an impairment coming on that number and if you can give us any clarity around and I know you talked last quarter about I think half of it or maybe little more than half of it, you said you weren\u2019t worried about it was with the operators (ph), what can you tell us about the given the $78 million is non-accrual. There is no disclosure there, so what can assume as to what\u2019s going to happen with that, maybe when are those loans coming due and what happens when they come due?", "Scott Estes", "Sure Ross, I\u2019ll give you some additional color, I would generally categorize that the current outlook for the loans that non-accrual bucket is encouraging, we do as always feel we\u2019ve been fairly conservative by not recognizing interest here, but I would say we\u2019re making some good progress. When you look at the loans in that bucket, they are basically six different operator relationships and essentially driven by either better performance in one case a potential transition to a new operator that we\u2019re working on, would they assume the full loan and begin paying its current interest and potential payoffs, I feel like at least $30 million to $40 million of that $78 million number could move out of the bucket over the next few quarters and really again the biggest risk at this point is probably $20 million to $30 million of loans where we\u2019ve chosen not yet to move forward on development projects.", "And really as we evaluate the our options with a few of those projects those are the really to quantify the risk and so we determine that, that\u2019s probably the best number for you to think about. But again I wouldn\u2019t be (inaudible) and say still extremely small part of the aggregate company portfolio.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "And the ultimate game plan with the loans I recall is only convert them into a long term lease, is that your game plan?", "Scott Estes", "It is just obviously on the table, yes. Again these are some projects that commence so we\u2019re looking at our options. So we have \u2013 since we haven\u2019t made the determination I would put those $20 million to $30 million in a limbo stage as we figure out the best option for those handful loans.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Right, but on the 4471 (ph), was the game plan on all of that converted into long term leases.", "George Chapman", "No Ross, George here, in some of those as you recall our loan, very good loans to a Florida nursing home operator in Ventas (ph), one liner and we find most of our loans to be very good and they helped to accommodate a very good series of relationships with high quality operators.", "Scott Estes", "Yes those numbers are the three operators that are in our top 10 that George referenced represent about $256 million of that $472 million totals about 55% of the total loan bucket.", "Ross Nussbaum \u2013 UBS", "Those loans are when (ph).", "Scott Estes", "I think if you look at the loan interest maturity schedule, its 2011 and 2013 for some of those larger ones.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with Keybanc.", "Karin Ford \u2013 Keybanc", "Hi good morning.", "George Chapman", "Good morning Karin.", "Karin Ford \u2013 Keybanc", "Just a few more questions on Merrill Gardens. Scott do you have an estimate as to how accretive you expect the transaction to be your FFO in 2011?", "Scott Estes", "I think the short answer is I think it would be flat to slightly accretive. You think about the total transaction value of $817 million, there is $381 million of debt on the properties at 5.4% and obviously we\u2019ll use our line initially which makes it incrementally very accretive and so you use your theoretical cost of capital, but using an equity cost of something like 8% I think you can lend and assume it slightly accretive next year.", "Karin Ford \u2013 Keybanc", "Great, do you anticipate needing to issue equity later this year if the investment pace continues as you expect in your guidance?", "Scott Estes", "Karin, situation is we have a $1 billion available and based on our current guidance net of the terms debt we basically need between $350 to $750 million of capital. So we have current availability more than enough to meet our current pipeline but as always we\u2019ll be watching the debt and the equity markets.", "Karin Ford \u2013 Keybanc", "Okay, helpful. Final question is just on the management contract with Merrill Gardens, you said it had a seven year term, do you guys \u2013 what circumstances could you guys terminate the management contract sooner than that? Are there any performance requirements?", "George Chapman", "Jeff Miller.", "Jeff Miller", "Yes, this is Jeff Miller. What I would characterize is typical kinds of performance requirements out of the management agreement.", "Karin Ford \u2013 Keybanc", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks, good morning everyone.", "Scott Estes", "Hi Rich.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "If I could just play a little devil advocate here, you mentioned first class operator, sure they are, but you\u2019re also mentioning the opportunity for margin expansion in occupancy increases. Can you just sort of tell me why there are first class operator but also there is more money on the table?", "George Chapman", "Rich, Chapman. We\u2019ve dealt with Bill and his team for almost 15 years now. We\u2019ve seen them turn around underperforming assets, we\u2019ve seen them takeover troubled assets. We\u2019ve witnessed their efforts during tough economic times, and we think that the only reason there is money being left on the table relates to the economy. And we\u2019ve seen virtually everybody\u2019s occupancies move down into high 80s and senior housing. (inaudible) and Bill and his teams portfolio have been affected that way as well but they are moving back up and I think they\u2019re doing very, very well and they are performing very effectively and every asset is affected in some way by the economy.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Was there some corporate level or even why they wanted to do this or is it pure love for HCN?", "George Chapman", "Well I\u2019m sure a lot of it was pure love for us. And while I think that there were a few corporate goals as well to rationalize their particular capital structure and other issues that relate to the Merrill family and their planning. But I think that\u2019s as much as I would say right now.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, are there any promoted interest opportunities for either party?", "George Chapman", "Yes, there is after a very high return to the venture, there is some opportunity for a promote \u2013 for Merrill Gardens based on performance.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Bigger picture, this is your first foray into RIDEA, you\u2019ve mentioned maybe as much as 25% of your portfolio having some type of RIDEA structured to it. Is this perceived as a bit of a litmus test, see how it goes or you\u2019re going full head up forward to look for other opportunities maybe within your portfolio with current operators? What is your game plan in the near term as it relates to RIDEA?", "George Chapman", "Frankly we have commented on RIDEA structures and the way we tend to think about RIDEA is as follows, we view relationship, good relationships as the way we build out portfolio. RIDEA is just one of the ways that we can form a good mutually beneficial relationship. At this point in time, there may be more good opportunities to do RIDEA structures in the IOAL (ph) space as occupancy had come down, occupancies have come down and we view the next two or three years as a period of very high growth. So yes we are looking at for that reason. Some of the operators and their portfolios are going to be perhaps candidates for that, others would not be and we would be better off just sticking with a typical operating lease with fixed increases.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay and last question. Do you feel like a $2 billion plus in terms of investment activity this year, you\u2019re kind of tapped out in terms of annual action or how much bigger can it get on a sort of a annual basis in terms of investment activity?", "George Chapman", "You\u2019ll recall when Scott and I have talked to and talked to the street about this, so we told you and all the other analyst that we had built a program that could do a $1.5 billion per year. I think possibly we can go higher than that annually, but again it depends on opportunities. We\u2019ve added some great people. We have great capabilities and we could clearly go beyond $2 billion a year.", "Rich Anderson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Thanks we have some excitement here to the earnings season.", "George Chapman", "We\u2019re glad to help.", "", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I want to just clarify a couple of details and first so when we think about the $60 million to $63 million of NOI, that sort of your projected sort of 2011 number, if that\u2019s kind of a current run rate and we sort of add 5% to that. Just want to make sure I understand what\u2019s kind of in place and what to assume?", "Scott Estes", "That is the projection for 2011 NOI after management fees Jerry.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, so with the ups build in, okay. and I guess in terms of the triple net rents, wanted to just clarify get a sense of how much of yours has floors, how much of is really affected by just very low CPI escalators, because I think you had made a comment that you actually catching up some rents for CPI, I mean does that 2%, 2.5% go low or because CPI has been so low, what\u2019s your expectation sort of as we go forward?", "Scott Estes", "Hey Jerry, the short of it is about 80% or so our senior housing portfolio has at least compliant of the annual rent increase or then influenced by CPI and if you remember last year, really through most of last year that number was negative, so we kept rents flat and what we\u2019ve actually found through the first and second quarter the year-over-year monthly CPI increase which is what it is for calculating increase there is range between roughly 3.5% at the high end and I think 2% or so at the lower end.", "So we\u2019ve actually received full increase or the need in some catching up of previous year\u2019s flat rent impact. That is in part driving the higher same store performance this quarter.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, so at least the two \u2013 you would be comfortable with 2.5 on the triple net stuff easily?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, all right, thanks. And then just kind of coming back to the entrance fee and the stuff and lease. I was just wondering if you we get a little bit more color, you\u2019ve provided some but there were like four properties in your sort of fill table, the one from like 0 to 50, 50 to 70, I was curious if any of that is entrance fee, maybe a little more color just on what\u2019s going on incentives or what\u2019s moving the entrance fees have been higher. I think you said they move from like 46 to 49 and then the strategy switched (ph) operators again just trying to get a little more color there?", "George Chapman", "On your unstable progress question. Yes I think that is important and we did have four properties move up in occupancy as you referenced in our supplement and two of those four were actually entrance fee communities in Florida. The other was a combination of rental senior housing property and the other was a free standing dementia building. We are seeing nice momentum, our largest operator and two operators in the entrance fee world are doing very well, as we mentioned part of our optimism is really based on that sequential improvement.", "As Chap mentioned, we\u2019re ahead of budget in terms of entrance fee moving, above entrance fee and rental components increased occupancy 3% this quarter and if I think important measure if we\u2019re going to think about is as we looked at when we think the majority of those entrance fee communities can stabilize. We currently project between about 1.5 to 2 years and the vast majority of the entrance fee portfolio we think will meet our stabilization criteria of a blended 80% occupancy.", "So we\u2019re actually getting encouraged and we\u2019ll look at the end of the year based on where we\u2019re at but again as we mentioned we think rents are moving up in direction.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay and then just on Stratford I think it is who is the new operator and jus what was going on there?", "George Chapman", "Jerry it\u2019s referencing community in Kenwood, Ohio that is one of the true, we think the (inaudible) real update in its market if the project that is just come out of construction and in July we transition this property to Senior Star who is a high quality senior housing operator that\u2019s already in our portfolio. They will be running that community as a rental model under we think it\u2019s an attractive long term lease featuring an incremental growth revenue component which could enhance future returns.", "So we\u2019re happy to \u2013 team did a good job I think putting resolving that situation and I think probably from a metrics perspective the number we would share is obviously, we\u2019re generalize not a home run but we think based on conservative cap rate assumptions we can still get nearer of 7% to 8% on that asset.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay and wasn\u2019t the entrance fee the move to rentals that what you do is part of that?", "George Chapman", "That\u2019s correct. This is an entrance fee that we move to a rental model.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. All right. I think I am good for now. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Yes, good morning. Just back to Miller Gardens, its already still well run occupancy at 92%, one, could you give us a sense of what the operating margins are right now and then two, when you kind of look back at the economic boom, five or six years ago, could you give us a sense of what peak occupancies and peak margins were back then?", "Scott Estes", "Yes they were.", "George Chapman", "John Getchey, go ahead and answer the question.", "John Getchey", "Yes the occupancy has always been, what was the year you were looking for they were \u201809, there were 90%, it was 91% 2009, 93% 2008 and currently running at 92% today. And as far your operating margin question, it\u2019s probably around 35% or so.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "35% today?", "John Getchey", "Yes.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "What about in the peak years?", "John Getchey", "We kept at \u2013 it\u2019s always circling down 35%.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, so what would the upside come from then, I guess its occupancy kind of a peak occupancies right now and margins are kind of like a peak margins. What does the 5% NOI growth come from?", "Scott Estes", "Generally I think yes when John\u2019s giving general numbers Tayo, the 91%, 92% range of occupancy in our (inaudible) can grow to 95% for this portfolio. And he said they were current EBITDA there in the kind of 30% to 35% range is somewhere in the middle there. There is definitely a few percentage points of EBITDA margin expansion from where the numbers are now in these guys have always been very good operators over a time. So we\u2019re comfortable as the economy improves. Clearly assets like these will have some of the best pricing power in their markets.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Do you have any concern at least near term about somewhat of the portfolio, one being independent living in California that has a week housing backdrop?", "George Chapman", "We certainly look at that and we know that the economy is probably having the greatest impact on independent living but we think that cyclically that we have some room to move up at this point.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, I appreciate that, and then just going back to the developments, the one CCRC that you guys have not determined the development yield on yet. Any reason why?", "Scott Estes", "That was in the (inaudible) facility that I detailed through Jerry to response.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. And then the deferred rents on the other which can be open CCRCs, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting to get some of that back in 2011 as we \u2013 how much you\u2019re expecting back and how soon that could faster happen?", "George Chapman", "We do think we are going to increase rents on the CCRC portfolio and we\u2019re going to look at the remainder of the year before making hard determination.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. One more questions, life sciences joint venture, anything changed in regards to that, you guys were kind of seeing the 20% leasing spread you were expecting that will generally be 5% NOI growth?", "John Thomas", "Yes, Tayo its John. What we\u2019re seeing in the market and some of the relation there really above our expectations. So the numbers you quoted we\u2019re very comfortable with.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, well one big transformational transaction in first quarter, second one in second quarter, what should we be expecting in the third quarter?", "George Chapman", "We get board easily (ph).", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "I hear you, thanks a lot guys.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Hey thanks guys, I apologize you already answered these questions. The other transaction you announced were $143 million, who was the seller on that, was that an existing tenant?", "Scott Estes", "It was existing, it was an operator fine portfolios of ours, so just great sale lease back transaction.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay.", "Scott Estes", "They were not in our portfolio but we had a long term relationship and has worked with them back and the early 90s and their portfolio had matured and they were looking for growth partners so we were able to acquire that portfolio from them.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. So the operator is going to stay the same, you are not changing out the operator?", "Scott Estes", "Correct.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Part two of that, what factors contribute to the closing dates at least on one of the properties getting stretched into the first quarter of next year?", "Scott Estes", "Some of it is the tax considerations and some of it are related to debt assumptions.", "Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks Todd.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Rob Maine with Morgan Keegan.", "Rob Maine \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Thanks, good morning. Most of what I had its been answered, so I\u2019ve just got a little odd man question left, and that is skilled nursing portfolio, there have been, with that kind of a flurry of reimbursement issues that come up FMAP and Medicare rates for next year and proposed therapy cuts and all that stuff. Am I correct in assuming that when you look at this netted out, you don\u2019t see any significant impact on either your coverage or your appetite for that asset class?", "Scott Estes", "I think that\u2019s correct. I do think it\u2019s a net user basically right now.", "Rob Maine \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks.", "Scott Estes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Yes, just two quick questions. One along Mr. Maine\u2019s question, although you expect it to generally be neutral in regards to Medicaid, are there any particular states where the outcome was somewhat worse than you expected?", "Scott Estes", "No big \u2013 honestly so many of the state budgets are still unfolded this point, and we heard some encouraging news out of the potential for increasing FMAP through the next first couple of quarters of next year and it looks like that\u2019s going to move to the house and later this week as I understand it but again the bottom line is our school nursing facility coverage is 1.72 times among the highest in the industry and based on all the changes that we don\u2019t see a lot of or any operators who have significant issues in light of the Medicare, Medicaid pricing changes that are on the table.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Got that, all right. I appreciate that but then just one more question. I appreciate your patience, I know you had discussed this just a few minutes ago, but the CPI related triple net leases, you said and there was a certain catch up you were getting right now which is why the increases were between 2% to 2.5%. Could you just talk about that again real quick please?", "Scott Estes", "Sure Tayo, you can see most of our leases would have, the typical 2.5% of approximate annual increase and as you can see even see it in some of our independent and assisted combination operators we saw as much as kind of the 5% to 6% year-over-year increases when they\u2019re leases came up during the first half of this year because effectively what was happening was last year rents were held slight while CPI was negative and then the CPI has come back positively, we\u2019ve been able to not only get the normal annual increase but catch up some of the rent that should have been increased in the prior year.", "Tayo Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, so that\u2019s something works. Okay, it sounds good. Thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc", "Hi, I just had a follow-up on the two post quarter acquisitions. Are the two senior housing portfolios in the Merrill Gardens deal and the other $143 million deal similar, so that \u2013 if we sort of compare the cap rates, the cap rate and the lease rate basically between those two deals. Would that be a good measure of what you might consider to be the premium you\u2019d need to pay to do a RIDEA deal versus a triple net deal?", "Scott Estes", "How would you characterize the relative assets Chuck are there significant difference.", "Charles Herman", "Quality I think there are of similar quality and similar mix, so I think they\u2019re reasonably the same.", "Scott Estes", "As far as the differential, we\u2019re doing a right deal versus doing a straight acquisition. I think it potentially is one property I think it could be larger spreads depending upon the growth in the RIDEA portfolio that maybe out there. Even IRRs too \u2013 I mean some of our potential IRRs on a typical triple net be on senior housing maybe more in the 9.5 to 10 range and we think we can get in excess of that based on some pretty reasonable, what do you think reasonable assumptions and in terms of growth in the Merrill Gardens portfolio as well as terminal cap rate actually using in cap rate that\u2019s kind of higher than the growing cap rate. We still think we can just kind of at least 10% to 11% potentially and that\u2019s kind of another way we think about the value added proposition.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc", "Helpful, and then just finally, do you anticipate within the current structuring of the deal that there will be any tax leakage or do you think it will be sort of tax efficient the way you\u2019ve got it structured?", "Jeff Miller", "This is Jeff Miller. There is inevitably some level of tax leakage because you\u2019re working to a TRS however the way we have structured, I think we have done a pretty good job of minimizing that.", "Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Chapman, do you have any closing remarks.", "George Chapman", "I have no closing remarks. I just want to on the behalf of the management team thank people for participating in the call and to advise you that Scott will be available for any follow-up questions. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Christie and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Miller", "Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's fourth quarter 2010 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release that was distributed last evening and this morning, you may access them via the company's website at www.hcreit.com. We are also holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website. ", "Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news releases and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT. George?", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much, Jeff. Good morning. It is a particular pleasure to report to you today. In 2010, our well-positioned platform, driven by our relationship investment strategy, generated a record year of investments. It only seems appropriate that in our 40th year, we invested an unprecedented $3.2 billion with leading senior housing operators and health systems. And year-to-date, in 2011, we have announced an additional $1.3 billion of high-quality investments. ", "Relationships with best-in-class operators differentiate our company. This strategy has produced excellent portfolio results and in turn will drive strong and accelerated FFO and FAD growth for 2011 and into the future. Although we faced challenging economic conditions in the last several years, we remain steady and disciplined by preserving liquidity and completing all committed investments. During the same period, we focused on deepening existing relationships and developing new ones with senior housing operators and health systems. Our capabilities were strengthened by adding strategic, knowledgeable and experienced employees to our team. We also enhanced the full-service capabilities that make us a value-added partner. And as we've entered into RIDEA partnerships that will enhance our organic growth potential, we have added key personnel to help us in managing those relationships and adding value to the partnerships. ", "During the last 40 years, Health Care REIT has created a foundation of relationship and trust with senior housing operators and health systems. Year after year, a large percentage of our investments are with existing relationships. In 2010, over 90% of our investments were off-market, providing Health Care REIT and our partners an opportunity to negotiate win-win capital structures. ", "In our press release distributed yesterday, we announced four major investments with Benchmark Senior Living, Brandywine Senior Living, Senior Star Living and Silverado Senior living. These new investments included an expansion of our relationships with key portfolio companies, Senior Star and Silverado. We also formed new and important relationships with Brandywine and Benchmark, two highly regarded operators in the Northeast. The Senior Star, Silverado and Benchmark investments have joined Merrill Gardens as partnership structures formed under RIDEA. The Brandywine investment can be converted into a RIDEA structure after the first three years of the lease, subject to specified performance measures. All of these partnerships offer potential future external growth, with the right of first refusal on future investments. It is also important to note that all of these partnerships offer internal growth opportunity through occupancy, particularly the Silverado and Senior Star portfolios, with properties currently in lease up. In aggregate, the occupancy of these four new partnerships is 86%, leaving significant room for upside. These best-in-industry partnerships result in a portfolio of extremely high quality of assets in high barrier to entry markets. ", "Additional information about these new structures and partnerships is included in our February 15 press release and on our website. The partnerships extend the company's strategy of capitalizing on favorable fundamentals in the senior housing industry by investing with innovative operators who have a track record of quality care, profitability and growth. The company anticipates earnings accretion in the short run and growth in the long run. We are quite enthusiastic about these investments and relationships and look forward to being a value-added partner. ", "During this period of new partnership development, we also continue to grow existing relationships with our highly valued, long-standing operator partners, including Emeritus, Brookdale, Capital Senior Living, Life Care Centers of America and a numerous and notable regional operator partners. In fact, we now have 63 senior housing and care operators in our portfolio, a reliable and high-quality platform for investment and FFO growth. ", "In our Medical Facilities division, we made investments totaling $1.2 billion in 2010, with major investments in 17 medical office buildings master leased by Aurora Health Systems, an A-rated, highly-regarded Wisconsin health system. We also invested with Forest City in seven first-class Life Science buildings in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Late in the year, we completed investments in five Florida Medical office buildings and 17 medical office buildings, primarily in the Midwest. We now have investments with 46 health systems with the potential to produce future investment opportunities. ", "This relationship investment strategy has resulted in a strong, high-quality portfolio that we believe is one of the best in the country. Our aggregate portfolio of coverage is 2.12:1, which we believe to be the strongest coverage in our sector. And following my remarks, Scott Estes will provide additional highlights of our portfolio metrics. ", "During the past four years, our relationship investment strategy has created a 16% average annual return for our shareholders. And the current environment has confirmed Health Care REIT's position as partner of choice in senior housing and a key player in the medical facility sector. Our guidance for 2011 provides for a range of 6% to 9% FFO and 6% to 10% FAD growth, excluding the benefit of future acquisitions. The 63 senior housing and care operators and 46 health care systems within our portfolio and the numerous rights of first refusal for future investments will undoubtedly drive a significant additional external growth. The RIDEA partnerships and life science investments are expected to provide strong organic growth. And these diversified growth opportunities position Health Care REIT to drive significant FFO and FAD growth and result in shareholder value, not only in 2011, but for many years to come. These relationships results and returns could only have been produced by a talented team, and I'd like to take the opportunity now to formally thank our committed employees for their tremendous efforts in producing these accomplishments. ", "Lastly, I'm pleased to announce that Health Care REIT will host our first ever Investor Day at our newly renovated headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, on May 19 and we look forward to the opportunity to showcase our company's industry-leading capabilities, as well as some of our key operator partners. And with that, I will now turn to Scott Estes, our CFO, for a brief financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, George and good morning, everyone. As George discussed, we are very excited about the recent additions to our portfolio, and our expectations that they will drive meaningful earnings and dividend growth for the company over the next several years. We were also pleased with the fundamental performance of the portfolio during the fourth quarter. We try maintaining coverage at an all-time high and strong same-store NOI growth that ranged between 2% and 5% across all of our asset segments. We made a decision to raise a significant amount of capital during the fourth quarter, which allowed us to form the additional partnerships announced last evening. These are all strategically significant partnerships with excellent operators and high-quality health systems that will help generate more significant earnings and dividend growth in 2011, 2012 and beyond. We believe our enhanced growth potential as a result of these investments more than offsets the minor near-term dilution, which occurred as a result of raising the capital early in completing the majority of our investments during the last week of December. ", "Turning now to the details, as George discussed, we had a very successful year on the new investment front, completing $3.2 billion in total during 2010, which included a record $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, the $1.3 billion of investments announced in 2011 to date, represent excellent additions to our portfolio and position us to generate FFO growth of at least 6% to 9% this year. Turning to portfolio performance, first in our stable, Senior housing and Care portfolio continues to perform well. Senior housing payment coverage remains at the solid 1.54x with occupancy increasing 1% to the current 89% level. Skilled nursing payments coverage increased five basis points sequentially to its historical high of 2.42x, with current occupancy of 85%.", "We generated strong same-store NOI growth rates within both the senior housing and skilled nursing portfolios during the fourth quarter. Our same-store senior housing NOI increased 2.9% versus last year, while our same-store skilled nursing NOI rose nearly 5% year over year. We also continued to see some nice progress at our entrance fee properties. As a result of this continued progress, on January 1 of 2011, we increased rent on the original nine communities operated by senior living communities by 8.3% or 50 basis points to 6.5%. These properties have a current investment balance of approximately $400 million. The 8.3% annual rent increase on these properties translates into a blended 2011 annual increase of 5.2% across our entire $653 million entrance fee portfolio. ", "Next, I'll just briefly discuss our senior housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA partnerships. As of December 31, the operating portfolio consisted of our previously completed Merrill Gardens partnership and the recently announced Senior Star partnership, which closed on December 31. And we have included some additional disclosure regarding the operating portfolio for the first time on Page 24 of our supplement. ", "Moving now over to the medical facilities portfolio. First, in regards to our hospital portfolio, fourth quarter stable payment coverage improved one basis point to a strong 2.7x overall. We also experienced significant 4% same-store NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the fourth quarter versus last year. Our medical office portfolio had another strong quarter and finished the year exceeding our expectations. Occupancy increased 10 basis points sequentially in the quarter to end the year with occupancy over 93%, while our retention rate during 2010 was a strong 85%. We also generated solid same-store growth in our MOB portfolio, as fourth quarter same-store cash NOI increased 2.1% year-over-year. ", "Our life science portfolio also continues to perform very well, as we saw a nice sequential same-store NOI increase of 4.1% versus the third quarter as depicted on Page 30 of the supplement. ", "Turning now to financial results, we reported normalized FFO per share of $0.75 for the fourth quarter and $3.08 for the year, while normalized FAD per share was $0.68 for the quarter and $2.84 for the year. Our results came in below guidance as a direct result of the $950 million of capital raised during the quarter, which is not included in our previous forecast and the fact that the vast majority of fourth quarter investments occurred during the last week of the year. More important, this activity sets us up for significant growth in 2011 and puts us in a strong capital position to complete the 2011 transactions announced today. ", "Regarding our dividend, the Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.715 per share or $2.86 annually, commencing with the May dividend. This represents a 4% increase versus the previous rate. ", "I'll now provide some additional details regarding our fourth quarter capital activity. The $450 million long tenure unsecured note offering completed in November enabled us to extend our weighted average debt maturity to nine years. In terms of equity, in addition to our 11.5 million share equity offerings in December, we issued 516,000 shares under our Dividend Reinvestment Program at an average net price of $46.50 per share, generating $24 million in proceeds. No shares were issued under our equity shelf [ph] (0:17:52) program during the quarter. At this point, our credit profile remained strong through December 31, with debt to undepreciated book capitalization of 45%, and interest and fixed charge coverage of 3.4x and 2.8x respectively. ", "Finally, I'd like to review our 2011 guidance and assumptions. First, I would like to point out one change regarding our guidance methodology beginning in 2011. We will no longer assume additional investments in our guidance beyond what has been announced to date. In addition, we are discontinuing the investment press release that was typically issued about 10 days after quarter end that provided investment volumes but limited detail regarding expected returns on those investments. Instead, we plan on reporting investment results for the previous quarter at the time of our earnings release. This will enable us to include more detailed disclosures, such as cap rates, initial yields and growth potential and allow us to provide more details on the rationale behind these investments on the earnings calls. ", "As detailed in the earnings release, we expect to report 2011 net income available to common stockholders in the range of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. We anticipate 2011 FFO in the range of $3.25 to $3.35 per diluted share, representing strong 6% to 9% growth. Our 2011 FAD expectation is a range of $3.01 to $3.11 per diluted share, which also represents a strong 6% to 10% increase over normalized 2010 results. ", "Our 2011 investment guidance assumes only the $1.3 billion of acquisitions and joint venture investments announced through today, and $212 million of funded development on the projects currently under construction. Also included in guidance is our expectation for approximately $300 million of dispositions in 2011, which are weighted towards the front half of the year. And finally, we are projecting development conversions for projects currently under construction of approximately $480 million, with an average initial cash yield of 9.1%. ", "As George explained earlier, our overall portfolio mix is now an excellent balance of higher potential growth opportunities, supported by the more stable 2% to 3% increase as expected out of our triple net lease portfolio in medical office buildings. Including the transactions announced today, we expect that about 1/4 of our portfolio has the potential to generate internal NOI or rent growth at 5% or greater over the next several years, while the remaining 3/4 is expected to average the more traditional 2% to 3% growth per year. The higher growth vehicles in our assumptions are the senior housing operating assets, representing 22% of the pro forma portfolio and our life science investment of 3% of the portfolio. ", "In regards to specific portfolio segments, in our triple net senior housing and hospital portfolios, we are forecasting solid same-store NOI growth of approximately 2% to 3% in 2011. As stated earlier, our senior housing operating portfolio will represent approximately 22% of our total investments, including the recently announced partnerships. We anticipate this portfolio will generate a 2011 NOI yield after management fees of approximately 7%, and it's positioned to grow approximately 5% to 6% over the next several years. ", "In our medical office portfolio, we're expecting that occupancy will stay in the 93% range, while same-store cash NOI growth is forecast to increase approximately 1% to 2%. In addition, we have only 6% of the portfolio rolling over in 2011 and we are forecasting solid tenant retention of approximately 80% this year. Next, we expect that our life science portfolio will continue to perform well in 2011. The first two leases that came up for renewal, representing about 15% of the total life science portfolio square footage were renewed at average rate increases in excess of 35%. Since these new leases are expected to commence later this year, we are expecting average NOI growth roughly of 2% to 3% for the portfolio this year. However, we do expect to be able to achieve NOI growth in the life science portfolio in excess of 5% over time as a larger number of leases begin to roll beginning in 2012. ", "Our G&A forecast is approximately $69 million for 2011, representing approximately 67 basis points of assets this year, including the acquisitions announced today. As George mentioned, we have continued to add a number of outstanding professionals to our team as we manage the significant growth in our portfolio. ", "And finally, I'll take just a minute to discuss our capital needs as we enter 2011. As of December 31, we have almost $1 billion of cash and line of credit availability. And as discussed, we have announced growth investment of $1.5 billion this year. So approximately $1 billion of this $1.5 billion growth investment capital need is expected to come from the following sources: First, we will assume approximately $613 million of secured debt associated with our recently announced 2011 investments at a blended rate of 5.5%. Second, we expect $300 million of asset sales weighted towards the first half of 2011. And third, $90 million is expected through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan. This leaves only about $500 million that's not spoken for. So given our cash and line availability here of nearly $1 billion and the $400 million in committed bridge financing we obtained as discussed in our press release, we believe we're in excellent capital position and have adequate liquidity to meet our current 2011 investment needs. With that, George, that concludes my prepared remarks and operator, I guess we'd like to open the call for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "A question for George or Scott, I guess as you look at the balance sheet, and Scott you just walked through the details. You are in pretty good shape on the financing side. But if you look at your assets, they're up about 50% year-over-year. Can you just talk broadly about the pipeline of what you're looking at today and what you think the HCN platform can handle, I guess in terms of new deal volume for 2011?", "George Chapman", "Jay, as Scott indicated, we're not giving a guidance. We continue though because of the relationship financing program, investment program to see all the deals that are out there. We're seeing probably more senior housing opportunities right now than say medical office buildings or hospitals or the like. And in terms of what we think we will do, it all comes down to the quality of the operator and the quality of the portfolio. We're reviewing a number of opportunities right now but we're not really going to say much more than that at this time.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then you mentioned life science. I know 3% of the portfolio. Can you talk about the opportunities you're seeing there today because it's certainly one of the areas you mentioned in terms of growth?", "George Chapman", "I'll just start and then maybe I'll ask John Thomas to comment on that. We have looked at a lot of opportunities with Forest City. It's a very collaborative arrangement and we have actually pursued several. And we will pursue life sciences if they are particularly attractive like our current investment in Cambridge. John, some comments?", "John Thomas", "Just to add to that, this is John Thomas. We have looked at  opportunities on both coasts in the core life sciences corridors and we expect to grow that when we find best-in-class assets located near universities and core tenants. So, we expect to grow.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Maybe just switching back to senior housing, in terms of Benchmark and Brandywine, can you talk a bit about rent coverage, I guess more on the Brandywine side? And then in terms of I guess just potential rent growth and where occupancy is for each of those portfolios?", "George Chapman", "We're going to be reporting growth and as a part of the four operating senior housing operators. And we're probably not going to give that much specific detail on each one of our senior housing operators every year until we maybe refine our methodology for doing so. But both Brandywine and Benchmark have a very attractive occupancy right now. They've done a great job during the downturn. They have several percentage points of opportunity to grow occupancy and they certainly have some real pricing power in a very tough area to build in and to develop in. So Scott, do you want to add anything to that? We're very pleased about Brandywine and Benchmark. We think that these are some of the best operators in the country, with some of the best assets in very tough markets and we're looking for a real significant growth there. Our approach to the four though is that we're going to be able to grow our operating platform more in the 5% to 6% range annually and they're certainly going to be great contributors.", "Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "In terms of RIDEA in total, you said 22% of the total portfolio. How large could that grow over time? Could you mention Brandywine could, I guess convert after three years?", "George Chapman", "Yes, we frankly hope they will. Our expectation would be that they would be able to convert in three years or perhaps even sooner, depending on what the circumstances are and how Brenda and her team sees the opportunities. Certainly, we talked in the past about 25% to 30% or so, perhaps our sort of steady-state RIDEA platform. And at this point, I would think that, that would be appropriate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Yama [ph] Gailan [ph] with Bank of America.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was curious how you were thinking about disposition, and I know as pricing gets competitive, would you consider more than currently the $300 million you have targeted?", "George Chapman", "What was the question, dispositions? We really have -- we undertook a process about four years ago when there were -- we are all focused on liquidity. And it was an opportune time to sort of jump start the disposition process that would otherwise take seven to eight years. So we're getting toward the end of any dispositions, for example, relate to more stand-alone Medicaid-oriented skilled nursing facilities and we have some loans that are due to be repaid this year and next that we have talked about it at undue length in previous calls. So, I think we're getting toward the end.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Marlow with Sandler O'Neill.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I want to take a sort of a different tack on the investment pipeline question. You have talked about in the past $5 billion to $6 billion investment pipeline. Recently, it's been more, you said sort of 60:40 senior housing versus other facilities and 90% with existing relationships. Can you just talk about how that shifted given the acquisition volumes you completed in the fourth quarter and now into 2011?", "George Chapman", "As you point out, we're doing about $5 billion. We did $3.2 billion last year. We've announced $1.3 billion this year and we frankly think that the pipeline is probably going to refill and it's probably going to be oriented a bit more toward senior housing as I said earlier than the medical facility side. But I would point out we did $1.2 billion in the medical facility side and all of the noise and whatever about how well we did in senior housing, I'm real pleased about John's group and what they've done. But I think it sort of remains the same. We're just not in a position right now to tell you it's going to be another $2 billion or $3 billion or whatever the number is. It's a little hazier today than it was going into the second half of last year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then you look at on the construction side in 2011, the development balance is going to come down as you deliver projects. Are you seeing more opportunities to refill the pace of new construction and is the 6% to 8% that you talked about now, is that sort of a target or should we think about that more as an upper range of where you would be comfortable with that exposure?", "George Chapman", "I think that's probably an upper range. And the talk about development about two years ago, when the markets sort of fell apart and we had higher than normal development. This is where we tend to be in our development pipeline and most of those will be in a substantially pre-leased and medical office buildings with great systems or some outpatient facilities connected to, related to, affiliated with the really good health systems, as well as some senior housing generally as part of a master lease. So, we will do development. We're geared up to do it. It's particularly important in the health system arena where they have to develop new medical facilities that are appropriate for the customer and are appropriate for the outpatient nature of procedures today. But I think that's right. 6% to 8% is probably the high end.", "Unidentified Analyst", "My last one here, the G&A looks like it's gone up quite a bit. Is that just simply a product of the expanded team given the investment activity in monitoring the new relationships? Are there are other items that are on top of that, either related to the RIDEA structures or something else?", "George Chapman", "I'll make a couple of comments and then I'm going to turn it over to Scott to follow up on some of his comments he made in his initial remarks. But generally, we have tried to stay ahead of the game in terms of bringing in top-flight people as I said in my remarks. We brought in a lot of people in the medical facilities area, including people who are quite good and add to our property management team, as well as our development group. And then, as it relates to senior housing, Chuck has been very active in bringing in folks like Stephanie Anderson to add to our resources there. And the effect has been very good. We also said that with the RIDEA structures, we are going to bring in a team that will add value. We've already added two to three people and are looking to add two to three more people as well. We think that the way the Health Care REIT world is evolving, is that we're really a complete company, instead of, hey  we're not just an entrepreneurial financiers. We're full-blown companies, with top infrastructures and top people and that's how we position the company. Scott, do you want to add anything?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, James. I think I just said, my answer to your question would be really no.  There's nothing beyond just the infrastructure improvements that we really begin as we've embarked on this initiative to grow the portfolio very significantly, really beginning in 2010. And obviously, going in continuing into 2011. Obviously, moving from roughly $6 billion in assets now to pro forma in excess of $10 billion, we've started, as George mentioned, staffing for the growth beginning probably middle of 2010 and when you kind of just look at where the numbers play out, you have the high quality team in place. It's virtually all staffing related. And I think as a percentage of either assets or revenue, it's flat to even slightly down based on the aggregate portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A couple of things. On guidance, I guess this is Scott's question. What do you assume on  the capital raising side? Any equity offerings? I guess just the stuff you mentioned coming from the DRIP. Just want to clarify that side of it.", "Scott Estes", "Sure, Jerry. I think the point of where we're at from a capital position shows that we have a lot of flexibility here entering 2011. But I guess for modeling purposes, we've always assumed the blended mix of 45%. That 55% equity kind of our standard in terms of incorporating and providing guidance to you all.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And I think it was probably just some rounding but I just wanted to sort of clarify a couple of things that you went through the capital needs end. You had talked about $1.5 billion. I think that's what you said unless I misunderstood you. You really talking about the stuff that has been funded or committed to the $1.3 billion for the first part of this year.", "Scott Estes", "Yes, the aggregate of the announced $1.3 billion of acquisitions and joint venture fundings plus $200 million of projected development fundings from the projects that are underway this year.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just any more rationale just about sort of not assuming sort of investments. You've done that sort of historically in terms of your future guidance.", "Scott Estes", "Sure. We thought a lot about it. We've spoken at length about our pipeline. I think George gave some color. Obviously, we still feel like our position and our investment opportunities are strong and a lot of it will be recurring business from our existing portfolio of senior housing operators and health systems. I guess the short of it is we feel like it will be easier to just communicate the investments as they come through as opposed to proposing some level of hypothetical guidance and then hypothetical capital raises. In our opinion, it will just be easier to talk to you as they come through.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Just one or two more for me. The FFO guidance from what we expected, FAD was a little bit lower. Are there any capital CapEx funding needs or anything else that's sort of changed on the FAD side that we should be thinking about? Particularly as you get into RIDEA, there's some stuff in lease up, do you have CapEx per unit or something like that we should be thinking about?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. There's obviously some more CapEx that are included in the FAD guidance and it's a blend of really what we're projecting in our operating portfolio, combined with what we project in our medical office portfolio. And I think when you put it together, it's probably in the $30 million area in aggregate. I think we're projecting, correct me if I'm wrong, pretty typical, about $1,250 per unit of CapEx in the operating portfolio would be a rough estimate.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And there's no big, on the MOB side, there's no big tenant roll-over or extra TIs that's running about where it was on CapEx.", "John Thomas", "Yes. This is John Thomas. That's correct. We got a very low rollover this year and next. So that's consistent with 2010 on those numbers.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Last thing for me, I was wondering how you think about, and I've actually didn't get to calculate cost per unit, but cost per unit on the stuff maybe you bought in the new senior housing stuff that you announced? And how do you think about replacement costs on those properties?", "Charles Herman", "As far as replacement costs, we're seeing in these types of markets, they're very difficult to build in, very difficult to construct and you expect in the New England and mid-Atlantic states to be at least $250,000 to $300,000 a unit, plus some fill-up costs to stabilize those assets. So that's not uncommon for us to see. The other portfolios were not in the higher -- were not in New England or mid-Atlantic states, some were in California. They're a little bit different. They're in the $200,000 to $250,000 range to redevelop, reconstruct, so that's kind of typical.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a couple of questions. First on development, you're going to complete nearly $500 million in 2011. One of the issues with HCN maybe some of this pushed back a little bit now, may becoming an opportunity is your exposure to development. Do you see development? Because at this point, I think it's in single digits as a percentage of your total assets. Do you see ramping up development, new investments over the course of the next few years?", "George Chapman", "Rich, Chapman here. I already mentioned that, that 6% to 8% is probably at the high end but we do view development as a particular opportunity that will even lead to monetization of existing assets with the great health systems. And there's clearly a need for a more customer friendly facilities, outpatient and otherwise, in the medical facilities area. And then from time to time, given the demand supply components, if we can add a very good senior housing asset into an existing master lease with one of our top partners, we will do that. But you should be looking at that range, 6% to 8% going forward.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "One of the things that's happening in the Health Care REIT space is there's a lot of transaction activity. My pipeline is bigger than your pipeline type of thing. I guess, I wonder now that you're saying that there's not a whole lot of or as much visibility into your pipeline on a go-forward basis, I mean is that kind of a wink that you're willing to kind of slow it down a little bit, allow some of these deals to marinate and maybe address the potential that you have become too big to grow type of phenomenon?", "George Chapman", "I think that we're gearing up. We have already geared up to manage our company, which is much larger and more complex than it used to be and appropriate for a Health Care REIT going forward. We are adding to our RIDEA team. We are very capable of running all of these new investments and adding value to our RIDEA and other partners. So, I don't think that is a constraint but we are only going to do projects that really makes sense to us. And I just can't predict, Rich, whether we're going to find a number like we had last year or we're going to actually not even have the same type of year that we did last year. It's just difficult to say. We didn't go into last year thinking what we we're going to do is $3 billion necessarily. But because of the pent up demand, I guess, for financing and the need of private equity firms that were approaching their front lines [ph] (0:43:33), we had just a wonderful opportunity to move forward and do more projects with our ongoing partners and to add several more and to move to a RIDEA structure. So we're just going to have to wait and see.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But you don't think that there's a too big type of number in your mind? You could grow and grow and grow as far as you're concerned?", "George Chapman", "I think we can. I suspect that at some point, when the three REITs that seem to be growing most quickly get to 20% or 25%, it's going to be more difficult to grow at 6% to 7%. It might be 4% to 5% but you have to look then at the risk-adjusted return to people. So I sort of view the perceptions as changing over time as some of the larger REITs get much larger. But we have a lot of very good transactions we can pursue and we're looking forward to it.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "On the topic of RIDEA, can you comment on -- you and others taking on more risks and kind of transitioning from a conventional Health Care REIT and how investors should view the risk perspective of your company as you take on things like occupancy opportunities in Silverado and others. I guess the risk perspective is changing for you and I wanted to see how you think about that as a long-term issue for your company.", "George Chapman", "I think Scott made the point very precisely in his comments that we see a balance between triple net lease portfolio and the operating portfolios being very appropriate and that it is just one more way in which we can diversify and provide a better risk-adjusted return to our shareholders. In terms of the particular risk, we have done business with Merrill Gardens and Silverado for almost 15 years now. We've been their partner. We know what they do and we know how they do it and we think we're going to be right on top of those. And as you look at our good friends at Brandywine, Benchmark and Senior Star, who we have been involved with in the industry forever, we think we have best-in-class operators and think that the risks are minimal and very manageable and that our returns, which will be greater than the normal triple lease, more than make up for it.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "One last question is on the entrance fee issue. You mentioned the 8.3% increase in rent for senior living communities. I guess that's about eight of the 13 that you have outstanding in entrance fees, is that correct?", "Scott Estes", "Rich, it's actually 11 of the 13, that\u2019s all fees, the vast majority of that portfolio.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "What amount is still left on the table in terms of recapturing some of the deferred rent that you gave away at the bottom of that market? Do you see significantly more to catch up on in future years or do you think you get back to where you kind of started with this increase during 2011?", "George Chapman", "I think we sort of look at it as catching up in two or three years and then perhaps going past and averaging out about the same that we would've otherwise. So much of it depends on when the economy or if the economy regains its previous form and the housing markets come back. But the way we're looking at is we're going to move. I think it's Scott, isn't eight out of this 11 that are moving ahead at the 5%?", "Scott Estes", "Nine.", "George Chapman", "Nine. Then we can move those ahead at 50 bps increasers for the next several years and I don't want people to model more than that until the economy really gets going. And then the entrance fee communities, will be the greatest beneficiaries of a faster growing economy.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So the recovery of the entrance fee issue is this is the first of a say two- to three-year process?", "George Chapman", "I think so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the Senior Star acquisition, I think the going-in cap rate was a 6%, but you have some properties in fill up there? If you exclude those, can you talk about what the yield would've been on that portfolio?", "Scott Estes", "Do you want to walk him through that,   the Senior Star portfolio?", "Charles Herman", "New acquisitions were around the 7% yield going in. ", "We had some properties in fill up. This is Chuck Herman. We have a couple of properties in fill up and then we bought a stable portfolio, with some room but generally stable at around a 7% yield.", "George Chapman", "And we do think that the Senior Star portfolio could have one of the highest growth rates in the NOI side. So we're very much looking forward to doing a lot of business with Bill and Bob Thomas going forward.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then on the projected growth of call it about 5% to 6% on the RIDEA assets over the next few years, can you clear that up? How much of it do you see coming from occupancy versus pricing. I know you mentioned the portfolio is on average were about 86% leased. So is it, would you say it's 2/3 occupancy pick up and the balance on pricing or is it even more skewed towards occupancy?", "Scott Estes", "This is Scott Estes, again. We will talk in terms of the aggregate portfolio and I do think you're right. That is in our opinion, a good representation of the opportunity on the occupancy front. The fact that the blended portfolio is about 86% occupancy. But I think as you can tell from the data that the Senior Star and the Silverado portfolio is due to having some assets in essence and fill up had some bigger opportunities there. So the short of it is there's some significant opportunities on occupancy. I'd say somewhat of an occupancy opportunity on both the Merrill Gardens and Benchmark over time. But I think those that are the more stable assets have the best pricing power would probably where you\u2019d see that the margin expansion opportunity is due to their strong market positions and pricing power. So it's really a blend of both and I would actually, I think we're very comfortable with those projections based on the numbers that we're looking at right now.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And last question. Keeping with you for a second, the $3.08 for 2010, $0.75 in Q4, when you look at the numbers and the timing differentials between the acquisitions and the drag, about how much per share do you think the drag was in Q4?", "Scott Estes", "By our calculation it was about, the capital will be raised at about $0.05 diluted in the fourth quarter. We raised about $450 million of 5.03% debt in early November and then 11.5 million shares of equity in early December. So aggregate, we calculated about $0.05. And really, honestly, on the timing, we're just talking about that, Steve, [ph] (0:50:54) as a means of an example, if the Brandywine, $600 million transaction happened on December 1 instead of December 31, that would have added about $0.03 for the quarter. So that would be my general view. This is about $0.05 from the capital activity and then really just a lot of the deals all just came at the end of the year, which set us up for a good 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Scott, I want to clarify a couple of things. First of all, earlier question about G&A, am I correct that the fourth quarter figure specifically does include that $1 million of stock compensation grants?", "Scott Estes", "That is included in the fourth quarter number, yes.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "So a normalized number would be $1 million lower?", "Scott Estes", "That's correct. That was in the release Rob, in the first quarter, traditionally we have about $3.9 million of accelerated vesting of grants as it detailed in the press release. Remember to do that.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Right. And then I have a question before the year, senior housing NOI number gets swamped by the new deals. In the fourth quarter, we just had Merrill Gardens. And stop me if any of my numbers are wrong here, but in the third quarter, you had Merrill Gardens on a weighted average for less than a month because some of the properties closed later. And you did $4.8 million in NOI, and if I just multiply that by three, I would've gotten $14.4 million and your fourth quarter number was lower than that. Was there anything going on with that portfolio specifically in Q4?", "Scott Estes", "No, Rob. As I recall in the month of September in particular, I recall there was a $200,000 or $300,000 adjustment. That's a positive adjustment in that month. Again, I still think the best way to think about the Merrill Gardens portfolio is occupancy was stable. And again, we're getting an approximate 7% return currently and we'll continue to roll that out as a part of the portfolio in 2011.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "So the full quarter that we saw in Q4 is probably a better run rate to use?", "Scott Estes", "Sure, if you're  trying to model it by operator, sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo with UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "It's Ross Nussbaum here for Dustin. On the operating side for the senior housing assets, what kind of geographic, non-compete clauses do you have built into the contracts? Can you continue to acquire assets in the markets where these operators are operating?", "George Chapman", "Typically, it's a 3-mile to 5-mile radius. We do a pretty good job though working with our operators to make sure we're not going to be competing with ourselves. We have a great ongoing relationship with these folks. We know exactly what the development plans are. Where they\u2019re looking to acquire. So we feel pretty comfortable with that kind of number.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Specifically on the Brandywine portfolio, how do you define what fair  market value is in terms of the rent reset?", "Company Speaker", "If the parties can agree, this is Scott Brinker speaking, it will be subject to an appraisal. I would just remind you that there's always a floor of the prior year plus the increaser. So there's only upside in the reset opportunity for us.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "So would it be fair to say you look where the cash flows on that portfolio are in three years and hopefully have a meeting of the minds in terms of what an appropriate yield would be if you will from a rent perspective?", "Company Speaker", "That's right. The other point is our hope is that this converts into a partnership structured as RIDEA within three years or so.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "And that was the second part of my question on Brandywine, which is a -- it looks like there's a skilled nursing component there. How does that fit in under the RIDEA structure? Is there a private letter ruling that's needed or do you think it's going to be okay?", "Company Speaker", "This is Scott again. Skilled nursing would be permitted under RIDEA and that's one sub-acute unit within an assisted living facility. And Brenda and her team actually have a history of operating skilled nursing in sub-acute units.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "A couple of quick questions. The Benchmark deal, just for modeling purposes, a date for closing. I think your press release said the first half of the year but the GPT press release said first quarter?", "Scott Estes", "I think that projection is I hope it\u2019s roughly right around the borderline between the two quarters. It may be right at March 31 to April for your modeling purposes.", "George Chapman", "It's a function of licensure transfer and debt assumptions. That's what's driving those issues. We've come to all agreements. We're ready to move forward with the transaction.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then after you do all your charge transactions, you give us a number of 22% of your assets will be within the RIDEA structure. So we'll get a sense of what the percentage of NOI, that would be?", "Scott Estes", "Let me think about it, Tay, and get back to you. I don't want to give you a wrong number on the call here.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Going back to an earlier question that was asked, the whole idea of the risk profile changing as you're increasingly exposed to the business cycles of senior housing, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you would  tackle the world where fundamentals begin to turn negative. I think right now, you're getting into those house fundamentals are going to turn positive, but once the business cycle changes again, how do you deal with that?", "Scott Estes", "There tends to be only about 15% to 20% of the cash flow that's really going to be all that variable. That's what in effect we're trying to capture with these transactions. So these assets are going to yield because of the types of operators that we are working with, the quality of the assets, the location. There's going to be a yield from these assets. So it's not like they\u2019re going to drop off the face and go negative on us.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I asked because this company has such high operating leverage though, like in a tough environment, just a slight drop in vacancy really causes a big impact into overall margins. And I guess, how do you protect yourself against that. When the business cycle ultimately turns again, whether it's five years or 10 years from now?", "Scott Estes", "I could try to answer first then Scott Brinker could add to this. I would point to the track record of these best-in-class operators in the in fill markets and I believe Tom is very excited, the fact they've grown NOI 7% on average over the last what, four to five years. Obviously through one of the biggest downturns and we always speak of the resiliency of the senior housing industry even being not entirely resistant but somewhat resistant to economic downturns. So our view is yes. You may not get 5% plus every year but the down year shouldn't be that bad and on average, we should be able to get in excess of 5% returns over time.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "One more question, I appreciate you indulging me. The MOB platform, the 1% to 2% cash NOI gross projection for 2011 with flat occupancy. I'm just curious if you could break that out in regards to what you're expecting by way of revenue increases and also operating expense increases?", "John Thomas", "This is John Thomas, again we don't have a lot of roll this year, so most of that is coming from the built-in increasers and we're tightly managing the expenses and frankly lowering our costs, particularly on property taxes and energy costs. So it's a lower year and there's still is some rate pressure out in the market. So that's the tie together.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So is it fair to say something like 1% revenue increases and expense is flat or. . .", "John Thomas", "Closer to 2% revenue and 1.5% on the expenses, so 1%.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "1% increase?", "John Thomas", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael O'Dell with AIG Asset Management.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just one question going back to the increased operating leverage with regards to the RIDEA structure, and just what type of leverage in terms of the debt to EBITDA basis you're targeting on a financial perspective?", "Scott Estes", "This is Scott. I would point out we were talking about the way the adjusted EBITDA page looks in our supplement. It's obviously skewed by the fact that we completed a very significant amount of these investments on the last, really, days of the quarter. So what you see on our supplemented net debt to EBITDA of 7.6x, basically using the annualized EBITDA from the investments we made in that last week, it would go down to about 6.7x to 6.8x. And our model this year shows roughly 6x to 6.5x is what we are basically what we're trying to get to in our internal model this year.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just in terms of the decision to utilize the bridge facility, it seems like you have availability on the credit line. Just what's the thought process there?", "Scott Estes", "We do, and I think you're right. I think at the end of the day, the bridge is put in place to provide both flexibility from our perspective and just surety of financing. And we'll see in another month and a half or so if it's needed. But we haven't determined that. It's really was just done for flexibility from a capital management perspective. I think Mike -- again, the key is really we would manage the balance sheet to the 45%, I think or less over time debt to undepreciated both tax levels.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So you don't think taking more operating leverage would lead to an issue in terms of taking the same if not more financial leverage.  Do you think you're fine and you're comfortable at that somewhat 45% level?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just in terms of the one the rationale for the sellers in terms of monetizing their ownership interests. It seems like mostly founders out there for a while making that decision. Just some more color on the incentive management fees and whether that's profit driven or revenue driven?", "Charles Herman", "This is Chuck Herman again. The incentive management fees are a function of several different factors. Sometimes it's revenue related, clearly NOI related and occupancy. They're all different factors that we roll into the overall calculations. Each one's a little bit different depending upon the deal we could structure. So it changes based on the operator. But those are the basic levers that we can use.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So for these recent transactions, in terms of just a proportion of the deal either NOI driven or top line driven. Could you give me a sense or no?", "George Chapman", "It's mostly based on NOI.", "Charles Herman", "But to your comment on the rationale for the sellers on all these transactions, is that the question?", "George Chapman", "Some of the sellers were larger private equity folks that were looking to monetize. That was the case in a couple of instances, in most of the instances. The other was the management team looking to recoup some capital and then have a platform to grow additionally. So, those are   the two main reasons.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's Quentin Valeli [ph] (1:03:58). Just going back to the GPT question that Tayo asked, in terms of the NOI yield that GPT started at, I think it was about 6.2%. Yours was 6.8%, 7.2%. I'm just wondering whether you could sort of walk us through what the difference there would be?", "Scott Estes", "This is Scott. I'll try to answer. I don't do their calculation, so I don't know for sure. But I think part of it is theirs is based on a trailing number and also the management fee is different. I believe they paid a 7% fee versus the 5% fee that we're paying Benchmark. That accounts for quite a bit of the differential, 50 basis points or so. And I think the rest is just standard NOI growth from 2010 to 2011, which is consistent with what they've done over the last four years during a pretty challenging economic climate.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is a follow-up from Jerry Doctrow from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Scott, I thought you said that Brandywine closed at the end of the fourth quarter and I thought that was a first quarter deal. So can you just clarify which of these closed fourth, which of these closed first and maybe give me a little more color on the additional transactions that closed in the [indiscernible] (1:05:27)?", "Scott Estes", "I'll probably point you to the Page 2 of our earnings release that has the four bullets that says the fourth quarter investments, Jerry. Walking through those, the Brandywine closed in December. You really can just reiterate it.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies and Company.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a couple of quick follow ups. The disposition of $300 million for the year, I know Jana had asked about it earlier but could you give us a sense of what assets you're looking at?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. It's a blend of primarily senior housing and skilled nursing assets. Again, the number is approximately $300 million, as George pointed out, a good bit of that are some loans this year, about $150 million plus are actually loans. So that would be the rough overview. And it is skewed more likely to happen in our model in the first half of the year.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Are you selling the loans or are the loans are just maturing?", "Scott Estes", "Couple of the loans are maturing, the maturity dates.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then just last question with you, George. It's more directed towards you but with you firing on so many cylinders right now, what\u2019s kind of keeping you up at night or what do you worry about as you kind of think about the evolution of HCN over the next three to five years?", "George Chapman", "Tayo, what we've been building the last two or three years is a full-service platform and it's working, and it allows us to invest across the full spectrum of healthcare. And to do what's necessary to be a valued partner, i.e. in the medical office and the medical facilities area, being able to do property management, do planning for health systems, do development if necessary. In senior housing, we've added a lot of people because we have larger partnerships in the RIDEA structure or perhaps much more of a true partnership and the need to get on the ground and really be a help. So I think what would keep us up at night would be just that. Do we have the right infrastructure and the right people in place? We're continuously looking at it. As you look at our employee base, it is right now, we are 250 employees. I think we've done a pretty good job at being proactive. But as this very large investment opportunity continues, we're just going to have to keep working to enhance our capabilities. That's what I think my job is, is to make sure that we're in a position to handle all of these investments and to be a good partner in the RIDEA structure specifically, but also the health systems and our ongoing operators as well.", "Operator", "That concludes today's question-and-answer session for today. I'll hand the program back over to Mr. George Chapman for any other further comments or closing remarks.", "George Chapman", "I would just add that we appreciate your participation. Good questions. I think this relationship investment strategy is working. It's driven a very disciplined growth platform and we're looking forward to producing very strong FFO and FAD that should translate into a very good shareholder value in the future. So, thanks very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Meghan Lublin. Please go ahead madam.", "Meghan Lublin", "Thank you. Welcome to Sunrise Senior Living Investor Conference Call, this is Meghan Lublin of Sunrise\u2019s Investor Relation. Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is been recorded and the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.", "During the course of this call the company will make various remarks concerning management\u2019s expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future.", "I will now turn the call over the Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer.", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks Meghan. With me this morning are Greg Neeb, our Chief Investment and Administrative Officer and Marc Richard, our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Also with me is Julie Pangelinan, our current CFO who will be leaving Sunrise in a few weeks.", "Julie is a first-class accounting professional who did so much, first to enable Sunrise\u2019s survival and then put us on a path of ongoing reliable success. We can\u2019t thank Julie and after all she has done for us.", "2010, was the year of significant strengthening of Sunrise preparing us for strong future. We announced strong operating results this morning including comparable community occupancy of 88.3%, which was 80 basis points ahead of the same period last year and 60 basis over the prior quarter. We posted average daily rate growth of 3.7% over the fourth quarter 2009. Of course, we now operate a smaller revenue base and our overhead has not declined tremendously [ph].", "We restored our balance sheet, dramatically reduced our debt, and restructured several of our joint venture and management relationships. We also made a major first step in our stated goal of owning more of what we manage with the recent acquisition with the CNL Lifestyle lease of one of our finest portfolios.", "We were just as busy restructuring our operations where we both recruited from outside and in some cases like with our cohesive operations promoted strong professional from with them. Virtually every area of the Sunrise operations and community support team has been strengthened and here again we have a built a great foundation for future success.", "Our team has successfully climbed many mountains before and I\u2019m confident that together we can cross the hill we still face. We\u2019ve continued to deal with many legacy issues at Sunrise, fortunately among them is our strong brand and reputation.", "We have the sectors perennially leading brand and we have many plans to build this all important area. When I refer to the hills, we still have to climb let me clear, first, we reduced the size of Sunrise fairly dramatically and while our fixed overhead run rate has declined and has not declined enough yet and we still have outside G&A costs hitting each quarter. We\u2019re tackling this now.", "Also, now that major parts of the old Sunrise have been discontinued, our management partnerships and contracts now are the major pieces of our business. As you will see in a full reading of our 10-K and 8-K filed this morning, we have provided additional supplemental disclosure to help you better understand both our revenue strength components as well as pointing out, including specifically in the 8-K filed this morning, the continuing imbalances in some of our JV relationships.", "Well, these relationships are not individually material, they\u2019re still very important to our revenue base and we intend to work on the imbalances to find a comfortable resolution. Again, to be clear, we believe in transparency and we have high confidence that the legacy challenges before us are manageable, just as larger past challenges were.", "We want you know that while we agree with recent headline, Sunrise Senior Living is back, we haven\u2019t moved our offices to Tahiti. This work to be done and we\u2019re looking forward to doing this as any strong independent and committed management team should.", "In just a moment, our Chief Administrative Officer, Greg Neeb and our Chief Accounting Officer and incoming CFO Marc Richards will provide additional detail about the quarter. But before they do, I\u2019ll expand on some of the relationships that are essential to Sunrise.", "In 2010, not only do we structure our relationship with Ventas, we built on an already strong relationship to put us on a path of increased performance in this major portfolio. We work very closely with the entire Ventas team to find ways to add value to our assets and this process is already borne through.", "Our relationship with HCP, which was strained as we entered 2010 was also restructured and is now positive and constructive. We are of course excited that we have renewed our relationship with CNL with the purchase of the portfolio we once owned with our Capita. We are also very proud of both the continuing relationship we have with our Capita in the U.K. and of the mutually valued added relationship that ended with the CNL Sunrise purchase.", "We want Sunrise to be considered the operating partner of choice and we hope that these relationships and others attest to the renewed strength of Sunrise. This reputation will enable us not only to stay strong but to find new opportunities for growth in a rapidly changing sector.", "You may recall that we did not start 2010 with positive lender relationships; of course I\u2019m happy to report that our lender relationships are dramatically improved and we have now moved to establishing new banking relationships to support future operations.", "I spoke earlier about the Sunrise brand and (inaudible). The Sunrise mission and principles of services along with our physically attractive and adaptable communities and thousands of little details collectively represent the best brand in senior living and provide the Sunrise signature experience.", "We have built a very talented and driven sales and marketing team to build our brand further and in 2011 as we celebrate our 30 years of championing the quality of life for all seniors, you should expect to see a lot from Sunrise. The quality of our brand of course also opened many future possibilities for us to take advantage of and we are excited by these prospects.", "Now, let me talk about our team and core operations. I have reported to you during the past several quarters that this was not going to be simply a financial turnaround, but the building of a foundation for growth. I also said that 2010 was a year of rebuilding our teams and that\u2019s just what we\u2019ve been doing.", "We have been a titan in every core area of community operations to ensure that we will have the best team, the best care, the best activities, and something very dear to my heart the best food. In fact this week we are rolling out a new menu signaling the shape of things to come.", "We also have been working to be sure that we at the community level have a strong commercial sense along with our commitment to our mission. We are stewards of our real assets on behalf of our shareholders, partners and lenders and we know that this understanding had to extend throughout Sunrise for us to be successful.", "Also while we are happy with our core, we know that there are many services that we could incorporate within Sunrise, thanks to our strong geographic concentrations which could add materially to our bottom line.", "Finally, let me speak a bit about growth. We see many opportunities arising as our sector changes. Development and acquisition opportunities are likely to appear and we are very interested in exploring these in a measured fashion. Sunrise is a leader in a great and changing sector, we have the strength and discipline to build on what we do while always driving our risk down. I am very excited about the future and ready to tackle the issues we face.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark Richards. Mark and I worked together for years including his last 18 months here at Sunrise. He has a great reputation as a seasoned real estate and multi size accounting leader and has grown as respectable auditor (inaudible) during his career.", "Mark?", "Mark Richards", "Thank you Mark. I will focus my discussion this morning on our consolidated operating results and the various components of Sunrise\u2019s earnings for the quarter and full year of 2010. It\u2019s important for me to note that this quarter we\u2019ve provided a new supplemental report to provide additional operating and performance data, which I will refer to throughout my discussion.", "Specifically, we have provided supplemental data surrounding community performance broken down into various categories to include consolidated communities, lease communities, joint venture communities, and managed communities. This data has been organized by community or by loan pool and we have provided the associated mortgage debt by community where loan pool well.", "Lastly, we have included in our supplemental a schedule of the management fees we have earned by owner or as applicable loan pool. Greg Neeb will also address this information in more detail later in the call.", "Turning to our operating results, during the fourth quarter we reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $15 million or $0.87 per fully diluted share as compared to net income of $10.4 million or $0.19 per fully diluted share for 2009.", "The change between periods was primarily driven by a $10 million buyout fee paid to us by HCP and $25 million gain resulting from the sale of venture interest in certain communities to Ventas.", "Going forward we will utilize adjusted EBITDAR among other metrics to evaluate our operating performance. We have adjusted net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent expense to further exclude certain non-cash gains and losses and other items of income or expense, including cost related to our restructuring effort.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $25.7 million as compared to $42.1 million for the same period last year. This decline is primarily due to a $6 million reduction in our share of EBITDAR from our ventures primarily due to a $3.6 million reduction in EBITDAR associated with the sale of certain of venture interest in 2009 and 2010, as well as a $2.8 million reduction in EBITDAR due to a gain on the sale of real estate at one of our ventures in 2009.", "We also incurred higher general and administrative expenses and earned lower management fee income. General and administrative expenses were $33.5 million for the quarter, compared to $26.4 million for the same period in 2009. Our Q4 2010 G&A includes $2.6 million of professional fees incurred associated with our HCP, Ventas, and CNL transactions.", "These transactions resulted in the buyout of 27 HCP management contracts, the sale of our venture interest in certain communities to Ventas, and the formation of a new venture with CNL. Further, bonus expense was $7.6 million, which included a $3 million stay bonus of our CEO compared to $2.3 million of bonus expense in the same period in 2009.", "Management fees for the quarter were $26.4 million and included $1.6 million of fees related to contracts that have been bought or terminated. Additionally, Sunrise\u2019s share of earnings from our venture interest increased quarter-over-quarter by $14.4 million primarily due to a non-recurring distribution of $22 million from one of our U.K. ventures.", "Our fourth quarter 2010 consolidated operating results were also impacted by $23.4 million in net operating income from our consolidated and lease communities as compared to $21 million in NOI from these communities in the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Net operating income as income from operations excluding depreciation, lease expense, and impairment charges related to these communities. This increase was primarily due to four communities that were opened in 2008 and 2009 that continued to lease up.", "Turning to our annual results, we reported net income attributable to common share holders of $99.1 million or $1.72 per fully diluted share, as compared when net loss of a $133.9 million or $2.61 per fully diluted share for 2009.", "This significant year-over-year change was driven by $63.3 million of buyout fees earned in 2010; lower restructuring cost of $20.8 million, lower impairment charges of $25.8 million, and $68.5 million of income associated with our discontinued operations, as compared to losses from discontinued operations of $25.4 million in 2009. Our exit from Germany and the associated restructuring of that related debt contributed significantly to this year-over-year change of discontinued operations.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the year was a $117.9 million as compared to $131.1 million last year. The year-over-year decrease of $13.2 million is primarily due to lower EBITDAR from our ventures of $12.7 million, primarily due to the sale of certain of venture interests in 2009 and 2010. Lower management fee income and higher G&A expense partially offset by lower development expense due to winding up development activity.", "General and administrative expenses for the year were a $124.7 million compared to a $114.6 million in 2009. Our 2010 G&A includes $6.9 million of professional fees incurred associated with our HCP, CNL, and Ventas transactions, $3.5 million in costs associated with the HCP litigation, $2.6 million in severance costs, and $14.1 million of bonus expense compared to $8.8 million of bonus expense in 2009. We continue to believe that our annual recurring cash expenditures for G&A will be a below $100 million in 2011.", "Management fees for the year were $107.8 million in 2010 and $112.4 million in 2009. After removing $14.3 million in 2010 and $26.6 million in 2009 related to management fees from contracts that were bought out or terminated, our recurring fees were $93.5 million in 2010 and $85.8 million in 2009. This year-over-year increase of $7.7 million was driven primarily by lease up at various communities that were recently opened.", "Our full year 2010 consolidated operating results were also impacted by $91.1 million in net operating income from our consolidated and lease communities. Leasing communities generated $80 million and NOI during 2009. Note that $47.9 million of our 2010 lease community NOI is related to communities that have leases that will expire in 2013 and the extensions of those leases will require third party approval.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, our unrestricted cash increased from a $39.3 million at December 31, 2009 to $66.7 million at December 31, 2010. Our outstanding consolidated debt is now $163 million compared to $440 million at the end of 2009. Accordingly, you will note that in our 2010 form 10-K we filed this morning, we no longer believe that there is substantial doubt and our ability to continue is a growing concern.", "I will now the turn the call over to our Chief Investment and Administrative Officer Greg Neeb. Greg?", "Greg Neeb", "Thanks Marc Richards. Let me start by saying that I agree with Mark Ordan\u2019s positive assessment of the state of Sunrise offered earlier in the call. My goal is to make our investor aware of important details of our business about competitively disadvantaging ourselves and respecting confidentiality provisions of our agreements. With that objective that we filed the supplement 8-K this morning and additional information about our properties, ventures, debt, and contracts.", "Going forward, we have slightly modified our call format with variety with transparency into our principle business line mainly our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures, and finally our management agreements. I hope to accomplish this by providing usual operations data within each group as well describe how those operations affect our asset valuation and financial performance.", "I hope to fit our key transactions into these buckets to get better visibility and how they enhance overall value. Our new supplemental 8-K provides information broken down by these business lines and represents how we manage our business.", "Before I can start with an overview, I\u2019d like to elaborate on couple of new metrics you will find in our 8-K. First, our properties and grouped into two new buckets, stabilized communities and leased out communities. Stabilized communities are a group of assets owned by a single venture that at least one property has not been opened for 36 months.", "This is difference in our concepts of comparable communities which disregards the joint venture and classifies individual properties as comparable if they have been opened since January 1, 2008. I will reference comparable communities for consistency with statistics we have previously disclosed and stabilized communities for new statistics and comparisons.", "We believe the new stabilized community concept, the group\u2019s assets by joint venture better captures the financial arrangements incorporated into our loan and venture documents that effectively pool these cash flows and cross collateralizes the assets.", "Second, we are now reporting net operating income by these business lines. To match our income statement, our consolidated and leased properties do not have management fee deduction as (inaudible) ourselves an eliminated in consolidation. The other reported NOIs containing management fee deduction at the stipulated contractual rate.", "Now, let me start with the general overview. Overall trends for Sunrise Communities continued to improve. Comparable community occupancy of 88.3 for the fourth quarter 2010 is an 80 basis point increase over fourth quarter 2009 and a 60 basis point increase over third quarter 2010. This positive trend has reversed our early year results where we reported declined occupancy in both the first and second quarter of 2010.", "ADR for occupied units for comparable communities in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $206.32 representing a 3.7% increase over fourth quarter 2009 ADR. NOI is also higher increasing almost 7.3% in 2010 over 2009 for stabilized properties and 16.6% overall including leased properties.", "Let me breakthrough results down on a regional level, where which we have nine regions plus the United Kingdom, all regions except one reported positive NOI year-over-year with a range of negative 0.4% to a positive plus 12.7% with seven of nine reporting growth of 4.5% or higher. ADR increased in all regions in 2010 compared to 2009.", "Operating trends for the Sunrise leased communities were positive in 2010, although not as robust as our overall portfolio. Net operating income for stabilized leased communities was up 5.3% for the full year 2010 over 2009. Occupancy was slightly lower or 89.3 for the fourth quarter 2010 versus 89.4 for the fourth quarter 2009.", "The leased communities have a different unique profile when compared to our managed and joint venture communities. They are composed of approximately 50% independent living units versus 10% for the JV and managed communities combined. This leads to lower NOI per unit and has slightly enhanced, slightly impaired growth as compared to our assistive living and Memory Care product in this economy.", "Our eight stabilized consolidated community consist of a variety of asset types, including three lower performing assets we are in the process of selling and other properties we consolidate but don\u2019t own 100%, so the trends are not necessarily revealing on an ongoing basis.", "Specific information about important individual assets including Connecticut avenue and Monterey is available on our 8-K both of which are trending positively. Three communities in Montreal that are wholly owned have not leased up according to our expectations. The facilities are operated in this French speaking market but penetration and brand awareness has been slow.", "$26.8 million mortgage debt relating to these communities is not recourse to us matures in April 2011 and we have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lender. We are currently considering our options for these communities.", "Operating trends for venture and managed communities in the fourth quarter of 2010 were strong. Comparable community occupancy of 88.2% for the fourth quarter of 2010 was up a 110 basis points over fourth quarter 2009. ADR for occupied unit for venture and managed comparable communities in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $220.07 representing a 3.6% increase over fourth quarter 2009. Net operating income for venture and managed stabilized communities was up 7%, for the full year 2010 versus 2009.", "Let me highlight two transactions occurring in 2010 relating to venture and managed communities, number one, our Ventas restructure and number two, our new partnership CNL.", "In December 2010, Sunrise entered on a purchase and sale agreement with Ventas and certain of its affiliates to sell to Ventas all of Sunrise\u2019s joint venture interest and entities owning 58 communities managed by Sunrise. The aggregate purchase price of the joint venture interest was $41.5 million. Sunrise continues to manage the 58 Senior Living communities together with the other 21 Senior Living communities in the Ventas portfolio that are already holding on by Ventas.", "As a condition of the purchase agreement, Sunrise and Ventas amended the existing master agreement and management agreements to set forth the revised rights and obligations with respect to the management and other matters related to these communities.", "Additionally, Ventas waived certain existing rights it had to terminate multiple management contracts for performance based reasons that impose tighter performance operating and reporting thresholds, the 79 management contracts and maturities, mainly from 2034 to 2037.", "We believe this transaction increase the security of our management (inaudible) with Ventas which was our number one objective. And also from Ventas a realistic opportunity to return to earning of 6% management fee in the future. The JV interest were sold to them were not marketable and had very limited participation in major decisions. This poor controlled aspect is inconsistent with our current real estate ownership objectives and because of this we view these interests as non-core.", "Number two, in January 2011, we brought in a new partner to replace a selling institutional partner, in a pool of 29 high quality assets mostly purchased mansions. We moved our 10% promoted interest into a new 40% interest in the new venture with CNL.", "The transaction is significant to Sunrise for a few main reasons. Number one, it stabilizes this core group of management contracts well in the future as we now have a reset performance test and unlimited share rights. Our former partners have the right to terminate our management agreements for a specified fee.", "Number two, it allows us to control the assets as we have fixed buyout right of our partner at the beginning of year three at a fixed price. Number three, it realize the value of our embedded promote in the old venture as we wrote our interest from a 10% interest to a 40% interest.", "Number four, it opened up new lending relationships to Sunrise as we plaint this mortgage, this new mortgage $430 million with Goldman Sachs. We have more work to do with our existing management and joint venture relationships. We recognize that some of our recent development assets have been (inaudible) to lease-up and put additional stress in our lenders and partners.", "Our ventures passed used a high LTV mortgage financing rolling forward into new more conservative lending environment and also induce some stress. Therefore, and certain of these circumstances, it is more difficult to qualify for prewired extension provisions or obtained favorable refinance the options at par. Our 8-K provides on data on each of these situations. Mark expressed our outlook for these things at the beginning of this call.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to a discussion of our noncore assets. As a part of the German settlement, we created a liquidating trust of assets to be sold for the benefit of the participating banks. We guarantee a minimum payment recovery under the agreement of approximately $50 million.", "We sold four properties in the trust in 2010 reduced to $50 million guarantee by $11.5 million. In January 2011, we sold an additional two parcels reducing the guarantee by another $6 million.", "Moving on to loan balances maturities in the falls. As of today our line of credit balance is completely paid off and we have $13.5 million outstanding and letters of credit, which is completely cash secured. At the JVs we have worked out defaulted loan balance now to approximately $300 million at year end, down from $ 1 billion earlier in the year. We continue to work through their remaining defaults with our lenders and partners.", "That concludes my comments. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you Greg. Thank you Mr. Richards. Operator, we are now ready to turn the call over to any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi good morning and thanks for all the additional disclosure although it\u2019s complicated \u2013 now we actually have to go through it all. I have a couple of things Mark, I think one on sort of the joint ventures, I think I read this \u2013 as he was going through quickly is that the numbers that are in the disclosure are kind of pre the CNL transactions, so that the ownerships, weighted kind of average ownership interest will be up and I was curious whether you kind of have a pro forma and for CNL ownership interest in the JV and maybe the adjusted debt on the JV sort of post CNL.", "Mark Ordan", "We have don\u2019t have that in our fingers which you\u2019re absolutely correct.", "Marc Richard", "Jerry that the disclosures reflect the \u2013 our Capita arrangement which was in place at year end. Maybe you can let to know which particular things you\u2019re looking for on a pro forma basis, we can try to provide that.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I can combine that, I think the two we really just want is, one that weighted average ownership interests the JV has posed and then kind of the post debt number, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s refinancing on the CNL or not.", "So that was one. On the other side, I think just on G&A, so to bring down G&A you indicated was \u2013 is a big issue, I think you indicated it will be down under this $100 million based on the cash kind of run rate basis. Any more color you can give us as to how much it could come down, how fast it can down, what should we be thinking about, as we think about \u201911 to \u201912?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, in 2010 we spent a lot of time and money on rebuilding Sunrise so there are many aspects of G&A that \u2013 certainly think it will hit the fourth quarter that were important, but haven\u2019t done the numbers where we needed to be. I would say that it\u2019s \u2013 well I don\u2019t have a number that I\u2019ll throw out today, I think that we can readily tackle this issue and bring our G&A down maturely lower and it\u2019s something that we are doing now, this is not a long-term effort.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "So we should start seeing benefits even first quarter, second quarter and maybe some ramp as you go through the year in terms of bringing it down or?", "Mark Ordan", "Yes, I mean over the coming months I think you\u2019ll see the difference.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Yes, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all from me. Thanks and again I appreciate this good disclosure.", "Greg Neeb", "Oh, sure thank you Jerry. I think you asked for didn\u2019t you Jerry?", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "We did number of a times.", "Mark Ordan", "We are working on getting the average on page 4 of the supplemental, under venture pool, foot notes.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s just \u2013 one of the ways we evaluate it, as you indicated which is by the buckets and just those metrics, sort of move the numbers in fair amounts, so it\u2019s like \u2013 make sure we got exact good numbers.", "Mark Ordan", "You got it.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll move next to Ryan Daniels with William Blair.", "Christina Blaishek \u2013 William Blair", "Good morning it\u2019s Christina Blaishek [ph] for Ryan today. I have one bigger picture question, you commented in your prepared remarks that your long-term goal is to own more of what the company manages and then you also remarked on growth opportunities which include both development and acquisition.", "So I was just wondering, as you continue to right size and restructure everything and get the portfolio right. If you could just comment on some of these longer term opportunities and what you think your strategy is going to be with those?", "Mark Ordan", "Sure, well first of all I\u2019m certain of our, as we, I think we\u2019ve said in the past and certain of our JV relationships, there are times when people look for liquidity and if there is a possibility for us to own more of that venture going forward, we would like to do that. We like owning real estate, we like managing right only what we manage, I think it\u2019s just a basic value building principle that we think is important and a lot of us in the management team here has spent a lot of time in the real estate business before.", "On the other side of the coin, we have strong geographic concentrations at Sunrise which really bear great fruits and go to the bottom line and we see many opportunities where there are locations that don\u2019t yet have a Sunrise and that\u2019s very enticing to us. If we can add to our market position we\u2019d like to do that.", "Last, I think this is a changing sector, it\u2019s a consolidating sector and I think that at times there are different ventures that are pooled, that are available to take on the management contracts and we\u2019ll be eager to do that. Over the last couple of years and you noted we\u2019ve been in a rebuilding phase and we are not looking for growth opportunities and that has shifted.", "Christina Blaishek \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, great that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll go next to Morton Sachs [ph] with Sachs Investment group.", "Morton Sachs \u2013 Sachs Investment Group", "Am I on?", "Mark Ordan", "Yes you are.", "Morton Sachs \u2013 Sachs Investment Group", "Thanks for that again. I want to congratulate you; this has been quite an interesting event watching Sunrise come out of the ashes. I am a social worker and financial social networking on the message boards communicate daily about Sunrise and have been watching with interest how this has evolved and how the communications have been and it\u2019s been quite and again I congratulate.", "I sort of committed to (inaudible) which is past this morning, we would host a lunch for the message board at the Carlisle, New York and I hope that when we do that somebody\u2019s from the company would come and visit us. Anyway we just want to congratulate you to, we hold over million shares but \u2013 interest in your success. I think this has been as good of a classic job as I ever seen and I\u2019ve been at this for 50 years. So congratulations and that\u2019s all I want to say.", "Mark Ordan", "That\u2019s very flattering and we appreciate the support, enjoy your lunch.", "Morton Sachs \u2013 Sachs Investment Group", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we will go next to Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hello, again. Just kind of follow ups on kind of acquisitions development and I think you\u2019re also talking about by sort of \u2013 kind of every kind of ancillary services. So I guess I was just trying to get again a sense of sort of timing I mean I think Mark you said on sort of acquisitions development, you proceeded a measure phase on ancillary again if I understood you right, which market you see a lot makes any sense about the timeframe for perhaps expanding in any particular areas in which you sort of add services.", "Mark Ordan", "Yes, let\u2019s sort of take down to the question I answered before. Having come \u2013 well we certainly haven\u2019t declared victory but after spending a lot of time on rebuilding Sunrise, we also want to look at the opportunities to do what we do better. So obviously services that our residents require is something that we might to understand better and where there are opportunities of course to provide, we\u2019d like to do that.", "In terms of development, the markets are changing, the capital markets are changing so we see opportunities there and we think we have the ability, as I said at a measure phase, we don\u2019t have a timetable for these things but I think it is important to let our shareholders and our partners know that this is something that we\u2019re actively working on, we think it\u2019s part of our job to do it. So but there is no timetable or forward looking projections around us.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "It\u2019s something, you could see yourself maybe in or at least starting some projects say in 2011, I was just trying to get a sense of, you probably got of move to off hands, again I\u2019m trying to pin you down so when do you it, but you\u2019re sort of \u2013 you could start tomorrow or is it still sort of ways off that you could do.", "Mark Ordan", "Well, certainly I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it but it wasn\u2019t something that was \u2013 to be honest 2011 initiative, so.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And at this time there are no further questions.

My name is Bee, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Miller", "Thank you, Bee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's First Quarter 2011 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website as well. Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the new release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. I would like to now turn it over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT, for his opening remarks. George?", "George Chapman", "Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. We are pleased to report that Health Care REIT experienced a strong first quarter in 2011. Through the execution of our disciplined relationship investment strategy, we generated a 12% first quarter return for our shareholders and remain on target to deliver outstanding 2011 earnings growth of 8% to 11%. The investments we closed in 2010 and year-to-date 2011 provide a foundation for strong future earnings growth. The key drivers of this earnings growth include internal NOI growth generated through our core portfolio rent increases and RIDEA partnership NOI growth. Our RIDEA investments are performing in line with budget through the first quarter and remain on target to generate an average of 5% annual NOI growth over the next several years. In addition, our investment pipeline remains strong, providing embedded growth opportunities through disciplined acquisitions driven by our existing partner base. We will continue this disciplined growth profile going forward. ", "In 2011 to date, we completed nearly $4 billion in gross investments, including transactions with Genesis HealthCare, Benchmark Senior Living, Silverado Senior Living and Capital Senior Living. We completed the closings of these portfolios on or ahead of schedule, which allowed us to raise our 2011 FFO guidance by $0.07 as these transactions will be immediately accretive to our earnings. Health Care REIT's unprecedented investment growth of $4 billion in 2011 builds upon the momentum of a $3.2 billion of investments in 2010. This extraordinary period of investment growth demonstrates the successful execution of our relationship investment strategy and will generate solid earnings and dividend growth over the next several years. By investing in industry relationships for over 40 years and providing a full service value add business platform, Health Care REIT has earned a reputation as a long-term partner of choice. During this unparalleled period of opportunity and growth, we continue to strengthen and reposition our portfolio to capture investments that reflect emerging industry trends in the evolving senior housing and health care environment. We are deploying capital, disposing of assets and deepening our management team in order to capitalize on the opportunities created through this period of change. We are staying ahead of the curve in the way we evaluate asset quality, using a comprehensive matrix that considers the quality of asset in its entirety, including the physical asset, the strength of operations, clinical quality, referral networks and strategic geographic considerations. This comprehensive approach to capital deployment is resulting in long-term consistent returns for shareholders. ", "Now, let me take a moment and comment on the recent announcement by CMS regarding the proposed adjustment in payment rates for skilled nursing facilities in 2012. The proposals presented by CMS are preliminary and will go through a significant period of discussion. The proposals will not materially affect Health Care REIT's payment risk, and we also believe the end result will consider the interest of all stakeholders and likely be phased in over a period of several years. Our current $1.2 billion skilled nursing portfolio as of March 31 had very strong rent coverage of 2.3x. Pro forma for Genesis, the coverage would have been a bit over 2x. These coverage levels are the strongest in our sector and have increased over 20 to 30 basis points over the last 5 years. Additionally, 99% plus of our skilled nursing portfolio has a rent payment coverage of approximately 1.7x. You should note that in anticipation of the RUGs-IV payment rate adjustments, we conservatively underwrote the Genesis portfolio at approximately 2x coverage, using a payment rate below the current RUGs-IV rates. I should also point out that our industry-leading operators have proven adept at managing through reimbursement changes by strategically adjusting their business models and consistently managing costs. Our operators' active management, together with our strong portfolio diversification coverage and systems, have resulted in consistent performance through many economic and reimbursement cycles. And we remain optimistic that we will continue to successfully lead the company through these and other challenges and opportunities presented by an evolving healthcare environment. ", "Through our active portfolio management approach, our company has successfully managed and grown our triple-net lease portfolio for decades. We also actively manage and operate approximately 9 million square feet of medical office buildings across the United States. We are now applying the same portfolio management discipline and experience to our expanded RIDEA operating partnerships, and we have built a customer-focused business platform to manage our portfolio of relationships. Our relationship managers are tasked with driving NOI growth in our RIDEA portfolio, as well as growth in our triple-net lease portfolio. In addition, they serve as facilitators of best practice sharing and potential synergy and development across our operator provider and tenant base. In fact, on May 18 of this year, we will be holding our first executive forum for the executives of our operating portfolio of partnerships to begin this process. This is an exciting period of opportunity and growth for Health Care REIT. We are looking forward to our first annual investor day to be held at our corporate headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, on May 19. Our Investor Day will provide a forum to meet and interact with many levels of our management team and the executives of some of our key portfolio partnerships. Participants will also gain insight into Health Care REIT's business strategy, portfolio quality, industry-leading capabilities and vision for the future. I should again mention that so far, attendance has been terrific, and we would encourage those of you who haven't made a commitment to attend to do so. It would be surely a great day. And with that, I will now turn the forum over to Scott Estes, our CFO for REIT financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Thank you, George. Good morning, everybody. As George discussed, we had a very successful first quarter and are off to a great start to 2011. Through early April, we have completed nearly $4 billion of new investments. These investments have been entirely prefinanced with attractively priced debt and equity capital and are immediately accretive to earnings. Most importantly, we believe these investments have positioned us for very meaningful earnings growth over the remaining 3 quarters of the year, enabling us to generate expected FFO and FAD per share growth in a high-single digits or better for the full year. We also ended the quarter in a great balance sheet position, having financed all the deals announced year-to-date without any significant changes to our credit metrics. As of today, we have our entire $1.15 billion line of credit available, plus an additional $200 million of cash available. Our first quarter performance was perhaps our strongest ever, with same-store NOI increasing between 3.4% and 3.8% across all of our reported asset categories, while our RIDEA and Life Science portfolios performed at or above our expectations for the quarter. Our expectation for accelerating earnings growth over the next several years recently allowed us to increase our dividend by 5% versus the comparable quarter last year, while still positioning us to lower our FFO payout ratio to 80% or below by as early as 2012. Turning now to the details, first regarding our investment activity, we completed $1.4 billion of gross investments during the first quarter and nearly $4 billion year-to-date. The vast majority of these investments were announced throughout the first quarter, including our partnerships with Silverado Senior Living, Benchmark Senior Living, Genesis HealthCare and Capital Senior Living. We also acquired 7 senior housing assets in the first quarter for an aggregate $113 million, with an average initial rental yield in excess of 8%. All of these investments were brought to us through relationships with our existing operators. And finally, we did sell 2 smaller Senior Housing portfolios for $44 million, generating $26 million in gains. ", "Turning now to the portfolio performance. First, our stable triple net Senior Housing and Care portfolio continues to perform quite well. Senior housing payment coverage increased 1 basis point to 1.55x and occupancy remains strong at 88%. Skilled Nursing also remained strong, with payment coverage increasing 2 basis points to 2.38x and current occupancy stood at 85%. We also generated strong same-store cash NOI growth rates within both the Senior Housing and Skilled Nursing portfolios during the first quarter. Same-store Senior Housing NOI increased 3.5% versus last year, while our same-store Skilled Nursing NOI rose 3.4% year-over-year. ", "Next I'd like to take a minute to discuss our Senior Housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA partnerships. As of March 31, the operating portfolio represented $2.2 billion or approximately 22% of the total portfolio. First quarter results include a full quarter of performance for Merrill Gardens, Senior Star and Silverado, while the Benchmark portfolio performance is only included for the last 4 days of the quarter. Including the investments completed subsequent to quarter end, our RIDEA partnerships make up approximately 17% of the total portfolio investment balance. As you can see in the supplement, the blended occupancy across our 4 operating portfolios is 89.8% as of March 31. And with a portion of both the Silverado and Senior Star portfolio still [indiscernible], we believe our operating portfolio occupancy has room to increase over the next several years, providing a source of increasing NOI and earnings growth. As George mentioned, first quarter results added to the operating portfolio were almost exactly in line with underwritten expectations. And as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect the operating portfolio to generate average NOI growth of 5% or better over the next several years. Moving on to the Medical Facilities portfolio, first in regard to our Hospital portfolio, first quarter stable payment coverage remains strong at 2.6x. We again experienced solid 3.5% same-store NOI growth in our Hospital portfolio during the first quarter versus last year. Our Medical Office portfolio also had another strong quarter, with occupancy at 93% and trailing 12-months retention of nearly 80%. We also generated excellent same-store growth as first quarter same-store cash NOI increased 3.8% year-over-year, exceeding our internal projections and was actually the highest same-store quarterly NOI growth since we began investing in medical facilities 5 years ago. Our Life Science portfolio also continues to perform better than initial underwritten expectations. Our lease renewal activity continues to be very encouraging as the first 2 leases which roll over this year had been renewed at rates approximately 40% above current rates. As a result, we are increasingly confident that we will meet or exceed our long-term NOI growth expectation at 5% or better in our Life Science portfolio. ", "Turning now to financial results, we reported normalized FFO per share of $0.70 and normalized FAD per share of $0.62 for the quarter. First quarter earnings included $0.08 per share of capital carrying cost as a direct result of [indiscernible] raising $3.5 billion of capital in early March, most all of which remained in cash on the balance sheet for the remainder of the quarter. Other cash was promptly deployed to fund the $890 million Benchmark and $2.4 billion Genesis transactions that closed on March 28 and April 1, respectively. I think importantly, the ability to close all of our major transactions on or ahead of schedule positions us for a very significant quarterly growth throughout the remaining 3 quarters of the year. Our G&A expense was $17.6 million for the first quarter, which included $3.9 million of accelerated expensing of stock and options for certain employees and directors, which normally occurs in the first quarter. And for the remaining 3 quarters of the year, we would expect a G&A run rate of approximately $16 million. Regarding our dividends, we recently declared the 160th consecutive quarterly cash dividends for the quarter ended March 31 at $0.715 per share, representing a 5.1% increase over the same period last year and an annualized rate of $2.86. In terms of our capital activity, as previously announced, we successfully raised $3.5 billion of equity in unsecured debt capital in March, which enabled us to fund our unprecedented acquisition volume thus far in 2011. We also issued 574,000 shares under our Dividend Reinvestment Program at an average net price slightly above $48 per share, generating $28 million in proceeds. And no shares were issued under our equity shelf program during the quarter. ", "Next, I'd like to take a minute to discuss our current liquidity position. As I mentioned, we raised $3.5 billion of capital during the first quarter, generating sufficient proceeds to pay for all of the investments announced year-to-date. The recent debt offering extended our average debt maturity to 10 years. And as a result of this capital activity as of March 31, our cash balance stood at $2.7 billion. After paying for the $2.4 billion Genesis transaction and the $141 million Capital Senior Living transaction, which included $48 million of assumed debt that closed subsequent to quarter end, we currently have a pro forma cash balance of approximately $200 million. In addition to this surplus, as previously mentioned, we have our full $1.15 billion line of credit available. We have started the process of renewing our bank lines and hope to increase our line of credit capacity to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion by the end of summer. And as a result, I think we're in an excellent capital position and note that the increase in our line of credit would provide important flexibility to allow us to come to market to raise permanent capital less frequently than we have in the past. ", "Turning to our credit profile, we remain comfortable with our current debt to underappreciated book capitalization of 44.6% and our secured debt to total assets of 12.9%. Our interest and fixed charge coverage of 3.1x and 2.6x, respectively, are slightly lower than our historical average [indiscernible] circumstance of raising $3.5 billion of capital that was not deployed until the end of the quarter. Over the next quarter or so, we would anticipate our interest in fixed charge coverage to move back to their historical averages of approximately 3.5x and 3x, respectively. In addition, we will look to move leverage down from current levels over time. And more specifically, looking to move debt to underappreciated book cap down closer to the 40% level from the current 45%, and to maintain net debt to EBITDA at 6x or below. Finally, I'll just take a moment to review our updated 2011 guidance and assumptions. We do remain comfortable with our most recent earnings guidance, which increased 2011 normalized FFO to a range of $3.32 to $3.42 per diluted share, representing strong 8% to 11% growth over 2010 results. Our 2011 FAD expectations remain unchanged at a rate of $3.01 to $3.11 per diluted share, representing 6% to 10% growth over the last year.", "I would like to take a brief moment to give you some additional perspective regarding our earnings per share over the next 3 quarters. By simply adding a full quarter's impact of the Genesis and Benchmark acquisitions and a full quarter's impact of our March capital activity, we are positioned to generate very strong normalized FFO and cash growth over the remaining 3 quarters of the year prior to the benefit of any additional investments, which may occur. More specifically, our second quarter earnings run rate in terms of normalized FFO is currently in excess of $0.85 per share. As we mentioned last quarter, our investment guidance does not include any investments beyond what has been announced at this time. So as a result of what has been completed year-to-date, we've increased our net investment guidance from the previous $1.2 billion to $3.7 billion. Our growth acquisition guidance of $4 billion represents an increase of $2.5 billion, which is primarily comprised of the $2.4 billion Genesis acquisition and $130 million of additional investments completed in the first quarter. Finally, we do continue to expect dispositions of approximately $300 million for the full year. With that, operator, that concludes my prepared remarks. And we'd like to now open the call for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from Jana Galan of Bank of America.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I was wondering if maybe we could get a little bit more color around that potential CMS Medicare [indiscernible] and are there any individual tenants that you could see potentially bumping along your coverage ratios?", "Scott Estes", "It's Scott. I'd like to provide a little more color for you and everyone. I think we've seen our portfolio in the industry manage through reimbursement cycles many times. That is why we do underwrite specific coverages of about 2x our Skilled Nursing portfolio. And I would note that our portfolio coverage is actually up about 20 to 30 basis points over the last 4 or 5 years. I think including -- or thinking about the impact of what was announced, the decision, in our opinion, to issue 2 proposals by CMS signals, I think, the need to discuss and acknowledges the meaningful uncertainty of only using 3 months of preliminary data. As a result, we're probably in the camp of most people where we think the most likely outcome will be similar between the positive 1.5% to the 11.3% reduction and potentially be baked in over a period of time. In the past, I think one main point is in our current portfolio, it actually doesn't reflect the full impact of the RUGs-IV benefit. And as we've looked at our portfolio and even some of the public companies have started to report generally you've seen Medicare rates up 10% to 15% per day. So we have not even seen that impact in our coverages. So even if we think about coverages, which again are very strong at 2.4x currently, those are the key numbers you can start from and don't even yet reflect the full benefit. And the one thing I might clarify, too, from George's comments, we actually did look at the stratification of our existing portfolio, and we found out that 99% of our operators within our portfolio cover in excess of 1.7x.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "That's very helpful. And does it change your thinking at all about the Genesis operating exposure option that you have? Being that this is likely to be a continued issue?", "George Chapman", "Well, we look at this as a triple-net lease investment to begin with, with the opportunity to benefit at some appropriate time as a result of our option. And now there's another overview comment I'd add to Scott's and that is that over the years -- over our 42-year history doing skilled nursing, skilled nursing has always been a very cost-effective platform, probably the most cost-effective efficient platform in healthcare. And while the approach or the services have changed a bit, we certainly move to much higher acuity customers, folks that used to be in hospitals, we've also moved to shorter lengths of stay, which has maintained the reputation of skilled nursing as a very cost-effective way to deliver necessary care. So I really would add -- my general comment would be that we really think the enhanced collaboration between the operators and CMS and the others and working off common data that they will drive should lead to a very palatable final rule.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Milam of Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "I just want to add one more question on the Genesis underwriting. And I was just wondering if you guys could give us a little more color on some of the sensitivities you ran and I guess where coverage would go if RUGs-IV in effect weren't implemented, so under a RUGs-III methodology? And then also how you guys look at the growth of that portfolio if for example the worst case scenario were to come to pass where the full reduction were implemented? And I guess finally maybe just talk about if the full reduction is implemented, what you think that could do to pricing for acquisitions in the SNF [skilled nursing facility] market?", "George Chapman", "I'll start and then I'm going to turn this over to Scott Brinker who\u2019s in charge of our underwriting team. Generally, when George Hager and our group did this deal, our goal was to move up to after management fee coverages of 2:1, okay? So we think we have significant upside in this portfolio, and we'll do very well regardless of the outcome of these proposed rules. We also think we have a lot of opportunity with George, in general, to add to his platform, make it even more cost effective. In terms of pricing of additional acquisitions, perhaps there will be some effect. But we're going to have to wait a bit until we see what the final rules are. Scott, do you want to comment generally on underwriting?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, I'm happy to. This is Scott Brinker. We underwrote the transaction to sort of a hybrid between the rates that had been in place in 2010 and what potentially would be in place under RUGs-IV. And that's really the 1.5 coverage that we had given to the public. It's unlikely that rates will decline by the amount that's been released by CMS. But nonetheless, we think rates will at least be at a minimum what they had done prior to the ruling. So coverage in the 1.2 to 1.3 range to us is sort of the low end of expectations. Genesis has been very successful over the years in managing through reimbursement cycles. And we would expect them to do the same here.", "Scott Estes", "If I could add, too, Scott. This is Scott Estes. And we did speak with George Hager over the weekend, and Scott has been taking about the changes. I like to point out, you're right that specifically a worst-case scenario ignores their ability to lower cost, which I know they're thinking about. And it also, I think more importantly, ignores their ability to increase quality mix over time. As we talked about, we're looking for about 55% quality mix this year, but the ability to expand to the mid 60s over the next five years or so as we've talked to many of you about is I think much more important and speaks to George Chapman's comments about why we're comfortable with [indiscernible] about upside in terms of coverage in that portfolio.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay, great. That's helpful. Can you guys also just talk a little bit about the dispositions you have left or planned for this year and what you're seeing and expecting in terms of timing and pricing on those?", "Scott Estes", "Sure, James. I think $300 million probably is our best estimate at this point. It's a mix of generally skilled nursing assets, as well as some senior housing assets. I would say it looks to me that about $110 million of what has not happened yet is severed loans. And if I had to weigh the portfolio, it looks to me that about $150 million of it could actually happen in the second quarter. So it weighted earlier in the year from this point out.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "So the $150 million, does that -- that's in addition to the $50 million that was done in the first quarter?", "Scott Estes", "Yes. I think it was $26 million in the first quarter or so. Probably $100 million a year or so in the second. And then you can model it evenly throughout the last 2.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay, great. And then my last question, can you guys just talk about the Development portfolio just given the sense if everything is still on track and on time? And then maybe could you give us a little color on the Nashville development that we saw some press reports about? Just in terms of I guess what the plan is there and how that fits into the overall Health Care REIT strategy?", "John Thomas", "This is John Thomas. I'll start with the Nashville project. That is a development site. It\u2019s adjacent to the ATA headquarters and HCA's flagship hospital there in Nashville where they are land constrained. We have an MOB there. And there's also a large physician practice facility on the location. So between Vanderbilt and some Life Sciences opportunities and other discussions in that market and the HCA campus opportunity, we had a kind of an inside track on the opportunity to purchase that. We will not develop that until leases are signed, as is our general practice, and we'll take a conservative approach to that. We're having very good discussions with a number of institutional tenants about the potential there.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "And the plan is to do healthcare-related facilities, not to do some mixed-use? It sounds like from the article mixed-use residential, retail, restaurant, et cetera but it's still going to be healthcare focused, is that correct?", "John Thomas", "It'll be our core competency of either healthcare, direct healthcare or life sciences, healthcare related to the academic opportunities in that market. The mixed-use development and other things is really the broader plan that the city has for that location. And the key driver of this was the mayor's plans and development of a bridge connecting that site to West End Avenue. So again, very optimistic and very good inside opportunity for us. But again, we will not move forward in the development until leases are signed and consistent with our normal conservative element of practices. As far as the rest of our development portfolio, we moved 3 projects to completion in the first quarter. One, Loma Linda University Medical Center physician office building a month early and 98% occupancy. We just -- we had the grand opening of that facility yesterday, but rents commenced in March. Other projects that are in the development right now are on time, on schedule, frankly moving ahead of schedule in most cases and in a very conservative high-occupancy fashion.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Great. That's it for me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson of BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just first, is maybe -- I apologize, but maybe this is an ignorant question but I'm asking anyway. If you're talking about increasing the quality mix of Genesis, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't that kind of put you more in the crosshairs of the CMS proposal?", "Scott Brinker", "Well, Medicare would -- this is Scott Brinker speaking. Medicare would still be much more profitable than the other payer. So any improvement in mix would almost for certain improve payment coverage even in a worst case when a full 11% comp was enacted.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay so -- but from a growth perspective, it could be a negative. But anyway, I just wanted to make sure I understood that issue. The question I have and we're trying to work through our model is you're talking about a $0.39 annualized positive impact from Genesis, and you raised guidance by $0.07 at the end of the day, understanding there was capital raising and all the rest. Can you kind of walk through the specifics of how closing Genesis, when you did, which was very early on in the second quarter, why the actual accretive component to 2011 was so much lower than $0.39?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. This is Scott. I think the best way to think about it is you're correct. We advertise an annualized impact of the Genesis deal at $0.39 FFO benefit and $0.29 just to ad. I think by closing the deal on April 1, the 3 quarters of the year would reduce the $0.39 and $0.29 to about $0.29 and $0.22, respectively. And then you would lower each of those numbers by about $0.22. And the net result has been in the $0.07 net [indiscernible] increase on FFO and maintaining that guidance flat. The components of the $0.22 by our estimation are the $0.08 of capital carrying costs from the capital we raised in March. And then probably that $0.12 from upsizing our deals basically by sitting here in a position where we have our line available and actually sitting on cash as opposed to having a little bit of borrowings on the line, probably about $400 million to $500 million difference makes a very big difference to the tune of giving us future earnings growth potential by having that whole line capacity available. But that would be relative to our previous guidance. So and -- and the other small piece was Capital Senior Living deal closed in April versus what we had originally estimated to be February. So I think that those are the pieces that should hopefully connect the dots for you.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Going back to Genesis, what would have been your coverage without the hybrid analysis but just RUGs-III?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Rich, this is Scott again. That's the number I had mentioned earlier, roughly 1.2x, 1.3x.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. You called that the low end of expectations, but if I'm correct and maybe you can enlighten me, but the most draconian of scenarios, the 11-plus % decline would be worse on a net basis than RUGs-III would be, would it not?", "Scott Brinker", "It depends on the operator, but it would be pretty close in terms of per diem rates.", "George Chapman", "Rich, I'd like to comment, too. I think Scott made a -- the elder Scott, Scott Estes, made a very good point. And that is that all of these operators are very adept at responding to if not getting ahead of some of the new proposals or final rules. And George Hager and his team are already working on significant cost reductions as well. So I think we're going to adapt very well.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then last question, can you comment about the situation with your net portfolio in terms of master leases and how you're kind of cross collateralized and protected against any kind of cherry-picking situation?", "Scott Estes", "Sure, Rich. This is Scott. I think probably -- I don't have the Skilled Nursing specific number, but our Senior Care portfolio is generally about 90% of the portfolios in a master lease. So the vast majority of our portfolio and the Skilled Nursing portfolio has generally been around longer. Rich, when you say -- is it virtually all?", "Scott Brinker", "It's virtually all.", "Scott Estes", "It's virtually all we think of the Skilled Nursing portfolio would be in a master, larger master lease.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford of KeyBanc.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Just a question on Page 24 of the supplement, the Senior Housing Operating portfolio. The occupancy throughout the 110 basis points between 4Q and 1Q, is that just a mix issue and the addition of properties and fill-up in 1Q?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, Karin. You're exactly right. The addition of both the Silverado and Senior Star -- Senior Star is [indiscernible] Silverado has a number of assets that didn't fill up. Net portfolio is slightly lower, somewhere in the mid 70s occupancy line. So in aggregate, we reduced the number there just slightly, but that's no reason.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Do you have a same-store occupancy number there or just a number excluding the properties and fill-up?", "Scott Estes", "I don't in front of me, but I know from our general expectations that the overall portfolio we do think there\u2019s room to improve occupancy. I would categorize the Merrill Gardens and the Benchmark portfolios as stable, and they\u2019re in the low 60% occupancy. And then you have the Senior Star and Silverado portfolios, [indiscernible] fill-up assets somewhere in the 70s and growing quite nicely. It comprises the remainder of the portfolio.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. And what type of rate growth are you seeing in, say, like the Merrill Gardens portfolio?", "Scott Estes", "Karin, on the last I had spoken to [indiscernible] it was approximately 3% to 5% type of rate increases. Would you guys agree with that?", "George Chapman", "Yes.", "Scott Estes", "3% to 5% is the approximate rate bumps we've seen in that portfolio.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay, great. Last question from me is just on the investment opportunities from here. George, I think you said a few times in your opening comments, you used the word disciplined. Is that -- are you sort of planning to take sort of a slower approach given the large amount that you've done in recent months? And can you just talk about the size of the pipeline that you have today for investments and what the composition is of it today as well?", "George Chapman", "Well, we're not going to comment on the size of the pipeline. But we continue to see really good projects. But we were, I think all of us a bit surprised at how large our investments were in 2010 and early 2011. And I think probably we'll slow a bit, but we never know. I mean, if you look at HCP and Ventas and ourselves, we had a great run, and there is still consolidation occurring in senior housing. And for that matter, we at Health Care REIT who do a lot of MOBs in acute care are seeing some opportunities as well in medical facilities. We're just not prepared to predict, Karin, how large our pipeline might be, but we are seeing -- we continue to see very good opportunity.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "The HMLE portfolios, entity level deals and which asset type are you seeing more or less of today?", "George Chapman", "We're still seeing more senior housing, increasing numbers of SNF packages. We're seeing [indiscernible] potential deals. We're seeing it all right now. I think everybody is really amazing, consolidating in the sector at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Doctrow of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Lots have been covered. I wanted to come back to just a couple of other things. So the entrance fee CCRCs and still -- if was reading the supplement right, it looked like the entrance fee component was sort of stable. I think those are backward-looking numbers in the fourth quarter, making a little progress on the rental side. Can you just give us a little more color about what's going on there and maybe bring us up to date since we're almost within a quarter pass of what state it was?", "George Chapman", "We just had  [indiscernible] our largest CCRC operator. And they are doing particularly well on the rental healthcare component, even adding units to his facilities and filling them very quickly. The CCRCs continue to move at pace, Jerry, unduly quickly. The economy and especially the housing market hasn't turned up, so it's just going to be very much blocking and tackling, and he is doing a very good job with it. We're pleased with our portfolio.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So you're seeing a little bit of incremental sales and [indiscernible] occupancy on the entrance fee side but not much. Is that sort of the way to\u2026", "George Chapman", "That's right. But in some of the facilities where we've repositioned them, including Greenville, we've seen very good growth in terms of occupancies, even on the entrance fee side. And we've repositioned another facility, as well, to add even more wellness, as well as a SNF component that we think will drive some very good growth in that as well. Stephanie Anderson, do you want to comment?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Yes. The [indiscernible] are entrance fees that actually have deposits have increased significantly over first quarter. And so [indiscernible] those moving in as well as operating income is ahead of budget.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I don't know if this is for Stephanie or back to George, but and your CapEx has got some expansions. Are those mostly the same properties, if I was reading it right?", "Stephanie Anderson", "They are. They're the healthcare component of the properties, and those will be opening in second quarter, and we expect those 2 to do very well.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great, thanks. And then again, I would sort of echo, I think, Karen's comments about [indiscernible] same-store stuff. You gave out a couple of numbers on senior housing but just your sense of occupancy rate movements, particularly as we get into the first quarter here or maybe outlook, can you give me a little color but how comfortable are you feeling with the performance on the operating assets?", "Scott Estes", "I'll take that, Jerry. This is Scott. I'd say we're very comfortable. I think the -- what we\u2019re seeing on the rate side and, obviously, we can try to give you guys some sense. We obviously did not have the investments in our portfolio a year ago, thus we began reporting once we did acquire them. But because you have the environment where you have some assets [indiscernible], I think if you will all recall when we announced these deals, we were basically assuming about a 5% longer-term NOI growth out of the Merrill Gardens and the Benchmark portfolios. And that's what they've generated historically. And then even for example Silverado, I recall, with an increase of 7.5% return this year going to 8.5%, talking about 13% growth. And Senior Star is similar, much more significant growth. So I think putting it all together and if you look at the same-store results this quarter because of the assets and fill-ups, the percentages would be extremely high. So again, long term, we still think everything's filling up nicely and are comfortable with 5% or better on average for the portfolio for the long term.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And last one for me. I don't want to repeat this step, but just on the coverage numbers on the Genesis stuff, there was a lot of numbers thrown out. So when you talk about sort of the 1.5 sort of your original underwritten numbers which was sort of a hybrid between 3 and 4 and then you talked about it being 2 now, and then I think you talked about it sort of worst-case being 1.2 to 1.3, so are those sort of trailing 12 current quarter annualized pre-management fee, post-management fee? Just to make sure I understand what the numbers are that I'm hearing.", "George Chapman", "Jerry, the 2:1 is pre. The 1.5 or so is after. And Scott, you want to comment on the 1.2, 1.3?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, that would be after management fees, as well, Jerry.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. So today -- if today they\u2019re running about 2:1 pre-management fee; 1:5 post-management fee, and it might go down to 1.2 to 1.3 if we were back to -- a post-management fee if we were back to kind of RUGs-III level. Is that\u2026", "Scott Estes", "[Indiscernible] improvements, et cetera.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, okay, okay. And all of those would be thinking of kind of I guess they're kind of a current quarter annualized or what you're saying the 2:1, is that sort of a trailing 12 or that's kind of where we stand today kind of go forward?", "Stephanie Anderson", "On the 2:1, that is where we stand today and also pretty consistently since RUGs-IV was implemented.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. I think that's all for me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I think my question is more geared towards John Thomas. You mentioned there's 3 MOB projects recently moved to completion. Can you just go into some of the details surrounding those \u2013 timing, location, some of the initial yields you're expecting?", "John Thomas", "This is John. Two of those are in the Northwest, anchored by the leading hospital system. They are a large ambulatory, freestanding emergency rooms with physician office space. So great affiliated suburban projects. And again as I mentioned, they opened early. And the occupancy on those is right at 80% kind of hospital and the freestanding physician space and yielding close to 8%. The largest project was the Loma Linda University Medical Center physician office building. It's 160,000 feet. As I mentioned, it opened a month early and 98% filled and initial yield right at 9%.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Okay. And just refilling the development pipeline, what have you recently broken ground on and what does that look like for the next 3 quarters?", "John Thomas", "On the medical -- [indiscernible] larger 100,000, 150,000-foot affiliated medical office buildings pre-leased at, at least 80%. I think our overall development pipeline of what's broken ground and pre-leased is closer to 85% to 87%. And again they're all with leading healthcare systems, all affiliated. The largest project under construction right now that's referenced in the book is almost a 300,000-foot physician office building for the New Virtua Hospital Campus in Vorhees, just not too far from Philadelphia. And that project is about 85% pre-leased at this point and includes a substantial amount of hospital space and thus hospital leasing.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Thanks, John. And this is probably geared towards Scott. What does the buyer profile look like when you look at -- if you're separating the dispositions into your loan book and then the real estate? Who buys the loans? And then currently, is it really current operators buying your real estate?", "Scott Estes", "Virtually all of the current operators who are repaying the loans are buying the real estate back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Co.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Again, back to the CMS-type question. I mean the reduction in the coverage ratio if you do end up with the cuts of 11.3% going to 12%. I guess my question is when I do look at all the different RUGs categories, you do notice that all the rehab and therapy categories are getting bigger cuts, most of those cuts are anyway between 15% to 20%. And just given the higher per diem rate that Genesis has within their own portfolio, it seems to suggest they have more exposure to these categories and are going to take a bigger cut. So how do you get comfortable? The number only goes to 12% when it seems like the percentage of cuts they may get may be higher than the 11.3% average that Medicare's putting into place?", "Stephanie Anderson", "This is Stephanie Anderson. And we actually have the cuts right now plus we've spent a lot of time over the weekend re-underwriting everything, making sure we understood the impact to our portfolio, as well as specifically to Genesis. Those numbers that we discussed and analyzed with Genesis, and we're very comfortable with them.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Very helpful. And then if a coverage does end up back at 1.2x, which is good that they're covering the rents, but if you do look at Genesis or any other skilled nursing operator out there, by the time you factor in the interest expense and any other leases they may be paying for, for assets that you don't own and all their other kind of general current obligations, it seems to suggest that quite a few nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities will start to become negative cash flow entities. I'm just kind of curious how sustainable that would be before this starts to become pressure on the rent.", "Stephanie Anderson", "We do not see that to be the case with any of our post acute or skilled nursing operators. We are very comfortable with where they are. Specifically in the case of Genesis, they do have the opportunity to convert some of their lower paying days to Medicare, improving the overall coverage. We still have great base in improving coverages due to their strong extant focus as well as their continued focus on the post-acute area.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then last question, what's your outlook at this point on Medicaid? And could that also be kind of an additional double whammy in addition to the Medicare issues that we're facing?", "Stephanie Anderson", "I would speak specifically, we just, as part of the discussion, when we look at the Medicare, the CMS proposal, we also dig in into the Medicaid discussion because as you know, CMS often, today, is very aware, and it's looking at an overall reimbursement to the post-acute nursing facilities. Our Genesis portfolio, as well as many of the other states, are still aiming up with a positive Medicaid increase of 1% to 2% in the states that we operate in. So we are not seeing a negative impact that everyone was concerned about.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So the funds you're getting is by July 1 when their budgets of Medicaid will be up probably 1% to 2% in the state you operate in?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Yes.", "Scott Estes", "I can tell you, Tayo, I was talking to George Hager yesterday. They currently believe their fiscal 2012 Medicaid average rate increase will be positive 1%.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Interesting. Okay. And then, George, just going back to the senior housing operating portfolio, just along Karen and Jerry's recommendations, is there any way kind of going forward to finally get a sense of what's going to be going on or what's going on individually in many of these key portfolios? I noticed from the disclosure this quarter that you started to lump everything together. But I think it would still be helpful to kind of get a sense what's happening in each of the deals simply because they were all so large.", "Scott Estes", "Understood. We hear your point. I'm thinking if we do think of it though as an aggregate portfolio and I do -- I know we'll be happy to give same-store results and add any aggregate portfolio and we will endeavor to extract some more color to give everyone a sense of how the individual components are doing.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "That's all for me.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Stephen Mead of Anchor Capital Advisors.", "Stephen Mead - ", "If you look at sort of what happened in 2011, my perception it was kind of an opportunistic year for the 3 major Health Care REITs. And as the capitalization in the balance sheet kind of stabilized at a much lower sort of cost of capital, going back to the question about sort of acquisition and yield on the acquisition and the kind of environment that you kind of see going forward in terms of continuing to put money to work at an accretive rate, at what point would you sort of say let's slow down a little bit here?", "George Chapman", "Well, I think that all of us should be looking at when the pricing becomes difficult to justify. The pricing, frankly, has moved up as some of the larger transactions have been announced. So we'll just see who applies the discipline and who doesn't. We certainly look at that every week and understand why you're asking the question. We do internally as well, and presumably Jay and Bev [ph] are doing it as well. We'll see.", "Stephen Mead - ", "But where are yields now looking at?", "George Chapman", "Well, yields moved down probably 50 basis points or so on Assisted Living. And Independent Living has always been sort of a mystery as to how low they can get depending on the quality of assets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Doctrow of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I just actually wanted to see how you were feeling about development, George, sort of a follow-on to Steve's question. You've always done a fair amount -- I think you've always talked about the need to sort of be kind of at the head of the curve I think was the phrase used on this call. So you know, I think people have been sort of nervous a little bit about some of the CCRCs and that sort of thing. But are you seeing sort of good development opportunities and how big a piece is that going to be as the business kind of go forward?", "George Chapman", "Well, we clearly didn\u2019t head to market exactly right on the CCRCs and we're not doing more but we're doing fine with them. They're very good assets, and probably in many respects the continuum of care, Jerry, in senior housing is going to be the wave of the future with a very small percentage allocated to volumes. So I wouldn't worry about that. But in terms of how we run the company, we're at 4% development right now. And as you well know, we've had great acquisition opportunities, both in senior housing and in John\u2019s space on the medical facility side. So we're not going to be doing a lot. We have some limits that we sort of placed as goals on both Chuck Herman and John Thomas. But we, on the other hand, do believe that especially right now in medical facilities that the opportunity to take advantage of the need for capital in great health systems and the ability to pre-lease it 80%, 85% level presents some opportunities that we're going to seize. But we think those kind of developments where we move directly from development to stable are pretty attractive. But we're always going to measure our development.", "John Thomas", "Jerry, this is John Thomas. I failed to mention and should have in both in March and in April, we completed 2 large hospital projects, as well. So everything we've got currently in process or under -- in the near term starts or in large ambulatory care centers. Every one of them, all of it\u2019s affiliated with leading healthcare systems and all of it\u2019s coming through our relationships that -- where they look to us to help them grow their organizations. But Loma Linda, we just completed that hospital, and they started paying rent in April, as well. So you'll see that the next quarter but -- some $220 million hospital project. So everything we've got under construction right now is very conservative, but larger ambulatory care centers affiliated with hospitals.", "George Chapman", "And, Jerry, I think that our goal is to not only do some state-of-the-art more customer-centric facilities, but also use this as an opportunity to deepen our relationships like we've done in senior housing and to do more monetizations of their more modern and existing facilities as well. So we have a clear goal to deepen relationships with 10, 15 hospitals as we go along and to continue to do all of their business, not just the development.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And on the senior housing side, you do some but more -- maybe more carefully underwritten or...", "George Chapman", "No, I think we tend not to do was our greenfield developments with new customers with very small exceptions. It's mainly master lease deals with some of our great operating partners or our [indiscernible] lease partners who we\u2019ve been in business with for 10, 15, 20 years. We feel very comfortable with that. And as you know, the development is not keeping pace with the growth in demand. And it's a very good time to do very selective development to add to an already very strong master lease portfolio.", "Operator", "And there are no further audio questions at this time. Mr. Chapman, are there any closing remarks?", "George Chapman", "No, just again, all of us thank you for your participation. And we will be available for follow-up questions as needed. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This will conclude today's conference call.

I am very pleased that this morning we announced results which speak to our continuing improvement. Stabilized community occupancy of 88.3% for the first quarter of 2011 is a 70 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2010, and a 40 basis point decrease over the fourth quarter of 2010. This is a typical seasonal decline.", "ADR for occupied units for stabilized communities in the first quarter of 2011 was $208.54 representing a 3.8% increase over the first quarter 2010 ADR. NOI is also higher, increasing almost 5.8% in the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010 to stabilized properties, and 12.2% overall including lease up properties.", "Our drive at Sunrise is focused on five strategic areas: number one, core operations that lead the sector in resident care and satisfaction; number two, increasing operating efficiency by controlling direct costs and increasing operating margins to maximize returns for both Sunrise and for our partners and owners from whom we manage; number three, we want to own as much as possible of what we manage, always with a strong bias towards best-in-class assets; number four, we want to rely on a strong balance sheet, capital markets opportunities and a solid financial reputation; number five, we want to grow earnings through additional profitability in current operations, new resident services, as well as development, acquisition, joint venture and last but not least brand expansion opportunities.", "Our core operations as demonstrated by our announced results are growing nicely, although we have not yet done a sufficient job of steadily controlling costs including direct labor and overhead. We have been successfully focused on supporting the quality of the Sunrise team to rigorous hiring practices and a very strong management structure.", "We have reduced yield overhead through a streamlining process which we believe will enable better control when needed, to new solid management tools. Our world is highly regulated and we are relied on to provide scepter leading care. We have been devoting great and increased resources to maintain our lead in this all important area, and we are humble when we see deficiencies.", "We have shifted the recruiting balance at Sunrise and now it successful attracts top candidates who are also highly sought by competitors.", "Our recently announced purchase agreement with a group of funds affiliated with Morgan Stanley on the heels of our purchase of a joint venture along with the CNL Lifestyle, it clips us in a vastly different position versus our announced ownership goal. These deals represent 44 class A communities. Of course our debt balance is higher as a result of these, but we want to remind you that these are essentially non-recourse obligations. I also want to assure everyone that we are not a buying spree. We will conservatively judge opportunities, weighing the upside of acquisitions against the cash and debt costs to Sunrise.", "Also remember, in both of these transactions while we were enabling our upside, we were also protecting our long term status. Our capital markets and borrower status positively flipped in the past few months, with both the successful completion of our $86.5 million convertible debt offering, underwritten by Stifel Nicolaus and KeyBank, and our new $50 million credit facility commitment from KeyBank. Here again we hope you see that we don't incur debt for general corporate purposes. We raise money when we see an attractive opportunity or to defend our long term position.", "Unfortunately, recent events in Pennsylvania compel me to comment. We had a shocking and (inaudible) incident where in an isolated incident three associates were arrested. We received a licensed revocation notice, as from the Pennsylvanian Department of Public Welfare for this community. A move which we consider totally unwanted and we immediately appealed.", "Contrary to some claims I've heard, I'd like to offer a few facts: one, we were immediately and totally co-operative with the Regulators and Police, and we work closely with our residents and families, including my reaching out to the families that were involved in spending a lot of time at the community myself; number two, nobody wants justice here more than we do. If somebody violates our trust or our residents, we want to see that justice is done. Number three, a Department of Public Welfare spokesperson made harsh comments about our corporate culture. These comments were ridiculous and damaging and made by someone who knows nothing about our fine corporate culture.", "Until this, we had full licenses from that very same Department of Public Welfare in 16 of 17 communities, with only one provisional license. And the five communities that they referred to that we had sold many months ago were part of an overall restructuring where we sold over 50 communities worldwide.", "Now please don't misunderstand. We, like all companies have deficiencies at times and we will always respond to those sincerely and vigorously. And that\u2019s exactly what we've offered to the Department of Public Welfare here, and that offer from us stands. Though this situation is isolated and it is not financially material, it is of huge importance to all of us in the Sunrise family who care very deeply about the well being of our residents and about our deservedly great reputation built over 30 years.", "And this brings them to my last point, our reputation. The Sunrise brand and the Sunrise signature experience are all important and is strong and growing. As we celebrate 30 years of champing the quality of all seniors, we have introduced a fresh new logo, not because we had nothing else to do, but because we want everyone to take a fresh look at Sunrise and know as I do, and everyone here knows that there is no better place for a senior you love.", "Marc Richards will now provide more detail about our operating results for the first quarter.", "Marc Richards", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Earlier today we filed our 10-Q and consistent with year-end reporting, we filed an 8-K containing supplemental disclosure regarding various operating results and liquidity metrics related to our communities and consolidated operating results. We will continue to furnish this information on a go-forward basis to provide enhanced visibility into our community operating activity.", "My discussion this morning will be focused on our consolidated operating results and the various components of Sunrise's earnings for the first quarter of 2011. Greg Neeb will address our community operating results in more detail later in the call.", "Turning to our consolidated operating results. During the quarter, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $17.7 million or $0.32 per fully diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $16 million or $0.29 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2010. The change between periods was primarily driven by lower management fees and transaction expenses related to our venture investments, which were partially offset by lower salary expense in 2011, and restructuring costs that we incurred in 2010 but not in 2011. I'll address each of these areas later on the call.", "As I mentioned on our last call, we began utilizing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDAR among other metrics to evaluate our operating performance. We have adjusted net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense and further excludes certain non-cash gains and losses, and other items of income or expense, including costs related to our 2010 restructuring efforts.", "Adjusted EBITDA declined from $16.2 million to $11.7 million quarter-over-quarter, and adjusted EBITDAR declined from $30.9 million to $28.1 million. The decline for the period was primarily due to lower fee income.", "General and administrative expenses declined at $32.4 million for the quarter, compared to $33.3 million for the same period in 2010. Our first quarter 2011 G&A includes $1.5 million of professional fees associated with two venture transactions. These transactions resulted in the formation of a 29 community venture with CNL, and our forthcoming purchase of an 80% interest in a 15 community portfolio.", "Further, G&A expense included $3.2 million in severance costs related to the reduction of 42 physicians at our corporate and regional offices, as well as a $2 million retention bonus. Our first quarter 2010 G&A included $5.9 million of professional fees associated with the litigation that was resolved during 2010.", "As we previously disclosed, we sold or terminated management contracts relating to 32 communities during 2010. As a result, our management fees for the quarter declined from $29.4 million during the first quarter of 2010 to $24.2 million this period. Additionally, Sunrise's share of losses on investments and unconsolidated communities increased by $6.2 million quarter-over-quarter. This line item includes our share of transaction and refinancing costs of $4 million associated with the formation and type of structuring costs of our new venture with CNL.", "Before I move on to net operating income from our consolidated lease communities, I'd like to mention that we now consolidate the operating results from six of the 29 communities within the new CNL venture. In connection with this transaction, we entered into operating leases with these six communities and accordingly have reflected $9.7 million in resident fee income, $5.6 million of community expense for consolidated communities and $3.9 million of community lease expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of 2011.", "In our supplemental disclosure we have reflected this net operating income in the appropriate joint venture pool rather than in our consolidated leased NOI, as the mortgage debt in related assets are all held within the venture. On our first quarter 2011 consolidated operating results, excluding the impact of the six CNL venture communities, were also impacted by $2.8 million in net operating income from our consolidated and lease communities, as compared to $2.7 million in NOI from these communities in the first quarter of 2010. Net operating income is income from operations excluding depreciation, lease expense and impairment charges related to these communities.", "Moving on to the balance sheet. Our unrestricted cash decreased from $66.7 million at December 31, 2010 to $41.5 million at March 31, 2011. The decrease in cash is primarily due to the payment of annual bonuses in the first quarter of 2011, our initial investment in the CNL venture and a principal debt pay down to extend the community mortgage. Our outstanding consolidated debt is now $154.7 million, compared to $163 million at the end of 2010.", "Further, current maturities of debt have declined from $80.2 million at year end to $53 million at the end of March 2011 due to extending the mortgage on our Connecticut Avenue community.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Neeb. Greg?", "Greg Neeb", "Thanks Marc. Beginning this on our fourth quarter conference call, we have modified our call format, our goals to provide transparency into our principal business lines, namely our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures and our management agreements. We intend to accomplish this by providing useful operations data within each group, as well as describe how those operations affect our asset evaluation and financial performance.", "In addition, I will elaborate on a number of key transactions within each business line to enhance visibility on the impact to overall value. Supplemental 8-K filed this morning, provides information broken down by these business lines and is a reflection on how we manage our business.", "Before I get started with an overview, I would like to stress that we believe the new community concept, the group's assets by joint venture better captures the financial arrangements and incorporates our loans and joint venture documents. These generally pool cash flows and cross-collateralize the assets. You may also continue to reference our comparable community data which is disclosed as part of our supplemental information contained in our 8-K.", "Turning now to our overall performance for the quarter. As Mark mentioned earlier, overall trends for Sunrise communities continues to improve. For the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010, stabilized community occupancy is up 70 basis points, ADR per occupied unit for stabilized communities increased 3.8% and NOI has increased almost 5.8% for stabilized properties and 12.2% overall.", "When we break the results down on a regional level for which we have nine regions plus the United Kingdom, seven reported positive NOI for the first quarter of 2011 over the first quarter of 2010, with six of nine reporting growth of 6.4% or higher. ADR increased in all regions for first quarter 2011 over first quarter 2010. Operating trends for the Sunrise lease communities were positive for the quarter. NOI for stabilized lease communities was up 7.4% for the first quarter of 2011 over first quarter 2010. Occupancy was slightly lower or 88.8% for the first quarter of 2011 versus 89.2% for first quarter of 2010. These properties contain approximately 13% skilled nursing where we had an approximately 25% increase in ancillary revenue due to increased rates and resident days.", "Our 10 consolidated communities consist of a variety of asset types and other properties we consolidate, but don't know on 100%. As a result, trends are not necessarily revealing on an ongoing basis. Specific information about important individual assets including Connecticut Avenue and Monterey, which both trending positively is available on our 8-K. Three communities in Montreal that are wholly-owned have not leased up according to our expectations. The outstanding principal balance is not recourse to us, but we have provided operating debts of guarantees to the lender. The principal balance of $48.1 million was due on April 30th, 2011. We are seeking a loan extension, while we market the communities for sale and explore other alternatives.", "Operating trends for the venture and managed communities for the first quarter of 2011 were strong, with ADR occupancy and NOI, all up. Net operating income for joint ventures was up 6.3% while NOI for managed stabilized communities was up 5.5%. Now I want to highlight a major announcement that occurred relating to one of our ventures. In April 2011, we announced that we had entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Morgan Stanley to purchase their 80% ownership interest and an entity that owns 15 senior living facilities for a purchase price of approximately $45 million.", "After the transaction Sunrise will own 100% of the equity interest of these assets. These 15 Sunrise purpose-built mansions, owned by the venture, generated an unleveraged NOI yield of 6.2% based on 2010 actuals which includes a deduction for Sunrise's 7% management fee. From an asset performance perspective, average unit occupancy for the portfolio, this portfolio in 2010 was 87.3% as compared to a peak occupancy level of 91.6% in 2008. The portfolio has nine communities concentrated in Southern California that have lagged in recovery due to economic conditions there and have not yet rebounded as quickly as other parts of the portfolio.", "In conjunction with this purchase transaction, we have a non-binding term fee with the mortgage lender to modify the existing debt with a $25 million partial pay down and a cash sweep through maturity. The modification is significant on several fronts: first, the modified loan would provide relief under the existing debt service covered requirements and alleviate concern of the existing debt default. Second, the term of the loan would be extended from June 14, 2012 to June 14, 2015 and provide the runway necessary to optimizing value. Third, since October 2009, Sunrise has subordinated 3% of its 7% management fee, and as required, under the existing loan documents. Under the modified terms, Sunrise expects to earn its full 7% management fee.", "Lastly, regarding this portfolio, the asset quality is high. Ranging in age from 5-8 years, these assets are clustered in major metropolitan areas and possess characteristics that will outperform this sector over time we believe. Both ADR and NOI margin significantly exceed our North American averages.", "The Morgan Stanley partner buyout is expected to be financed with the proceeds of our issuance of $86.25 million; a 5% junior subordinated convertible notes. These notes were issued in April 2011 and are due in 2041. Also in April, we entered into a commitment letter with KeyBank regarding the terms of a new $50 million senior revolving line of credit, the closing of subject to customary closing conditions and the preparation of definitive documents. The line will contain customary financial covenants and will be secured by our partnership interest in the pool of 29 Sunrise properties.", "Now I will turn to a discussion of non-core assets. As a part of the German settlement, we created a liquidating trust of assets to be sold for the benefit of participating banks. Initially we guaranteed a minimum payment recovery under the agreement of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter of 2011, we sold two wholly-owned operating communities and one land parcel which were part of the liquidating trust for approximately $8.4 million, further reducing the guarantee to approximately $29.9 million at quarter end.", "Moving on to loan balance maturities in defaults. As of today, our line of credit balance under our (inaudible) line of credit is completely paid off and we have $13.5 million in letters of credit outstanding which are fully cash collateralized. At the joint ventures, we have $635 million of long-term debt that is in default as of March 31, 2011. As of today, an additional $134 million of joint venture debt is in default, and $48 million consolidated debt is in default. The $134 million lender has notified the venture of its intent to pursue remedies under the loan documents, including cooperation and a foreclosure.", "Alternatively, we are in active discussions with both our partner and lender to find a more satisfactory outcome. Of this total $769 million of defaulted joint venture debt today which includes the $134 million I just referenced, $365 million relates to the mortgage loan which we contemplate to modify upon closing of the purchase agreement with Morgan Stanley. We continue to work through the remaining defaults with our lenders and partners. Back to you Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Greg, thank you, Marc. As you can see, we are determined, we are optimistic, we are pleased with our recent results and we look forward to continued improvement in the coming quarters. With that, we are ready to begin the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Jerry Doctrow with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "Mark, I guess I just wanted to start with kind of expenses sort of overall. You've had some severance, I think you identified both in your press release and you touched on the call that bringing down expenses is sort of one of those items. So, can you give me a little more color I guess, on sort of two levels; one is on the property level, I think on lease same-store I think it's still in the 20's rather than maybe the 30's on operating margin, and then on G&A you kind of had this goal again under 100. Where are some of those opportunities to go forward?", "Mark Ordan", "Sure. On the operating side I would, I don't mean to be too glib but I would call it pilot error. I would say that we have not done a good job of controlling expenses overall, especially direct labor. I think that\u2019s something that we are very focused on in tackling. I think clear savings that are achievable were also rolling out a new labor management tool which I think is going to make that much more practical and reliable.", "On the overhead side, I am in a way less concerned because I see a clear path of bringing our head down from where it is and we've made many changes which will bear fruit in the coming months. So certainly on the latter issue, I know that we can manage that number down without fracturing what we do. And again on the first, I think you should expect in the coming months to see improvement on the expenses and margins.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "And on G&A, is there kind of a target that\u2019s sort of below this kind of $100 million. I think you're already well below the $100 million run rate or we need to wait and see?", "Mark Ordan", "We haven\u2019t announced a firm target, but our goal is to get it well below that number.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "And I just wanted to maybe touch on the sort of the debt. I think Greg maybe talked about the fact that there is sort of an increase now on sort of [AB debt]. Can we get a little bit more color on, I know its Morgan Stanley, so, where is kind of the rest of it and are there operating guarantees at issue, just a little more color, sort of the mechanics there. Is that stuff likely to get resolved? How long it will get resolved, that kind of thing?", "Greg Neeb", "If you look at the Morgan Stanley purchase, I mean that by itself of the $769 million of joint venture debt that\u2019s in the fall. That\u2019s $365 million. So that takes the number down to a little over $400 million. And then we've got a couple of other things that we are actively working on, and you can see from our joint venture debt scheduled that we've had some maturity defaults and some other defaults that have been outstanding, leaving some for sometime as late as last year. But we are certainly working on those and are optimistic about the majority of those. There is a new default that I specifically mentioned and that one is for $134 million, and that one is a more difficult discussion at this point.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "And the defaults, are you sort of violating covenants or is it the fact that the terms are due or may be any other color as to what's [different]?", "Greg Neeb", "The default that we had on the Morgan Stanley venture is a default that was a debt service coverage base default that occurred at the end of the quarter. Of course we are in deep negotiation with them to pay down and extend on the terms that I referenced earlier. So, that was one that was a debt service coverage issue. We do have several however, that are more maturity defaults, including the $134 million and a couple others. So, we have a $66 million, so I am just looking at the scale of $66 million joint venture debt that is a maturity default. So, we are working on those too. Obviously, for our purpose the goal is to get those extended and give ourselves the ability to work on the assets and put them to a place that\u2019s refinanceable.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "And I guess just coming back, Mark to you, or any of you actually. We are well in to the second quarter, any just sense of sort of move-in, enquiries and sort of how you're feeling about rates and occupancy go forward. I mean you had very good year-over-year numbers. How are we sensing sort of this spring?", "Mark Ordan", "I've heard what our competitors have said I would say in the [comments] I've gotten from Nick and I would say we are in line with it, I think it seemed pretty good, not a very clear path, but we are pretty optimistic. We see good demand and I couldn\u2019t give you a forward-looking projection, but I feel pretty good about demand and rate stability.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "I've a got a lot of little details, maybe we'll take them offline just in terms of some of the other specific moving parts, but I'll jump off. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "Mark Ordan", "Operator?", "Operator", "Yes, sir?", "Mark Ordan", "If there are no further questions, I will close the call and thank everybody for their continued support and confidence in Sunrise Senior Living.", "Operator", "We do just have a gentlemen queue up. Do you want to take that caller sir?", "Mark Ordan", "Sure.", "Operator", "Okay. Go ahead sir.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel Nicolaus", "It's just Jerry. I'll come back and talk to you offline. That\u2019s fine. Thanks.", "Mark Ordan", "No problem Jerry. Thank you everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Smith. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim Smith", "Thank you, and welcome to Sunrise Senior Living\u2019s Investor Conference Call. This is Tim Smith of Sunrise\u2019s Investor Relations. Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being recorded and the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.", "During the course of this call, the company will make various remarks concerning management\u2019s expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks, Tim. Joining me this morning are Marc Richards and Greg Neeb who has dialed in remotely. Let me may begin my remarks. I\u2019ve heard people talk here that it looks like they know how to restructure a company, but can they run the railroad?", "I\u2019m pleased that in our second quarter results and first half of 2011, we revealed an operation that can produce strong results in a difficult environment. As we announced last evening and Greg Neeb will review in greater detail, we achieved year-over-year gains in occupancy revenue per unit NOI and adjusted EBITDAR. While our second quarter occupancy dropped slightly from Q1 we have recouped a large portion of that in July.", "While occupancy is the Holy Grail of our sector, I\u2019ll remind you that Sunrise stands apart from the other senior living operators by running higher end, higher priced and overwhelmingly private pay communities. Our average daily rates are quite strong and we manage them carefully. When we saw others heavily price promoting in the spring, we held the line until the summer when we felt the economic conditions was so persistently poor that we had to act preemptively.", "We provide the highest levels of service and care in our sector to truly make good on our mission to enable seniors to age in place. Our demand is need-driven and our target market is families who want the very best and understand that while Sunrise is not inexpensive, we actually provide great and irreplaceable value.", "You\u2019ll hear more and more about value from us at Sunrise because we don\u2019t think that the market fully understands the extraordinary experience of living at Sunrise. Our 24-hour a day devotion to seniors has been in Sunrise\u2019s DNA for 30 years really doesn\u2019t cost much more than a typical senior housing experience. You see, while we\u2019re very proud of the hundreds of special touches in our buildings, it\u2019s that care and devotion to all seniors that\u2019s uniquely Sunrise", ".", "This experience is not just more affordable than many think. It\u2019s also, as I said earlier irreplaceable. I just received a letter, atypical of the letters that I\u2019ve received and I\u2019d like to read it to you because it expresses a common theme. Dear, Mr. Ordan, as you can see, I\u2019m a resident of Sunrise of blank.", "In June of this year, my wife passed away and I want to tell you about the personnel here, all of them. The employees here have been so kind and caring to me that I cannot find enough words to express my feelings. It has been a difficult time for me and they have made my life here so much more easier by just being with me. I thought you might like to know this, sincerely a resident.", "This letter is just one of the many that I frequently receive and this is why that while we are pleased with the results of our financial restructuring activities we\u2019re far more focused on the day-to-day managing of our over 300 very special communities.", "We are actively working on strengthening every facet of the company while streamlining the way we operate and responding to market conditions. The core of our business is care and we are in the midst of a thoughtful reworking of our structure here. This by the way was prompted by direct feedback from our nurses and executive directors, a group we listen to very carefully.", "Similarly in food, we have restructured our operations, recruited top culinary talent, rolled out a great new menu with much more to come. My mom is among the thousands who eat our own cooking at Sunrise and we want her and them to be very happy.", "I\u2019m also very happy to report to you that we are in the midst of the largest and broadest community remodel process in Sunrise history. This process is managed by a small, but very hard working group of assets and facilities managers along with very talented designers. For example, I would call out that our HCP portfolio under both the Sunrise and Brighton Gardens flats is part of the core of all we do and all of them are undergoing a thorough remodel.", "I\u2019m sure you all know that an updated physical plant really helps drive results and we are confident that this surge of well spent money will support positive trends. As you would hope, we have been heavily investing in CapEx in the portfolios we recently acquired and here too we think that this spending is the necessary foundation for ongoing success.", "This remodeling effort is not only in portfolio (inaudible) Even our Ventas portfolio, which has always received careful attention is receiving renewed property-by-property focus.", "Before hearing from Mark and Greg, I do want to tell you that as promised we are in the next few weeks taking active steps to reduce overhead. Today I am announcing, an overhead reduction effort, which we estimate will reduce spending by over $5 million annually by eliminating many physicians.", "While we never like reduction plans they are necessary, as we have said often and publicly for the last several months. When we do take such a step, we do it with professionalism and sensitivity to the careers of the people, who will be leaving.", "Having said that, we see strong avenues for growth, which will not countermand our efficiency increases. Let me point areas we are currently developing, which we think and in combination add materially to our bottom line; One, increased community efficiency including unit conversions. Number two, ancillary services, three, community redevelopment, four brand expansion and five targeted major market ground up developments.", "In summary, our results are solid and growing. Our market positioning and community investments are very strong. Our focus on talent and operating profitability is unwavering and our growth opportunities are diverse and strong.", "I will now turn the call over to, Marc Richards.", "Marc Richards", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. And thank you all for joining our second quarter conference call. I will focus my discussion this morning on Sunrise\u2019s consolidated operating results for three and six months ended June 30th, 2011, as well as the impact our 2011 transactions have had on our recently filed financial statements.", "During the second quarter, we reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.3 million or $0.02 per fully diluted share, as compared to net income of $46.3 million or $0.81 per fully diluted share in 2010. The change between periods was primarily driven by a $52 million gain associated with our German debt restructuring and $12.7 million of management contract buyout fees recognized during the second quarter of 2010.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $39.1 million as compared to $32 million for the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to incremental EBITDAR resulting from our AL US and CC3 acquisitions and lower general and administrative expenses.", "We have adjusted net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense to further exclude certain non-cash gains and losses and other items of income or expense including cost related to our restructuring efforts and arriving at adjusted EBITDAR.", "General and administrative expenses were $27.6 million for the quarter compared to $28.3 million for the same period in 2010. Our Q2, 2011 G&A includes $1.1 million of severance expenses, $1 million of professional fees associated with our recently announced transactions and $2 million of non-cash stock compensation expense.", "Our Q2, 2010 G&A included $1.1 million of stock compensation expense and $2.2 million of legal fees incurred associated with our HCP litigation that was resolved later in 2010.", "Management fees for the quarter were $24.4 million and included $1 million of fee income from the AL US Venture which we will no longer earn as a result of acquiring a 100% interest in the venture. Accordingly, these fees will be eliminated going forward.", "Before I move on to net operating income from our consolidated and leased communities I\u2019d like to mention that we began consolidating the operating results from the 15 AL US communities on June 2nd, 2011.", "Our consolidated results include $6.7 million of resident fee income and $4.2 million of community expense for consolidated communities associated with the AL US portfolio. And as I mentioned last quarter, we consolidated six of the 29 communities within the new CNL venture as of January 2011.", "Accordingly, we have reflected $10.2 million in resident fee income, $5.9 million of community expense for consolidated communities and $4.2 million of community lease expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the second quarter of 2011.", "In our supplemental 8-K disclosure, we have reflected the net operating income from these six consolidated CNL communities in the appropriate joint venture pool rather than in our consolidated leased NOI.", "As the mortgage debt and related assets are all held within the venture.", "And for comparability purposes, our supplemental disclosures reflect the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating results of the AL US communities in the aggregate for the periods prior to June 2nd, 2011 and our consolidated leased NOI rather than as a venture.", "Our second quarter 2011 consolidated and leased community net operating income, excluding the impact of the six CNL consolidated venture communities and the 15 AL US communities increased $2.7 million quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily due to continued lease up at our Qu\u00e9bec communities and higher average daily rates on our stabilized communities. Net operating income is income from operations, excluding depreciation, lease expense and impairment charges related to these communities.", "Turning to our year-over-year results, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $16.4 million or $0.29 per fully diluted share as compared to net income of $30.3 million or $0.53 per fully diluted share in the first six months of 2010. This significant year-over-year change was driven by a $52 million gain associated with our German debt restructuring and $13.5 million of buyout fees earned in the first half of 2010.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the first six months of 2011 were $67.1 million as compared to $63 million last year. This increase of $4.1 million is primarily due to incremental EBITDAR from our AL US and CC3 acquisitions and lower G&A.", "These positive results were partially offset by lower management and professional fee income due to terminated management contracts. General and administrative expenses for the first six months of 2011 were $60 million compared to $61.6 million in 2010.", "Our 2011 G&A includes $2.1 million in professional fees associated with our CNL and AL US transactions and $3.7 million of stock compensation expense. Further, G&A expense included $4.5 million in severance costs related to the reduction of 62 physicians at our corporate and regional offices as well as a $2 million retention bonus.", "Our 2010 G&A for the six month period includes $2 million of stock compensation expense and $8.1 million of legal fees incurred associated with the HCP litigation that was resolved later in 2010.", "Management fees for the first six months of 2011 were $48.6 million which includes $2.4 million in fee income related to AL US that will be eliminated on a go-forward basis.", "For the same period last year, management fees were $52.8 million which included a $11.4 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been terminated.", "Our year-to-date 2011 consolidated operating results were also impacted by $59.6 million in net operating income from our consolidated and leased communities as compared to $44.8 million during 2010 an increase of $14.8 million.", "The 2011 consolidation of the six New York CC3 communities accounts for $8.4 million of the increase and the consolidation of the AL US portfolio accounts for an additional $2.5 million of the increase.", "Moving onto the balance sheet, our outstanding consolidated debt has increased from a $163 million at the end of 2010 to $565 million at the end of June, 2011. We issued $86.3 million of junior subordinated convertible notes in April of 2011.", "This increase also reflects the now consolidated debt of the AL US portfolio in the amount of $325 million. The principal amount of the debt was $340 million at the end of June, however, our balance sheet reflects the estimated fair value of the debt at the date of acquisition as required under the accounting rules.", "The asset side of the balance sheet also reflects the consolidation of this portfolio, including a corresponding increase in property and equipment of approximately $412 million, representing the estimated fair value of the acquired real estate assets.", "I will now turn the call over to our Chief Investment and Administrative Officer, Greg Neeb. Greg?", "Gregory Neeb", "Thanks, Marc. Continuing our goal of providing transparency into our principal business lines, we will provide useful operations data within each of our asset groups, as well as describe how those operations affect our asset valuation and financial performance.", "Mainly we will focus on our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures and our management agreements which is a reflection of how we manage our business. In addition I will elaborate on a number of key transactions within each business line to enhance visibility on the impact to overall value.", "The supplemental 8-K filed yesterday provides additional information and breaks down these business lines into further detail. You may also continue to reference our comparable community data, which is disclosed as part of our Supplemental Information contained in our 8-K.", "I will now turn to our overall performance for the quarter. As, Marc mentioned earlier, overall trends for Sunrise communities continue to be positive. Comparing the second quarter 2011 to the second quarter of 2010, stabilized community occupancy is up 40 basis points, average revenue per occupied unit for stabilized community increased 5.2% and NOI increased 10.3% for stabilized properties and 14.4% overall.", "When we break the results down on a regional level for which we have nine regions plus the United Kingdom, all regions reported positive NOI growth and average revenue per occupied unit growth for the second quarter 2011 over the second quarter 2010.", "Operating trends for the Sunrise leased communities were positive for the quarter. NOI for stabilized leased communities was up 10.1% for the second quarter 2011 over the second quarter 2010. Occupancy was slightly lower or 88.3% for the second quarter 2011 versus 88.6% for the second quarter 2010.", "As mentioned on our last call, these properties contain approximately 13% skilled nursing where we had a 32% increase in ancillary revenue due to increased rates in resident days. This revenue stream will be affected by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid services CMS announced last week that it is reducing payments for skilled nursing facilities by $3.87 billion in fiscal 2012.", "Based on preliminary analysis and the limited information contained in the CMS announcement and assuming that the payment reduction have been in place for all of the first quarter of 2011, the company estimates that reported first quarter 2000 \u2013 consolidated net income and adjusted EBITDAR and EBITDA would have each been reduced by approximately $1 million.", "Skilled nursing units comprise approximately 3% of the total unit capacity of the 316 senior living facilities operated by the company. Most of this impact is in our leased community portfolio. Our 25 consolidated communities consists a variety of asset types and other properties we consolidate but don\u2019t own 100%. Specific information about important individual assets including Connecticut Avenue and Monterey are available in our 8-K.", "Of note this quarter the recently purchased 16 asset AL US portfolio is now included in our consolidated community totals in our 8-K as discussed by, Mark earlier.", "As I stated in my first quarter remarks this high quality portfolio has nine communities concentrated in Southern California that have lagged the recovery due to local economic conditions driving flat year-over-year results. We believe that as condition improves so will the performance in these properties.", "Three communities in Montreal that are wholly owned have lagged their expectations, but we now believe that with our focus on these properties, we can overtime create significant value. The outstanding loan balance relating to these communities is non-recourse to us. But we have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lender. We are not currently funding under these operating deficit guarantee.", "With principal balance of approximately $48 million was due on April 30th, 2011. We intend to reconfigure a significant portion of the adaptable real estate in suite buildings from assisted living to memory care where our demand is quite strong. The lender has sent not binding indicative terms and conditions that we are generally agreeable to for a loan extension underwriting this revised business plan.", "Operating trends for venture and managed communities for the second quarter of 2011 were strong with average revenue per occupied unit our occupancy and NOI are all up over the second quarter of 2010. Net operating income for stabilized joint ventures was up 13.9% while NOI for stabilized managed communities was up 8.3%.", "On our last call I discussed the mortgage maturity of one of our joint venture portfolios that occurred in April 2011 and on May 4th, 2011 a JV was notified by the lender that in event a default had occurred the loan is a $133 million and it\u2019s collateralized by six communities in the venture. On August 2nd, 2011, we and our venture partner transferred ownership of the portfolio to a new joint venture owned 70% by a wholly owned subsidiary of CNL Lifestyle Properties and 30% by us.", "As part of our new venture agreement, from the start of year \u201804 to the end year of \u201806 we will have a buyout option to purchase CNL 70% interest for a 16% IRR. In addition, the new venture modified the existing loan in the amount of $133 million to provide for among other things, one, the pay down of the loan by approximately $28.7 million and two, secure of the existing maturity default by extending the maturity date of the loan to April 2014 subject to two one-year extension rights under certain circumstances. In connection with the transaction, we contributed $8.1 million and CNL contributed $19 million for the venture.", "In the UK one venture with 15 communities has mortgage loans to value covenants and debt service covenants. It is uncertain, whether the venture will continue to be in compliance with these covenants. The mortgage loan had a balance of $644 million on June 30th.", "Operating statistics for this portfolio are described in our supplemental 8-K. If the venture does breach one or both of these covenants and the default is not cured, the lender could pursue options which are adverse to the venture, including foreclosure and/or cancellation of our management contracts. However, we have not guaranteed the principal balance of this loan or provided, an operating deficit guarantee.", "During the six months ended June 30th, 2011, we recognized $3.7 million in management fees from this venture and our entire UK segment recorded $2.6 million in income from operations. The venture is working with the lender to initiate a preemptive waiver and satisfactory outcome for all the parties.", "Overall, Sunrise venture have total debt of $2.6 billion as of June 30th, 2011. Of this $2.6 billion, there is approximately $300 million of debt that is in default. This is down from the $635 million at the end of the first quarter, primarily attributable to our work with respect to our AL US portfolio.", "We are in active discussions with both our venture partners and our lenders to work through these remaining defaults and achieve a mutually satisfactory outcome for all parties.", "Back to you Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks, Greg and Marc. Operator, we will now respond to any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you sir (Operator instructions) we\u2019ll go first to Jerry Doctrow from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks, good morning. A handful of things, on the G&A maybe first, and I don\u2019t know which Mark wants to answer this, but do you have a sense as to sort of the ramp I mean, I think what you said is you would say, $5 million annually, if I heard you correctly. And I was just trying to get a sense of how much that we see, say next quarter versus sort of over time?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, the \u2013 this is Mark Ordan. The reduction that we\u2019re talking about are mostly hitting in the \u2013 starting in the next few week. So you\u2019ll see both in this quarter severance expense and the start of those savings. That\u2019s an annualized run rate savings that we\u2019re projecting. So obviously, the bulk of that which you\u2019ll see \u2013 starting in the fourth quarter and 2012.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That\u2019s great. And then just, Mark on a little more color on sort of the sequential occupancy and then you said it was sort of rebounding, so I guess what I was trying to think about is kind of for modeling purposes where we should be thinking about occupancy for the third quarter and you\u2019ve talked about perhaps doing some discounting and that sort of things. So what should we be thinking about in terms of just rate growth and that sort of stuff as we think about third?", "Mark Ordan", "Yes, well sort of going back to my comment in the spring, we felt pretty good about things. We saw others fairly steeply discounting and we didn\u2019t see a great reason to do it. And our results in the spring were off a little bit, but not a lot.", "So we felt comfortable as we approach the summer and the economic news was so dispiriting, we felt that we ought to make sure that we don\u2019t lag behind. The discounting was very selective, it was really on units that had been in inventory for a while in many cases, in many parts of the country we didn\u2019t have to adjust rates down at all. So it really was a very minor hit. Our ADRs continued to be strong.", "We then saw in July which is normally a strong month for us that there was a significant pick up which recouped most of the loss that we experienced before and it\u2019s one month, one week into August, we continue to be up. I can\u2019t prophecy what the rest of the third quarter will be.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "But just in terms of directionally say so you were \u2013 what you\u2019re saying is sort of if you look at the world today you\u2019ve kind of recouped that 50 basis point sequential decline you had back to where you were...?", "Mark Ordan", "Partly yes.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then let\u2019s see is there \u2013 are there potential for any more JV buyouts there may be you have talked about a couple of \u2013 you\u2019ve done two now, anything else sort of on the horizon?", "Mark Ordan", "Yes I\u2019m glad you asked that, Jerry because when I was reading my script I left that off of my list. So there are still potential additional JV buyout opportunities and we look at other possible acquisitions. In a consolidating environment we think that there could be other opportunities for us both within our current portfolio and perhaps even outside.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And there is few leases and some management contracts that start maturing 2013, I think one with basically SNH or HRP you may call it. And then you have also some other management contracts. Is that stuff that creates risk you think of re negotiation or loss or are you thinking that sort of that far ahead?", "Mark Ordan", "In reverse order, we are absolutely thinking out far ahead, and I\u2019m sure, when there\u2019s a maturity, there\u2019s renewal risk. We think they\u2019re great managers of these properties and we hope that we\u2019ll continue to be, but there is always that chance.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then, just CapEx, I think you talked about the investment and properties and that sort of thing. Is the current sort of rate for CapEx sort of the right one or what \u2013 how should we think about CapEx spending as we go forward?", "Marc Richards", "Yes, I think what\u2019s happening now by \u2013 on our part and on our capital partners or landlords\u2019 part I think is really \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to put it but terrific. I think across the board, we are investing in our physical plants. And I think that in one cases where that had lagged, it made it that much harder for somebody \u2013 to get somebody to move in. So I think we\u2019re spending carefully but briskly really across the portfolio and I think and to me wearing my sales hat, I think it should have a significant effect on the company.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. But in terms of just the overall volume or sort of CapEx spending is the second quarter kind of run-rate number sort of a good number or is it going to move up from there materially or?", "Marc Richards", "It will move up. We\u2019ll be spending more, but and a lot of that spending is from our \u2013 is on our ambulance part.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Your CapEx on the balance sheet sort to speak or on the income statement is not going to move up that materially?", "Marc Richards", "Correct. It will move up because a lot of the spending started in the last few weeks. So we\u2019ll move up from what you see in the second quarter.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And any sense? Just magnitude or...", "Marc Richards", "I have to get back to that.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And last one from me and I\u2019ll jump off. Just on the CNL deal I think the one item we just want to clarify. So your percentage ownership stake in that is still the same after you moved into the new venture or was there a change in sort of your ownership stake?", "Mark Ordan", "No it went from 20% to 30%.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "It went from 20% to 30%?", "Mark Ordan", "Yes.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right, thanks. That\u2019s all for me.", "Mark Ordan", "Okay, Jerry. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Mark Ordan", "Okay, operator well it seems like that\u2019s it. So everybody \u2013 okay, we do have one more question, go ahead.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Vineeth Betty (ph).", "Vineeth Betty", "Hey, guys. I wanted to ask a quick question on the joint venture that you guys announced. So it sounds that you guys are paying about $8 million bucks out-of-pocket to preserve the management contract.", "Can you talk a little bit about what you think the normalized management fees on that\u2019s going to be, and what your view of the stabilized value of the venture might be as it reaches stabilization? Because it sounds like you\u2019re not putting much money out for what could be a very high value creating venture and preserving the loan management contract, but I think we\u2019re just trying to wrap our hands around the numbers around that. If you could provide some guidance it\u2019d will be very helpful.", "Mark Ordan", "Well, the 15 is going from about 1.8 up and as we lease up the portfolio, we expect it to increase. I couldn\u2019t give you a hard number. I do think that we\u2019re putting up relative to little to protect the growing management fees theme and I think these are very strong properties. So we think this is a careful and good use of our capital to back up a strong portfolio.", "Vineeth Betty", "And any view on kind of where NOI should be, on stabilization given the properties are only 62% occupied.", "Mark Ordan", "I\u2019d come back to you. Again, I don\u2019t want to throw out a number but we\u2019ll come back with something.", "Vineeth Betty", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "At this time we have no further questions.", "Mark Ordan", "Okay, thank you everybody. We appreciate your support, and we look forward to updating you in the coming months and quarters.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Tamika, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Miller", "Thank you, Tamika. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website as well.

Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT for his opening remarks. George?", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much, Jeff. The second quarter of 2011 continues to demonstrate that Health Care REIT's relationship investment strategy has created a growth vehicle with increasing momentum. Thus far in 2011, we have completed $4.2 billion of gross investments, and during this last quarter, we invested an unprecedented $2.8 billion in transactions, including the Genesis HealthCare and Capital Senior Living portfolios. ", "This period of significant investment volume has created a solid foundation for future embedded growth opportunities and importantly, meaningful earnings and dividend growth. The investment volume, coupled with portfolio of performance, has resulted in a 13% FFO and 10% FAD growth per share for the quarter and positions us well to generate 8% to 10% FFO and 68% FAD growth per share for the full year 2011.", "Our business model embodies the relationship investing philosophy, and it clearly differentiates our company. Our history of long-term relationships with over 60 senior housing operators and nearly 50 health systems has established Health Care REIT as a partner of choice. The investment growth I just referenced is evidence of that. ", "Based upon the quality and diversification of these relationships, we are seeing a steady future flow of investment opportunities. In fact, even without the addition of any new partners, we anticipate a robust and reliable pipeline of investments at accretive rates of return, resulting in earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders.", "We expect a sizable run rate, a regular run rate of approximately $1.5 billion of organic annual investments just from our existing relationships. This growth vehicle is a key industry differentiator for Health Care REIT. ", "The successful execution of our relationship investment strategy has resulted in a portfolio quality that is best in sector. Our portfolio includes operators and health systems that are highly regarded in the industry for strong financial performance and excellent clinical outcomes. We are not relying upon 1 or 2 quality operators, but have partnered with a number of best-in-industry players. ", "The physical quality of our assets is compelling. We have an industry-leading portfolio in terms of age, tenant diversification and geographic concentration. Our portfolio of quality, combined with our embedded growth, is generating excellent performance and earnings growth this quarter.", "Our aggregate portfolio same-store NOI growth was 5%, and our RIDEA same-store NOI growth was 12.6% for the quarter. Our RIDEA investments are proving to be favorable additions to our portfolio diversification. They're in line with budget through the second quarter and remain on target to produce strong annual NOI growth over the long term.", "The integration of our RIDEA investments is complete. Our relationship teams are in place. Data is smoothly flowing into our accounting systems. Our communications with our partners are robust, and our operating partners are working together to identify synergies and share best practices.", "In May of this quarter, we convened our portfolio partners to develop a strategic plan for sharing best practices and developing collaborative strategies. Our partner CEOs and other executives, representing the industry's best senior housing operators and health systems, committed to convene regularly to discuss topics ranging from purchasing to information technology to marketing. This forum will enable them to evaluate and implement best practices, among the leading operators in the industry.", "In addition to best practice sharing, we are facilitating the creation of synergies between our partners. This quarter, I attended a number of meetings and site visits with our partners on the East Coast, deepening connections across acuity spectrum, from our hospital systems to our post-acute providers, to our assisted and senior living operators. We are proactively anticipating change in the healthcare industry and managing our portfolio as a collective investment whose operations can be optimized as a whole to create additional shareholder value.", "Now I would like to take just a moment to comment on the decision, the recent decision, reached by CMS regarding payment rates for skilled nursing facilities in 2012. While industry was surprised by the implementation of the 11.1% net parity adjustment, I think it is important to level set a few important facts.", "RUGs-IV payment levels resulted in higher-than-expected earnings per operators. The payment rates announced by CMS for 2012 will return reimbursement levels -- return to reimbursement levels that are 3.4% over 2010 RUGs-III levels. Post-acute providers will remain critical to the healthcare continuum as the lowest cost setting in a healthcare environment, with increasing pressure to reduce cost while providing high-quality care.", "As it relates to our portfolio, I would like to be very clear in stating that the rate adjustment will not affect Health Care REIT's rental income. Our investments in the skilled nursing post-acute industry, our triple-net leases with strong payment coverages at both the facility and corporate guarantor level. Our aggregate portfolio of coverage for our skilled nursing investments is the highest among our peers. And based upon our 40-plus years of experience investing in skilled nursing and post-acute sector, we structure our investments with sufficient payment coverage to withstand reimbursement changes such as this one. Our portfolio contains industry-leading operators who have proven adept at managing through reimbursement change for many, many years. ", "As for our largest post-acute partner, Genesis HealthCare, our investment business remains intact. There are 4 reasons we invested in Genesis. One, Genesis has a focus on the post-acute care model, which provides a lower cost alternative to hospitalization. It also aligns well with the pressures to provide high-quality patient care in a lower cost setting. Two, and very importantly, Genesis is very well positioned for growth of its quality payer mix as it continues its focus on the post-acute patient population.", "Unlike many of its peers in the industry, Genesis has the potential to significantly increase its quality mix in the future. In fact, it's grown its quality mix by 2% year-to-date, a trend that has continued since 2006, where the quality payer mix has grown from 47% to 55% in 2011. And for your benefit, as a rough rule of thumb, for every 1% improvement in quality mix, our Genesis facility coverage will improve 5 basis points and it adds $12 million to Genesis' EBITDAR.", "Third, the Genesis-HCN partnership will result in significant external growth opportunities. We expect the CMS rule to amplify these additional market share opportunities by generating a pipeline of potential acquisition targets as smaller operators struggle to satisfy the requirements of the rule, and this favors the institutional quality operators, such as Genesis.", "Finally, there is a significant overlap between Genesis' geographically dense portfolio and Health Care REIT's senior housing assisted-living and hospital partners in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. We believe this overlap creates continuum of care within Health Care REIT's portfolio of operators that is being capitalized upon through the exploration of synergies among our portfolio partners.", "In closing, we have delivered a very strong second quarter. We held -- recently, we held our first ever Investor Day in May and had outstanding attendance. And it was a great opportunity for our investors and analysts to learn more about our relationship investment strategy as well as to meet both a number of our talented senior executives and portfolio partners.", "Through our relationship investment strategy, we have created a growth vehicle with increasing momentum. We see this in the $2.8 billion in transactions closed this quarter and the over $7 billion of investments we closed since 2010. Most importantly, the investment growth over the last 15 to 18 months is now translating into meaningful earnings growth for our shareholders. We are very pleased with the 13% FFO and 10% FAD per share growth this quarter, and through our existing relationships, we will continue to see additional investment opportunities as well as generating meaningful earnings and dividend growth for years to come.", "I'll now turn to Scott Estes, our CFO, for a brief financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, George, and good morning, everybody. As George discussed, we just closed the most successful quarter in our history on the new investment front, completing $2.8 billion of growth investments in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date total to $4.2 billion. Our recent success on the investment front fueled the significant double-digit FFO and FAD per share growth in the quarter, enabling us to meaningfully increase the dividend while continuing to drive down our payout ratios.", "Our portfolio also performed very well in the second quarter, highlighted by blended same-store cash NOI growth of 5%, which was driven in particular by the strength of our operating RIDEA portfolio's performance. In addition, our portfolio diversity by relationship and our rent payment coverage levels remain among the best in the sector, positioning us to have limited, if any, revenue risk from the inevitable cycles that occur in government reimbursement.", "Finally, our balance sheet is also in great shape as our new $2 billion line of credit and over $328 million of cash on hand put us in a great liquidity position to continue to grow the portfolio. We believe the success of our relationship-based investment program will continue to generate meaningful assets, earnings and dividend growth into the future.", "Turning now to the details of the quarter. Regarding investment activity, as I just mentioned, we did complete $2.8 billion of growth investments during the second quarter at a blended yield of over 8%. The most significant of these investments included our previously announced $2.4 billion Genesis HealthCare transaction and $142 million investment with Capital Senior Living. ", "We also acquired 6 senior housing assets with existing operators for an aggregate $96 million and an average initial rental yield of 7.7%. We acquired 6 medical office buildings out of existing relationships that are all affiliated with health systems for an aggregate $65 million at a blended yield of 7.6%.", "And finally, we acquired a skilled nursing asset in New Jersey with Genesis at the end of the quarter. That was the first asset beyond our initial transaction for $21 million at an initial yield of 8.25%. In terms of dispositions, we completed $257 million of asset sales and loan payoffs during the quarter, generating over $30 million in gains and $3.8 million in fees.", "Turning now to portfolio performance. First, our stable triple-net senior housing and care portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations as senior housing payment coverage stands at a solid 1.5x, while occupancy remained at 88%. We generated strong, same-store cash NOI growth rates within both the senior housing and skilled nursing portfolios during the second quarter. Same-store senior housing NOI increased 4.1% versus last year, while our same-store skilled nursing NOI rose 2.2% versus the same period last year.", "I will now spend a couple of minutes discussing both our current as well as our future expected skilled nursing portfolio payment coverage. First, I'll comment on the current portfolio coverage as of today. Our existing skilled nursing portfolio coverage, as reported in the supplement, which is prior to the Genesis transaction, increased 4 basis points to the current 2.4x, the highest level among our peer group. The current Genesis portfolio facility level coverage as of today is 1.9x. When blending the Genesis portfolio into the existing Health Care REIT portfolio, our current skilled nursing portfolio covers in excess of 2x today. ", "At this point, I'll comment on our preliminary expectations for the Genesis portfolio coverage under the new reimbursement changes effective in fiscal 2012. Our team has really spent a lot of time working with George Hager's team, since the announcement of CMS late last week, to assess the potential impact of the pending changes in reimbursement. As an important reminder, we had a single master lease that covers our entire 148 facility Genesis portfolio as well as the corporate guaranty.", "I think the best perspective on the security of our investment is the fact that Genesis' corporate level fixed charge coverage is about 1.6x today, and in 2012, is projected to be approximately 1.4x even taking into account the full effect of our rent increaser. These coverage numbers also do not include the full potential for improvements in quality mix, which as George discussed, increased coverage at a rate of 5 basis points per percentage of quality mix improvement.", "In addition, we expect Genesis will generate approximately $100 million per year of free cash flow after all corporate overhead, rent expense and interest expense. The company has significant liquidity, virtually no debt and is led by seasoned management team. As a result, we remain confident in Genesis' ability to continue to pay a rent and increasers in the new reimbursement environment. ", "Now at this point, I'll provide an update on our senior housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA partnerships. As of June 30, the operating portfolio represented $2.2 billion or approximately 17% of the total portfolio investment balance. As you can see in the supplement, the blended occupancy across our 4 operating portfolios increased by over 200 basis points versus the prior quarter to the current 86.3%. ", "We also did expand our operating portfolio disclosure to provide same-store performance metrics for the second quarter versus the second quarter of last year. And I think as you can see, our operating portfolio is off to a great start, generating a 12.6% increase in same-store NOI in the second quarter versus the comparable quarter last year.", "With a portion of both the Silverado and Senior Star portfolio still in fill-up, we believe our operating portfolio occupancy has room for considerable growth over the next several years, providing a source of increasing NOI and earnings growth. Longer term, we continue to expect the operating portfolio to generate average NOI growth of 5% or better.", "Moving on to the medical facilities portfolio. Our medical office portfolio had another strong quarter, with occupancy up 40 basis points sequentially to 93.3%, with trailing 12-month retention at a solid 84%. We also generated same-store cash NOI growth of positive 1.4% in the second quarter. ", "In regards to our hospital portfolio, cash flow payment coverage remains strong at 2.7x. And we, again, experienced solid 2.4% same-store cash NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the second quarter versus last year. Our Life Science portfolio also continues to perform better than initially under written expectations. As we mentioned last quarter, both leases which have renewed this year, have been at rates approximately 40% above previous rents. We do anticipate reporting same-store results on this portfolio beginning next quarter, and we continue to expect to meet or exceed our long-term NOI growth expectation of at least 5% in the Life Science portfolio.", "Turning now to financial results. As George mentioned, we reported normalized second quarter, FFO per share of $0.90, up a strong 13% versus last year's quarter; and normalized FAD per share of $0.80, up 10% versus the comparable quarter last year. As George also mentioned in his opening remarks, we are now in position to generate more significant earnings growth over the next several quarters, driven by our success on the investment front, the strong NOI growth expected in our senior housing operating and Life Science portfolios as well as the solid 3% to 3.5% rent increases expected across much of our triple-net portfolio.", "Our G&A expense came in at $19.6 million for the second quarter, which did include about $2 million of one-time expenses related to the timing of some initial tax and audit work for our RIDEA joint ventures to integrate the new platforms as well as the cost of terminating the lease at our former office. As a result, we do expect a G&A run rate of approximately $18 million for the remaining 2 quarters of the year. ", "Regarding our dividend, we recently declared the 161st consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30 of $0.715 per share, representing a 5% increase over the same period last year and an annualized rate of $2.86. Our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the second quarter declined significantly to 79% and 89%, respectively.", "In terms of our capital activity, this was a relatively quiet quarter for the company as the only capital raised was the issuance of 625,000 shares under our dividend reinvestment program, which we did at an average net price slightly above $50 per share generating over $30 million in proceeds. In addition, no shares were issued under our equity shelf program during the quarter.", "On July 27, we replaced our existing $1.15 billion credit line with a new $2 billion line. The new line has an initial term of 4 years with a 1-year renewal option and an accordion feature allowing us to expand the line to a maximum of $2.5 billion at our discretion. Borrowings are priced in LIBOR plus 135 basis points based on our current ratings and with an annual facility fee of 25 basis points. We currently have no borrowings on our new line.", "In addition, driven largely by disposition activity that occurred towards the end of the quarter, we had over $328 million of cash on the balance sheet as of June 30. As a result, we believe we're really in an excellent liquidity position, with over $2.3 billion available entering the third quarter. And note that our larger line capacity provides us with additional flexibility to allow us to raise permanent capital less frequently than we have in the past.", "Turning to our credit profile. Debt to undepreciated book capitalization currently stands at 45%, while our secured debt to total assets is currently 14%. Our interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 3.4x and 2.6x, respectively, while net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 5.4x. Longer term, we will continue to look to drive debt to undepreciated book capitalization down towards the 40% level, and to maintain net debt-to-EBITDA of 5 to 6x.", "Finally, today, I would like to review our updated 2011 guidance and assumptions. We are narrowing our 2011 guidance slightly to reflect the fact that virtually all of our dispositions have now occurred during the first half of the year. As such, we have fine-tuned our FFO guidance to a range of $3.34 to $3.40 per share and FAD guidance to $3.02 to $3.08 per share. Our revised FFO and FAD per share ranges reflect strong 8% to 10% and 6% to 8% increases, respectively. And we believe that we remain well positioned to generate significant earnings growth again in 2012.", "I would note that since most investments occurred very early in the second quarter, while the vast majority of second quarter dispositions happened late in the period, we do expect that our third quarter run rates for both FFO and FAD to be approximately $0.03 below the results reported in the second quarter.", "And as a final reminder, our earnings guidance does not include any investments beyond what had been announced in the second quarter. Disposition guidance for the year remains $300 million, of which $282 million has been completed through June.", "With that, that concludes my prepared remarks. And operator, could you please open the call for questions. Thanks.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "I don't know if I missed this. Did you mention what you thought the projected EBITDAR coverage would be post CMS adjustment?", "Scott Estes", "This is Scott. We mentioned that the current corporate level fixed charge coverage is 1.6x. And under the post-CMS adjustment rule, 1.4x. We said, frankly, the answer to your question is it's 1.3x to 1.4x.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "1.3x to 1.4x?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And can you give me a little bit color on the kind of margins that Genesis is running now versus how those are going to change after the CMS adjustment?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Jeff, this is Stephanie Anderson. We have looked at that with our current margins today as well as the offsetting operational efficiencies that they have already begun to put in its place. And we feel comfortable that they will still be industry-leading margins, and that they'll support the 1.4x coverage ratio after management fees and do well on a go-forward basis.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc.", "Okay. And then do you have to change your projected Q-Mix that Genesis has ramp up to the kind of keep adequate coverage on the lease escalations?", "George Chapman", "Right now, as Scott reported, these numbers do not assume additional Q-Mix improvement. So we think we have substantial upside of maybe 1 to possibly 2 percentage points of improvement a year as he's done this year, would really enhance their already strong coverages.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Per conversations with your skilled nursing operators, do they comment on their outlook for Medicaid and kind of any coverage sensitivities around that?", "Scott Estes", "Jana, it's Scott. I would think probably that Medicaid perspective is obviously, that state budgets are in the process of being finalized. I can tell you, as you think about our skilled nursing portfolio, Genesis is about 2/3 of the investment balance. And as George has mentioned, as a part of our initial acquisition conference call, they expect their Medicaid rates to be flat to maybe even up 1%. If you think about their market, they're in a lot of the stronger Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. And as we've analyzed the rest of our portfolio, we're expecting Medicaid rates across the portfolio to be may be flat to down 1%. So it's probably a general perspective I could give you.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then on the $1.5 billion of embedded investments within the portfolio, can you maybe just break out which product types or kind of what the percentages are between the senior housing and further skilled nursing or medical office?", "George Chapman", "I think that this year has been -- last year and this year so far has been pretty indicative of what is happening, and that is that there are more consolidation opportunities in senior housing than any other area that continues. On the other hand, in John Thomas' group, we continue to get our share of medical office buildings and outpatient-type facilities. So I expect it to run 2/3, 1/3 perhaps this year and next. But after setting that, everything is very opportunistic in our world. So that's the way it's been going so far. And we're seeing awfully good senior housing opportunities, I should say, especially along the East and the West Coast in very tough infill markets that should put us in great position going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Derek Bower with UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "It's Ross Nussbaum here with Derek. A couple of questions. First, how are you feeling about what's going to happen this fall with respect to the second phase of the budget debate and how that may impact reimbursement for skilled nursing?", "George Chapman", "I don't think anybody knows, Ross, for sure. But again, this is already a significant cut to skilled nursing that we can easily handle. I guess there's a reason why we're always running around 70% private pay, and we're happy to be there right now. But we think there could be some additional changes. But I think all of our folks are in a great position given the payment coverage buffer to do quite well. And as you well know, having been in the industry for a long time as well, again, we have periods where reimbursement is improved like it has been in skilled nursing for the last 5 to 6 years. And then you would have a bump in the road like this, and it's going to continue to go like this as we look to the future as well. So it's going to be very manageable, and we'll all have to wait and see what Congress does in there -- so in their usual workmanlike way.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Are you worried at all that any of the insurance companies are going to look to what happened on the Medicare reimbursement front and look to potentially reduce payments?", "George Chapman", "Anything's possible, but we don't necessarily anticipate that. But when we're in a -- when you're in skilled nursing or if you're in acute care, those things can change from time to time. But the reality of looking at reimbursable type of facilities is that they are very efficient. I mean, I made a comment in my opening remarks that there is nothing more efficient than a skilled nursing facility in terms of delivering cost-effective care. And ultimately, that should be the mantra of Congress and all of us when we look at what we're paying for and what we're getting for. So that continues even after 40 years being in this business to be something that we believe should always be the focal point in evaluating the success or failure of any types of facilities. And if you look at post acute, like George does so well and Paul does over at HCR Manor Care, I mean, they have become -- those facilities and those kind of companies have become even more pivotal and more important to the delivery of decent healthcare going forward. So we remain really very confident in the success of skilled nursing, and for that matter, well run, efficient patient-centric health systems.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then finally, as you look out over the next couple of quarters, and I know you don't put acquisitions into the guidance, but just what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline as well as your appetite for new investments. Are you -- is there any reason to believe you're backing away from new investments? Or is it still sort of full steam ahead on that front?", "George Chapman", "I think that cap rates have come down, and therefore, we're becoming even more selective in our investment. But we are seeing tremendous opportunities. As I mentioned just to the previous conversation that we're seeing some great opportunities down the East and West Coast, and we think over time, those are going to be wonderful additions to our portfolio.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank", "Are you seeing the same level of potential portfolio opportunities out there? Or is it sort of back to the old sort of onesey-twosey, regional, smaller kind of opportunities?", "George Chapman", "Well, we're not -- there are not a lot of nationwides Manor Care or Genesis out there, but we're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of terrific opportunities. So we're not back to the steady state where we're just doing 1 after another. There are some awfully good portfolios out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Doctrow with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A lot have been covered. I'll just do a couple of follow-ups. George, on acquisitions, would you be buying additional skilled nursing facilities here? And I guess I was curious as whether you think cap rates are sort of moving back up for skilled and even for senior housing as well?", "George Chapman", "Well, first of all, predominant investment type, as I said earlier, is going to be senior housing. And on the other hand, in skilled, we're going to support George and his team as we think there are going to be tremendous opportunities. I do think you're going to see, Jerry, in skilled nursing that the pricing is going to have to change a little bit. Cap rates are going to move. And yet we also think there are incredible opportunities as the industry consolidates because frankly, as I said in my opening remarks, some of the smaller operators who have some really good assets are not going to want to fight it out with some of the new rules. And it will give George and his team, the opportunity to move down the East Coast, which we think is just an incredible opportunity for him. And it will be a wonderful collaborative opportunity for George and his team along with our health system clients and our assisted living senior housing operators. So we will support George, and we will support certain skilled nursing operators. But right now, the emphasis or focus has been on high-quality East and West Coast senior housing.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And just on the senior housing kind of operating portfolio. I mean, you had tremendous quarter-over-quarter jump in occupancy, I think 200 basis points. I was just curious as to how the stabilized stuff might be doing versus kind of the lease sub, just to get a little more color there?", "George Chapman", "Scott, do you want to handle that?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. Jerry, you're referring probably to the RIDEA portfolio, I believe?", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yes.", "Scott Estes", "I guess first on the aggregate portfolio, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, one of the great parts of our portfolio is we have some assets and fill-ups. So you clearly have an 86% level with a very good chance of continuing to improve the overall occupancy. And I would categorize your question regarding stable occupancy in the quarter performance was about flat. I think you're seeing good rate growth. And of the 12.6% aggregate growth, at least half of it is coming from the stable portfolio and we're obviously getting some benefits too from assets and fill-up like we've been talking about. So it still seems to be like the quarter overall, NOI growth definitely in excess of 5% for the stable portfolio.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just last, so the entrance fee stuff, I understand it's not that big a portion of the portfolio. But I think occupancy is only still 54%. Just curious at how you're dealing about that, whether we've got any prospects for further rent increases there. And actually, maybe just any comments about the entrance fee business in general?", "George Chapman", "It's been slow and pretty steady, Jerry. I mean, you have visited -- you and your team have visited some of Donald's projects, SLC's, and they're doing very well on the rental. And we've even added on in the healthcare component, and they fill immediately. And the entrance fees keep moving up slowly. I mean, it's still most directly impacted by the housing market and the economy generally, but he's doing a great job. So we're going to do fine, and I do hope we're going to see regular rent increases till we get back to the original rate and do pretty well over time. This is a product that is very dependent upon the economy, and once the economy does start up, we're going to see the most significant growth improvement in that sector. But again, as you say, it's a small part of our portfolio. We're not going to add to it, but we're pleased with Donald's efforts today.", "Jerry Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "George, I think you upped the rents last January. Is that sort of an annual review? Do you look at it quarter-by-quarter?", "George Chapman", "No, annual review pretty much.", "Scott Estes", "Jerry, it's Scott. I think I'll just add a quick comment. I would say that we are having a strong July. I would note that both our entrance fee and rental occupancy components are up an additional 1% to 55% in the entrance fee and 89% in the rental fees as of today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Just want to ask 2 questions, I guess, around the SNF portfolio. But the first one, I understand what you guys have said about the way the post-acute assets are positioned and the care continuum, how you think that's a low-cost, clinically appropriate setting, et cetera. But I'm wondering if in the underwriting of Genesis and the strategy behind that investment, if you felt like you had more of a supportive partner on the reimbursement side, and maybe now with RUG-IV and now maybe some of that support is going away. I'm just wondering if your investment thesis would have changed at all given where we are now versus where we were at that point?", "George Chapman", "Well, we'd rather not have had 11% announcement by CMS. But George didn't want it, Paul Ormond didn't want it, Jay didn't want it. So I mean, it's not a positive. But the fact is that we saw one of the most experienced management teams that needed a partner like us and had capital to enhance their ability to improve their quality mix, and I think that's where I'd like to take you back to. George has the ability now to move from 55% to 65% Q-Mix, a very, very significant increase in coverage for us. And he has the ability to be a consolidator in that industry and to collaborate very well with our senior housing operators and health systems. Already, we're seeing some of that cross referrals working and making all of our partners in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic better. So our thesis remains the same, and we think they're a terrific team. And they've managed through a lot of these kind of changes, ups and downs, and they're going to continue to do it well. I've been out on the East Coast with George and Mike and their team to meet with health system leaders, and we'll continue to do that and continue to drive to the extent we can an improvement to the healthcare delivery system. And George and Mike and their team are just critical to that. So our thesis remains the same.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up to that. As you guys look at acquisition opportunities with Genesis, you did one in the quarter for 8.25% cap rate. I'm just wondering if you have any changes on your pricing expectations. I know it's a little early in terms of transactions coming out now, but maybe just your thoughts going forward from here.", "George Chapman", "We have already set a matrix for our returns. So George knows what we need, and he's comfortable with that. How much we decide to pay together for our assets is obviously going to change somewhat in light of the Medicare situation, but we're seeing some great possibilities there. And again, we're looking at this as not just a SNF investment. We're, in a narrow sense, looking at it as post acute adding to the continuum of healthcare delivery, and also looking to George and his team to interface effectively with the rest of our operators on the East Coast. Again, as I say, we're looking to expand George's reach, and I think we're going to have some really good opportunities now to do just that.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Okay. Is the matrix, is that initial cash yield matrix, or is it an IRR-based matrix? How do you guys look at the core return there?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Yes, it is a cash yield matrix based on investment, and it allows us the ability to make sure that we're getting the right yield for the marketplace.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just a kind of a conceptual question. What's to stop Genesis or any of your partners from inviting competition from other real estate landlords to engage in acquisitions with them?", "George Chapman", "We have exclusivity with most of our key operators. We do with George, and we're working very effectively together. But even beyond the contractual provision, everything comes down to their -- our operators continuing to think we're the best partner, and I think they do. We work with them all the time, Rich. We don't do a large transaction and put it on the shelf and forget about it. I've been on the East Coast a lot with George and his team, and so are all of our key executives and our RIDEA teams. It's that day-to-day relationships with a lot of our people and the value add that continues to get us more work from key people in the healthcare industry. So we have a lock-on on a lot of the business. But again, it comes down to, again, proving ourselves quarter after quarter.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Just back to the acquisition, the 8.25% cap rate. Is that -- I assume that was done well in advance of the CMS news. If you were to kind of try to do an apples to apples in that, what would that 8.25% number be in your mind? You talk about how you've had this matrix. I mean, can you quantify a cap rate adjustment that you would make on sort of on that transaction specifically?", "George Chapman", "Well, let me clarify your point. That was a beginning lease rate, okay, and we had coverage on top of it. And so we have very good initial yields built into the matrix with good coverages as well, and I don't think there's any reason for it to change.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Scott, you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks, the 1.4x fixed charge coverage for Genesis. What are their other fixed charges besides rent?", "Scott Estes", "There's some small third-party rents, and we don't have all the assets in the portfolio. That's the most significant because there's very little, virtually no debt.", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then last question, I guess, is sometimes, these broad-based announcements from CMS, we can all recall PPS for nursing homes and the unintended consequences that came from that. And I'm curious if have you kind of thought about unintended consequences of the 11.1% cut? And what are some of the trigger points you're looking for, and for something to come along the line from this that could change the landscape to the negative? And have you thought about that? And what are you looking for?", "George Chapman", "You're asking us to speculate, probably to our detriment as to what might come along. I guess...", "Richard Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "What could go wrong, George?", "George Chapman", "And we've done that before. I think that this was a very significant cut back to the normalized kind of reimbursement from 2010, and we're back on track for that. I don't think that we're expecting a lot of bad news going forward. The reality is that skilled nursing post acute is the most effective provider of healthcare on a cost basis, and also increasingly, with people like Paul Ormond and George Hager and others providing terrific clinical outcomes. So we think the SNF post acute facilities' place in the healthcare delivery system is even stronger than it was in the past. So we're very confident going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "It was actually asked. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Not to put words in your mouth, but given your relationship strategy and obviously the opportunities you're seeing up and down the coasts and elsewhere, it sounds like there are some opportunities with the smaller skilled nursing operators given their lack of efficiencies, et cetera. How does Health Care REIT, with its existing portfolio and any incremental growth with new operators, participate in the improved margins, the improved efficiencies that a Health Care REIT would bring outside of, let's say, a RIDEA structure? How do you participate in the improved margins as these SNF portfolios are repositioned down to some extent in terms of quality mix, et cetera?", "George Chapman", "Well, I think the way we're going to play in the SNF post-acute area is primarily through key portfolio operators such as George, okay. We're already looking at some real terrific opportunities. And as people get back to reality as to the value of, like, Manor Care or Genesis and as well as Health Care REIT's, we think that there is going to be incredible value build up in Genesis. And of course, we have a 9.9% option, so we'll share in that success. So that's the way we're going to play it. We're going to have 3 or 4 just key nursing home operators that will be consolidators in that space. And again, the way we structured the deal with Genesis, we'll share pretty significantly in that. And the odds are that when the market gets back to reality on the value of skilled nursing, especially the post-acute providers, that you might even have some liquidity that's in the form of IPOs or whatever for any number of these companies. So think we're going to be in a very good position.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Acting as a bit of a roll-up partner possibly as you renegotiate leases or renew leases with existing operators, bring them into, for example, the Genesis fold, et cetera, that's the idea?", "George Chapman", "Well, it could well be that we can facilitate that. But all of our operators are independent-minded, and if we see the opportunity, we'll be all for that. But it's going to be up to them.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay. Okay. And then one other question, and I know my colleague, Jason Ren, is sitting here with me and has a question. But -- and this might be for John Thomas. I don't know if he's on the line or not, but...", "George Chapman", "He is.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay. From the not-for-profit side, I mean, obviously, over the last several years, you've talked about dealing with not-for-profit hospital systems, et cetera, growing your relationships with them because that would be a product line for you going forward. How have the last couple of years change their attitudes, if any, the last couple of years in terms of 2 respects: Health Care REIT's platform growth and also just what's going on in the financial markets, et cetera? How have not-for-profit attitudes changed toward the repositioning of their portfolios, the managing of their real estate risk and their interest in doing deals with a group like HCN?", "John Thomas", "Yes, Phil, it's a great question. It's evolved and turned in our direction very positively. Most of what we've done last year has been with the not-for-profits. And between healthcare reform and really the incentive to consolidate and buy or employ physicians has caused the not-for-profits to look to the private capital to develop bigger ambulatory care centers to house and consolidate those positions into an integrated facility and then just a shortage of capital. The one thing we haven't seen is a big monetization or maybe monetization opportunities by the not-for-profits. They have not gone -- not inactive or very active in selling their buildings as much as you would think, but the cost of capital between the tax-exempt municipal market where that has squeezed very narrowly to our cost of capital. We've had a lot of opportunity and we see a lot more in the pipeline.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "Okay. Perfect. And Jason has a question here as well.", "Jason Ren - Morningstar Inc.", "I was just wondering if you could detail a bit further on the CapEx requirement on the Genesis portfolio going forward and how that might be split or not split between you guys and Genesis? And also just in sum, would you describe your aggregate consolidated portfolio's risk profile as being improved since year end 2010?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Well, I'll get the one on the CapEx. It is a triple-net lease, where Genesis does all of the capital expenditures to refurbish. And then if there are projects that are rehabbing or changing the therapy in order to access the post-acute model, they would bring that to us and we would evaluate it based on IRR and get some return on it in the lease. And we also have that -- is already contemplated within our lease at a very good return. And the second question, I've already -- I think Scott has thesis [ph].", "Scott Estes", "[indiscernible] the question was where we came to this in 2010 out in the skilled nursing industry. A lot of different moving parts to that. I don't know how to answer...", "Stephanie Anderson", "As to the risk on the skilled nursing industry, I think with the 2.4x cover, that it is very strong. And we have very good operators who understand how to work through reimbursement cuts. We knew this going in, that regulated -- reimbursement is regulated, does have some volatility in it. But we feel very comfortable in their ability to reduce overhead spending, operating expenses and improve the Q-Mix.", "George Chapman", "And I should add that during the last 5 years at least, a good part of our dispositions have been Medicaid-oriented skilled nursing. So our focus is on folks that like Genesis that have wonderful post-acute opportunities. And therefore, putting a more -- helping them with capital improvements to make them an even more efficient post-acute provider, especially in Genesis' area, where they have a densely concentrated platform, is a very good investment of our -- for Health Care REIT.", "Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald", "And I would have to think that that's going to be an opportunity for you with your existing in-place portfolio in terms of organic growth and some of the relationships you have with smaller SNF operators as they, again, want to spend some CapEx dollars to better position their asset within the system, within the healthcare system. Is that a fair statement?", "George Chapman", "It's fair.", "Scott Estes", "The only thing I was going to add, Philip, is, and I was just going to point out that under RUGs-III back in 2010, our existing portfolio covered 2.4x. So you don't see a great swing. This is obviously an update to rate. This isn't a change in the system, so it's a big differentiator. And obviously, the industry's been in a fairly reasonable position. It'll just take some time to work through the changes from an operating perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Just a couple kind of picky number questions. First one, on the Genesis fixed charge -- corporate fixed charge number you gave us. For the therapy business, I assume that includes the impact, not just the 11.1% cut, but all the other aspects that would affect the therapy business?", "Scott Estes", "That's correct, Rob.", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then Scott, in the guidance that you have for the components of FAD, am I correct that noncash interest expense bumps up on the second half of the year?", "Scott Estes", "One sec. Let me just...", "Robert Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "And if this is too detailed, we can do it offline.", "Scott Estes", "It was -- I believe it's $0.01 different in our last forecast, so well, we can look at that and do the comparison offline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Jowell Bealty [ph] with Morgan Stanley.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Provide us an update on your thoughts about maybe repositioning your triple-net senior housing assets into a RIDEA structure?", "George Chapman", "We'll always look at that as an opportunity. We already have, as you well know, a triple-net lease relationship with Brandywine, who I just visited with, I think, Tuesday. And there was an option to convert to a RIDEA structure. And they have some good upside potential, and it might be very good for Brandywine and us some time within the next couple of years. But our goal remains, at least for now, being somewhere between 20%, 25%, maybe a touch higher, if we have good RIDEA opportunities.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And I was also wondering if you could provide us an update on your view for development opportunities across the asset classes beyond what is already in your pipeline?", "George Chapman", "Well, as you know, we're going to hang around 4% or 5%, probably on average in development. We are seeing some opportunities for renovation adding on to existing facilities. I was talking to Jerry about even our entrance fees/rental facilities for a Donald Thompson's, we've added some great rental healthcare components to that. We always see that adding on to an existing successful portfolio or facility is just a terrific opportunity. We'll continue to do that. And we will build for some of our better senior housing clients subject to about the 5% cap, and we see that as a potential positive for us. And then in John's area, acute care, there's no question that the platforms are changing. So we're, at the very least, going to go in and help the health systems substantially renovate their facilities to make them more customer-centric and also in recognition of the fact that 60% plus of the procedures are outpatients. So there are opportunities there as well, but we're going to hang around the 5% level and take advantage of good opportunities. And I also add too that in the skilled, that they just -- in the senior housing area, we do them for folks that are already substantial players in our portfolio and subject to master leases. And then in the MOB space or in ambulatory care centers, we're looking for either a strong guarantee for a health system or -- and our standard for MOBs is at least 75%, if not 80%, pre-lease. So we're not talking about the kind of development risk that people can worry about. We think these are really terrific opportunities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jeffries & Company.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So quick question on the senior housing operating portfolio. Occupancy fell 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. I think in general, the trends you're kind of seeing out of NIC still kind of remain somewhat tough. So curious about, again, how you think about that portfolio and the earnings growth you could get out of it over the next 12 to 18 months relative to the 5%, 6% same-store NOI expectations?", "Scott Estes", "Tayo, it's Scott. Yes, I'd say we're very excited about the senior housing operating portfolio. I think you've seen -- you're kind of blending a few different questions there. In general, the fact that we are seeing solid occupancy, have assets and fill-ups, good rate growth, I mean, we're very comfortable with our longer term NOI growth projections in the RIDEA portfolio performance. In aggregate, it's essentially tracking right in line with our initially underwritten expectations at this time. And in general, as you think about just the NOI, there's been some questions this quarter about the industry performance. And it seems like occupancy has been pretty stable the last few months. We've seen some improving trends. So I would really get back to portfolio of senior housing, the triple-net portfolio occupancy of 88%. I believe is right about in line with the NIC average. And you really haven't seen a heck of a lot of movement there. And we also have reasonable coverage in that portfolio as well. So I would characterize it as stable overall and that RIDEA is a great opportunity for us.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Do you think -- I mean, on a long-term basis, where you could probably get to the 5% number, do you think you can get there in the first year of this deal?", "Scott Estes", "First year of this deal, well, we have the first quarter as a comparison even though that wasn't in our portfolio last year of 13% growth. So with a lot of room to run, I think you clearly have an opportunity to have great growth this year and it should actually continue for a number of years. So that was obviously a part of our comfort in saying longer term, 5% growth or better over the next, call it, I call it longer term.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question is kind of more in line with over the next 6 months, so there's a lot of the noise around Medicare, Medicaid, the government continue to kind of play chicken with this thing going into November, December. One, how do you think that ultimately shakes out, if you have any insight into that? And then two, specifically, if you do see some type of big fix with the physician doc fix, if that has any impact on your thoughts about the MOB space?", "John Thomas", "This is John. I'll take the doc fix. How they play this game every 18 months. In the end, we would expect a neutral to maybe slight increase from the doc fix. Our physicians, most of our physician medical office space is not very heavily concentrated in Medicare or Medicaid, so would not have any meaningful impact there. But yes, we would expect the Medicare doc fix to get fixed, and it's a very expensive fix. But they play the chicken game every year.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "But you guys don't have any meaningful exposure to Medicare anyway on that side.", "John Thomas", "Not on the medical office side. We don't measure every doctors' office payer mix like you do with, like, the skilled nursing. It would be less than 20% at most, and they make their money on the commercial side with the physicians affiliated with hospital systems like ours.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Then just a quick question on Genesis with the mitigation on the Medicare stuff. Is it really the change -- potential change in Q-Mix that gives you most of the mitigation? Or is it really going to be more of a cost cutting operation?", "Stephanie Anderson", "They definitely have some expenses already in line to be cut. They are reducing overhead spending, operating expenses. They have some pilot programs that were solely focused on care delivery and outcome that were, although great for the residents and the hospital partners, won't probably need to be postponed. But it is mainly an expense story and a focus on expenses, and there is -- they will continue to improve Q-Mix.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Do you have a sense of just how large those cuts could be? I mean, Sunhill [ph], they kind of give a sense of how big it could be. Is Genesis willing to give a similar type of outlook?", "George Chapman", "I think we're not going to get into all of the expense cuts and how we're going to do it. That's for George and for us to worry about. There are always ways for a skilled nursing to rightsize everything they're doing. It's been part of the 40- or 50-year history of skilled nursing. So just know that, that team is very capable of driving great Q-Mix improvement and to be able to create operating efficiencies.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. So theoretically, could you give a sense of where do you think coverage ratios could go after that?", "George Chapman", "Well, coverage ratios, Scott gave you already, based upon repositioning of the portfolio and even without the move in Q-Mix. So it's already built into...", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. That's built into that number.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Just one quick one. Do you expect any loss of coverage in your senior housing portfolio as the result of the CMS change?", "George Chapman", "No, I don't think so.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Chapman for his closing remarks.", "George Chapman", "Thanks very much. Let me close by reiterating that this has been probably the most successful quarter for investments in our company's history and probably in general. It has been a tremendously successful time for us. ", "We believe we built a best in the industry portfolio, and we're able to deliver outstanding growth for our shareholders for many years to come. And I think we continue to be poised to capitalize on tremendous opportunities in the marketplace. ", "So with that, I'll thank all of you for participating and remind you that Scott and his team are available for some follow-up questions, if necessary.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Brooke, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com.

Chapman", "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Health Care REIT's relationship investing strategy continues to produce strong financial results. In the third quarter, we generated year-over-year FFO and FAD per share growth of 13% and 7%, respectively. We have increased our 2011 FFO guidance and now expect growth of 10% to 11% this year. We believe that this earnings growth together with the acknowledged high quality of our portfolio have both contributed significantly to share-value creation. ", "The portfolio continued its strong performance generating same-store NOI growth this quarter of over 4% and our relationship investing strategy resulted in investments of $650 million in the third quarter and a record $4.8 billion year-to-date. ", "We continue to see a healthy pipeline of private-pay senior housing assets concentrated in global -- in coastal markets and larger MSAs, as well as MOB investments affiliated with leading health care systems. Nearly all of these investment opportunities are derived from our long-standing industry relationships. ", "The third quarter data released by the National Investment Center, NIC, last week affirms the positive trends and resiliency of our industry. The reports showed that industry fundamentals in senior housing occupancy and pricing are strong despite a volatile economic climate. ", "Overall, improvement was particularly notable in key metropolitan markets. Markets that represent a substantial part of our senior housing portfolio. These encouraging industry trends aligned with a overall positive performance of Health Care REIT's senior housing portfolio again this quarter. ", "The Health Care REIT sector generally has been a very steady performer during the current challenging macroeconomic conditions. Historically, Health Care REITs have produced stable growth and steady cash flows even in highly volatile markets. Current demographic trends, limited supply and favorable access to capital are contributing to a positive outlook for the industry. The consistency of cash flows, portfolio diversification and excellent liquidity are providing an opportunity for long-term value creation with less risk than other asset types, an appealing option for many investors. ", "Our company has demonstrated this consistent growth and value creation through its relationship network. We define our unique relationship investing strategy with the words relationships, results and returns. These words make an important point. Specifically, they connect the dots and explain how our company's relationships create meaningful portfolio results and, ultimately, generate shareholder returns. ", "Now I'll walk you through the success of this quarter using that strategy.", "First, relationships. The nearly $650 million in gross investments we closed this quarter are reflective of that relationship investing strategy. The majority of investments for the third quarter are acquisitions, at an average yield of 7.3%, in primarily high-end, private-pay seniors housing and medical office building investments. These premier investments are the result of existing industry relationships and further strengthen our industry-leading portfolio. And I should add that, I believe this quarter's investment volume, in a particularly difficult overall environment, speaks to the consistency and predictability of the HCN relationship-based approach to investing.", "As mentioned during my introduction, even in the current climate, we have a healthy pipeline of investments. In senior housing, we are pursuing newer, high-quality properties located in strategic geographic markets. In our senior housing operating portfolio, we now have the youngest average SNH among our peer group, and 90% of the properties are located in the top MSAs for East and West Coast markets. ", "We are also focused on operators that are generating strong financial results, including steady cash NOI per unit. For MOBs, we are focused on newer, larger properties affiliated with leading investment-grade systems, and we are pleased that our stable of partners is strong and growing. In fact, through our relationships, we have built the most balanced and diverse operator base in the industry, which is generating additional investment growth, especially in a climate of industry consolidation. ", "Next on results. Our relationships have created a foundation from which strong financial results are built. Recent investments have created a high-performance, high-quality portfolio. Our third quarter investments were primarily private pay, high-end senior housing and medical office building assets. All of these contributed to the quality of our portfolio. ", "We are particularly pleased with our new 308 million double -- triple-net lease partnership up with Chelsea Senior Living, a highly respected and quality provider in the Northeast. This transaction includes the acquisition and leaseback of 10 combination senior housing communities in New Jersey and New York, with a 2012 lease rate of approximately 7%. Our partnership with Chelsea is a continuation of our strategy to partner with premier operators with high-quality assets, and this investment also contributes to our increasing presence in East Coast markets. Information relating to the Chelsea transaction is posted on our website.", "In addition to the Chelsea transaction, this quarter's investments included $146 million for 630,000 rentable square feet of medical office buildings, and these high-quality medical office building assets are primarily affiliated with health systems and are over 90% occupied.", "We continue to see strength in our portfolio diversification with no one asset type representing more than 30% of the investment balance. We are focused on the growth of our assets supported by private payor sources, as evidenced by most of the investments made this quarter. Our private pay mix within our portfolio is nearly 70%, which we plan to increase to over 80% in the next few years. ", "With respect to Genesis, we continue to be impressed by George Hager and his team. George presented to our Board of Directors last week in New Jersey and reported the continued successful execution of the Genesis business plan. They are making appropriate adjustments necessary to accommodate reimbursement changes. And with George's geographically-clustered portfolio and his team's well-deserved reputation for quality care, we remain very excited about our partnership and our ability to help George and his team further develop Genesis' post-acute platform that is a critical component of the evolving health care system. ", "Now returning to our portfolio update discussion, we are pleased to report that our MOB portfolio is now over 10 million square feet and maintains 93% occupancy, the highest in our peer group, and our retention rate was 84% during the last 12 months. We also continue to pursue our coastal concentration strategy, where a dominant presence in these markets creates numerous strategic advantages. And as it relates to the portfolio, generally, 75% of our total portfolio is located in attractive East and West Coast markets, or in one of the top 31 MSAs, and finally, our total portfolio is producing solid same-store NOI growth for the quarter of 4.2%. ", "So in sum, our portfolio composition is highly reflective of our strategy and is leading the industry in a number of areas. We continue to solidify existing relationships and form new partnerships with the best senior housing operators and health systems in the marketplace, creating relationship-based future growth opportunities. ", "And now returns. The most important component of our strategy is the way that we are creating reliable and meaningful returns for our shareholders. In the third quarter alone, we generated significant earnings growth, and FFO increased, up 13% from the third quarter 2010. We have access to reasonably priced capital, a strong balance sheet and conservative payout ratios. ", "Based on the strength of our existing portfolio, confidence in our future pipeline and earnings growth potential, we have increased our normalized FFO per share guidance to 10% to 11% growth over 2010. And in addition, our board increased our 2012 dividend payments to a level in excess of 4% over 2011 payments. ", "I'd now like to take a moment to welcome a new addition to Health Care REIT's Board of Directors. As recently announced, Dan Decker has been named to our Board. Dan has nearly 20 years experience in the senior housing industry, including playing a key role in over $2 billion of investments. And Dan's prominent leadership and extensive experience in the industry will add tremendous value to the company's long-term goals for growth and shareholder returns. ", "Additionally, I'd like to highlight a recent corporate governance change enacted by our Board of Directors. On October 27, our Board of Directors approved declassifying board membership. So beginning at the May 2012 annual meeting of shareholders, directors who are nominated will be elected to one-year terms. Our board's decision is consistent with Health Care REIT's continued focus on strong perfect governance and best forward practices. ", "In closing, Health Care REIT's relationship investing strategy and high-quality portfolio continue to create shareholder value. Our year-to-date total return of nearly 14% exceeds our industry peers. We are also proud of the 60% total return we delivered to shareholders since inception in 1970. We have built a portfolio that is producing solid same-store NOI growth based upon an industry or an investment strategy that is providing ongoing opportunities that strengthen and diversify our industry-leading portfolio. Most importantly, we are generating strong financial results and delivering value to our shareholders. ", "With that, I'll now turn to Scott Estes, our CFO, for a brief financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. As George discussed, we continue to add attractive new investments our portfolio, having now completed a record breaking $4.8 billion of growth investments year-to-date through September. ", "Our portfolio continued to perform well in the third quarter highlighted by blended same-store cash NOI growth of 4.2%. Our strong same-store performance and success on the investment front generated another strong quarter of FFO and FAD per share growth. While our confidence and our future growth potential enabled us to announce a dividend increase earlier this week. ", "At this point, our portfolio diversity, by operator and a rent payment coverage levels are main among the strongest in the sector, providing greater certainty that we will continue to be paid our rents to the current government reimbursement cycle. ", "Finally, our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity with over $1.7 billion of line capacity and cash on hand at the end of September.", "Turning to the details of the quarter, regarding investment activity, as George mentioned, we completed $644 million of growth investments during the third quarter. This consisted primarily of $569 million of acquisitions that have a blended yield of 7.3%. The most significant of these investments was our $308 million Chelsea Senior Living transaction detailed in our press release and on our website. The other significant acquisitions were 2 medical office building portfolios affiliated with health systems for combined total of $124 million and a blended average NOI yield of 7.3%. ", "In terms of dispositions, we sold 3 smaller properties and had a few small loan payoffs totaling a combined $16 million, bringing dispositions year-to-date to just under $300 million. ", "Based on our fourth quarter disposition projections, we have increased our disposition guidance for the full year slightly to $350 million, as we continue to recycle capital into new assets to further enhance the quality of the portfolio. All around, we are pleased with another excellent quarter on the investment front from the company.", "Turning now to portfolio performance, as you may have noticed we changed the appearance of our supplement a bit this quarter, this new format facilitates a more automated reporting process for us internally while streamlining the presentation of the data for the investment community. ", "In terms of our portfolio, first, our stable of seniors' housing and care portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations. Our seniors' housing triple-net lease payment coverage stands at a solid 1.4x, while occupancy remains 88%. We also generated strong 4.4% year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth within the seniors' housing triple-net lease portfolio during the third quarter.", "Now I'll provide a brief update on our skilled nursing portfolio including some comments regarding Genesis. We continue to believe that skilled nursing facilities are the most efficient cost-effective settings for providing health care services. ", "Our skilled nursing portfolio remains focused on a relatively limited number of key relationships with strong operators. To that point, including Genesis, nearly 90% of the EBITDAR in our skilled nursing portfolio is generated by our top 7 skilled nursing operators. And importantly, as a result of adding the Genesis portfolio occupancy of 91% to the portfolio average, our overall skilled nursing occupancy increased a full 2.5 percentage points in the quarter to 88%. Last time our skilled nursing portfolio was at this occupancy level was 1995, or 16 years ago. ", "Our most recent cash flow coverage is listed in the supplement for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 with a strong 2.3x. This includes one quarter of the Genesis portfolio impact. Annualized for the full impact of the Genesis portfolio, our current skilled nursing portfolio coverage stands at 2.1x. And our latest view regarding Genesis' operating performance remains unchanged from last quarter's call. Specifically, we continue to expect the company's corporate level fixed charge coverage to be approximately 1.3x to 1.4x in calendar year 2012. ", "There's also, obviously, been a lot of discussion of late regarding an individual company's ability to adapt to the current skilled nursing operating environment, and we think, really cutting through it all, we believe there are 3 distinct factors which differentiate our Genesis investment. ", "First, they have a geographically-concentrated portfolio in the attractive Northeast and mid-Atlantic markets; they have greatly enhanced their right key [ph] platform, which allows for optimal therapy utilization and labor efficiency; and probably most importantly, they have the ability to significantly improve their quality mix over the long-term. As a result, we do remain highly confident in Genesis' continued ability to pay our rent.", "As this point, I'll provide a brief update on our seniors' housing operating portfolio which is comprised of our RIDEA partnerships. The blended occupancy across our 4 operating portfolios increased 30 basis points versus the prior quarter to the current 86.6%. In addition, our same-store operating portfolio NOI for the third quarter increased 8.2% versus the comparable quarter last year, driven by a combination of a 70-basis point occupancy increase over a 4% revenue per occupied unit growth and a slight expansion in margins. ", "Our operating portfolio continues to perform in line with expectations and we remain comfortable with our NOI growth expectation of 4% to 5% over the long-term.", "Moving now to the medical facilities portfolio, our medical office building portfolio performed well in the quarter with historic [ph] and occupancy remaining at 93.3%. In the trailing 12 months retention at a solid 82%. Our MOB portfolio generated same-store cash NOI growth of 1.7% for the third quarter. ", "In regards to our hospital portfolio, cash payment coverage remains strong at 2.6x, and we again experienced solid 3.7% same-store cash NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the third quarter versus last year.

And I think operator, we'd like to open up the call for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I understand you primarily focus on your relationships to drive investments but I was curious what you are seeing being marketed right now and how much in each of the different asset classes?", "George L. Chapman", "There are a number of decent-sized packages in both senior housing and the MOB space but fewer than say a year ago. And I think there's probably less of a tendency to go to market. People seem to be linking up with favored partners more than even at least a year or 2 years ago. John, you want to comment on MOBs? John Thomas?", "John T. Thomas", "This is John. There's been very few hospital modernizations over the last couple of years. There's a package out now and Scott's telling it [ph] -- everybody's very familiar with it, you know, not a very large package. So most of our attention is to our relationships and building new relationships and that's where most of our pipeline is coming from.", "George L. Chapman", "Chuck Herman, do you want to comment a bit on our senior housing?", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes. And I think our operators are generating some decent investment volume, a lot of off-market transactions that are coming our way because of that, but relatively few large packages, as George stated.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I think that after the third quarter acquisition activity, the senior housing operating NOI is now maybe around 14%. I'm wondering if you've -- where you kind of think that should be in your portfolio longer-term?", "Scott A. Estes", "Jana, it's is Scott. That is correct. It's about 14% at this point. And I think we would consistently say that we'll probably continue to have opportunities to grow with our existing operators and continue to look at additional idea investments opportunistically. But that's probably a good place to think it would be for the intermediate-term, somewhere in the mid-current 14%, maybe up to 20% level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I structured your Chelsea Senior Living deal as a triple-net lease, previously you've been doing a lot RIDEA stuff. Can you talk a little bit about -- is there something about the portfolio that lends itself to a triple-net or is it -- what's your thinking behind structuring?", "George L. Chapman", "Chuck Herman?", "Charles J. Herman", "We structured that transaction -- we felt that it aligned with the best interest of both parties. So that's what we agreed to. RIDEA does not fit every operator nor is it the desire of all parties. So we have options in how we can structure. In this particular case, we felt triple-net lease was the appropriate structure.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "It's not a change in philosophy necessarily going forward. It just happened to be the right one for this...", "George L. Chapman", "Jeff, this is George. I think that the better way to look at RIDEA versus net lease is exactly as Chuck indicated. That it could be the portfolio is very attractive for us to do, RIDEA, but perhaps the operator doesn't want to do it. Other operators came to us in part because they wanted to do business with us, but they -- others like to do deals as joint ventures. And so it isn't really the choice alone for the capital partner. It is a partnership. And I think it just -- it's just situational and in this case they elected to do a net lease and we're just fine with that. It adds significant quality and size to our very strong focus in the Northeast.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Makes sense. So the cap rate is a little bit lower, I think, than we've seen on recent triple-net deals. Is part of that due the mark-to-market rent structure, years 4 and 9? I guess can you walk me through the mechanism of that?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure, Jeff, it's Scott. Yes, I think this investment has, I would call, higher than average increase, there's a part of it, in terms of the bigger picture. And the short of it is, through 2015, the rents would increase at a fixed rate of about 2.6% per year, on average. And then at that time, there'll be a fair market value reset but the increase will be no less than 3.5%. And really from that point, through 2015 through '19 it grows at the rate of at least 3% a year. So in general, you have some benefit from the fair market value resets and probably on average with increased rents we think 3% a year.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess and then lastly, I noticed -- I guess last quarter, you stopped reporting EBITDAR coverage and kind of focused on cash flow coverage of EBITDARM, with the M. I just want to get your thoughts around the thinking behind that. I think that's a metric that a lot of people look at, the EBITDAR coverage and especially when you're comparing portfolios, like Genesis quarter to quarter, that kind of was initially talked about as an EBITDAR coverage metric, just kind of your thinking about taking that out of the supplemental.", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure, Jeff. It's Scott, I'll answer that one. Frankly, we find there's a lot of inconsistency in how coverage is reported across our sector, and management fees are subordinate to our lease payments and I think again they're also been imputed inconsistently throughout the industry, so our view is we'll continue to provide the cash flow coverage and help you guys talk about if you want to imply a management fee you can get to and after management fee number, but that was in essence our thinking around doing that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derek Bower with UBS.", "Derek Bower - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "George, before you talk a lot about the pipeline I guess for senior housing and MOBs, but is there anything in the skilled nursing front that you're currently underwriting? Or do you think the market is more of in a wait-and-see mode depending on what comes out of the Congress in the near future?", "George L. Chapman", "I think it's a little slower right now. We will look at individual transactions, either acquisitions or a development for one of our -- what is it, 6 or 7 key operators to help them. But you're right, in some sense, is that until there is a little bit more clarity, it's a little more difficult to underwrite it at this moment. So everybody's going a little more slowly than the past. But I echo what Scott said, we think that despite a very unfortunate decision about the White House to take away too much reimbursement away that skilled nursing is by far the most effective delivery system for care in the whole system and will be favored over time and will be very successful, very successful and key part of the health care delivery systems for many years to come. So I think we're just waiting for clarity. And then we look forward to, as I said in my comments, helping George and the rest of the Genesis team, and for that matter other of our key operators build out a system that really works in the evolving health care delivery system.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On the balance sheet front, really given the widening of spreads in the unsecured market, I'm guessing that it's unfairly an avenue you want to pursue. [indiscernible] So how do you think about your funding needs over the next 6 to 12 months on the right-hand side of your balance sheet with respect to [ph] that are coming due as well as your developments on any acquisition?", "Scott A. Estes", "Hey Ross, it's Scott. You're breaking up a little bit but it seems like you're asking about just unsecured and secured pricing and it -- prospects on financing outlook going forward, so I'll give a quick overview that. Let me know if I miss anything. I guess the advantage for us is I think we have a lot of flexibilities. We think about our capital needs and that's why we put a $2 billion line in place. And I think that's the most important. As it relates to debt pricing, been a lot of movement in that market obviously as well as the overall markets I would take a current new tenure unsecured note for us probably in the 5.75% to 6% range based on current treasuries and spreads in pricing. And the secured debt market, basically, we have -- I think we have some availability in that bucket, you know, 13.6% currently. But again, we tend to assume debt that's already on properties that we acquire. And again, in terms of equity, as we've said, I think over the longer-term, we do have slightly more conservative leverage goals, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, closer to 40% debt to undepreciated book in 5x to 6x net debt to EBITDA, so you'd expect us as always to be looking at that market, too.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And can we assume that the converts that are coming up here in a month or so are going to get taken out on the line?", "Scott A. Estes", "I guess you could, although we put out a notification there's $126 million of convertible debt that's puttable to us on December 1. The reality is those are actually in the money. The conversion price is, I think, about $47.10 or so. So we have actually $5 in the money. And at least our expectation, if dependent upon our stock price, at this point is they would probably remain outstanding, but we will wait and see there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on the capital question. It was a nice increase in the dividend. I'm just curious how you guys on the board are thinking about increasing that over time, and if you're trying to -- I think you could have increased it more, but are you trying to retain a little capital going forward? Or what do you think about in terms of payout ratios?", "Scott A. Estes", "George, do you want to do that?", "George L. Chapman", "It's always a balancing act. And to some extent, we try to lower our payout ratios a bit, and we're making a lot of progress there. And unlike a lot of other of our colleagues, we see a great pipeline. And so we have plenty use for the money as well. So it is always a tough balancing act that I think we came up at the right place, but people can differ.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Is there any kind of -- I mean, obviously, there's a taxable income floor [ph] , but is there sort of a minimum payout ratio that you guys would want to exceed over time or a minimum growth rate that you would look at?", "George L. Chapman", "Right now, we're about where we want to be. We might drive it a little lower. This economy and attitudes of people swing so dramatically from -- we're starting to feel like the market wants to go up, and then we have a REIS [ph]  Situation that comes in, everybody gets conservative. So I guess we're right now sort of erring a bit on the side of being somewhat more conservative in how we're running our balance sheet and how we're looking at our liquidity. But it wouldn't surprise me in the least. I have a totally different conversation in our next earnings call. So it just takes a hell of a lot of judgment right now and a balancing act to run any public company.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my second one, it looked like CSU did a couple of -- bought a couple new assets, did you guys participate in that? And then if not, can you just remind us what the obligations are of your operators to show you deals, and for you guys to participate in any transactions that they do?", "Scott A. Estes", "They bought -- with the Capital Senior Living, they --  public company, they've got the ability to go and do assets -- do deals outside of our relationship. And in this particular case, they wanted to grow one balance sheet versus off-balance sheet. We still have an excellent relationship with them and expect to be continuing to do business with them over the long term. Each relationship we have is different. So a majority of the time, we have the right of first option, the right of first refusal on new deals and have lines of credit with many of our line -- leased lines of credit with many of our operators. So that's why we tend to see a lot of business. And when you're focused on relationships, that drives volume our way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Sekino with Barclays Capital.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I know some of the RIDEA assets that you've recently acquired have a fill-up component to them. Can you kind of give us some perspective on how the operating assets progress in a lease-up perspective?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure, Bryan. I guess, I would just generally say they're doing well. I think the -- a few of the -- it's actually only about 6 buildings. So of the 99 total, 6 are in aggregated fill-up. The portfolio is doing well. They continue to fill. And that's actually, I think, a big benefit when you think about our overall NOI growth potential and why over the last 2 quarters, we've generated the 12.6% growth last quarter and 8.2% growth this quarter.", "George L. Chapman", "Stephanie Anderson is running our RIDEA platform. Stephanie, any other color?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Yes. I mean, overall, our operators are doing really well. There's so many different levers that they can pull to drive occupancy. And the lease-up continues much as you would expect with all the concerns in economy. They just continue. We continue to lease-up and have positive momentum.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "George, just wanted to follow up on a comment you made earlier that given some of the volatility in the capital markets and in the economy today, you might be running your balance sheet a little bit more conservatively. Have you changed your return expectations on new investments at all as a result of that as well? Or perhaps maybe your growth assumptions on things you're looking at underwriting for future acquisitions?", "George L. Chapman", "Karin, right now, we are intending to get most of our new transactions from existing customers, and we're doing the best we can to accommodate them. We are clearly looking harder at our returns. And to the extent new parties come to the table, we're probably being somewhat more selective, careful in terms of giving them commitments. But we try to keep everything in play that we can that looks good to us in terms of reasonable returns going forward and building relationships. But at the same time not disadvantaging anybody in the event that the capital markets turn down. So again, I just sort of reiterate what I said earlier, it's a very interesting balancing act for all of us running this company and, for that matter, our colleagues and the rest of the Health Care REITs. The only thing I'd also add is that all of us are doing pretty well in the Health Care REITs and have probably better access to capital and better opportunities in a better industry in a sort of a choppy economy than virtually any other property type.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Second question, just appreciate the update on Genesis -- your pro forma Genesis coverage for 2012. Does that incorporate an additional 2% Medicare cut under the automatic plan that could come down the line? And if it doesn't, have you run a sensitivity on what that impact might be?", "George L. Chapman", "Scott?", "Scott A. Estes", "The numbers I articulated on the call really include basically what's known at this point, including their assessment of the therapy impacts inclusive of our full rent bump and net of their estimate of cost mitigation. To your specific question about the potential for the 2% sequestration cut, it's not included. But again, that's unknown. It would not go into effect until January of 2013, and it would be again a net cut so if there were any market basket increase, it would be net of that. The sensitivity answer is basically still the same for us as it's been. Each 1% reduction in overall Medicare rates. If you hold all else equal, it translates into about 3% to 4% of an impact to our coverage. Again, so 2% would obviously be roughly 68 basis points. But again, I would importantly reiterate is there could always be some  netting out of some cost savings.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Helpful. Just final question. What was the pricing on the dispositions that you sold in the third quarter and what you've got teed up for sale in the fourth quarter?", "Scott A. Estes", "The dispositions in the third quarter were assets that had been in our portfolio a very long time and were very small amounts. There was only $16 million in aggregate. I think the blended average was  8.5%, 9%. I think a fair estimate for the last $50 million in our guidance would be something in the range of, say, 10% probably of a disposition yield.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jerry Doctrow with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A lot's been covered. I just have a couple of quick things. Shifting to kind of MOBs, it looked like you saw a little bit of occupancy slippage sequentially. One of your competitors reported the other day, noted some significant rent rolldowns. So I was just curious if you can give a little color on the MOB and whether there's a rolldown that we should worry about.", "George L. Chapman", "John Thomas?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes. Jerry, this is John. The -- we saw a very slight bump, but it's more of a timing on the occupancy. And we expect to finish the year making that up and strong. So far this year, we're a little ahead of budget on tenant rents and roll ups or increases, so it's -- we're still averaging 1.5% to 2% on renewals, and retention rates continue to be in the in that 80% to 85%. So we wouldn't expect any meaningful rolldown.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And then construction, I went through some of the construction material you had on the website today. Clearly, you seem to be comfortable with construction remaining a decent chunk of your business. I was wondering if I can get a little color on the CCRC lease-up and just your thinking about construction, how much you're comfortable doing, that sort of thing.", "Scott A. Estes", "Jerry, maybe I'll start and try to answer. It's Scott. Yes, we still like a selective construction. It's pretty small part of the aggregate portfolio right now. I believe we only have about $450 million of total projects underway. I think most importantly, we're focused on a triple-net lease senior housing assets with existing operators that would likely roll into master leases. And the other main focus would be, largely, almost in many cases almost 100% pre-leased medical office buildings. So that is the majority of the type of project that we believe are low risk and get also nice returns in terms of the additional construction that we may do. In terms of your question about the CCRC and entrance fee fill-up, they actually progressed pretty well this quarter. The entrance fee component of those assets increased from 54% to 56%. And I would actually point out one nuance in the portfolio in terms of what we report in the supplement. The rental occupancy is reported at 82%. The number was actually down if you just compare supplement-to-supplement, but that was because we added over 100 new units this quarter. So the previous quarter's number existing portfolio would have increased about 91.5%, I think it was, prior to the effect of adding some new units. So -- and we added those because a lot of our rental component of those facilities actually had a wait list. So as we mentioned before, we've added some new units, which is a positive, because we needed some additional capacity.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And just in terms of how all that sort of plays out to any future rent bumps. I mean, if we're assuming sort of a continued, sort of a steady climb on the entrance fee, I mean, when might you bump rents again? Or where does that stand?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, we're looking at that right now, Jerry. We hope to have another rent bump of perhaps the same magnitude as last year. And we're going slow on it. The rental's doing great. The Health Care is doing great. And the entrance fee is sort of just chugging along, making progress in a very choppy economy. So it's going to be very deliberative -- it's going to be modest, and we're just going to keep moving along.", "Jerry L. Doctrow - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And probably something like January 1?", "George L. Chapman", "Probably.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicholas Yulico with Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Looking at the senior housing construction portfolio. I see there's a good chunk of the units being dementia care. And I'm just wondering how that affects your underwriting since dementia wings are obviously very important to the ultimate value of the facility, but tend to be more costly for an operator to run.", "George L. Chapman", "We've had great luck with investing in dementia care. It's a great driver of value in our sector, and it's been very solid covering parts of our portfolio. We like it a lot, and we're doing business with people who can provide either the full continuum through adding dementia care or folks that are particularly skilled in providing dementia care, maybe higher-end dementia care, such as Loren Shook at Silverado. So we're very pleased with our investments in that area.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then, I was wondering if you have actually some stash you could share on what percentage of your existing senior housing properties either have dementia care units, whether you had sort of a percent of beds number or even just a percent of total properties that have some portion of dementia care.", "George L. Chapman", "I think probably we should get back to you on that.", "Scott A. Estes", "We need to research that. It's obviously -- we don't have that one right here at the table.", "George L. Chapman", "Good question. We'll get back to you on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just getting back to the Genesis fixed-charge coverage you identified and reiterated at 1.3x to 1.4x post some of the known issues. One of the known issues you mentioned was the cost savings that they're looking to incorporate. But when you talked about them, you talked about quality mix improvements, and you talked about geographical footprint, but I didn't hear anything about specifics on where they could become more efficient from a cost perspective at the property level. Can you share some of that color?", "George L. Chapman", "We're not going to go to all of their cost savings. That gets into a lot of very -- a much private information for George. But obviously, there are ways to deal with travel, with wages, bonuses and what have you. And we are very much aware of the fact that George and his team have been very aggressive in terms of resolving these issues with the least effect on their staff, which is, I think, one of the best, if not the best, in that sector. Scott, do you want to add anything?", "Scott A. Estes", "I will comment just briefly and let Stephanie make a comment as well. But I would say, Rich, I'd really still get back to, they're doing a great job and doing everything they can do on the cost front. I really think the most important differentiator is the quality mix over time opportunity for Genesis. I mean, again, we didn't mention it on this call, but the ability to move from the low 50s up to potentially 60% to 65% over the longer term, really, is an important opportunity. We calculate that each 1% improvement in quality mix would increase their coverage by 6 basis points. So obviously having that type of an opportunity, I think, is a real important part to not focus so much on all the moving parts near term, but really a long-term opportunity at Genesis. Stephanie, do you want to talk about anything in particular?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Sure. Rich, just to give you kind of a more broad highlight on areas that are of focus is they've really spent some time talking to their long-term vendors, as well as their employees and other partners and are setting expectations of cost-sharing, and they've been very successful in that. They are continuing to focus on delivering quality care, and that won't be -- continue to be their main focus. And there will be overhead savings at the corporate, as well as the utilization of technology and the therapy delivery. And just workflow benefits that they have with bringing people in and out of their therapy gyms. So there are a lot of things. They have a list of opportunities and really just making the entire quality of care even better that they'll be focusing on.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So let's say, a year from now, it's 1.35x fixed-charge coverage for Genesis. I mean, where are you comfortable -- I'm assuming you would hope to see that number go up. I mean, where are you comfortable in terms of coverage for that -- for the quality of that portfolio?", "George L. Chapman", "We're comfortable at Genesis, HC or Humana Care, our life care centers and the other quality senior -- skilled nursing operators can handle this situation again, like they've had handled it many, many times. We obviously would like to have our skilled nursing after management fee coverage more like $1.5 billion or so. And so we're not happy. No one's happy about what we think was cutting into muscle and bone by  the White House. We think it's a mistake, but we have the ability to get back up to our desired level and above it in the very near future.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, that's fair. And then, just big picture question for you, George and whomever. You guys obviously continue to be big-time investors and buying a lot of assets through your relationships and all the rest. Do you worry at all about becoming almost too big? Are you anywhere near that in terms of, from the standpoint of economies of scale or maybe that's not the right word, but it becomes harder and harder to grow the company, and it becomes this big boulder that keeps rolling down the hill, getting bigger and bigger, harder to grow. Do you ever want to say, \"Maybe we should just sit back for a couple of years and enjoy the size of the company that we've done so far in grow off of that base as opposed to getting making the base bigger and bigger.\"", "George L. Chapman", "Rich, we've never grown just to become larger. And we continuously dispose of properties, even some that are at 9% and 10% rates because we think some of those properties will not be as attractive in the new health care and senior housing environment. So we're always very aggressive about managing our portfolio. This just happens to be a period in which the health care REITs have wonderful access to capital, equity and debt at very attractive rates. And there are -- is consolidation going on in the operator worlds, and we're going to run hard. And we're doing very well vis-a-vis our closest competitors in terms of getting the best and the brightest. And I think it's just one of those time period. Just wait a year or so when a lot of the packages are gone and then we will have the ability to do that $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year with our relationships. And there won't be that many transactions out there. So it's going to be a very different world in a year or so. It's just a very unique time period.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was just wondering if you could walk through some of the detail behind how you got to the 4.5% or 4.4% top NOI growth on the same-store -- or triple-net senior housing portfolio?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure. Most of the -- I think you're referencing the 4.4% same-store senior's housing triple-net NOI growth. Okay. There was some benefit of, really, 2 factors, some catching up this year in terms of rents where we didn't get the full increase or in the prior year. And the other factor was the increase in the entrance fee properties this year versus last year helped to get us a little bit above what you'd probably expect to see in more normal, call it, 2.5-ish percent rate of growth in that portfolio.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So the entrance fee component, that specifically ties to the deferrals -- the rent deferrals that are coming back now?", "George L. Chapman", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ureil Gioti [ph] with Morgan Stanley.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "It seems overall that the RIDEA portfolio is performing well despite the macro headwinds that are in the economy. Do you believe, though, that at any point in this macro headwinds could cause RIDEA growth to soften below your expectations?", "George L. Chapman", "It's a sort of hard to answer that question because there'll be circumstances in the economy that could slow the growth in RIDEA. Yes, I mean, there could be. But we think we have a very reasonable balance between triple-net and RIDEA structures. And we've also -- so that we will manage any risk such as that. Also our experience, frankly looking back at our RIDEA partners is such that it's a very unlikely that the growth would go below at least the triple-net regular increase. But is it possible that we'll have slower growth? Yes. And probably the best way to look at RIDEA is sort of averaging out the rate of growth over a number of years and maybe even averaging out certain sections of the country that may be up while the others are down. So that's sort of how we present it to you. We think overall that we're going to get a better return on RIDEA over time than with the net lease.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And my other question is regarding one of the asset classes that you purchased this last quarter. You wanted the -- you purchased some hospitals. And looking at supplemental, you actually haven't gone into that space in a while. What motivated the purchase of hospitals in this quarter?", "George L. Chapman", "John Thomas?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes, this is John. That was with one of our existing good relationship clients. It was pursuing an acquisition consolidation within the LTAC space. And we've been with post-acute within patient rehab and LTACs, we've been concentrating on some life investments with our existing operators. And that particular operator is one of our better clients. So good assets, good pricing. And there's some opportunity from some upside of the company related to that transaction.", "Scott A. Estes", "Some good coverage to it, John, I mean, projected to be in excess of cash flow coverage in excess of 2x.", "John T. Thomas", "Correct.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And where do you see hospitals overall in your portfolio like -- because you were saying earlier that you see RIDEA senior housing as being about 14%, 15% of your portfolio? Where do hospitals line up there?", "John T. Thomas", "In that kind of 5% and 10% total. And we wouldn't, we think, go lower into that range with growth. Again, mostly with selective clients that we already have or great new opportunities. We opened a hospital with Loma Linda this year. That's a -- that's been a great investment with the medical office building that opened completely full. So we're getting 9-plus-percent yields from a great institutional client like that. So pretty selective, and primarily with existing clients and just on the mix of assets in that range. And as Scott mentioned, we're focused on 2x to 3x coverage ratios.", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think too, to add to add to that John, is that as we see the world evolving, it could be that our initial relationship with a hospital could be to do a hospital -- but where we think health systems are going is more toward outpatient facilities, more preventative care. And hopefully, these relationships that could start with a hospital investment will lead to a lot more of the modern post-acute or outpatient facilities that we really think are going to be the drivers in the future.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And I don't know if you mentioned this, or I might have missed it, but did you do provide the current key mix for the Genesis portfolio?", "George L. Chapman", "Scott?", "Scott A. Estes", "Going into this year, I believe it has increased over the last 5 years from 47% up to about 53%. So generally, it's about that, 54% right now.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "54%?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And when you were looking in the Chelsea portfolio, were you thinking that this portfolio would fall, well, within your idea of synergies with the Genesis portfolio?", "George L. Chapman", "We think that -- I think we have total assets up in the Northeast right now, Northeast and mid-Atlantic, that is in excess of 40% of our portfolio, which is I think double the percentage of any of our main competitors there. And we do think that anytime we get up there with high-quality assets and assisted living or post-acute for that matter, even hospitals, that we're going to try to drive a lot of synergy. Our board meeting last week was in Philadelphia and in New Jersey where we met with Brandywine, actually had our board meeting at our Brandywine facility. George Hager was there from Genesis. And then we had a very nice meeting, a great meeting with Rich Miller, who's CEO of the Virtua System, the most profitable hospital system in New Jersey. So we are looking to begin that process of breaking down the silos, making Health Care senior housing more efficient. So, yes, we're going to be very, very aggressive in doing that. We're probably still 1 year or 2 away from moving toward full ACOs and bundled payments and things like that, but we're trying to help break down the silos and get people ready for it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you talk about more -- a little more about the Chelsea portfolio? How did you source the transaction? And can you talk about the mix of IL and AL?", "John T. Thomas", "We've known the folks at Chelsea a number of years. Back when I was a consultant, we worked with them when they were starting out the company. So we've had a long history with these guys over the years. And our originating team has known them for many years when I was back a consultant, 10 buildings and expo markets in New Jersey and New York, all private-pay facilities, a little over 900 units, about 2/3 of them in the assisted living area and another 1/3 in memory care and IL side of the business. So I mean, real high-quality, excellent markets, tough to replace them. And like you've said, we've known them a long time and finally had the opportunity do business with them.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Are there any options to acquire existing facilities with Chelsea? Anything part of that deal.", "John T. Thomas", "We've been reviewing additional transactions with all of our operators. Right now, this is a majority of their portfolio. We've talked about other assets that they either have managed our have options on, and we expect to continue to grow the relationship over time.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And George, in your opening remarks, you highlighted the consolidation across several of the property types. It seems like skilled nursing would be a logical place to start. Can you comment on skilled consolidation or any other property types maybe you see for next year?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think that anytime you have sort of a shock going through any particular sector, some people are just going to hide and try to get through it. I always think that those kind of periods as periods of opportunity. So I think that will happen. I think we're still waiting for a little bit more clarity as people form relationships with one another, and then that can lead to more efficient pricing. So I would be surprised if consolidation would not occur.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just one question, kind of correlated to Todd's there. You talked about opportunities to add to the RIDEA portfolio that you've got. You've been holding steady at 99 facilities. Going forward, how -- what should we be expecting there if you're going to have? Would this be in the form of development with your partners or helping them acquire and integrate new facilities? Kind of just a sense of where that would go.", "George L. Chapman", "I think most of them would be new acquisitions, Rob, for now with very selective development within their particular region of focus, so strongly acquisition-oriented for at least the next year, some selective development.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "And I know if you can't write this in stone, but given that several of those portfolios are kind of geographically concentrated, I assume the acquisitions would be more on the smaller scale than significant change, or am I not thinking of it the right way?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think all of the existing acquisitions have tended to get somewhat smaller, okay? So I think you're generally correct, but there are some opportunities right now for, yes, $100 million, 500 million for some and -- but I guess that's tending to be a little smaller, given the size of our original acquisitions. But I still think they're significant and had too some of the cost efficiencies within the region for some of our top operators.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Odell with AIG Asset Management.", "Michael Odell - Medlife", "I was just hoping to revisit the discussion of utilizing EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage. I understand the fees subordinate to lease payment. But in practice, have you ever actually received rent without a management fee being paid? And also on that note, when you underwrite deals, are you doing so on and EBITDAR or EBITDARM basis?", "Scott A. Estes", "Mike, it's Scott. We do look at both. As we all know, we've provided both before and after management fees. So we have perspective, and we obviously, we can help you understand whatever numbers you want. So the inconsistency we found was causing a lot of confusion around the number. And there's intent to not help you understand what an after-management fee number is. So we'll continue to work with you to give you whatever you need.", "Michael Odell - Medlife", "Okay. Would you be able to provide those EBITDAR coverage numbers?", "Scott A. Estes", "I don't have them in front of me right now.", "Operator", "At this time, there for no further questions. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Chapman for his closing remarks.", "George L. Chapman", "We would just, in closing, thank you for your participation and, again, indicate that Scott and his team will be available for follow-up questions after this call. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the conference. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(SRZ) Q3 2011 Earnings Call November  8, 2011  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Mark Ordan \u2013 Chief Executive Officer", "Marc Richards \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Greg Neeb \u2013 Chief Investment and Administrative Officer", "Tim Smith \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations", "Analysts", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Prashant Anander \u2013 Tilton (phon)", "", "Operator", "", "Good day everyone and welcome to the Sunrise Senior Living Third Quarter Earnings conference call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Smith. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim Smith", "Thank you and welcome to Sunrise Senior Living\u2019s investor conference call. This is Tim Smith, Sunrise\u2019s Investor Relations.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being recorded and the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call. During the course of this call, the Company will make various remarks concerning management\u2019s expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and the Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "", "Thank you. Good morning everybody. Amid concerns that senior housing, and certainly high-end seniors\u2019 housing would be in a tailspin \u2013 witness the share declines in our sector \u2013 we are very pleased by our solid performance in occupancy, rate and NOI both in the third quarter and for the year. As we announced last evening and Greg Neeb will review in greater detail, comparing the third quarter 2011 to the third quarter 2010, stabilized community occupancy is up 10 basis points, average revenue per occupied unit for stabilized communities increased 5%, and NOI increased 4.3% for stabilized communities and 9.2% overall. We continue to enjoy real demand for our need-driven lifestyle and services in this wild economy. We think we know why.", "The Sunrise portfolio is a unique collection of communities which support our Company-wide devotion to seniors with varying levels of frailty. For your mom or dad, there\u2019s a room type in one of our communities at Sunrise that will enable their best possible life. We provide a value which we believe cannot be matched. Simply put, if your mom or dad needs the level of service, care and devotion that Sunrise communities provide, our value is unbeatable. This has been in Sunrise\u2019s DNA since its founding 30 years ago this December. ", "For shareholders, this is not the whole story. In Q3, we continued to fulfill our promise of operating at a lower overhead level. Changes made in this quarter will reduce our annual overhead run rate by over $5 million. This is a result of a difficult process - it must support all we do for seniors but always with a strong sense of economy and efficiency. We recorded both severance and transactions costs in the quarter which pushed us above our $90 million 2011 run rate target. Severance, obviously, is a necessary byproduct of expense reductions that are done professionally with people who are leaving only because we must grow smaller. We believe that our field operations, the envy of senior living, have achieved a proper level efficiency but we continue to find ways to reduce strictly corporate overhead and, as this quarter again demonstrates, we know how to drive down this tough road.", "We think our overhead from transaction costs actually represents a great investment. During the past 18 months, we have announced and closed a series of well-priced and transformative transactions which have steadily increased our ownership of the best real estate we manage while cementing long-term management contracts with these communities. These transactions enable us at a fixed and achievable IRR to purchase the remainder of these portfolios. I cannot overstress the great asset quality in these purchases and the upside potential that comes from owing great assets with locked in long-term management contracts. These are prominent in-fill locations concentrated in Tier 1 metropolitan areas. This is another important differentiator between us and others.", "We are also very proud of our relationship with CNL, a group who we\u2019ve closely aligned with not just on deal structure but also on how to operate top pride assets and making sure that they\u2019re well maintained and managed. We expect to drive results in these properties and that will directly add great value to Sunrise.", "In summary, with these transactions we have been building real net asset value, protecting our future management agreements, and putting us in a position in 2013 and beyond to materially increase our results. We know that our responsibility to our shareholders is to maximize the value of their holdings. Our careers have been built on this. Everything we\u2019re doing as managers is toward this goal. We work to minimize overhead costs and make our operating platform, when viewed standalone, a long-term cash flow and asset value building machine with unmatchable levels of care.", "While we build long-term value and we\u2019re pleased with continuing solid demand from families, we also know that the economy\u2019s path is uncertain and may remain depressed for quite some time. This is why we are so determined to always preserve a solid liquidity position, aka cash, so we can keep Sunrise out of harm\u2019s way. While Sunrise is in every measurable way stronger than in many years, we still don\u2019t have Microsoft\u2019s balance sheet. We look to spending money very carefully, balancing long-term value creation while preserving a strong cushion to make sure we get there. ", "Before Mark and Greg provide color on the quarter\u2019s activities and metrics, I want to share with you our initiatives to keep our core strong, advancing, and prepared to be a first-class partner in a changing healthcare system. We have a dedicated team that knows that our corporate wellbeing goes hand-in-hand with the wellbeing of our residents and communities. We are of course pleased that both Ventas and HCP were able to report improved results in their Sunrise portfolios, mirroring our overall results. ", "We\u2019ve also totally revamped our budget process during the past year, not to set aspirational guideposts but to reflect an asset-by-asset, room-by-room underwriting of our entire portfolio. We alongside our capital partners and owners work carefully to manage our daily operations and maximize results going forward. ", "We do continue to work through certain portfolio issues, but even here we seek opportunities to maintain or advance our position. Both in North America and the U.K., we are in discussions with lenders and partners which provide us with comfort that Sunrise\u2019s downside risk is manageable. Greg Neeb will detail these shortly. ", "I know that in today\u2019s environment people ask, when will all these issues go away? Well, at Sunrise this is part of what we tackle every day and it\u2019s something that we think we\u2019re very good at working through, and it all goes back to defending and building net asset and shareholder value and finding ways to grow profitably.", "I\u2019ll turn the call over now to Marc Richards, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide further details for the quarter, and then Greg Neeb will add detail and color to our restructuring and operating activities. Marc?", "Marc Richards", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining our third quarter conference call. I will focus my discussion this morning on Sunrise\u2019s consolidated operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2011.", "During the third quarter, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 8.7 million or $0.15 per fully diluted share as compared to net income of 18.7 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share in 2010. The change between periods was primarily driven by a $40 million buyout fee paid to us by HCP in the third quarter last year for the right to buy out 27 management contracts which were subsequently bought out in November of 2010.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was 37 million as compared to 31.8 million for the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to incremental EBITDAR from our ALUS and CC3 acquisitions and lower general and administrative expenses net of non-cash stock compensation expense. We have adjusted net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense to further exclude certain non-cash gains and losses and other items of income or expenses, including costs related to our restructuring efforts, in arriving at adjusted EBITDAR.", "General and administrative expenses were 28.3 million for the quarter compared to 31.2 million for the same period in 2010. Our Q3 2011 G&A includes 2.1 million of severance expenses, 1.1 million of professional fees associated with our previously announced venture transactions, and 2.2 million of non-cash stock compensation expense. Our Q3 2010 G&A included 1.4 million of severance expenses and $900,000 of stock compensation expense.", "Management fees for the quarter were 23.5 million, which includes $300,000 of fee income from management contracts that have since been bought out. For the same period last year, management fees were 28.7 million, which includes 5.9 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been bought out.", "Before I move on to net operating income from our consolidated and lease communities, I\u2019d like to remind you that we began consolidating the operating results from the 15 ALUS communities on June 2, 2011. Our third quarter consolidated results include 21.1 million of resident fee income and 13.2 million of community expense for consolidated communities associated with the ALUS portfolio. Also, we consolidate six of the 29 communities within the new CNL venture as of January 2011. Accordingly, we have reflected 10.7 million in resident fee income, 6.1 million of community expense for consolidated communities, and 4.3 million of community lease expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the third quarter of 2011.", "In our supplemental disclosure, we have reflected the net operating income from these six consolidated CNL communities in the appropriate joint venture pool rather than in our consolidated leased NOI as the mortgage debt and related assets are all held within the venture; and for comparability purposes, our supplemental disclosures reflect the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year aggregate operating results of the ALUS communities for the periods prior to June 2, 2011 in our consolidated leased NOI rather than as a venture.", "Our third quarter 2011 consolidated and leased community net operating income excluding the impact of the six CNL consolidated venture communities and the 15 ALUS communities decreased by 1.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily due to an increase in insurance expense of 3.6 million due to the reassessment of our actuarial estimate of ultimate expected losses. We have seen higher than expected workers\u2019 compensation costs and general and professional liability expense. Net operating income is income from operations excluding depreciation, lease expense, and impairment charges related to these communities. ", "Moving on to our year-over-year results, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 25.2 million or $0.44 per fully diluted share for the first nine months of 2011 as compared to net income of 49.1 million or $0.86 per fully diluted share for the first nine months of 2010. The significant year-over-year change was driven by a $54.6 million gain associated with our German debt restructuring and 53.5 million of buy-out fees earned in 2010.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the first nine months of 2011 was 104.2 million as compared to 95 million for the same period last year. The increase of 9.2 million was primarily due to incremental EBITDAR from our ALUS and CC3 acquisitions and lower G&A net of non-cash stock compensation expense. These positive results were partially offset by lower management and professional fee income primarily due to bought out management contracts.", "General and administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2011 were 88.2 million compared to 92.9 million in 2010. Our 2011 G&A includes 3.1 million in professional fees associated with our venture transactions and 5.9 million of stock compensation expense. Further, G&A expense included 6.5 million in severance costs related to the reduction of 89 positions at our corporate and regional offices as well as a $2 million retention bonus. Our 2010 G&A for the nine month period includes 2.9 million of stock comp expense and 8.4 million of legal fees incurred associated with the HCP litigation that was resolved in the third quarter of 2010.", "Management fees for the first nine months of 2011 were 72.1 million, which includes 4.3 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been bought out. For the same period last year, management fees were 89.4 million which includes 18.7 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been bought out.", "Our year-to-date 2011 consolidated operating results were also impacted by 94.1 million of NOI from our consolidated and leased communities as compared to 68.8 million during 2010, an increase of 25.3 million. The 2011 consolidation of the six New York CC3 communities accounts for 13 million of this increase and the consolidation of the ALUS portfolio accounts for an additional 10.5 million of this increase.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, our unrestricted cash balance at September 30 was 82.9 million. Our outstanding consolidated debt has increased from 163 million at the end of 2010 to 555.7 million at the end of September 2011. We issued 86.3 million of junior subordinated convertible notes in April of 2011. This increase also reflects the now consolidated debt of the ALUS portfolio in the amount of 323 million. The increase on the asset side of the balance sheet reflects the estimated fair value of the acquired real estate of these 15 communities of approximately 412 million.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Neeb.", "Greg Neeb", "Thanks, Marc. Continuing our goal of providing transparency into our principal business lines, I will provide comments on operating results for our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures, and our management agreements, which is a reflection of how we manage our business. I will also elaborate on a number of key transactions within each business line to enhance visibility on the impact to overall value. This information is available in our supplement 8-K filed yesterday.", "Let me now turn over to our overall performance for the quarter. Despite sluggish market conditions, overall trends for Sunrise communities were positive. Comparing third quarter 2011 to the third quarter of 2010, stabilized community occupancy is up 10 basis points, average revenue per occupied unit for stabilized communities increased 5%, and NOI increased 4.3% for stabilized communities and 9.2% overall. ", "Operating trends for the Sunrise leased communities trended lower for the quarter. NOI for the stabilized leased communities was down 11.3%. This decrease was the result of higher insurance costs, specifically the insurance adjustment Marc just discussed earlier on the call. Without this adjustment, NOI in the leased portfolio was essentially flat. Occupancy was slightly lower or 88.2% for the third quarter 2011 versus 89.2% for third quarter 2010, primarily driven down by lower IO occupancy in our larger rental full-service properties.", "Our 24 consolidated communities consist of a variety of asset types and other properties we consolidate but don\u2019t own 100%. These include the 15 mansion ALUS portfolio we acquired earlier in the year, our three Quebec communities, and Connecticut Avenue. These communities reported a slight increase in NOI of 1%; however, similar to the leased assets, these assets experienced higher insurance costs related to our modified actuarial estimates. Without these higher costs, NOI spiked over 11%.", "As discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, we have engaged with our lender on three Quebec communities to obtain a loan modification and extension. The outstanding loan balance related to these communities is non-recourse to us, but we have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lender. We are not currently funding under these operating deficit guarantees. The principal balance of 45.3 million was due on April 30, 2011. We continue to increase occupancy and NOI while we work through the pending loan modification but have been unable to implement our new business plan that we believe is necessary to drive a successful outcome.", "Operating trends for venture and managed communities for the third quarter 2011 were strong with average revenue per occupied unit, occupancy and NOI all up over the third quarter of 2010. Net operating income for stabilized joint ventures was up 6.4% while NOI for stabilized managed communities was up 9%. Joint venture lease-up properties continue to improve as evidenced by occupancy rising to 78.5% and NOI increasing 54%. ", "As previously mentioned in our last call, on August 2, 2011 we and our venture partner and a portfolio of six communities transferred ownership of the portfolio to a new joint venture owned 70% by a wholly owned subsidiary of CNL and 30% by us. In addition, the new venture modified the existing mortgage loan in the amount of 133.2 million to provide for, among other things, number one, pay down the loan by approximately 28.7 million; and number two, an extension of the loan maturity date to April 2014, which may be extended by two additional years under certain conditions. In connection with the transaction, we contributed $8.1 million and CNL contributed $19 million for the new venture. The agreement secured our long-term management agreement with unlimited cures and control over the assets via a buy-out feature. ", "Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, in October 2011 we closed the previously announced purchase and sale agreement with Master MorSun Acquisition LLC for its 80% ownership interest in a joint venture that owns seven senior living facilities to a new joint venture owned approximately 68% by CNL Income Partners LP and approximately 32% by us. In connection with the transaction, we transferred our interest in the previous joint venture valued at approximately 16.7 million and CNL Income Partners LP contributed approximately 35.4 million. The purchase was also funded by a $120 million new debt financing in the venture. The agreement secured our long-term 7% management agreement with unlimited cure rights and control over the assets long-term via a buy-out feature.", "In the United Kingdom, one venture\u2019s mortgage loan is in default at September 30, 2011 due to a violation of certain loan covenants. The mortgage loan balance was $627.9 million as of September 30, 2011. The loan is collateralized by 15 communities owned by the venture. The lender has rights, which include foreclosure of the communities. The venture is in discussions with the lender regarding the possibility of entering into a loan modification. The lender has verbally expressed their desire to work with the venture and manager to extend and modify the loan terms. We have begun negotiating a standstill agreement with the goal to negotiate a final modification hopefully sometime in 2012.", "During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we recognized $5.7 million in management fees from this venture. Our United Kingdom management segment reported $2.a million in income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. Our investment balance in this venture was zero at September 30, 2011.", "In 2006, we sold a majority interest in two separate entities related to a condominium project for which we provide guarantees to support the operations and debt service of the entities for an extended period of time. We are obligated to the lender and our partners on the assisted living venture to fund operating shortfalls. We are also obligated to our partner on the condominium venture to fund operating shortfalls including sales and marketing costs. The assisted living venture contains the amenities unit for the condominium owners who pay monthly fees for these services. We have funded $7.8 million under the guarantee through September 30, 2011 of which 0.9 million was funded in 2011. The depressed condominium real estate market in Washington, DC area has resulted in lower overall sales and pricing then forecasted, and we believe the partners have no remaining equity in the condominium project. Accordingly, we have informed our partner that we do not intend to fund future operating shortfalls in the condominium venture. As of September 30, 2011, loans of approximately 116 million for the condominium venture and 30 million for the assisted living venture are both in default. We have accrued 2.2 million in default interest relating to these ventures. We are in discussions with the lenders regarding these defaults.", "In connection with the restructuring of our German indebtedness, we granted mortgages for the benefit of electing lenders on certain of our unencumbered North America properties, what we call the liquidating trust. As of September 30, 2011, the liquidating trust asset consists of nine land parcels and one closed community. The carrying value of the related notes is subject to our minimum payment guarantee. The balance as of September 30, 2011 was $26.3 million, which represents our minimum payment guarantee at that date. Based on current market conditions and anticipated sales volume, we believe we may be required to fund approximately 5 million under this guarantee. ", "In total, Sunrise ventures have total debt of 2.5 billion with near-term scheduled debt maturities of 0.4 billion for the remainder of 2011 and 0.2 billion in 2012. Of this, 2.5 billion of debt, there was 0.9 billion that is in default as of September 30, 2011. The debt in the ventures is non-recourse to us with respect to principal payment guarantees, and we and our venture partners are working with the lenders to obtain covenant waivers and to extend the maturity dates, and also (inaudible), the construction loans and permanent financing provided by financial institutions is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed community. We have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lenders or ventures with respect to 0.7 billion of the total venture debt. Under the operating deficit agreements, we are obligated to pay operating shortfalls, if any, with respect to the ventures. Any such payments could include amounts arising in part from the ventures\u2019 obligations for payment of monthly principal and interest on the venture debt. These operating deficit agreements would not obligate us to repay the principal balance on such venture debt that might become due as a result of acceleration of such indebtedness or maturity. We have non-controlling interest in these ventures.", "Back to you, Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Marc. Operator, we\u2019ll open the call for questions now.", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. If you\u2019d like to ask a question at this time, please signal by pressing the star key followed by the digit one on your touchtone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that\u2019s star, one for questions. We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to assemble our roster.", "Again, that\u2019s star, one for questions. We\u2019ll go first to Jerry Doctrow, Stifel Nicolaus.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Good morning. Always a lot going on. I guess maybe a broad question first \u2013 overall in terms of just occupancy rate and that sort of thing, it looked like\u2014I mean, you\u2019re making very good progress. It looked like things were maybe slowing down a little bit when we start thinking about Q-over-Q. I was just wondering if you could give me any color about how you\u2019re feeling about the market out there. Are you doing any kind of discounting? I think Greg had said that the IL in the CCRC\u2019s was maybe slower than the AL; but just a little more color for sort of the market environment overall.", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah well, Greg was accurately \u2013 it\u2019s Mark \u2013 Greg was accurately portraying some of the differences we see, and I think others do, in IL versus AL where AL is obviously much more demand-driven. I would say no, we\u2019re not doing anything promotionally that\u2019s at all outstanding. Demand has been strong. We\u2019ve worked to really manage our inventory well, so we feel pretty good about things. You know, we read the newspapers to then we don\u2019t feel so good about things, so we\u2019re cautious in our outlook; but so far, so good \u2013 no special, unusual discounting or anything like that.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay, so if we\u2019re thinking of occupancy and rate continue to trend modestly higher, maybe a little stronger on the lease-up stuff, that\u2019s kind of the right way to be thinking about kind of the next couple quarters, at least?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, I don\u2019t know. Like I said, so far we feel pretty good. I can\u2019t tell where things are going to trend, but yes, we feel that we have strong enough demand to be able to look at our combination of occupancy and pricing and feel cautiously optimistic.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay. And then sort of a bunch of specific things \u2013 Bethesda, obviously you stopped funding the deficit guarantees. Do you expect them to foreclose on that property or you expect it to get worked out, your involvement will continue? Any sense of what\u2019s the most likely outcome there?", "Mark Ordan", "Actually, I\u2019m not sure what the outcome is going to be. We\u2019re in the middle of active discussions with both our lenders and our partners, and I really don\u2019t have any additional color to provide right now. As we know more, you\u2019ll know more.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay. There\u2019s this little feely lawsuit \u2013 I think it\u2019s in California. I think it\u2019s filed as a class action. Big deal, little deal? Any color on how concerned we should be about it?", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah, that\u2019s been dismissed.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Oh, okay. Okay. CAPEX \u2013 I think it was 2.5 million or so in the current run rate. I think it\u2019s been a little higher in the past. Just a sense of trend line there or what\u2019s the right run rate?", "Marc Richards", "Yeah, I think where we\u2019ve been running in the past is pretty reflective of where we are. Maybe we\u2019re down a little in this particular quarter, but our spend, I think you\u2019ll see in Q4, will be consistent with our full year.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay. I think this was\u2014JV proportional share of income seemed like it moved around a lot. That\u2019s sort of the shifting\u2014you know, just down from 11.2 million to 4.3 million 2Q to 3Q. It seemed like the CNL stuff and the ALUS obviously moved out a lot earlier, so I was trying to\u2014what was maybe making that\u2014causing that swing. Was that (audio interference) that back offline.", "Marc Richards", "Jerry, this is Marc. Are you looking at that from an earnings perspective or on an EBITDAR perspective?", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "EBITDAR \u2013 adjusted EBITDAR.", "Marc Richards", "Yeah, I don\u2019t have that data right in front of me, but I can get back to you on that.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay. And I guess just on the SNF stuff, I think you had said previously about a $1 million a quarter hit on the skilled nursing because of the Medicare changes and that sort of thing. I know some of the skilled companies, senior housing companies were saying some of that may have already started to be felt in the quarter as you kind of repositioned or sort of adjusted in anticipation. Is that kind of\u2014you know, if we think of it as a one quarter $1 million hit, is that still the right kind of number, or just where are we on that?", "Marc Richards", "Yeah, based on our current estimates on that, we still feel about $1 million a quarter is right. We\u2019ll know more moving through the fourth quarter as those new rates come into play.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay. And one question sort of Mark raised parenthetically was when will all these issues go away, but I don\u2019t think you answered that, so I was curious to come back to that. It sounded like some of the stuff you were saying, you were starting to talk towards 2013 as being sort of the year we might see substantial growth maybe starting to bring some of these assets back on balance sheet, or buy out some of the JVs and stuff. Just a little bit more on that, thinking about that timing, or am I reading too much into your remarks?", "Mark Ordan", "Maybe a little bit, but I\u2019d say a couple things. On a lot of the work-out issues, while they pale in comparison to the issues we had to deal with over the last couple of years, there\u2019s still a bunch out there and, as I said, I think we\u2019re pretty good at working through them and having construction dialogues with our lender to make sure that either we can retain upside or in other cases just make sure that we really contain our downside. What I was talking about in 2013 and beyond is that I think that we are adding a lot of value to this company, and whether we buy out our venture partners in the future, we think that by\u2014these transactions have really transformed Sunrise into not just a manager but a manager that has, number one, locked in management contracts and soon would have the ability, especially is we\u2019re really increasing occupancy in the metrics in those communities, to have far more valuable assets in our portfolio that we can purchase at a fixed IRR so that there could be a lot of value unlocked that way.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Okay. And I think we\u2019ve talked before, Mark \u2013 I think a third, roughly, of the JV units, or maybe that was before some leases and buyouts, you had buyout rights on either at some point. Is that kind of the right number, so we would expect more of these transactions to go forward?", "", "Mark Ordan", "Well, we like these transactions and when we can do them, we will because we think, again, locking in the management agreements and being able to add value where we see occupancy off of its traditional highs and we think that there are levers that we turn to really improve those values, yeah, I think those are\u2014I think that\u2019s what our shareholders would hope we do.", "Jerry Doctrow \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus", "Thanks. That\u2019s all for me.", "Mark Ordan", "Okay. Thanks so much, Jerry.", "Operator", "As a reminder to our audience, it is star, one if you\u2019d like to ask a question at this time. Again, if you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. We\u2019ll pause for just a moment to see if we have any additional questions.", "Again, star, one for questions.", "We\u2019ll go next to Prashant Anander, Tilton (phon).", "Prashant Anander \u2013 Tilton", "Yeah hi. I have a question that relates to the business trend within the quarter. So did you see the business slow down in September relative to July and August, and can you comment on incentive that you\u2019ve given to residents to attract business relative to, let\u2019s say, Q2?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, we don\u2019t break it out month by month, but I would say that the third quarter\u2014we announced in the second quarter that there had been some slowdown in the quarter, but then toward the end of the quarter it had picked up and we continued to see that into the third quarter. As I commented earlier in response to Jerry, we really have no special incentive programs. What we do \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to be cute about it \u2013 but we have many varying room types at Sunrise, so what we really most focus on is how to accommodate somebody\u2019s needs and budget within the various rooms that we have. So it\u2019s been business as usual. I referred to the budget process \u2013 I think we\u2019re doing a dramatically better job of really looking at our communities room-by-room and making sure that people in the field think about the potential. But otherwise, nothing else.", "Prashant Anander \u2013 Tilton", "And the follow-up \u2013 is 20 million a reasonable quarterly EBITDA run rate for the near term? Can you comment, elaborate on that?", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah, I can\u2019t comment on that. We don\u2019t issue that, so.", "Prashant Anander \u2013 Tilton", "And finally on the level of debt, where do you see that going? I mean, is 550 million\u2014are you comfortable with the leverage and what\u2019s your plan to adjust that, I guess, in the direction you want it to go?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, most people like their debt to go down; but I would say that we have\u2014I don\u2019t know how long you have followed Sunrise. We have had a dramatically more difficult debt situation in the past. We think that we are, as I said, very good at working through these issues, but we don\u2019t forecast where that\u2019s going to go. In many of the cases, the leverage that we have on our ventures is very appropriate, and obviously the more real estate we buy the higher our venture debt goes. So are we comfortable? Yeah, I\u2019d say we\u2019re comfortable.", "Prashant Anander \u2013 Tilton", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Ordan for any additional or closing remarks.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Operator. Well, thank you all very much for your continued support and understanding.

My name is Brooke, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website as well.", "Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT, for his opening remarks. George?", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks, Jeff. Let me begin by providing some perspective on the growth and transformation of our company. During the last 5 years, we have built a large S&P 500 company with great personnel and scalable processes. Our assets and enterprise value have more than tripled to $14.9 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively. The company has become a full-service health care, real estate organization dedicated to the continuing improvement of health care delivery. ", "As we reflect on our company's accomplishments, I would like to highlight just a couple of items from 2011. First, last year we generated 1-year and 5-year cumulative total returns of 21% and 71%, respectively, both were best among our Health Care REIT peers. On the investment front, we completed a record level of $6 million -- $6 billion of investments including $1.2 billion of new investments in the fourth quarter. Clearly, our relationship investing program is working. At year end, 71% of our revenues were derived from private-pay sources. We'll move that number to the 80% level in the next year or so. ", "Health Care REIT continues to differentiate itself from the market with its relationship investment strategy. Our long-standing immersion in healthcare is an inherent part of our ability to execute on this strategy. Because of this knowledge base, we are able to identify healthcare trends early and positioned and even  reposition the portfolio for the future. Moreover, we are able to add substantial value to our operators and health systems. ", "Our success in attracting the leading operators to our portfolio continued in 2011. We generated $5.2 billion in high-quality Senior Living investments. Significant additional investments were made with existing operators including Brandywine Senior Living, Merrill Gardens, Silverado Senior Living and Capital Senior Living. In the last half of the year, we also developed important new relationships with Chelsea Senior Living, Belmont Senior Living and Chartwell Senior Housing REIT. ", "We're obviously very excited about our partnership with Chartwell, the premier and largest publicly traded operator of senior housing in Canada. This important new relationships establishes  a best-in-class platform for Health Care REIT in Canada and extends our proven business model into the Canadian market. The high-quality portfolio is in attractive Metropolitan markets with favorable demographics and will be immediately accretive to FFO, with future NOI growth projected at 4% to 5%. And we expect to grow this partnership in the future with rights to first offer on acquisition and new development opportunities. ", "In our medical facilities division, we made investments totaling $745 million last year in high-quality health system-affiliated medical facilities. At year end, our sector leading occupancy and retention rates exceeded 93% and 79%, respectively. We continued to increase the average size of our MOBs to 60,000 square feet and the percentage of MOBs affiliated with health systems to 87%. At year end, we owned and managed over 11 million square feet of MOBs. ", "A touchstone of the long-term success of our relationship investment program is the strength and quality of our portfolio. We have sector-leading portfolio diversification with our top 10 operators constituting only 52% of our portfolio, and in the face of challenging economic times, our aggregate facility coverage was 1.9:1, demonstrating much greater resiliency for  health care and senior housing facilities than for other real estate classes. We are enhancing our portfolio by capturing investments that reflect emerging industry trends in the evolving senior housing and healthcare environment and by culling properties from the portfolio that are not aligned with our strategy. ", "In 2011, we disposed of $352 million of non-core assets. During the 5 years ended  12/31/11, we averaged $230 million of dispositions per year, and most of these dispositions were older, primarily, Medicaid-funded skilled nursing facilities, small unaffiliated MOBs and smaller portfolios. We have positioned our portfolio in high-end high-barrier-to-entry markets across the country. ", "At year end, 40% of our portfolio was located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic areas. 76% of our portfolio and 91% of our RIDEA investments were located in the East and West Coast markets or the top 31 MSAs. Historically, facilities in these high-barrier-to-entry markets  generally outperform other facilities. And these concentrations also give us the opportunity to foster collaboration among portfolio partners across the healthcare spectrum. ", "Health Care REIT's growth, particularly during the last 2 years has been fueled by rapid growth and change within the Health Care market. We expect the growth and consolidation in  health care to continue for several years. It is being driven by economies of scale, the clear need for professional management and training and the critical importance of technology to integrate clinical care, accounting and sales and marketing. These larger professionally managed and visible operators in the system should drive significant future investment opportunities for our company. ", "So we emerge from 2011 as an industry leader, with a most unique and sustainable platform for future growth. This platform in our industry-leading portfolio will continue to drive strong organic and consistent reliable external growth. ", "And before turning the presentation over to Scott Estes, I'd like to take a minute and congratulate Scott Brinker,  who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President in Investments. And since 2001, Scott has played a key role in growing our portfolio from $1 billion to over $15 billion of real estate investments today, and we look forward to Scott continuing to play a central role in executing our strategic objectives. So congratulations, Scott. ", "I will now turn to Scott Estes, our CFO, for a REIT financial and portfolio overview. Scott?", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, George, and good morning, everybody. I apologize. I'm a little bit under the weather today. I have a little bit of a cold, so not quite 100%, but, I have a lot of exciting things to talk about today. ", "As George discussed, 2011 was clearly a remarkable year, in which we transformed our portfolio, completing a record-breaking $6 billion of growth investments. Our portfolio continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, highlighted by blended same-store cash NOI growth of 4%. Our recent investment success and strong internal growth drove 21% FFO per share growth, and 18% FAD per share growth in the fourth quarter. Our relationship investment strategy continues to differentiate the company, having completed an additional $1.2 billion of high-quality investments in the fourth quarter and our recently announced expansion into Canada. ", "At this point, our largest operators are performing well, and as George mentioned, we remain confident that we can generate both internal growth from our existing portfolio and external growth from our relationship investment program. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong, and we had ample liquidity with $1.6 billion of line capacity in cash on hand entering 2012. ", "Turning to the details of the quarter. Regarding investment activity, we completed a significant $1.2 billion of growth investments during the fourth quarter, which, again, speaks to the consistency and sustainability of the HCN relationship-based approach to investing. The assets added during the fourth quarter were virtually all private-pay seniors housing and medical office buildings, nearly 75 of which are located in the top 31 MSAs, and are generally in the upper echelon  of our portfolio in terms of asset quality. We believe these are outstanding additions to the portfolio and plan on making them available for property tours throughout the year. We profile many of our newest investments on our website and encourage you all to take a look as well. ", "As detailed in the press release, we completed $178 million in seniors housing triple-net lease investments during the quarter. The most significant of these was the addition of 5 facilities to our existing Brandywine Senior Living partnership for $120 million at a 7% yield. These assets are a strong geographic fit with our existing portfolio and are all located in the New York and Philadelphia MSAs. ", "In addition, we completed $627 million of investments in senior housing operating assets at a blended yield of 6.2%, which reflects the higher quality and growth potential of these investments. The largest of these investments was the $415 million addition to our Merrill Gardens partnership. These properties are located in excellent West Coast markets, including the San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Jose and Seattle MSAs. And we also assumed  $224 million of debt associated with this portfolio at an attractive rate of 3.5%. ", "With the portfolio expected to stabilize over the next 3 years, we expect it to generate NOI growth of 5% or better for 2014 and then 4% to 5%, longer term. And we also added 2 outstanding facilities to our operating portfolio through our new $185 million partnership with Belmont Village Senior Living. These facilities are only 2 years old, are in exceptional condition and are located in the premier submarkets of Los Angeles and San Diego. Consistent with our overall operating portfolio, we're confident that these properties will also generate long-term NOI growth of 4% to 5%. ", "Also during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of 12 medical office buildings for a total of $263 million at a blended yield of 6.8%. The additions average nearly 78,000 square feet in size, are only 7 years old, they boast  94% occupancy and are 100% affiliated with major health systems. These are state-of-the-art outpatient facilities offering services such as outpatient surgery, radiology, oncology, hematology and neuroscience. As a result of these acquisitions, the overall percentage of our medical office portfolio of square footage affiliated with health systems has increased to 87% at year end. ", "And finally, yesterday, we did announce our entry into Canada, through a $925 million transaction with Chartwell Seniors Housing REIT. Our aggregate investment of approximately $503 million will be funded through a combination of $244 million in new and assumed debt at a blended rate of 4.7% and approximately $259 million in cash. I would note that we put a hedge in place to effectively fix the purchase price to the anticipated second quarter closing date by locking in the exchange rate on the cash portion of the transaction. ", "Now Chartwell is the largest seniors housing operator in Canada and will represent our 6th operating partner in the Health Care REIT portfolio. This portfolio consists of 42 facilities with approximately 8,200 units, with over half of the facilities located in the 5 largest Canadian markets and the majority of the remainder located in the top 35 Canadian census metropolitan areas. Importantly, the portfolio has the potential  for expanding occupancy beyond the current rate of 88% over time. The year 1 NOI yield on our investment is expected to be approximately 7.4% after management fees. ", "As a result, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to FFO and generate NOI growth of 4% to 5% over the longer term. We will not consolidate the 50-50 portion of this investment and we'll report the net income from these facilities on the income from unconsolidated entities line of our income statement. And again, as I mentioned, we do expect the transaction to close during the second quarter of 2012. ", "I'm turning now to portfolio performance. Before I begin, I would point out a few changes to our supplement this quarter. We included Property Level Coverage after Management Fees on Page 2 of the supplement, and we also added some more detailed disclosure regarding our operating portfolio on Page 7, which includes the Summary at the bottom of the page detailing operator concentration within the operating portfolio, as well as Health Care REIT's ownership percentage. ", "First, both our stable seniors housing and skilled nursing post-acute care portfolios continue to perform in line with  expectations. In regards to our seniors housing triple-net lease portfolio, payment  coverage stands at a solid 1.4x, while occupancy increased 50 basis points from the prior quarter to 88.2% on September 30, as reported in the supplement. Through the month of October and November, our stable seniors housing triple-net occupancy continued to strengthen and is tracking about 89% as of the end of November. This performance contributed to the strong 4.7% year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth within the seniors housing triple-net lease portfolio during the fourth quarter. ", "Now I would provide a brief update on -- about our skilled nursing portfolio including some comments regarding Genesis. We continue to believe that skilled nursing facilities are the most efficient, cost-effective settings for providing many healthcare services, and we intend to focus our portfolio on a select number of key relationships with the strongest operators. Our most recent cash flow coverage is listed in the supplement for the trailing 12 months ended September 30 with a strong 2.2x. Our overall skilled nursing occupancy increased 20 basis points from the prior quarter to the current 88%, while same-store cash NOI increased 1.5% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. I would note that same-store NOI would have increased by the more normal 2.5% to 3% this quarter but was going up against a tough comp of 4.9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2010, which included a significant catch-up  of CPI-based revenues that quarter. ", "Now I'd provide a brief perspective regarding how our operators are performing since the Medicare reimbursement changes went into effect on October 1 of 2011. Although significant, the Medicare daily rate impact through December and January was actually somewhat less than originally projected when considering the potential impact above the 11% Medicare rate reductions and the changes in reimbursement for therapy services. In terms of Genesis, we had a chance to catch up with George Hager and his team last week. They are performing slightly above  expectations, with their Medicare daily rate coming in slightly above projections through January of this year, combined with the successful execution of cost mitigation efforts.  Specifically to date, they've already put in place about $70 million of  $80 million of annualized cost savings contemplated for 2012. ", "Now looking ahead, Genesis remains focused on increasing occupancy and improving quality mix. They've actually developed a plan to expand the short-stay post-acute component of their portfolio to grow overall quality mix at a more accelerated rate than in recent years. As a result, we again remained confident in our view regarding Genesis's overall operating performance and their ability to pay our rent, as we expect the company's corporate level fixed charge coverage to be at approximately 1.4x in calendar 2012. ", "At this point, I'll provide an update on our seniors housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA's partnerships. The blended occupancy across our private operating portfolios at year end increased 70 basis points versus the prior quarter to 87.3%. In addition, same-store operating portfolio cash NOI for the quarter increased 7.7% versus the comparable quarter last year, driven by a combination of 30 basis point occupancy increase, a 5% revenue per occupied unit growth and a slight expansion in margins. Our operating portfolio continues to perform in line with  expectations, and we remain comfortable with our NOI growth expectation of 4% to 5% over the long term. ", "Now moving to the medical facilities portfolio. Our MOB portfolio performed well in the quarter, with same-store occupancy increasing 20 basis points sequentially to 93.6%, while same-store cash NOI grew 0.4% for the quarter and 1.9% for the year. For 2012, we expect our overall MOB portfolio occupancy to improve slightly to the 94% range, a tenant retention rate of approximately 80%. And note that only 6% of leases are expiring this year. ", "In regards to our hospital portfolio. Cashable payment coverage remained strong at 2.5x. We again experienced solid 3.5% same-store cash NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the fourth quarter versus last year. Our Life Science portfolio also performed well in the quarter generating strong same-store cash NOI growth of 7.8% and the portfolio remains full at 100% occupancy. ", "Turning now to financial results. We did report normalized fourth quarter FFO per share of $0.91, an increase of 21% versus last year's quarter and normalized FAD per share of $0.80 up 18% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our quarterly performance is driven by the internal growth generated by our existing portfolio combined with our success  investing profitably throughout the year. ", "We recently declared the 163rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31 of $0.74 per share, representing a 7% increase over the same period last year. ", "In terms of fourth quarter capital activity. We successfully raised $630 million of equity in November, which funded a portion of our fourth quarter acquisition activity. We also issued 665,000 shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating over $32 million in proceeds and issued 106,000 shares through our at-the-market program generating an additional $5 million in proceeds. ", "At the end of 2011, we had $1.4 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit, and had additional $163 million of cash and cash equivalents, providing $1.6 billion in liquidity as we enter 2012. At the end of December, our debt to undepreciated book capitalization stood at 46.1%, a decline of 50 basis points versus the prior quarter. Our secured debt to total assets was 14.2%. Our trailing 12-month interest and fixed charge coverage remains solid at 3.0x and 2.4x, respectively. Our net debt to EBITDA -- excuse me, net debt to adjusted EBITDA as reported in our supplement was 6.9x but I think more importantly, including the full annualized EBITDA from our fourth quarter investments and then backing out transaction cost impairments, loan loss and gains, it was about 6.2x. ", "Over the longer term, we continue to expect to drive debt to undepreciated book capitalization towards the 40% level and net debt to EBITDA at 6x or below. ", "Finally, I'll review just briefly our 2012 guidance and assumptions that are contained in our earnings release. As a reminder, our guidance for 2012 does not include the impact of any additional investments other than our existing development pipeline in the Chartwell investment. We expect to report 2012 FFO in a range of $3.68 to $3.78 per diluted share, representing strong 8% to 11% growth. Our 2012 FAD expectation is a range of $3.26 to $3.36 per diluted share, which also represents a strong 9% to 12% increase over normalized 2011 results. In terms of investments, our 2012 guidance includes our $503 million Canadian investment expected to close in the second quarter and $248 million of funded development throughout the year for projects currently under construction. We expect approximately $200 million of dispositions at an average 11% yield consisting primarily of skilled nursing assets that don't match  our focus on post-acute care. ", "Now finally, we're projecting development conversions for projects currently under construction of approximately $355 million at an average cash yield of 8.6%. As we have explained in the past, we believe our current portfolio mix is an excellent balance of higher growth opportunity through our operating portfolio supported by the more stable long-term rate increases expected out of our triple-net lease portfolio and medical office buildings. As a result, we're currently forecasting same-store cash NOI growth of approximately 3% in 2012. ", "And last, our G&A forecast is approximately $91 million this year, which includes approximately $5 million of accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation, which will hit the first quarter. These changes, in part, reflect our continuing addition and retention of outstanding professionals who have helped us successfully manage the significant growth within our portfolio.  ", "Operator, with that, that concludes my prepared remarks, and  we'd like to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'm here with Bryan here also. So maybe just as a starting point, I just wanted to ask more about Genesis, it sounds like things are going well there, you talked about the cost mitigation strategy, so it was, I guess,  almost a year ago when you guys announced the deal, so maybe just talk about how things have gone relative to the initial thoughts and just about future development opportunities in terms of funding more assets where you can partner?", "George L. Chapman", "Yes, Adam, we've had a great relationship with George and his team. It's a terrific, seasoned team that really is doing a great job in the face of these reimbursement cuts. If anything, we've accelerated some of the post-acute -- short-stay, post-acute facilities. We've been working with George and his team, we're having meetings with the assisted living operators, so there can be discharges, but -- through them and also going both ways, that is, and then also to various hospital systems. And to make sure that there are going to be excellent discharges, excellent relationships between the hospitals, the high-end hospitals and Genesis so that the post-acute facilities will really perform well. So I think all the other, except for an obvious reimbursement issue to deal with, it\u2019s been, if anything, even better than anticipated.  Is there anything else, Scott, that you want to add to that?", "Scott A. Estes", "No. I think that's a good overview. Yes, Adam, we really are impressed with their focus on managing the business and managing their team. As it relates to some of the cost mitigation efforts, they really have been very focused and I think that's why they're so successful in achieving a lot of the potential cost savings for the year. Maybe, just to provide a little bit more color on that, they really looked at internally weighted benefits, that these incentives was a significant component of it. Overhead expenses, they've looked at. One thing that's interesting, they looked at their center level, individual facility level, spending by facility and actually ranked all their buildings to really assess any outliers and require them to reduce costs a bit, which are already in place, which has helped and some of the professionals\u2019 and vendors\u2019 savings that you'd expect them to be able to get. And actually, the only thing that's still pending, I think, as we move throughout the year, is a bit of the, I would call, the therapist productivity. A lot of the efforts they have to more efficiently build by giving their therapists at the bedside iPads to do realtime billing and that's going well, but I think the cost savings of that will be realized throughout the year.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Guys, it's Bryan, just a quick one for me. I know in the past you've talked about $1.5 billion of acquisitions in your informal guidance. And it looks like you pretty much did that in the back half of '11. So you\u2019ve got some new relationships here, so I wanted to see if you could just give us an update on -- informally, what you can do with your existing relationships and what you're seeing in your pipeline?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, clearly, you're identifying a success story, Bryan. In the fourth quarter, when we already were adding on assets in the Merrill Gardens and the Brandywine and Silverado portfolios, it's showing that as we add each different operator, new operator, it's just adding to the opportunity to do a large cumulative amount of investments each year. But I think we're going to stick with him. They're going to have to do right now because we think that while there may be some ongoing consolidation in the next year, or maybe, in the next 2 years, that, that's more of a steady-state kind of number that we think is a fair one, once we reach that time when things are a little slower and there's been more consolidation and growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So quickly on the deals with Brandywine and then there\u2019s the operating acquisition. It seems counterintuitive to me that you would have a 7% return on the triple-net and a lower return on the operating. I figured, you'd be compensated with the risk that you're taking on. Can you comment on why those 2 numbers are kind of reversed?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure. It's Scott,  I'll try to take that. I think as it relates to the -- specifically, the 6.2% yield on the RIDEA deals. If you think about it, in  my opinion, it really comes down to the quality of those assets first of all, you're in outstanding locations in West Coast markets. And the biggest component of those investments this quarter is the Merrill Gardens, which is actually not yet stabilized, which as I noted, will have higher growth than 5%, we think through 2014. So when you\u2019re trying to take the aggregate picture in terms of growth, prospects and looking at these actual assets in the premier markets, generally, the West Coast plots better growth potential. I think you paint a pretty good risk-adjusted return picture.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes. But Brandywine or East Coast are -- should be good locations as well, no?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. I think you probably risk -- think about the 7% starting yield, but think about the increases too, 2.5% on a triple net versus the 4% to 5% longer-term growth potential, if not a little bit better near term. And I\u2019d also even point out too, we had some attractively priced debt  on the Merrill Gardens portfolio, the $224 million at only 3.5% should probably be considered as well.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then  going to the Canadian deal, you mentioned -- or it was mentioned, the 88%, and there\u2019s upside, that doesn't sound like a lot of upside to me. And maybe there's -- maybe there's  a little bit more to get. But where do you think the main occupancy opportunity is within that overall portfolio? Is there specific clusters of where you can see greater upside than other areas that you're buying there?", "George L. Chapman", "Rich, I'll just make a general comment, and then I'll have Scott Brinker add some color to it. But we have not only occupancy upside, but we have some staffing costs and other ways that we can improve everybody's return. We think that Chartwell is really a fine operator. They operate very much like we want our -- like our top operators do in the United States. We also -- I think we might have some ability to add ideas and to do the collaboration, look at everything that can be approved in this new portfolio. Scott Brinker?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Rich, this is Scott. There are, I\u2019d say, 3 or 4 fill-up buildings that are sort of less than 2 or 3 years old that still have census in the 70% to 80% range that we think over the next 3 years will improve to the 90-plus percent range. The other point that I would make is that in Canada a number of these markets had some overbuilding over the last 5 years that's starting to burn its way through. So industry wide, in Canada, the census is down 300 or 400 basis points from 3 or 4 years ago. And we're finally starting to see that sort of move back in the correct direction. So at least long-term, we think sort of  low 90s -- 91%, 92% is highly achievable, that's what Chartwell had done historically. And this portfolio, the 88%, we think there really is some 400 basis points of growth over the next 3 or 4 years.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But were -- are there any geographical areas, though, like specifically where it\u2019s lower than others like, say, Ontario or someplace specifically within the portfolio?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. It is market specific, but if I had to make a general comment, I would say Ontario suffered more than Qu\u00e9bec.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Why don't -- why didn't Chartwell want the 3 properties you're going to own yourself?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. It's a good question. This is Scott again. It really comes down to the importance of immediate accretion to them. These are 3 very high-quality purpose-built fairly new buildings that haven't yet filled. They have occupancy around 70%. So when you look at the purchase price versus the NOI that's there today, at least for Chartwell, the immediate accretion wasn't there, that they needed. We like the growth profile in those assets and we think that our purchase price over time is more than reasonable and we're happy to own them.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then the last question on management fees that you're paying them. Does it work out, if I'm doing my math right, assuming costs are sort of like a maybe 40% operating margin to get to a revenue number maybe in the $9 million annual range or management fees that you're paying to them, is that about right?", "Scott M. Brinker", "That's roughly correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "A lot to talk about today, I guess I'll focus on Canada. Can you talk a little about what really drove your decision to go into Canada and why you thought now is the right time to do it?", "George L. Chapman", "Let me start and then I'll turn it back to Stephanie Anderson and to Scott Brinker again. But frankly, Jeff, I wanted to emphasize that we think this is a natural extension of our relationship-driven strategy. These guys are terrific. Brent and his team operate facilities, provide the kind of care we like to see  provided. And it's a very comfortable relationship between the 2 companies. So we can add value to one another. So we view it, first of all, as  less of a huge international investment leap and more of an extension of our relationship strategy. Scott or Stephanie, you want to start?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Yes. We have spent some time over the last year or so looking at different marketplaces and  Canada we thought was unique in the sense that their growth of the elderly population as a percent even exceeds the U.S. There's also -- they've had less of a hit to their economy by the housing there. So even though there was some overbuilding, specifically in the seniors housing market, it did not impact their economy and so the stability of that economy was an advantage. We also are very lucky to have the top operator as our partner there. We think that the growth in -- to grow with them in that market will be extremely successful and so all of those things really are what drove us to Canada.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess one  kind of following up on that. So when you think about the differences of senior housing in Canada versus the U.S., what are the key differences or things that you\u2019ve got to focus on?", "Stephanie Anderson", "It's a very  similar marketplace  to the U.S. That was one of the things that also attracted us to that market. It's understandable, it's mainly -- it's lower acuity. These are really independent living facilities. The difference in Canada is that they have specialized health care once you reach a certain age and acuity level. So that causes there to be less acuity in this portfolio. There's also  been some changes on the regulatory side in Canada that happened this last year, where they're starting to have more licensing requirements, as well as they've moved the acuity levels up to be able to move into the socialized housing. So therefore, that creates additional private pay opportunities, which, over the next 5, 10 years, we think will be an advantage.", "George L. Chapman", "Scott Brinker, anything to add?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Jeff, I would just mention that it's all private pay and the buildings are comparable to what you would see in the U.S. If anything, they're a little bit bigger, but they have en suite bathrooms, all the amenities that you would want and expect in the high-end U.S. senior housing market. So we think that we'll do some site visits and people will be very excited about the quality of the real estate that they see in addition to the operating partner.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then -- I guess flipping this around and looking at it from Chartwell's perspective. It seems like a good acquisition. Why did they want -- or need you to come in and partner with them?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, this is Scott on it, Jeff. Better for them to answer that question, but our best guess is that it's a huge portfolio. This is a meaningful increase in the size of their company. They raised some capital last night to help them pay for it and I'm not sure that they could have raised as much as they needed to, to fund it 100%. We've been talking to Brent and his team over the last year about any number of opportunities and decided that we had a common approach to doing business and there were mutually beneficial opportunities on both sides of the border for us to work together.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Right.  Fair enough. One last quick question. In Chartwell's disclosure, they have this NOI guaranty reserve. Is that -- are you just ignoring that reserve or how are you accounting for that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. That's correct, Jeff. That is not included in the $925 million purchase price and similarly, we did not take any credit for that in the NOI or cap rate expectation that we've provided.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "A question on the Chartwell portfolio. It looks like it's majority IL. Is that the correct way to think about it or is it a more service-oriented product? And then also, is there -- do you guys have any identified plans to either adjust the unit mix there or make them more assisted-living type of units?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, this is Scott again. It is independent living, but all of these buildings have the ability to provide services. So there's no nursing care happening. This is all private pay but certainly activities of daily living is something that can be provided, but if you were to walk through the facilities, they\u2019re  very low acuity. Chartwell, over time, may decide that the best approach in this specific building is to add more health care services, they have that ability and capability. But today, it's a very low acuity portfolio.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then is there anything you guys can tell us about Chartwell's U.S. portfolio that they're working on divesting?", "Scott M. Brinker", "No.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. A quick one, just -- Scott, maybe you could just take us through kind of sources and uses on the balance sheet, just given where the line of credit balance is and obviously, you have some capital needs to close this Chartwell.  Are you guys thinking  unsecured debt? Maybe you could tell us where  you think a  current 10-year would price and thoughts on, maybe, equity as well?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure. I think we're actually -- we have a lot of flexibility entering 2012. We had, as I mentioned, only $610 million borrowed on the line, essentially at year end. And we actually had $163 million of cash with some dispositions that occurred right at the end of the fourth quarter helping the cash totals there. So the Chartwell transaction is not expected to close until the second quarter. And our cash requirement, really, for that is only about $250 million. So we're -- we actually have good flexibility from a capital perspective, but I do think we're -- as always, we're watching the debt market, the equity markets, pricing on it, 10-year for us today, I think is probably in about the 4.5% area; 7 years, probably, in about the 4% area. But again, I think with the -- most importantly, we have some good flexibility and have a lot of time to think about what we will need to do.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. And then just my last one. On the G&A, that looked like a higher number than I was expecting. Can you just talk about the acceleration of the amortization for the stock-based compensation. Is that  unique to this year? And then is the rest of the increase -- is that due to an increase in staff or is it just that people have been working hard and deserve more compensation for the service they provide in the company?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think, first -- just overall, James is referring to our G&A, which, in 2011 was about $77 million projected to increase  about 18% to $91 million in 2012. The overall G&A, James, first, if you\u2019re thinking about that, I actually think we're doing a good job trying to staff efficiently. We've really added some outstanding people and do need to retain them, but if you think about that, traditionally, the company is probably running about 50 to 60 basis points of G&A as a percentage of assets. And we just added $5.6 billion of net assets, but that G&A increase of  $14 million is actually only a 25 basis point increase in G&A. So I think we're still actually staffing, as reasonably as we can. And I can see that George is very focused on controlling costs and we're all thinking a lot about that. As it relates to the $5 million, that has been in the first quarter numbers, probably,  the last 4 or 5 years and basically, people, if they've had enough years of service with the company or are directors of the company, you expense the annual grants in the first quarter immediately.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derek Bower with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Ross Nussbaum, here with Derek. A couple of questions. The 7.7% same-store NOI growth for the senior housing operating portfolio, can you break out -- how much of the top line revenue growth was driven by increased occupancy versus a higher rate?", "Scott A. Estes", "Ross, this is Scott. The number there is about 30 basis points of occupancy improvement and I believe, it was up 4.6%, which I called 5% in my prepared remarks, so a little less than 5% revenue per occupied unit increase. And margins, as a result -- if you can see in the same-store calculation, I think are up about 70 basis points.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Where did that come in relative to your expectations when you bought these assets?", "Scott A. Estes", "In my view it\u2019s pretty good. We've always said 5% -- over 5% near term and I think the 3 or so quarters  we've generated same-store cash NOI returns on the operating portfolio and, you guys can all look and don\u2019t hold me to that either, I believe it was about 12% and about 2 quarters at 8% growth. So again, near term, I think we'd see some better growth. There\u2019s a few of the assets in the portfolio as we've acquired [indiscernible]  and we should continue to see some of those benefits over the near term. But again,  long term, we still like where these operators are and think they\u2019re  the type of operators that we're comfortable believing can generate long-term NOI growth of 4% to 5%.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And I was actually a little pleasantly surprised on that rate number because I thought that the upside near term was going to be occupancy driven  as some of the leased-up facilities were improving and that rate improvement is pretty meaningfully above what Nick has been reporting lately. What do you think is driving that in your facility?", "George L. Chapman", "I think, Ross, that it sort of confirms our premise that some of these high-end markets have a lot of pricing power, and are very strong facilities. So we're really pleased with that number as well.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Let me switch over to MOBs. On the $263 million of MOBs you purchased during the quarter, where are the in-place rents relative to market, in your view?", "George L. Chapman", "John Thomas?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes, the -- Mike Noto\u2019s  team were working hard market-by-market to get the best rates possible. Again, our increase in occupancy -- or our increase in the percentage we're building to affiliate with healthcare systems, again, we get stronger rates and stronger renewals because of that. So that's again, we continue to focus on that. That's where we're getting better rates to market, based on that concentration.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Have you -- just to be clear, if you look at the actual in place rental rate per square foot today, you think that's  at or below market?", "John T. Thomas", "At or above. I'm sorry, you said on the acquisitions?", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, on the acquisitions. Are you -- where are those rates relative to the current market rents?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes. I apologize. They're at or below -- we did find some very attractive high-quality assets in the fourth quarter with rates either at or below, that was very attractive. Increase was built into those leases.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And from a location perspective, it looks like, from your website, I was trying to dig this up, are most of these in Atlanta and Central Texas?", "John T. Thomas", "Atlanta and Central Texas. Dallas -- North Dallas in the Southlake area;  Houston -- excuse me, Atlanta and then  Central Texas.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Let me go back to the Chartwell transaction. How did you structure -- or have you structured it to avoid any taxes -- cross-border taxes on that investment?", "George L. Chapman", "Scott Brinker?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, I don't think it's necessary probably to go into the details, but one thing that we liked about the Canadian market, in addition to its proximity, is the fact that the tax burden is very low. So most of the taxation is actually upon the exit from the investment, which may or may not ever happen. So the taxes during the holding period are very low and therefore, attractive to us. So it won't meaningfully reduce our yields.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So as you bring those profits back on an annual basis into the U.S., you're not expecting any federal taxes?", "Scott M. Brinker", "There is a tax. It's just very low.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, understood. Last question for me. The dispositions that you have in guidance looks like the cap rate there is high. What kind of assets are you disposing of at 11% cap rates?", "George L. Chapman", "Ross, we've been really looking at Medicaid-oriented SNFs and a number of those have been in our portfolio for a long time and they have high yields. And that's just a choice we're making to gradually dispose of assets that perhaps won't be as closely aligned with our strategy in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nicholas Yulico with Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Going back to Chartwell. Can you just talk a little bit more about this idea that socialized medicine in Canada, most elderly  people actually are going into long-term care rather than assisted living since -- when you're looking at the portfolio, there are -- I mean based on the Chartwell press release, there are a number of facilities particularly in Qu\u00e9bec that do offer some level of assisted living on Alzheimer's?", "Stephanie Anderson", "Yes, right. There is -- in Canada, there is an acuity test for when you will go into a government-sponsored -- they call it a nursing -- they call it long-term-care homes. It is not the same as our nursing homes in the U.S -- if you went to visit one, they are much lower acuity. If you went back 10 years ago in the U.S. when the hospitals did not have DRGs and there were -- the elderly ended up staying longer time periods in the hospital. So that is more similar to where the Canadian health care market is today. So you have their government supported with long-term-care home, which is more like a -- it's more like assisted living in the U.S. today. But you do have that gap where you have someone that is not going to live at home, may need some supportive services that they do not qualify for the long-term care homes. And that is a gap that -- the gap in acuity is expanding and we do believe there's a lot of opportunity there to provide those services. And yes, definitely, with Alzheimer's and things like that, it's a lower acuity Alzheimer's than what you would see in the U.S. but...", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "That's helpful. And then along those lines, I mean, are all these facilities set up so that residents who do need to use, who get older and need more intensive healthcare services, that they can bring in an outside agency to do that at the facilities?", "Stephanie Anderson", "They don't really have the same -- definitely they have the ability to offer those additional services already. It would not necessarily have to be an outside agency. Chartwell as an operator -- is an operator in Canada and they operate along the continuum in Canada. So we can add nurses to the building if necessary. We can add caregivers.  It's just a little bit less regulated market plays  right there today. So there is a lot of flexibility in the way that we work with the portfolio to provide additional services.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just one thing on Chartwell. It looks like the average age of all the buildings is 13 years old and there's some -- obviously, some of the older ones in some of the cities in Qu\u00e9bec, but are you guys looking at any of these facilities as needing redevelopment to maybe enhance returns on the facilities?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, this is Scott. I mean, there are a few facilities that don't perfectly fit our profile and we\u2019ll evaluate whether  the right approach is to add services, renovate or sell, but that's a small number out of the 42. Most of these are very high quality in markets that perfectly fit our profile.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And just quickly, last thing, on Merrill Gardens. Are the new acquisitions -- do they have a similar unit mix as your old relationship, which I think was 66% IL?", "George L. Chapman", "Scott Brinker?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. They're similar. They're  a little bit more weighted towards independent living and they are a little bit bigger. One thing that Merrill does is try to fill the facility with independent residents that then might add services over time. So a newer building would tend to have a much lower acuity resident than one that\u2019s been in existence and managed by Merrill for a number of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the 3% NOI growth guidance for the same-store pool for 2012. How much of  your NOI is in the same-store pool in 2012 and what are the growth prospects for the non-same-store pool relative to that 3%?", "Scott A. Estes", "It\u2019s Scott Estes. I think it was about 60% this quarter, a little bit less. And the big reason was some of the significant level of acquisitions we completed during 2011. And when you really look at that, you will feel the Genesis is probably the most significant signature [ph] in there over time. So the bottom line is the expectation of 3% really comes from the triple-net seniors housing hospitals. And skilled nursing are basically 2.5% to 3% growth. You have some higher growth projected out of the  RIDEA portfolio, as well as the Life Science at 5%. And the medical office portfolio, we're roughly projecting flat to up a percent same-store NOI. We do have a small amount of leases expiring in the MOB portfolio. It's slightly lower yields that's impacting that number. But all in all, 3% is a reasonable expectation.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And it sounds like the non-same-store pool would be higher than 3%? Generally?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Same question, just relates to -- going back to the sources and uses question. What type of sources and uses are assumed in guidance? Do you assume that the $600 million out on the line in the Chartwell deal are financed just on the line or do you have any permanent financing assumed?", "Scott A. Estes", "No. We do not include any permanent financing in those numbers, nor did we include any investments, as I said, beyond what's in there. The biggest variability in the range that we provide is the dispositions. Basically, if you take $200 million at 11% at the beginning or the end of the year, it gets you -- you're about $0.10 flexibility in the guidance number.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And last question is -- just going back to the relative cap rate discussion. Can you just talk about what you attribute the differential and cap rates you paid between the 7.4% for Chartwell versus the 6.2% for the $627 million operating senior housing in 4Q given, I think you're expecting similar NOI growth in the 2 portfolios over the next few years?", "George L. Chapman", "Do you want to comment, Scott?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, this is Scott Brinker. The NOI growth on the U.S. assets is higher than in Canada. They're both well in excess of the triple-net lease escalators that we're accustomed to, but there is a meaningful difference over the next 3 years at least, especially in the Merrill Gardens portfolio, with respect to NOI growth.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Meaningful -- you're sort of talking about that 4% to 5% range that you quoted for both, so you think Chartwell is closer to 4% and the U.S. assets are closer to 5% or...", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, let me clarify. The 4% to 5% is upon stabilization and I would say that the growth profile in the 2 portfolios are similar once they're stabilized. Over the next 3 years the fill-up, and therefore, NOI growth in Merrill Gardens is much higher.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a follow-up question on Merrill Gardens. Could you just tell us where the occupancy is right now, so we can get a sense of just what kind of occupancy gains you could get over the next 3 years?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. This is Scott, again. There are 6 buildings of the 9 that are above 90%. There is one building in San Diego that just opened recently, so that is driving down the portfolio average. And then there are 2 in California that are below 90%, closer to 85%, that we would expect to stabilize in the low 90s over the next year or 2.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the one recently opened building is -- where\u2019s the occupancy there now?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, it opened in the fourth quarter, so [indiscernible] 0, it's close to it.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it, that's helpful. And then just in regards to the senior housing operating portfolio, I mean, you guys have been on a tear the past 18 months really building this platform out. Could you give a sense now with all these new deals, fourth quarter and as well as Chartwell, how large the senior housing operating portfolio is as a percentage of NOI and basically, how large can it get and if you start to run up against any REIT rules that may limit further growth in this platform?", "George L. Chapman", "Let me just try to look at this more generically. I mean, one, probably there are fewer pools out there of large senior housing and portfolios. But we seem to continue to find them and our operators tend to find them. I don't know any reason why we would be running into any kind of REIT rules in terms of growing our senior housing portfolio. Right now, we're $5.2 billion out of our $6 billion last year, Tayo, were senior housing assets and we're already starting out this year pretty well. But I look out  another year or 2, and maybe we get to  more of a steady state in terms of what we can do, but we continue to be a bit surprised at the opportunities. Chuck  Herman, do you want to -- Head of Senior Housing, do you want to comment at all, generally, about the markets?", "Charles J. Herman", "I mean, generally, the market -- we have -- as George stated, we're feeling pretty good about those prospects, especially with the quality of the operators that we've got in place. These guys tend to find a lot of off-market transactions, which gives us a more stable growth profile over time. We also are seeing a fair number of portfolios, as George stated as well, so we feel pretty strong about the market right now.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So on a pro forma basis, the operating portfolio, as a percentage of your total NOI is what now?", "Scott A. Estes", "Tayo, pro forma for the deals announced in the fourth quarter plus the Chartwell deal is about 17.5%. So the NOI, that's about what we've talked about -- we've talked in general and as we evaluate our longer-term strategy, I mean, 20% range is a nice balance we think of having operating asset exposure.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last question, just kind of given where cap rate  seems to be going directionally, is there any interest at this point of ramping up development again or is it still too early to get involved in that?", "George L. Chapman", "We've talked about being careful about development, but in the -- let me get into the acute care space too, it's -- clearly, there is more profound change occurring in the medical facilities, health system area and we have found some awfully good pre-leased top and large MOBs to do with great systems. And we will do a certain amount of that. We tend to limit those developments to around $300 million in a year when we go into our planning with John and his team. And then on senior housing, there has been surprisingly little development and we would do some development of high-end facilities with our existing operators, with whom we have master leases and a great deal of confidence. So there is some room for development, but again, we're looking at $200 million to $300 million on each category is sort of our cap.", "Scott M. Brinker", "And then if I could add, George, it may have been  a little bit lost in the shuffle, but we did  start $150 million of development projects this quarter, at a  blended yield projection of about 9%.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. That's particularly why I asked the question. I noticed that and I was wondering what was going on there.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. I think that's right. I mean, for us to add potentially starts of $300 million to $500 million a year would be just a nice supplement to an acquisition program that's been very active. And as George mentioned, the 2 MOBs we started this quarter, are 100% pre-leased and everyone else is an existing operator, generally, with the combination of seniors housing facility.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then Scott, when the deal -- the Chartwell deal is closed, just wondering, I know you guys are not going to be consolidating that but, will you be giving us operating statistics associated with it going forward?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. We're still evaluating that Tayo, as we think about it, obviously, everyone will want to understand the performance of that portfolio and we will give as much as we can. Yes, I still think we are just talking about it internally and haven't finalized it, but we'll make sure people can understand how they and the overall RIDEA  portfolio are performing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Molly McCartin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Actually, this is Molly McCartin for Mike. So I have a couple of questions. First, sorry if I missed this, but what drove the strong 4.7% senior triple-net NOI growth in 4Q, higher than the secured and active 3% outlook?", "Scott A. Estes", "We actually didn't mention that. You didn't miss it. We\u2019re again  benefiting in 2011 from the stronger-than-expected bumps we put there on our entrance fee portfolio this year. That's driving the a little bit more than you'd expect to more normal 2.5% to 3% growth there. But we increased rents and our entrance fee portfolio at a greater rate during 2011.", "Molly McCartin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, also, did you mention what the full year 2011 same-store NOI growth was?", "Scott A. Estes", "No, we didn't. We actually could do that, we -- you could just calculate it probably from the 4 quarters that we've reported, but we did not do that and I don't have that right in front of me. But I do recall that most of the quarters this year have been what guides between 3% and 4%, so my guess is it'd be somewhere in that range, if not even a little bit better. It\u2019s generally towards the 4% range.", "Molly McCartin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. And lastly, what's kind of happening with the average time to stabilize the development right now and what is the trend going forward?", "Charles J. Herman", "What we're following -- on the senior housing side, yes, it really depends on the size of the asset and the pre-leasing, generally, the ones -- the newer ones that we're doing tend to have pretty strong pre-leasing  in the seniors space. A lot of John's stuff in the medical office building, they are 100% pre-leased the day the  doors get opened. So I would say, it depends on size on the seniors side and the amount of pre-leasing, 12 to 18 months is pretty typical in our space.", "George L. Chapman", "But they're on target.", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes, they\u2019re on target. On the medical side, we don't start development projects unless they're 75% pre-leased and we're hitting close to full occupancy, if not 100%, before they're opened or complete leasing before they're opened.", "Molly McCartin - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And do you see kind of it going in the right direction? Is the time getting shorter or have they kind of  been flat?", "Charles J. Herman", "No, I think  people -- several of our operators have done extremely well. So it's case-by-case basis, but generally, we feel pretty strong about the market right now.", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think we see a little development check. These are filling very quickly. It\u2019s not like years ago -- 10 or 15 years ago, when a lot of development was going on and it was really a tough slog and they're doing all -- all doing very well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Uireil Gioti [ph] with Morgan Stanley.", "Unknown Analyst", "I was wondering, could you provide an estimate on the current margins on the master portfolio and where do you expect them to go?", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes, just to clarify the question, you asked the current margins and where you...", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. On your master portfolio, your Canadian acquisition.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. This is Scott. So the current margins are in the low to mid-30s and we would expect to stabilize the margin in mid- to high-30s.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. Got it. And does the future rights agreement that you signed with Chartwell, does that include their U.S. portfolio?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It does not. This is Scott, again. It is within defined  boundaries of the joint venture assets that we acquired in this portfolio.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay. And given that you guys went north of the border, would you consider going to other regions internationally, perhaps Europe?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, you should note that back in late 1990s, was it? We were over in England with -- the U.K. with Dan Beatty [ph], Bill Carlson [ph] and another -- and we had a local partner, Pat Carter [ph], who ran the fourth largest skilled nursing facility public company in that country. So if we have the right opportunities, we would look hard at it, but I will tell you that, one has to really look hard at the opportunity cost, the time commitment and we would only go in if we had really excellent opportunities with local partners like we did years ago in Great Britain, and as we are doing now with Brent and his team up in Canada.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got it. And going back to the Canadian -- I mean, Canada, as a acquisition region, would you be willing to go higher on the acuity spectrum?  You mentioned earlier that perhaps Chartwell will add perhaps a memory care unit on the independent living asset that you already own in the JV, but would you be interested in, like, focusing on post-acute, for example, or going to other asset classes, within Canada?", "George L. Chapman", "We're really focusing on driving our private-pay percentage up to 80%, in part, so we don't have to talk about reimbursement, I suppose. And so -- and we're not eager to do that right now in Canada, I think this is  a great first step to learn more, to be with the top senior housing operator in Canada. And then we'll have years to evaluate what, if any, additional moves we make in any country.", "Unknown Analyst", "Got it. And talking about the RIDEA portfolio, the same-store NOI, at 7.7%, it was 8.2% last quarter. At what point do you think that the current portfolio will go to a more stabilized 4% to 5% same-store NOI growth rate?", "Scott A. Estes", "This is Scott. I guess, I'd just be speculating. My guess would be that over the next year or 2. We\u2019re still getting some benefit and we would hope to have some stronger growth for a while, but again, that 4% to 5% long-term growth rate would be great for those assets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I had a question on the -- I guess, the senior housing portfolios, maybe...", "George L. Chapman", "Could you speak up, Dan?", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Sorry, I have a question on the senior housing portfolios, that you picked up in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Do you have a sense of what the stabilized initial yields are since a lot of that is already in lease up?", "George L. Chapman", "Would you ask that question again? You cut out a couple of times, Dan.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Sorry. Do you have a sense of what the initial yield is on stabilized assets for the acquisition, your housing acquisitions, that you've done in the fourth quarter in mistral [ph]?", "Scott A. Estes", "Senior housing triple-net acquisition yield, you're asking, Dan?", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm going to pick up my phone here, sorry. I was asking -- a lot of the assets in -- the operating assets that you're picking up in the fourth quarter and then mistral [ph] here in the first quarter are on lease up. Do you have a sense of what the initial yield would be on stabilized assets  in place today? If you were just isolating  the stabilized properties, what would be the initial yield on those assets, do you think?", "Scott A. Estes", "I guess that my rough answer would be they\u2019d be slightly higher than the yields we reported because of that, but it obviously depends on the asset quality and the size of the portfolio and its growth potential. But I would guess, something in the 6.5% to 7% range for high-quality stuff.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the other question I have is  the MOB\u2019s at 6.8%, it seems like -- I guess, it might be the asset quality itself that's driving that down, but are you seeing any cap rate compression in the MOBs and perhaps any -- is there any additional competition, given the low cost of capital for,  I guess, both MOBs and maybe, senior housing.", "George L. Chapman", "Let me start and, John, I\u2019ll throw it to you in just a minute, but there has been ongoing strong competition and probably a limited number of really high-end portfolios out there. So we think that cap rate --  this is a very appropriate cap rate for the quality of these 2 portfolios. John?", "John T. Thomas", "There's a lot of competition in the medical office space and a lot of kind of alternative capital and private equity chasing medical office space. So there has been cap rate compression, generally. We've been very disciplined on pricing, been particularly focused on the quality of assets as  presented on the website today. And the assets that we picked up, as I mentioned before, the very high occupancy, located on great hospital system campuses, great hospital tenants,  and as I said before, the in-place leases were kind of at the high end of increases and we're looking for -- to increase  the NOI growth of those potential. So very appropriate pricing for these assets and we look forward to touring you through them in Dallas or in Atlanta when you have the opportunity.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, absolutely. And I want to go back to George's comment from the beginning of the call about working with both the senior housing operators and the post-acute operators for changes in healthcare reform and change in the environment, and in particular, I was thinking about cannibal [ph] care organizations and the possibility of bundled payments and re-admission penalties to hospitals. So have you gotten together with your senior housing operators and your post-acute operators to actually come together with like -- maybe like a combined plan that you can go to the hospitals with and  say, \"Here's our re-admission rates, this is why you should give us the business going forward?\" Have you actually gone down that path at all?", "George L. Chapman", "Yes, we have. And we've done a lot of work just with our assisted living, senior housing and post-acute operators here in our headquarters talking about that very topic, as well as  best practices and other ways to develop win-win situations and maybe even  joint buying and other things like that. But an example in, actually out East, Dan,  is with a new hospital that we've done a lot of work  with, health system, great  health system, one of our assisted living operators is actually building right to the north of the hospital and one of our top post-acute operators is building right adjoining the hospital and there are ongoing discussions about how they can vet one another and to be prepared for ACOs, bundled payments, when they actually hit. Everybody\u2019s trying real hard to figure out how to do it and how to do it effectively and we've been right in the middle of it and we're hoping that our concentration -- areas of concentration will continue to provide an opportunity for John Thomas and Chuck Herman and our people on both sides of the house and myself to foster more collaboration because frankly, even without stiff penalties being in place right now, there are some benefits for trying to deliver health care much more effectively and cost efficiently. So we've been very active in that area. And we're starting to see a lot of really good collaboration developing.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "One more quick question. I assume you\u2019re splitting the CapEx on those Chartwell assets, equally with Chartwell and about -- what should I think about in terms of CapEx per unit for those facilities?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, this is Scott Brinker. The 39 buildings that are on 50-50, everything is 50-50. There are no promoted interests or anything so we split all the cash flows equally and all the capital expenditures equally. In terms of the CapEx that will be needed over time, it helps that the buildings have been well maintained by the current owners and are relatively new. Best guess is $1,000 a unit plus/minus. We\u2019ll  have to assess that over time, but we think based on the age of the assets, these are probably at the low end of the spectrum range for CapEx.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo  Securities.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just to stay on that theme, probably  a question for you, John Thomas. What's the CapEx you're looking for on the new medical office building portfolio?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes, a great question. We build it in to our underwriting and reserve, but again these are very new assets and  the age of our portfolio is younger, much younger than  our competitors and these are all fairly new assets. So kind of $0.50 a foot from time to time is an appropriate reserve.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Is that about where they were,  the last couple of years?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes, yes.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then any indication -- just what does the lease maturity schedule look like over the next 2 years, call it?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes, very, very low turnover. We've got about 6% of our portfolio rolling in '12, 5% to 6% next year and the next, we've really -- Mike Noto\u2019s done a great job of spreading out renewals and getting  longer-term leases in place for us. We have a very balanced portfolio and again, the downside of this and what we just acquired in the fourth quarter, those come in at about 94% occupancy. So very little roll in the next few years.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And probably a question for Scott Brinker. How much does occupancy factor into the price, this refers to the Chartwell deal. Would you go after a RIDEA deal if it, say, was  in the 91%, 92% occupancy and if you had a cyclical high, how do you kind of think about that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "We would. It's just a matter of how it's priced. Benchmark  portfolio that we bought a year ago was -- had occupancy in the low 90s. We've been able to increase that slightly and generate some very strong NOI growth. But the cap rate on that portfolio was a little bit lower than it would have been on a fill-up portfolio like you see with Merrill Gardens.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just sticking with Chartwell. Do you guys have a purchase option to revert the Chartwell portfolio into a wholly-owned net-lease portfolio at the end of some pre-determined period?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Not necessarily. There's a buy-sell after 10 years, but otherwise, there's no right to acquire their interest or for them to acquire our interest.", "Stephanie Anderson", "And this is Stephanie. We look at this as a long-term partnership. As George spoke to you earlier, on our relationship strategy, we would like to grow in Canada alongside with Chartwell. That would be our long-term plan.", "George L. Chapman", "And I think, Todd, the other point I would make is that while we're going to have sort of a cap, at least for a while on how many  RIDEA deals we do, to work on it, watch it and just make sure that they are working as well as we thought. And so far, they're great. The real strategy is to partner with the best operators. And many times, an operator has a strong preference for a RIDEA structure or a net-lease deal and we want to be with the best and the brightest and support them and grow with them. And as Scott says, of course, you have to worry about how you price it if perhaps there's  higher occupancy and things like that. But again, I want to get back to basics and that is we want to be supporting the best health systems, the best senior housing and care operators in the country and some of them are going to be done through RIDEA and some through triple-net. And we think we have assembled just an outstanding group of operators and  health systems.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just a last piece here, just going back to dispositions. I think, George, you indicated, certainly, your slant towards the skilled nursing category and Medicaid. Any specific state concentrations, any states that you would start to migrate more so away from?", "George L. Chapman", "Not at the moment. Not at the moment. I think it\u2019s more of a generic desire to have a higher private pay.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I don't have much left, just one. The comments on Genesis and some of the public companies, what they've been saying sort of suggests that the nursing home cuts haven't been as dire as we might have thought in the last couple of conference calls. Just how does that translate in any changes for your appetite for the asset class or the availability of investment opportunities?", "Scott A. Estes", "It\u2019s Scott Estes. I\u2019ll take a shot at that one. I think you're correct, we have seen a little bit less than what was projected in terms of the aggregate potential impact of the Medicare rate increases and the therapy  changes. Does it change what we're trying to do? Probably not because the bottom line is we're really focused on just a handful of key relationships in the skilled nursing post-acute area. Frankly, 5 to 7 operators in particular that we're likely to continue to grow with. And I guess, maybe, that could mean, with those operators, we may get more comfortable growing sooner than later, but I think most importantly, as George mentioned, we'll continue to probably creep up our aggregate private payments from the low 70s,  now toward 80% over time.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one follow-up to Dan's question about the Chartwell CapEx. Would that all -- is that going to all come through on the CapEx line or is some of it going to be operating income? I'm just trying to think about how we should  be modeling the FAD impact.", "Scott A. Estes", "That CapEx does not  come through, so that will come in  -- we'll have to give you that information in the supplement, Rob, but in a 50-50 building, the only -- everything will come in on the net income line in terms of the interest in unconsolidated entities line. For the 3 buildings only, it will be consolidated in our RIDEA portfolio and you would see those facilities, but we'll help you guys do that.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Right. So the 50-50, that will be a JV adjustment on the FAD?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Robert M. Mains - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And -- but the question, the thousand dollars number per unit, that Scott put out there, that would be a pure CapEx number? That's not 50-50 between operating expenses and CapEx?", "Scott A. Estes", "Right, yes. It's a 100%  CapEx number to be sure, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up. In regards to the dispositions, could you give us a sense of timing around that?", "Scott A. Estes", "Tayo, it's Scott Estes. I think probably, your best convention modeling is to assume middle of the year.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Middle of the year? All right.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. That's the best way to do it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Sorry to keep you on the line, but one more question. The guidance for 2012, does it include the step-up  already in the CCRC portfolio?", "Scott A. Estes", "It does include  our estimate for the entrance fee portfolio. I think it's net annually about  3% to 4% of the total. We did see an increase in both entrance fee and rental occupancy of 2% this quarter and based on where we're at, we were able to increase at least with our largest operator, the aggregate payments to us by  about 4 point -- a little over 4% in 2012. That's included in that number.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Chapman for closing remarks.", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks very much. I'd like to thank everybody for participating in the call.  A very productive call for us and we're very, very pleased with what we've managed to achieve in terms of our investments and forming the relationships with new operators and new health systems and developers. So with that, I'd just remind you that we'll be available for any follow-up questions later. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the conference.

Before we begin, let me remind that you -- you that this call is being recorded and the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.", "During the course of this call, the company will make various remarks concerning management\u2019s expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks Tim. Good morning, everybody. Our fourth quarter was a solid and with very positive year for Sunrise Senior Living. While we continue to restructure the many pieces of our company successfully, we have generated strong operating results reduced overhead and expenses, and build a very significant amount of net asset value.", "Also, knowing that all we do is built on our 30-year strong mission of championing the quality of life for all of our seniors. We have been strengthening our operations, our regulatory pro-activeness and our care teams.", "Let me start with our overall performance for the quarter. Overall trends at Sunrise communities continue to be positive, comparing fourth quarter 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2010 stabilized community occupancy is up 30 basis points to 88.2%, average revenue per occupied unit for stabilized communities increased 3% and NOI increased 0.5% for stabilized communities, and 3.2% for total communities.", "Fourth quarter 2010 net operating income included a one-time management fee expense credit relating to the Ventas portfolio of approximately $6.2 million. Excluding approximately $4.7 million, the portion of this one-time credit adjustment that relates to prior period, NOI increased 3.8% for stabilized communities and 6.5% for total communities. Greg Neeb will shortly provide details on the components of these results.", "We believe that the process of turning at risk contrast into valuable real assets but long-term revenue streams created an enormously more valuable Sunrise in 2011. We acquired a 100% of the 15 community AL US portfolio for $430 million. We capitalized 42 properties and three ventures representing over $900 million with CNL.", "Here we stabilized and enhanced our management contract and added attractive buyout rights, and secured extension rights on our most significant and profitable lease contracts. The portfolios we own in combination with our ownership in many of our joint ventures in this cap rate environment are accretive to NAV level we believe is not widely appreciated.", "As I said to you during 2011 as we effected these transactions, we believe that we cannot only solidify our long-term contracts, but knowhow to add demonstrable value by acquiring real-estate in a very best metropolitan areas with the assets themselves have great growth potential.", "We have also shown as evidence for example by our performance announced by Ventas of their 79 communities which we manage but don\u2019t own that we could perform as a manager regardless of our ownership position. We expect in 2012 to continue to maximize our value while providing strong operating results.", "We\u2019re very proud of our results and of our new reputation as a successful manager of a broad range of senior living communities. We are at the higher end of senior living and we have built our communities and our teams to provide great service and care, Sunrise devotion to our seniors.", "While providing care to seniors is not a precise science and has built in challenges. We have done many things to increase consistency and to minimize deficiencies. Under the direction of our operations and HR leadership, we have bolstered our training and evaluating tools, and have significantly changed, we believe strengthened. Our team of 40 women and men, who each lead the operations eight to 10 of our communities, this group is supported by strong care, sales, regulatory and IT teams to promote better and better outcomes.", "Again, all of this is aimed at making each Sunrise community a great place to live. Our team of over 300 executive directors in U.K. generation manager\u2019s lead-teams that provide an extraordinary experience and a great value when you consider the care and living experience we provide.", "We\u2019ve told you that we\u2019ve needed to do all this with lower head -- lower overhead matched to a smaller size. We have successfully reduced overhead in 2010 and 2011, and even with some planned additions to field base support we expect to operate the 2012 at decreasing recurring overhead levels.", "You\u2019ll now hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Marc Richards?", "Marc Richards", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I will focus my discussion this morning on Sunrise\u2019s consolidated operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011, as well as the impact our 2011 transactions have had on recently filed financial statements.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the fourth quarter was $43.5 million, as compared to a $25.1 million for the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to incremental EBITDAR from our AL US and CC3 acquisitions, and lower general and administrative expenses, net of non-cash stock compensation expense.", "Adjusted EBITDAR is net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense, and further excludes certain non-cash gains and losses, and certain items of income or expense in arriving at adjusted EBITDAR.", "During the fourth quarter, we reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.8 million or $0.03 per fully diluted share, as compared to net income of $50 million or $0.87 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010.", "The change between periods was primarily driven by a $10 million buyout fee paid to us by HCP and a $25 million gain resulting from the sale of venture interest in certain communities to Ventas in the fourth quarter of 2010.", "General and administrative expenses were $26.3 million for the quarter, compared to $33.7 million for the same period in 2010. Our Q4 2011 G&A includes $1.5 million of severance expense and $1.7 million of non-cash stock compensation expense. Our Q4 2010 G&A included $1.4 million of severance expense, $1.1 million of stock comp expense and a $3 million retention bonus.", "Management fees for the quarter were $24 million, for the same period last year, management fees were $26.4 million, which included $3.1 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been terminated.", "Before I move on to net operating income from our consolidated and lease communities, I\u2019d like to remind you that we began consolidating the operating results from the 15 AL US communities on June 2, 2011. Our fourth quarter consolidated results include $21.4 million of resident fee income and $13.1 million of community expense for consolidated communities associated with the AL US portfolio.", "Also, we consolidate six of the 29 communities within the new CNL venture as of January 2011. Accordingly, we have reflected $10.9 million in resident fee income, $5.9 million of community expense for consolidated communities and $4.3 million of community lease expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the fourth quarter of 2011.", "In our supplemental disclosure, we have reflected that NOI from these six consolidated CNL communities in the appropriate joint venture pool rather than in our consolidated leased NOI, as the mortgage debt and related all -- related assets are all held within the venture.", "And for comparability purposes, our supplemental disclosures reflect the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year operating results of the AL US communities in the aggregate for the periods prior to June 2, 2011, and our consolidated leased NOI rather than as a venture.", "Our fourth quarter 2011 consolidated and leased community net operating income, excluding the impact of the six CNL consolidated venture communities and the 15 AL US communities, decreased by $200,000 million quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectations, the October 2011 reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates contributed approximately $1 million to our lower consolidated quarter-over-quarter NOI.", "Net operating income is income from operations excluding depreciation, lease expense and impairment charges related to these communities.", "Turning to our year-over-year results, we reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $23.4 million or $0.41 per fully diluted share, as compared to net income of $99.1 million or $0.73 per fully diluted share.", "This significant year-over-year change was driven by $63.3 million in buyout fees earned in 2010 and $67.8 million of income associated with our discontinued operations in 2010, as compared to $3.7 million of buyout fees and $1.1 million of losses associated with our discontinued operation in 2011.", "Adjusted EBITDAR for the year was $147.1 million, as compared to a $117.8 million last year. The increase of $29.3 million is primarily due to the incremental EBITDAR from our AL US and CC3 acquisitions, lower G&A net of non-cash stock compensation expense. These positive results were partially offset by lower management fee income to the terminated management contracts.", "General and administrative expenses for year were $114.5 million, compared to a $126.6 million in 2010. Our 2011 G&A includes $2.8 million in professional fees associated with our venture transactions and $7.6 million of stock compensation expense.", "Further, G&A expense included $8.1 million in severance costs. We eliminated 69 G&A related positions in 2011. Our 2010 G&A included $4 million of stock compensation expense, $2.7 million of severance expense and $8.4 million of legal fees incurred associated with the HCP litigation that was resolved in the third quarter of 2010.", "Management fees for the year were $96.1 million, which includes $2.4 million of fee income from management contracts for the 15 AL US communities, which are now consolidated. For 2010, management fees were $107.8 million, which includes $20.4 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been terminated.", "Our 2011 consolidated operating results were also impacted by $130.6 million of NOI from our consolidated and leased communities, as compared to $91.8 million during 2010, an increase of $38.8 million. The 2011 consolidation of the AL US portfolio accounts for $18.8 million of this increase and the consolidation of the six New York CC3 communities accounts for an additional $17.9 million of the increase.", "Looking at the balance sheet, our unrestricted cash balance at December 31st was $49.5 billion. Our outstanding consolidated debt at the year end was $593.7 million, compared to a $163 million at the end of 2010.", "In December, we drew down $39 million on our line of credit to facilitate funding an $85 million cash collateralized letter of credit for Marriott. We issued $86.3 million of junior subordinated convertible notes in 2011 and this increase also reflects the now consolidated debt of the AL US portfolio in the amount of $322 million.", "The asset side of the balance sheet also reflects the consolidation of this portfolio, but of course funding increase of approximately $412 million, representing the estimated fair value of the acquired real estate assets.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Neeb to discuss our operating results. Note that our supplemental reporting package is fully transitioned to our stabilized and lease-up definition, and we have eliminated the comparable community statistics. Greg?", "Greg Neeb", "Thank you, Marc. Now let\u2019s review Sunrise\u2019s operating results. Marc reviewed our overall trends, so let me give some color behind those. I\u2019ll provide comments for our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures and our management agreements both stabilized and lease-up properties, which is a reflection of how we manage our business. I will also elaborate on a number of key transactions within each business line. This information is available on our supplemental 8-K filed this morning.", "Operating trends for the Sunrise leased communities trended lower for the quarter. NOI for the stabilized leased communities was down 5.2% quarter-over-quarter. Occupancy was lower or 88% for the fourth quarter of 2011 versus 89.3% for the fourth quarter 2010.", "These declines were driven by two factors, number one, lower independent living occupancy in a couple of buildings and number two, Medicare average rates being lower. Excluding the 10, lease communities that we\u2019ll terminate in 2013, NOI and occupancy in this portfolio were effectively flat.", "Our 24 consolidated communities consist of variety of asset types and other properties, we consolidate but don\u2019t own 100%. Included in our consolidated communities are the 15 mansion AL US portfolio we acquired in 2011 are three Quebec communities and Connecticut Avenue, stabilized consolidated communities reported significant increase in NOI of 13.6% for the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010.", "Operating trends for venture and managed communities were generally positive in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the U.S. occupancy was slight -- was down slightly 4.2% while rate was up approximately 4%. For net operating income, stabilized joint ventures were up 7.6%, while stabilized managed communities were down 4.2%, excluding the one-time management fee expense credit for the Ventas portfolio ranked in the fourth quarter of 2010 as part of our modified management agreement, managed community NOI growth for the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the fourth quarter of 2010 was up approximately 2.5%.", "Joint venture lease-up properties continued to improve as evidenced by NOI increasing 55%. We continue to work through our two primary workout situations, our condominium building in Bethesda and our $621 million defaulted loan in the U.K.", "Let me start with our condominium, in 2006 we sold the majority interest in two separate entities related to our condominium and assisted living project in Bethesda, and agreed to provide guarantees to support the operations and debt service for the entities for an extended period of time.", "We are obligated to a lender and our partner on the assisted living venture to fund operating shortfalls. We are also obligated to our partner on the condominium venture to fund operating shortfalls, including sales and marketing costs.", "The assisted living venture contains the amenity unit for the condominium owners to pay monthly fees for these services. We have funded $8 million under the guarantee through December 31, 2011 at which $1.2 million was funded in 2011.", "We believe the partners have no remaining equity in the condominium venture. Accordingly, we have informed our partner that we do not intend to fund the future operating shortfalls in the condominium venture.", "At December 2011, loans of approximately $116 million for the condominium venture and $30 million for the assisted living venture are both in default. We have accrued $3.3 million in default interest relating to these ventures. We are in discussions with the lenders regarding these defaults.", "The lender group to the condominium venture has begun marketing, the loan for sale and has initiated for closer proceeding against the assets for condominium venture.", "Let me jump to the United Kingdom. In U.K. one venture\u2019s mortgage loan is in default at December 31, 2011 due to a violation of certain loan covenant. The mortgage loan balance was $621 million as of December 31, 2011. The loan was collateralized by 15 communities owned by the venture. The lender has rights, which includes foreclosure of the community. The venture is in discussions with the lender regarding the possibility of entering into a loan modification.", "Lender is currently reviewing the Ventas business plans and has verbally expressed their desire to work with the venture and the manager to extend and modify the loan terms. The 4609 Overbook stand still agreement with a goal to refinance the -- to goal to negotiate a final loan modification.", "During the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 we recognized approximately $8 billion in management fees from the 15 communities in this venture. Our United Kingdom management segment reported $1.6 million in income from operations for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011. Our investment balance in this venture was zero at December 31, 2011.", "In 2011 we sold three wholly-owned operating communities and three land parcels which we -- which were part of the liquidating trust for approximately $12.8 million. The trust was formed in connection with the restructuring of our German indebtness. We have one closed community and nine land parcels remaining to sell in the liquidating trust, which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet under assets held under liquidating trust.", "To the extent we are able -- unable to sell all of these assets at their estimate value by October 2012, we may be required to fund the minimum payment under the guarantee which was $26.3 million as of December 31, 2011.", "As discussed on previous calls, three communities in Canada, which are wholly-owned have been fully leased-up. The outstanding loan balance related to these communities non-recourse to us, but we have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lender. We are not currently funding under these operating deficit guarantees. The loan matured in April 2011 and had a balance of $45.9 million as of December 31, 2011.", "In February 2012, we entered into a loan modification that among other things, number one, extended the loan on our three Canadian communities two years from the modification date, number two, provided for a termination of our operating deficit guarantee 42 months after the modification date and number three, cross collateralize the three communities, and number four, increase the interest rate by 25 bips. And lastly, obligated us to complete the ruminations conversion in a section of one of the communities.", "As discussed in our 10-K, in the first quarter of 2012 Sunrise purchased its partners 85% interest in a joint venture that don\u2019t have property in Santa Monica for $16.2 million and refinance the asset together with our Connecticut Avenue property a wholly-owned asset in Washington D.C. Sunrise obtained a $55 million non-recourse mortgage for the combined assets.", "Regarding our $50 million senior revolving line of credit with KeyBanc, we have no borrowing availability under the credit facility as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011 we have outstanding draws of $39 million and $10.2 million in letters of credits.", "In total, Sunrise ventures have total debt of $2.5 million with near-term scheduled debt maturity of $0.3 billion in 2012 and there is $0.9 billion of debt that\u2019s been as of December 31, 2011. The debt in the venture is non-recourse to us with respective principal guarantees and the interventure partners are working with the venture lenders to obtain covenant waivers and to extend the maturity dates.", "In all such instances, the construction loans are permits financing provided by financial institutions to secure by a mortgage or data trust on the finance community.

Any such payments could include amounts arising in part from the venture\u2019s obligations for payment of monthly principal and interest on the venture debt.", "These operating deficit agreements would not obligate us to repay the principal balance of such venture debt that might become due as a result of acceleration of such indebtedness or maturity. We have non-controlling interest in these ventures.", "Back to you, Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Marc. We\u2019ll now take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Daniel Bernstein with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good morning. How are you?", "Mark Ordan", "Good morning.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess, we\u2019ll start on the, that the core fundamentals of the company, the occupancy and rate seem to be moving in the right direction. So maybe if you could talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing from incoming residents, their attitudes towards moving in and in terms of your leads and it just seems to be filling in the right direction, want to hear a little bit more about that?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, I would say that the numbers kind to speak for themselves, we\u2019re seeing good flow of new leads, I think we\u2019re doing a very good job of watching our pricing and making sure that we\u2019re meeting the markets. I think that\u2019s been a big advance for the company, I sense no better than anybody else\u2019s is that is, there is some more optimism in the economy so people feel little bit better.", "I think that what we\u2019ve been stressing Dan as you know is that Senior Living and we think Sunrise particularly is a very good value of that moving into a Sunrise or forth somebody a level of care and daily life, that they just can\u2019t get any place also anywhere near the prices we charge. So I think our pitch to people is really about the value and the care that we provide.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And obviously the first quarter is always seasonally weak but are you still seeing some of the same kind of trends that we used in terms of again at least leads, how you are feeling about the first quarter so far?", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah. Our trends are not the similar from the past.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And I wonder if you could also talk about a little bit about in terms of your capital needs, obviously you have lot of cash that\u2019s unrestricted. But you also have tied up the credit facility with the Marriott guarantee and as well as you mentioned that you may have to fund some of that liquidating trust notes in Germany. So are you looking to refinance the credit facility at this point or raise some other type of capital? How you feel about the capital situation?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, I would be -- we are comfortable with our capital situation. We the -- what we did with Marriott enables us to -- there are many variables around that. So I think we can manage the business properly. That was the reason to do that deal and we look forward to seeing how we can navigate that going forward. But I\u2019m comfortable with our cash position. I\u2019m comfortable looking out through 2012 at our source of usage.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And you\u2019re looking to refinance the credit facility at all given you kind of reach the limit of what you can draw on that or?", "Mark Ordan", "Dan, at this time, that\u2019s not something that we are thinking about.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And do you have any expect -- what are your expectations for G&A for 2012, obviously you\u2019ve -- you\u2019re bringing that down consistently over the last couple of years? What are your thoughts and how G&A will look?", "Mark Ordan", "Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t -- I\u2019m not going to throw out a specific number\u2026", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay.", "Mark Ordan", "\u2026 but I\u2019d say that we continue to look at ways to reduce our overall spending. We have significantly reduced our run rate, so we\u2019d continue to try to find ways to be more and more efficient.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And the last question I have is, any thoughts on comments that you can make about [the appeal] that was disclosed in the 10-K about the Pennsylvania property, I\u2019m not sure something that\u2026", "Mark Ordan", "Nor really\u2026", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Normally, but? Okay.", "Mark Ordan", "I can\u2019t add really more to it. I think we spoke to the nature of it in our filing and obviously, we\u2019re cooperating with the property adjustments, but now nothing better than that?", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. All right. I\u2019ll jump off and see if there is anybody else has questions.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Mark Ordan", "Well, Operator, it seems that there are no further questions. So, with that, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their continued support and interest in Sunrise, and we will be updating you soon on further progress.

My name is Brooke, and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President of Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website as well.", "Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. ", "I will now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT, for his opening remarks. George?", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks very much, Jeff. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for our company and its shareholders. We had a record 24% and 26% normalized FFO and FAD per share growth, quarter over previous year quarter. Our relationship investment strategy is hitting on all cylinders, driving $750 million of investments for the first quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date. Most importantly, this strategy has produced a consistent and predictable pipeline and enhanced the quality of our already strong portfolio. And of the $750 million of new Q1 investments, nearly 90% of them were with existing partners. ", "We have attracted the industry's finest operators and health systems largely as a result of our reputation as a value-add partner. This reputation has been earned over many years of being a key part of numerous providers' successes, yet we understand the need to earn that confidence every day. We're also quite pleased to welcome Senior Lifestyle as the 10th largest senior housing operator in the United States to our portfolio, and we're excited to have Bill Kaplan, John DeLuca and team added to our portfolio of best-in-class operators. ", "And on May 1 of this quarter, we closed a previously announced $937 million Chartwell transaction. As most of you know, Chartwell is Canada's largest senior housing operator with high-quality assets in metro areas. The investment will be immediately accretive in markets with excellent demographic trends. And we look forward to a successful partnership and future growth in Canada.", "Our portfolio continues to perform well with blended same-store cash NOI growth of 4.2%. Our RIDEA partners had same-store NOI growth of 10.3%. We believe that there are ample opportunities for continuing improvement in seniors housing as the economy and the housing markets improve. We also continue to be impressed with how well our skilled nursing operators are coping with the previously announced Medicare cuts. The general ability of operators to execute on mitigation efforts has been quite impressive. We continue to believe that post-acute providers, particularly, will be a key part of the evolving healthcare delivery system. ", "Genesis has a strong team and a scalable infrastructure that will allow the company to grow and produce strong results, and we are working closely with George Hager and team to help grow the short-stay post-acute component of their portfolio, resulting in accelerated quality mix improvement. ", "In the MOB space, we have a sector-leading occupancy of 93% and excellent retention rates. With nearly 90% of our facilities affiliated with strong health systems, our MOB portfolio is well-positioned for strong performance. ", "In addition to adding high-quality investments, we continue to enhance portfolio quality through the disposition of non-core assets. We are increasing our anticipated dispositions by $100 million to $300 million and expect most of the dispositions to be older, primarily Medicaid-funded skilled nursing homes and older, smaller, unaffiliated MOBs. We believe our active approach to portfolio management has helped us to maintain a sector-leading portfolio in terms of quality and diversification. Our portfolio is positioned in high-end, high barrier-to-entry markets. 40% of the portfolio is located in the northeast and mid-Atlantic areas. 70% -- 76% of the entire portfolio and 90% of our RIDEA investments were located in East and West Coast markets or the top 31 MSAs. ", "Facilities in these markets have generally outperformed. But in addition, these concentrations have provided and will continue to provide opportunities to foster collaboration among portfolio partners across the healthcare spectrum. As the healthcare markets have changed dramatically during the last several years, Health Care REIT has benefited from extraordinary growth as our commitment to relationships, improvement of healthcare delivery and collaboration has appealed to operators and health systems. We expect the evolution of healthcare will continue given the need for professional management, technology and economies of scale. We believe this will drive continuing change and consolidation, resulting in larger, professionally-managed branded operators and health systems that should further strengthen our portfolio valuation. ", "We're very pleased with the ongoing volume of new investment opportunities, yet there are fewer larger portfolios still available. And at some point, the pure transactional volume will decrease. And at that point, our relationship strategy will constitute an even more important competitive advantage by providing consistent and predictable access to ongoing investment opportunities from our portfolio companies. ", "Scott Estes will primarily focus on capital markets activities and financial and balance sheet metrics, but let me simply make 2 points: One, we achieved our record FFO and FAD growth while maintaining conservative leverage with current liquidity of $2.2 billion; and two, through our capital markets activities, we extended our average debt maturity to 9.5 years, the longest average maturity among the big -- so-called Big 3, and this 9.5 average debt maturity closely mirrors our portfolio lease duration of approximately 10.4 years. ", "Before I turning to Scott for his comments, I'd like to take a moment and welcome Judy Pelham to our board. Judy has been actively involved in the healthcare industry for over 30 years, including leadership roles with leading hospital systems and healthcare institutions. Most recently, she served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Trinity Health, one of the top 10 healthcare systems in the United States. Ms. Pelham currently serves on the Boards of Directors of Amgen and Smith College, and we all believe that Judy will be a great addition to our board. ", "And with that, I'll ask Scott Estes, our CFO, to address financial and capital markets matters. Scott?", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. As George discussed, our relationship investment program continued to generate a steady pipeline of opportunities, and our portfolio continued to perform well, highlighted by 4.2% blended same-store cash NOI growth, including over 10% growth in our seniors housing operating portfolio. We put ourselves in a great liquidity position, having raised over $2 billion of capital through early April, which lowered leverage and was used to pay down our primary credit line, retired $275 million of higher yielding preferred stock, redeemed $126 million of convertible debt, pay off $185 million of secured debt and financed our investments. Despite the number of moving parts as a result of our first quarter capital transactions, we were able to generate normalized FFO and FAD per share growth of 24% and 26%, respectively, our best in recent memory. ", "Turning to the details of the quarter. Regarding investment activity, we completed $753 million of growth investments during the first quarter, $654 million of which were acquisitions with the majority of the remainder in development funding. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with Belmont Village, acquiring 6 seniors housing operating assets for $210 million. In addition, we acquired 13 medical facilities, which included 12 medical office buildings for $332 million that are on average 94% occupied, 83,000 square feet per building and all affiliated with leading health systems in their respective markets. ", "Finally, as George mentioned, we added another high-quality operator to our portfolio with the addition of Senior Lifestyle Corporation, acquiring 3 triple-net lease seniors housing properties for $96 million. ", "In terms of first quarter pricing, our triple-net seniors housing investments were generally priced at initial yields in the low- to mid-7% range. Our recent RIDEA transactions were priced in the upper 6% range, and medical office buildings were priced in the mid-6% range, reflecting these very high-quality additions to the portfolio. ", "Our first quarter dispositions consisted of 4 smaller non-strategic medical office buildings with a net book value of $32 million, generating a small $769,000 gain on sale. As always, additional detail regarding the timing and pricing of first quarter acquisitions and dispositions can be found in our supplement. We're off to a great start to the second quarter, having completed our $510 million investment in the Chartwell transaction last week. And our pipeline throughout the remainder of 2012 looks strong and remains heavily concentrated in private-pay seniors housing and medical office building opportunities. ", "Turning now to portfolio performance. Before I begin here, I would point out several additions to our supplement this quarter. We consolidated our old construction book into a development project summary on Page 12, which includes more detailed disclosures, such as pre-leasing and health system affiliations. And on Page 14, we added new information detailing the success and history of our relationship investment program. ", "Both our stable seniors housing and skilled nursing post-acute care portfolios performed in line with expectations in light of recent additions to these portfolios and changes in Medicare reimbursement in the skilled nursing sector. Our seniors housing triple-net lease payment coverage stands at a solid 1.35x before management fees and 1.16x after management fees, while occupancy increased 90 basis points from the prior quarter to 89.1% as of December 31. ", "The stability of our seniors housing triple-net portfolio was once again demonstrated through a first quarter increase in same-store cash NOI of 3.4%. Our skilled nursing portfolio payment coverage currently stands at 2.04x before management fees and 1.57x after management fees for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2011. Our overall skilled nursing occupancy remains flat at the current 88% level, while same-store cash NOI increased 2.7% in the first quarter versus the prior year. ", "Our coverage declined somewhat sequentially, primarily due to the lower Medicare rates implemented in October. Importantly, however, much of the successful cost mitigation efforts were not in place at Genesis or many of our other skilled nursing operators in the fourth quarter. I think what I can provide is what I consider to be the most important perspective in terms of what our current 2012 run rate coverage numbers, which would be inclusive of the full effects of the Medicare reimbursement changes, as well as the mitigation efforts which are in place as of today. Based on that criteria, we believe our current skilled nursing portfolio calendar 2012 run rate coverage levels are about 1.7x to 1.8x before management fees and 1.3x to 1.4x after management fees. Our Genesis makes up the largest portion of these numbers and after speaking with George Hager and Tom DiVittorio last week, I can report that Genesis operating performance year-to-date is slightly above budget and that cost mitigation efforts continue to go well. As a result, our overall expectation regarding Genesis corporate level fixed charge coverage remains unchanged at close to 1.4x per calendar 2012. ", "At this point, I'll provide an update on our seniors housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA partnerships. Our operating portfolio continues to perform well and is ahead of budget through the first quarter of the year. The blended 87.3% occupancy rate across our 5 operating portfolios for the first quarter was flat versus the prior quarter and up 3.1% versus last year. In addition, same-store operating portfolio cash NOI for the first quarter increased a strong 10.3% versus the comparable quarter last year, driven by an 80 basis point increase in occupancy and a 5.1% increase in revenue per occupied unit. Through a combination of strong revenue per occupied unit growth and solid expense controls, margins in our same-store portfolio expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. ", "Moving now to the medical facilities portfolio. The medical office building portfolio metrics were stable as expected during the quarter, with overall occupancy up 20 basis points year-over-year to 93.1%, while trailing 12-months retention was 82.5% including 88% for the first quarter. Same-store occupancy of 92.9% remains among the highest in the sector, while same-store cash NOI grew 0.2% for the quarter. ", "For 2012, we continue to expect overall MOB portfolio occupancy to improve slightly to the 94% range and expect the tenant retention rate of approximately 80%. In regards to our hospital portfolio, our cash flow payment coverage remains strong at 2.45x before and 2.1x after management fees. We again experienced solid 2.8% same-store cash NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the first quarter versus last year. We believe the recently announced proposed rules regarding fiscal '13 Medicare rate increases for both the inpatient hospital and LTAC sectors were generally positive news, though I would note that we have only 3% of our portfolio investment balance in inpatient hospitals, 2% in LTACs with the remaining 1% in inpatient rehab facilities. ", "Our life science portfolio was fairly steady in the quarter. The portfolio does remain 100% occupied, generating same-store cash NOI growth of 1.9%. More importantly, we expect another significant acceleration in our life science NOI growth back to the 5% level during the second half of 2012, as we've recently renewed approximately 20% of the overall portfolio at renewal rates that averaged 60% above current rates, commencing in mid-2012. ", "Turning next to financial results and guidance. We reported normalized first quarter FFO per share of $0.87, an increase of 24% versus last year's quarter, and normalized FAD per share of $0.78, an increase of 26% versus the comparable quarter last year. Quarterly performance was driven by the strong internal growth generated by our existing portfolio combined with a nearly 70% increase in gross real estate assets invested accretively over the past 15 months. We recently declared the 164th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended March 31 of $0.74 per share, representing a 3.5% increase over the same period last year. ", "I would also note that our preferred dividend of $19.2 million paid in the first quarter were about $2 million higher than the previous quarter or about $0.01 per share. This was a result of having about a month of overlap when we had both our new $287.5 million, 6.5% preferred Series J, as well as the old $100 million 7.875% Series D and $175 million 7.625% Series F securities outstanding. The $275 million aggregate value of the Series D and F were redeemed at par at the beginning of the second quarter. So as a result, our preferred dividend payment should decline to about $16.6 million per quarter. ", "Our first quarter G&A expense totaled $27.8 million, which as previously disclosed, included approximately $5 million of accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation, which typically occurs in the first quarter. First quarter G&A also included $4.3 million of special stock-based payments for executives boarded for retention, performance and excess shareholder value creation over both the short and longer term. Excluding these factors, we currently forecast a G&A run rate of approximately $21 million to $22 million next quarter and note that our overall G&A is running under budget year-to-date. ", "In terms of capital activity, we were very busy raising over $2 billion in aggregate thus far in 2012. We raised $1.1 billion of equity in February at $53.50 per share, representing the highest offering price in our history. We issued $287.5 million of preferred stock late in February at a record low of 6.5% coupon, which was used to refinance the $275 million of outstanding preferreds with coupons over 100 basis points above the new issue. We also issued 429,000 shares under our dividend reinvestment program, which generated $23 million in proceeds. And finally, we issued $600 million of 7-year notes in late March priced to yield 4.2%, which settled in early April. As a result, at the end of the first quarter, our entire $2 billion line of credit was available, and we had $469 million of cash on the balance sheet. ", "I would point out that following the end of the quarter, our March 31 balance sheet was impacted by the following items. I'll go through the list here. First, we issued the $600 million of senior notes; secondly, repaid $275 million of preferred stock. We've redeemed $126 million of 4.75% convertible debt. We repaid $185 million of secured debt at an average rate of approximately 4.25%. And finally, we funded the approximate $263 million cash component of the Chartwell transaction on May 1. So after all the dust settles on these transactions, we will be left with our full $2 billion line of credit available plus an approximate $200 million in cash. ", "Our capital transactions significantly strengthened our balance sheet. At the end of March, our debt to undepreciated book capitalization stood at 41.2%, representing a 5% decline from the prior quarter. Our trailing 12-month interest and fixed charge coverage remained solid at 3.2x and 2.4x, respectively. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA as reported in our supplement has improved to 5.5x. Importantly, these metrics will not be significantly impacted by capital activity subsequent to quarter end, as we use much of the senior note proceeds to pay down debt as recently mentioned. ", "Finally, I'll provide an update regarding our 2012 guidance and assumptions. As a reminder, our investment guidance for 2012 only includes the impact of investments completed during the first quarter; our Canadian transaction with Chartwell, including debt assumed as a part of that transaction; and third, the ongoing funding of our existing development pipeline. ", "Our earnings guidance does include all the capital activity announced year-to-date, including the April senior note issue and the pay-off I just discussed, which occurred subsequent to quarter end. And the final change included in our guidance is the $100 million increase in our planned dispositions from $200 million to $300 million. And we've identified certain non-strategic Medicaid-focused skilled nursing facilities for sale. We remain proactive in managing our high-quality portfolio, as we accelerate the push to move our portfolio to over 80% private pay. ", "As a result of the $100 million increase in our disposition forecast, we've lowered our guidance by $0.03 per share, resulting in a new 2012 normalized FFO range of $3.50 to $3.60 per diluted share and a new normalized FAD range of $3.08 to $3.18 per diluted share. Importantly, with $2.2 billion of current cash and line of credit availability to the extent our relationship investment program continues to prove successful throughout the remainder of the year, we do have the potential to move toward the higher end of these ranges or beyond. ", "Operator, that does conclude my prepared remarks, and we would like to open the call for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I have a question on the greater disposition guidance and do you already have a large portion under contract, or are you seeing increased demands or more favorable pricing for the SNFs and MOB assets?", "George L. Chapman", "I think the fair answer to that would be that we have more interest and ability on the parts of the operators to buy back, refinance, recap some assets and we have an interest in reducing our commitment to Medicaid-oriented SNFs and certainly, an overall desire to move toward private pay at 80% to 85%. So it's just really that their abilities and ours -- seem to be coming together with ours. So we see more opportunity to do it. But until it's over, it's not over. So we'll wait and see to some extent, but we have some term sheets in certain cases and some desire on others and we'll keep reporting back to you.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I believe there's also a hospital up for sale, maybe if you could speak to that.", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure. Jana, it's Scott. There was just a small hospital facility in the held-for-sale bucket that also met similar criteria. You guys have the amount on that? We can mail you the amount. I don't have it right in front of me.", "George L. Chapman", "Probably it's just $1 million. So it's a small...", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, it was very, very small and it was a sold subsequent to quarter end.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just quickly on the financing for potential future acquisitions, you brought down leverage quite a bit. I was wondering if we should still kind of think about them being funded as 40% debt, 60% equity going forward.", "George L. Chapman", "We think so. We think we've done a few things that are going to be very important to strengthen the company going forward. One is keeping the leverage at around 40% and two, moving toward a higher percentage of private pay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Adam Feinstein with Barclays.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is Bryan Sekino on behalf of Adam. Just a question on the disposition's increase, would you classify that more motivated by potential acquisitions that you're seeing and needing just a little bit more firepower? Or is it kind of a change in your view of that -- those assets, given some of the reimbursement changes over the last few months?", "George L. Chapman", "I think the latter, Bryan. We have $2.2 billion worth of firepower and right now, the incredible ability to raise capital. So we don't need it for that, but we are still very much dedicated to the post-acute platform and to certain operators within the SNF portfolio. But strictly within the Medicaid-oriented SNFs, we think we can drive a higher company value by having more dedicated to the key components of the future healthcare delivery systems such as post-acute but, in particular, driving more value through private pay, whether it be MOBs or perhaps more importantly, through our private senior housing.", "Bryan Sekino - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just an update on the deal environment, it looks like you've got an improved balance sheet. There's certainly some unknowns in reimbursement but I guess, it appears CMS is not likely to issue proposed rules or make significant changes for SNFs and other post-acute providers. So is that helping the deal environment and despite the uncertainty in the election? And maybe talk about your appetite to capitalize on that.", "George L. Chapman", "Well, we're not going to be out there buying a whole lot of skilled nursing. We're going to help George Hager and his team grow his post-acute platform. We think that's just critical. And for us, we've had an ongoing access to good deals because of our relationship investing platform. I think we've told The Street in the last 10 quarters, we have averaged new investments of $1 billion, okay? And 40% of those have come from our ongoing partners. So we're just seeing it because of our relationships. The senior housing is -- people are still coming to us. People are adding on to their existing portfolio, and we feel like we have an ongoing predictable deal flow.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask about the same-store growth this quarter. It's running ahead at 4.2%. I guess, it's running ahead of your 3% guidance you'd indicated for the year. Did you change that in the updated guidance at all? Or -- and do you expect it to come back down to the 3% level? Or what are your expectations for the rest of the year?", "Scott A. Estes", "Karin, it's Scott. We didn't, I guess, provide an official update to that. I would say through the first quarter, clearly, the most significant outlier in the positive sense would be the operating portfolio. I think it's really based on timing. I still believe our projection for the full year for most all the components of the portfolio remain unchanged. So you may see a bit of a trend, where you may average more towards the 3% level. I think as we've said, medical office building forecast was 0% to 1%. Most of the triple-net portfolios were roughly 2.5% to 3%. And then I still think that, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, life science should get back to the 5% area in the third and fourth quarters. And I think the RIDEA portfolio projection, it's a little bit above budget but we're still forecasting somewhere on average for the full year, I would call it 5% and maybe a little bit above 5% -- 5% to 6%.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "It's helpful. And just one other question on Genesis, I think you were due for a rent bump on April 1, can you just talk about -- did that happen and how much was it?", "Scott A. Estes", "We did. The CPI was in excess of the 1.75% threshold to give us the full 3.5% rent bump in April.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And that's incorporated in that 2012 pro forma coverage number that you gave earlier.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. It has been and it always has been in the numbers we've given around Genesis on the aggregate portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions. First of all on -- can you -- Scott, can you give us a quick update on maintenance CapEx, especially -- well obviously, with regard to the RIDEA portfolio? How we should be thinking about that going forward, given the growth of the portfolio?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure, Philip. I guess our general forecast -- the 2 largest components of CapEx, are both in the medical office building portfolio as well as the RIDEA portfolio. As a quick aside, we would expect the medical office building CapEx to be a little higher than it was in the first quarter due to just some timing of some renewals and other projected capital expenditures. And the RIDEA portfolio continues to run -- forecast around, I would say, about $1,700 per unit per year is probably the number to think about. It tends to translate into something, hover about 75 basis points of -- per year. It's about the number we've used in terms of RIDEA CapEx.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then just kind of a broader, kind of industry question, George, you spoke a bit about this and obviously, working with Genesis, et cetera but give us your thoughts on post-acute 5 years into the future. As part of the integrated health care delivery system, are you going to be seeing a bit more demand? Or could you see this portfolio growing into the ancillary healthcare business? I know you're going more toward private pay, certainly, but the front end of the healthcare system and even the post-acute ancillary outpatient services are something that the REITs aren't as heavily involved in yet. And I say yet with a big question mark, but I would just be interested in your thoughts.", "George L. Chapman", "Yes. We really believe that post-acute is going to be a critical part of the healthcare delivery system, and post-acute can be defined in a lot of ways. You can have IRFs or you can have LTACs or just post-acute like George runs. And if anything George Hager and others, who are oriented toward post-acute in the SNF -- general SNF category are moving toward more specialty units within existing SNFs or moving to standalone post-acute. And we are very supportive of that. In terms of just post-acute as well, or looking at different settings, even some of our larger medical office buildings have surgical centers and all types of services. It can even fit generally within the ambit of post-acute. So we actually just see healthcare as rolling out in an entirely different way with much more preventative care, much more post-acute care, sometimes within the hospital system itself or through affiliations with it. So we clearly think healthcare is changing and will continue to change in that direction. Exactly how it's done, exactly what role the hospital plays in terms of ownership or joint venturing it or just affiliation agreements, that's more difficult to tell, Philip.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted a sense of the acquisition pipeline that George mentioned earlier. I was trying to get a sense of pricing wise, where you think a lot of that stuff may fall out and generally, overall, a sense of pricing trends. I noticed that the cap rates for the acquisitions you did this quarter were somewhat better than fourth quarter, except in the medical office building category where there is a lot further cap rate compression.", "George L. Chapman", "First of all, there wasn't further cap rate compression in the MOBs. It was just a continuation of the acquisition of 2 of the higher-end portfolios in the country that began in the fourth quarter. So there's no additional compression. We thought the pricing for those particular portfolios was totally appropriate. We think that cap rates can come down into the 6s for some of the remaining really good MOB platforms, which generally are close to the 7, 7.5, as our generally senior housing assets, again, with the best packages coming down into the 6s on occasion.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on the medical office building side of the business, you did talk about -- in first quarter, it was a 20 basis point same-store NOI kind of good. Can you just talk a little bit about what renewal spreads look like within that portfolio?", "John T. Thomas", "Tayo, it's John. The renewals still continue to see some pressure on renewal rates, but our retention was higher than expected so -- which offsets them and also Scott mentioned, lowers our CapEx requirements. So the portfolio is being managed well The -- I'm really proud of our expense reduction, which continues to drive and offset those the pressure on renewal rates.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. When you say there's renewal pressure, you're not talking -- are you talking about negative mark-to-market? Or is it just basically flat?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes. There's still slight negative mark-to-market. The leases they're renewing this year, off of the tenure highs of 10 years ago. So these are second generation off of 2002 rates, which are really the peak so...", "George L. Chapman", "John, maybe you want to let me make a general comment. I think some of the earlier platforms that we purchased years ago are smaller, and they're facing more resistance in certain markets. As we see the newer, larger portfolio roll through, you're going to see some nice pickups in terms of our renewal rates.", "John T. Thomas", "Yes. That's right, George.", "Scott A. Estes", "Tayo, if you do look at the renewal rate, it is on to that 20% in aggregate over the next 5 years, which is among the lowest. And we do often receive the question, how much of the legacy win growth's portfolio is comprised of -- or is in the aggregate MOB portfolio. And I think it's less than half. I think it's actually more like 30-ish percent. Right, guys? 30%. So it's a clearly much smaller part of the aggregate, given the larger buildings we've been buying over the last 3 or 5 years.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then just lastly, with the closing of the Chartwell transaction, kind of since you announced the deal anything that between the announcement the closing, any kind of new information with regards to things that you found out were better than you expected? The things that you found out were worse than you expected?", "Scott A. Estes", "That was me trying to first, Tayo. I would say the portfolio is performing in line with underwritten expectations really through the first few months of 2012. So I would generally say there's no change from our underwritten expectations at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Patinkin [ph] with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It's Rich Anderson here with Josh [ph]. So did you mention the seller of the MOBs?", "George L. Chapman", "No.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can you?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes, Cambridge. It is in the annual.", "George L. Chapman", "Oh, you mean the seller of the ones that we purchased from?", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes.", "George L. Chapman", "Yes. It was Cambridge and Richmond Honan.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "It was Richmond Honan, okay.", "Scott A. Estes", "Both of them at both quarters, right, John?", "John T. Thomas", "Yes.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So do you have more, obviously, more to go there then, right? Particularly, in Richmond Honan?", "John T. Thomas", "One more to go. Rich, this is John Thomas. We've got one more to go and expected to close here soon so...", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Just a quick question on the normalizing of FFO. I'm curious why you think stock compensation should be a normalizing factor?", "Scott A. Estes", "Rich, it's Scott. I'll try to take that one. I think we feel pretty strongly -- the number you're probably referring to is our -- at least categorizing the $4.3 million special stock grant. That was all stock that was paid to across the 9 executive team. It really was a special grant that was made for the successful transformation of the company and the very strong relative performance our stock has had over both the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. And that stock is actually granted after year end. It wasn't in our previous expectations. In our view, since it was granted for past performance, we chose to exclude it from our normalized number.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I hope you don't mind if I don't.", "Scott A. Estes", "Do as you like to do, Rich.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "On the pro forma coverage, the 1.3x, the 1.4x after management fees, you mentioned that includes the mitigation efforts. To what degree is that an offsetting factor? I mean, how low would it be after the full CMS but not including the mitigation factor?", "Scott A. Estes", "I don't know if we've ever looked at that. We decided to look and basically try to give you a run rate from where we are at in the first quarter, based on what mitigation efforts are in place today. I think it's in varying levels of success on mitigation. I know most operators are very focused on it and really for us, like we've said with Genesis representing about -- I think about 2/3 of our current skilled nursing portfolio, they currently have -- I think it's about $71 million of kind of in-place annualized mitigation efforts. So it helps but I still think the coverage levels are more than adequate with or without the specific mitigation.", "George L. Chapman", "Let me add a few comments, Rich, and allow me to disagree with you, too, in the premise of your question. It seems to me sort of an interesting but totally theoretical question you're asking, because as we've lived through 20 to 30 years watching skilled nursing, sometimes win some with the regulators and sometimes lose some. The rate that the nursing home operators are used to operating in a regulated environment. And to think that they wouldn't mitigate through cost reductions or more efficient staffing when there is a revenue effect, is just to sort of ignore what people have been doing for all of those years. And I think they've all done it pretty well, maybe George Hager and Mike and the rest somewhat more efficiently. But everybody's done it. They were used to doing this. It was just a big, big cut in reimbursement and demanding perhaps more severe cuts to the cost.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then last question just on guidance to Scott. You mentioned -- that and it says in the release, it's all -- almost all a function of the higher-level dispositions. But there are a lot of -- the deleveraging steps, the shares and all that, that netted to a 0 impact on your guidance.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. Maybe let me just walk through that, Rich, for everyone's benefit. I think it's important. I would say the best way to think about it is our guidance would not have changed but for the increase in dispositions. We did not have -- so what was not included in our previous guidance was first of all, the $600 million of senior notes, the 4.2%, which I guess, at their own accord, were about call it a $0.09 potential negative. But that was in aggregate offset by $0.09 of positive from the $146 million of additional investments we made post that $508 million investment announcement when we put a release out in mid-February. The $146 million of additional investments, the $185 million of secured debt payoffs and the $126 million of convertible debt payoffs basically net out the new debt issue. So again just adding $100 million to the disposition guidance, that 10% to 11% probably happened around mid-years but it's that $0.03.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Macquarie Capital.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "I want to see on the seniors housing development side, if you guys could maybe talk about whether you're thinking at all about increasing your investment there, maybe give a sense about how big that sort of pipeline could get based on your existing relationships today because it seems like that's sort of one of the best ways you guys can sort of add, let's say, NAV upside to the stock at this point.", "Scott A. Estes", "Nick, help us understand the question. Did you say seniors housing operating or senior housing triple-net or just in general that you think about or thinking about the portfolio?", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Yes. I mean, just in general. Just in general, I mean, mostly it's been on the triple-net side, right? So -- but I mean, could that piece of business go higher on the triple-net side? I mean, that's considering doing more on the operating side, perhaps?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. I'm sorry I didn't understand you were asking about the development component of the portfolio. Actually, we see development as a great opportunity in general. If you really look, most of our development would be focused on private pay, seniors housing, rental model, rolling into a master lease with an existing operator, as well as medical office buildings that are largely pre-leased. We don't break around generally unless we're about 75% plus pre-leased. We actually include that stat now in the book, which I think, the projects we have under way are what is it? 96% there -- 96% pre-lease, the projects we have under way. So I actually think the development projects there are a nice supplement to our acquisition-based growth. And I would say we generally -- I think, we'd probably have the potential to do something in the magnitude, maybe $300 million to $400 million to $500 million of starts per year. But I think we want to keep it pretty focused on existing relationships, high-quality assets and definitely keep it more toward the 5% to 8% range of the total portfolio. John, I don't know maybe you or someone we could comment -- we had a great facility open and we didn't talk about it this quarter with the Virtua addition, how much -- the 300,000-square foot medical office building that I believe is 98% occupied at opening and about an 8.2% initial yield.", "George L. Chapman", "And attached to the hospital.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "And on the senior housing RIDEA side, is there any way to get a sense for how much is sort of left as far as units or some sort of way to frame the size of the sort of possible future opportunity set with your existing partners at this point?", "George L. Chapman", "I don't know that there really is. We have been -- if you look back over a number of quarters, we've been running at $400 million to $500 million with existing RIDEA partners and other partners. And we've managed to add some RIDEA partners in the last 2 or 3 quarters, although it's -- perhaps the volume is reduced a bit. I think that I just go back to my comment during my opening remarks and that is, probably the volumes are going to decrease somewhat over the next year or 2. And that's where our ability to continue to execute on our relationship investing program gives us a large competitive advantage.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just -- sorry, just one last quick question on the dispositions, is it possible to get the debt balances for those properties?", "Scott A. Estes", "Which ones, Nick? The ones that...", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Well, the $200 million to $300 million, is there debt associated with them? I'm just trying to figure out what the net cash proceeds might be from that?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think 0, right? It's 0 on that aggregate $300 million. It is not related. If it is, it is relatively a small amount.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Few questions, first of all, on the senior housing RIDEA portfolio, I think you mentioned the 5.1% revenue increase. Considering occupancy went up about 80 basis points, can you talk about what the other revenue driver factors were? Was it just in general opening increases in base rate? Is it residents using more services or something else?", "Scott A. Estes", "There's -- it's those 2 points. It's both finance services and then also just the normal annual increases.", "George L. Chapman", "And they're probably different for different operators as well. Some people have really pushed enhanced services and others have been doing -- making it up elsewhere. I don't know if we can pin that down further, probably difficult to do.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. What do you think is ballpark has been the average base rate increase?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I mean it varies by market. This is Scott. But generally, it's 3% or 4%. Some of the better markets were able to do even better. But generally speaking, they're getting at least CPI and if not better, which is why we prefer newer buildings, high barrier markets. Over the years, we've seen those markets -- or those facilities outperform inflation.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Going back to the pipeline that you're seeing on the investment side, can you just roughly quantify what the visible pipeline is that could close in 2012 or could close this year, even though nothing's in guidance for it at this point?", "Scott A. Estes", "Mike, it's Scott. Tough call. Maybe I would point to I think our relationship success in the past, and we've been able to generate somewhere in that ranges of $300 million to $500 million of repeat business per quarter. That's about, in my opinion, where the potential is. As I mentioned, it's a lot of seniors housing assets as well some additional medical office building opportunities. But it's pretty consistent with the pace that we've kind of viewed or call it general relationship-based business opportunity.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And last question for me, shifting gears going to Genesis, can you talk a little bit about just the cost mitigation? I mean, where exactly are the costs coming out of the system? Is it labor? If so, where particular in labor? Is it someplace else?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure. I talked again with George and Tom. I think they are doing a good job. I think the specific answer to your question, there is a run rate of about $71 million. I would say at least half of those are coming at the facility level. Cost administration, maintenance, sanitary, housekeeping items like that. And then there's probably another $20 million or so or at least a portion of them are also facility based but also maybe more general that had both the facility level as well as overhead like some of the therapist productivity efforts, 401 (k) match and incentive comp changes that they've done. So actually, it's a pretty good percentage of -- it's actually at the facility level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess a couple of portfolio questions, it looks like the lease coverage dropped a little bit on the triple-net senior housing. Was that just from the additional acquisitions you did in the quarter?", "Scott A. Estes", "Dan, I think you're breaking up a little bit. I think you said the senior housing coverage. Yes, the whole trend there is really solely a function of -- due to some of the additions to the portfolio. They kind of come in over the last 3 or 4 quarters.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's what we thought. And then also on the medical office buildings, it looked like occupancy dropped on the same-store portfolio a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Obviously, it's still very high occupancy. But if you could just talk a little bit about that drop there and do you expect to get that back with some new tenant leases?", "George L. Chapman", "I think you're breaking out but you're asking about the slight drop in occupancy quarter-over-quarter?", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, on the same-store portfolio. I just picked up my phone instead of the headphone here.", "John T. Thomas", "Yes. Just a very slight occupancy, which will recover -- decline which we will recover this quarter or next. We had a one-tenant downsize slightly. But comfortable that the occupancy will increase, as Scott mentioned at the beginning of the call, by the end of the year, back to the 94% range.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe a little nuance question on the SNF portfolio, but it looks like the Medicare mix kind of dropped quarter-over-quarter. I mean, I understand that the coverage drop coming from the Medicare cuts. But just wanted to understand the change in the mix. Is that also a result of the drop in the reimbursement? Or is that something else going on within the portfolio in terms of mix?", "Scott A. Estes", "No. It's due to that, Dan. Our day has basically stayed about the same in terms of percentages. What we show on the supplement, as revenue and the Medicare decline is the result to the rate reduction in October.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just also -- a kind of disclaims that the supplement here on the CCRC is that they're -- they look like they're continuing to trend up very slowly. That's your -- that would be your take as well. And you see any -- and then -- and the other question related, do you see any acquisition opportunities in that entrance fee CCRC space? And you haven't done any of those. But do you see opportunities there?", "George L. Chapman", "Generally, not. We've decided to orient much more toward the rental model. And there are conceivably some that are arguably undermanaged by non-profits. It could be purchased but it's not going to be Health Care REIT that does it.", "Dan Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Is that because of your view of that particular model? I mean, we've had some web calls on the higher entrant -- higher entrance age and higher turnover in CCRCs. Is that just a strategic decision, based on your thoughts on the viability of the model? Or is there something else factoring into this?", "George L. Chapman", "No. I don't think so. I think that the entry fee model has a lot of viability. We just think we can have more predictable earnings and present our senior housing platform define generally to include triple-net and operating in a much more constructive way.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Chapman for his closing remarks.", "George L. Chapman", "We all thank you for participating. And again, if there are follow-up questions, Scott and team will be available. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes the conference.

And welcome to the Sunrise Senior Living Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.", "At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Smith. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim Smith", "Thank you. And welcome to Sunrise Senior Living\u2019s second quarter 2012 investor conference call. This is Tim Smith of Sunrise\u2019s Investor Relations.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being recorded and the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 apply to this conference call.", "During the course of this call, the company will make various remarks concerning management\u2019s expectations, predictions, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements.", "Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements in the future.", "I will now turn the call over to Mark Ordan, Sunrise\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Mark?", "Mark Ordan", "Thanks Tim. Good morning. We are pleased to speak about another overall solid quarter for Sunrise Senior Living. Our quarter-over-quarter stabilized occupancy increased 90 basis points to 88.1%, which is even with our first quarter results.", "Our current quarter is off to a strong start. Our results always vary regionally and we have even very pleased recently by strength in our West Coast communities where we have a large concentration.", "Our average revenue per occupied unit grew 2.4% to the second quarter of 2012 over the same period in 2011 and 1.2% sequentially. NOI grew 1.6% quarter-over-quarter for stabilized communities and 2.9% overall.", "General and administrative expenses were $25.2 million for the quarter, compared to $27.6 million for the same period in 2011. The decrease in the period is primarily due to $1.1 million of severance expense is paid in 2011 relating to the reduction of 20 positions at our corporate and regional offices, compared to $300,000 in severance cost in 2012.", "As a result of those and additional staffing reductions at our corporate and regional offices in 2011, salary expenses decreased by approximately $900,000 in the second quarter of 2012, compared to the second quarter of 2011.", "Our adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $49.7 million versus $39 million for the same period last year. The difference was driven primarily by the 15 community acquisition, which occurred in the latter part of Q2 of 2011, along with our reduced overhead and NOI growth.", "As you would expect with very few remaining workout completions to be done, our daily attention in Q2 and beyond is devoted primarily to increasing strength of our operations. While we are reducing our overhead spending, we have been and will continue to spend more on care.", "Our costs of care delivery and oversight have increased and are budgeted to continue to grow. Our mission has always in group included the care seniors who are time quite frail. We continue to increase our investment in our care team, including a new quality assurance team and program.", "Generally, an information system where we previously lacked resources of steady improvement, we invested more in 2012 and we plan to continue to invest heavily in 2013 and beyond. Here while our spending is broad we are especially focused on short and long-term health care imperatives.", "We manage over 300 communities, thanks to the enormous care and efforts of our 30,000 team member. I hope you don\u2019t find my emphasis on my team on an earnings call to mean that\u2019s placed.", "We at Sunrise want to do everything we practically can to maximize a happiness and engagement of our team members. In Q2, we launch a new engagement drive in which we spend a great deal of time and effort going around the field, listening to our team members to find better ways to do what we do.", "We intend to also to reduce where possible the stress point that is typical on healthcare. Our goal in 2012 and every year forward is to make sure the team members know they are appreciated and their voice counts.", "We believe that the benefit of these focus are manifold. Engaged team members stay with us, develop deep ties with our resident and their families, better attract new residents, are more attentive, more innovative and more prepared and eager for career advancement. We all read about the headline positive the senior housing and senior living. It\u2019s our increasingly engaged team that will provide lasting substance to these headlines.", "Greg Neeb will shortly describe several key transactions in the second quarter, but I\u2019ll highlight the few of them now. We were pleased to settle our long outstanding litigation with Five Star and to finalize our transition plan for 10 communities to Five Star. While we prefer adding communities, we never want residential team members to be unnecessarily in limbo.", "We strengthened Sunrise further with her latest venture with CNL including seven communities. With CNL\u2019s investment, we successfully refinance the debt on these communities. Sunrise received $5 million, while of course, retaining management of these communities.", "Next we are happy to have finally begun to make progress on our Fox Hill ventures in Bethesda. We successfully refinance our loans on the assisted living amenity side of this project. Thus closing out with the forked loan, and enabling us to have, we expect to be fruitful discussions with the new lenders on the condominium side.", "Finally, while we have no definitive news today on our U.K. debt restructuring, we\u2019ve had positive discussions with our partners and lenders which we hope to conclude very shortly.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc Richards, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Marc Richards", "Thank you, Mark. And thank you all for joining us today for Sunrise\u2019s second quarter conference call. Today I will discuss Sunrise\u2019s consolidated operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, including our recent transactions have impacted our consolidated financial results.", "As Mark mentioned earlier, our 2012 second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased by $10.7 million compared to the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to approximately $8.5 million of incremental EBITDA generated from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012, and the decrease of $3 million in general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash stock compensation expense.", "We've adjusted net income before interest taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent expense to further exclude certain non-cash gains and losses, and certain items of income or expenses, and arriving at adjusted.", "Net income attributable to common shareholders for the quarter was $9.6 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share, compared to $1.3 million or $0.02 per fully diluted share for the second quarter of 2011.", "The change between periods was primarily driven by a $21.7 million return on investment resulting from the sale of 16 venture-owned assets to Ventas, a $5.1 million increase in our share of earnings and unconsolidated communities, which was primarily driven by NOI growth and transaction cost incurred for certain ventures in 2011, but not in 2012, and the $2.3 million reduction in general and administrative expenses in the second quarter of 2012.", "The difference between the periods also reflects a $15.6 million impairment charge recorded in 2012 related to in-place leasehold improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment at 10 communities whose leases are being terminated early, and an $11.3 million gain on fair value for business combinations relating to the acquisition of AL US recorded in the second quarter of 2011.", "Management fees for the quarter were $25.3 million, which includes $400,000 of fee income for management contracts that have since been terminated. For the same period last year, management fees were $24.4 million, which includes $1.9 million of fee income for management contracts that have since been terminated or eliminated in consolidation, including $1 million from the 15 AL US communities.", "Our second quarter 2012 consolidated and leased community net operating income, excluding the impact of the 15 AL US communities acquired in June of 2011, as well as Santa Monica and the five operating properties acquired from two unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $1 million quarter-or-quarter.", "These 21 communities accounted for $23.5 million of incremental resident fee income and $15 million of incremental community expense in our second quarter 2012 consolidated results. Net operating income is income from operations, excluding depreciation, lease expense and impairment charges related to these communities.", "Turning to our year-over-year results, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $93.4 million, as compared to $67.2 million last year. This increase was primarily due to approximately $17.3 million of incremental EBITDA generated from communities acquired in 2011 and 2012, and a decrease of $7.2 million in general and administrative expenses excluding non-cash stock compensation expense.", "Net income attributable to common shareholders was $11.6 million or $0.20 per fully diluted share for the first six months of 2012, as compared with net loss of $16.4 million or $0.29 per fully diluted share for the first six months of 2011.", "The change between periods was primarily driven by a $21.7 million return on investment, resulting from the sale of the 16 venture-owned assets to Ventas, a $7.5 million gain on fair value from business combinations relating to the acquisition of Santa Monica and the transfer of five operating properties to us from two unconsolidated joint ventures for no cash consideration, and $11.9 million increase in our share of earnings in unconsolidated communities, which was primarily driven by venture NOI growth and transaction costs incurred by certain ventures in 2011, but not in 2012, and a $6.1 million reduction in general and administrative expenses in the first six months of 2012.", "The difference between periods also reflects a $15.6 million impairment charge recorded in 2012, relating to in-place leasehold improvements in furniture and fixture and equipment. At 10 communities, those leases are being terminated and an $11.3 million gain from business combinations, relating to the acquisition of AL US reported in 2011.", "General and administrative expenses for the first six months of 2012 were $53.9 million, compared to $60 million in 2011. The decrease in the period is primarily due to $4.5 million of severance expenses recorded in 2011, relating to the reduction of 62 positions at our corporate and regional offices, compared to $500,000 in severance costs in 2012.", "As a result of those and additional staffing reductions at our corporate and regional office in 2011, salary expenses decreased by approximately $3.8 million in the first half of 2012, compared to the first half of 2011. These decreases were partially offset by $3.7 million in expense, relating to the settlement of litigation with Five Star.", "Management fees for the first six months of 2012 were $49.7 million, which includes $900,000 of fee income from management contracts that have since been terminated. For the same period last year, management fees were $48.6 million, which includes $4.3 million of fee income from management contracts that have since been terminated or eliminated in consolidation, including $2.4 million from the 15 AL US communities.", "Our consolidated and leased community net operating income for the first six months of 2012, excluding the impact of the communities acquired in 2011 and 2012, which include the 15 AL US communities acquired in June 2011, and the six communities acquired in the first quarter of 2012 decreased $1.3 million year-over-year.", "These 21 communities accounted for $46.8 million of incremental resident fee income and $29.6 million of incremental community expense in our year-to-date 2012 consolidated results.", "Turning to our balance sheet, our unrestricted cash balance at June 30th was $54.8 million. The principal amount of our outstanding consolidating debt at June 30th was $531.2 million.", "Since our last conference call, we\u2019ve paid down our line of credit by $39 million and removed $175 million of mortgage debt from our balance sheet that was associated with seven communities that were contributed to a venture at the end of June.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Neeb. Greg?", "Greg Neeb", "Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll provide comments for our consolidated assets, our leased assets, our joint ventures and our management contracts for both stabilized and leased-up properties, which is a reflection of how we manage our business. I will also speak about key transactions within each segment, details are available in our supplemental 8-K filed yesterday.", "Our consolidated community portfolio now consists of 23 communities, all of which are stabilized as of June 30, 2012. In the second quarter, our consolidated portfolio was reduced by seven communities and these communities were transferred to a newly formed venture. I will detail this shortly.", "For the second quarter, the 23 consolidated communities produced $11.6 million of net operating income before management fees, resulting in a NOI increase of 1.5% for the second quarter of 2012 over the second quarter of 2011. For the same period, occupancy was up 170 basis points, and average revenue per occupied unit was up 1.7%.", "NOI for leased communities was down 13.1% and occupancy was 87.7% for the second quarter of 2012 versus 88.3% for the second quarter of 2011. Within our leased community segment on May 29, 2012, we entered into an agreement to terminate 10 operating community leases with the lessor, Senior Housing Properties Trust.", "The lessor lesser paid us $1 million as consideration for the in-place furniture, fixtures and equipment. Communities will be transitioned to a new manager over the next four to 12 months.", "Excluding the 10 terminated leased communities, NOI decreased approximately 7.6% and occupancy was 89.4% for the second quarter of 2012 versus 90% for the second quarter of 2011. This decrease was due to lower run rate as discussed on previous calls and lower skilled nursing resident days.", "Combining stabilized U.S. and U.K. joint venture communities, NOI was up 9.7% in the second quarter 2012 over the second quarter 2011, while stabilized management community NOI was up 0.9%.", "Revenue per occupied unit for stabilized U.S. joint ventures, U.K. joint ventures and stabilized management communities increased 4%, 3.5% and 2.6%, respectively. Leased-up properties combining all 18 of the U.S. U.K. communities continued strong as evidenced by NOI increasing 30% over the prior year.", "As we disclosed last quarter's, 16 assets have moved from venture communities to managed communities in the second quarter of 2012, due to the sale to Ventas of these assets.", "Also on June 29, seven committees were transferred from consolidated to joint ventures with the formation of a new venture, CNL Healthcare Trust. Pursuing to the terms of this transaction, we contributed our ownership in the seven senior living facilities, along with our share of transaction and closing costs to the venture.", "CNL contributed approximately $57 million along with its share of transaction and closing cost to the venture. The venture is owned approximately 55% by CNL and approximately 45% by us with the gross valuation of approximately $226 million.", "Prior to and of the condition to closing, we and CNL obtained new financing for five other facilities and modified the existing financing on two other facilities. In connection with the refinancing, approximately $50 million of CNL\u2019s contribution to the venture was used to pay down the existing financing on five other facilities that were refinanced.", "The venture had approximately $125 million of indebtedness collateralized by the seven facilities. In addition, we received approximately $5 million cash distribution from the venture immediately following closing. These communities will continue to be managed by us under new agreements with a fee of 6% of community revenues.", "We and CNL have entered into a new venture agreement that provides for our respective rights and obligations to the ventures, including our right at our option to purchase CNL interest in the venture subject to certain restrictions and conditions.", "In the second quarter, we successfully refinance the assisted living amenities unit component of our senior living condominium project. In June 2012, the assisted living amenities\u2019 venture refinanced at existing mortgage financing with new mortgage financing provided by Eagle bank.", "The new loan has a principal amount of $26 million, a floor interest rate of 5.5% and a term of three years. As a result of the refinancing, we have been released from our obligation to fund operating deficits and to pay default interest previously accrued by us through December 31, 2011, totaling approximately $2.4 million to the prior mortgage lender.", "Also, in connection with the refinancing, we funded approximately $6 million on behalf of the venture, leading to a modification of the joint venture terms. Return of our new funding will have priority over existing equity and the venture\u2019s partner\u2019s total return will be capped at its initial contribution of $6.5 million.", "Return of outstanding operating deficit and cost overruns of approximately $8.2 million to us will be subordinate to the return of capital of both venture partners. We are obligated to our partner on the condominium venture to fund operating shortfalls.", "We have funded $2.2 million under the guarantee through June 30, 2012 of which $0.1 million was funded in 2012. In addition, we are required to fund sales and marketing costs associated with the sale of the condominium.", "As previously reported, we believe the partners have no remaining equity in the condominium project. And we have informed our partner that we do not intend to fund future operating shortfalls.", "As of June 30, 2012, the loan of $117.3 million for the residential condominium venture was in default. In June, the lender sold their note to a new lender who has suspended the previous lenders foreclosure plans. We are in discussion with the new lender about fresh agreements.", "As I reported before and noted by Marc earlier, we have a venture in the U.K. with a $600 million loan that\u2019s in default. We\u2019ve had fruitful discussions with our lender and partner and hope to be able to report progress shortly.", "In October 2012, our German restructure note will mature and we may be required to pay under the guarantee if we are unable to sell the mortgaged assets. As of June 30, 2012, the amount of this guarantee is $24.2 million. Since 2010 and through 2012, we sold or intend to sell certain communities and land parcels that are held as collateral for the German lenders.", "We have one closed community and seven land parcels as of June 30, 2012, remaining to sell. The external estimate of likely property sales by October 2012, we believe that we may be required to fund the full amount due under the guarantee.", "If we are required to fund the remaining minimum payment under the guarantee any assets held as collateral for the German lenders, at the time of payment will be released from liquidating trust and we will therefore be entitled to sell, develop, finance or otherwise transact such assets for our own account.", "Two of the eight remaining assets included partially developed Sunrise community in Burlingame, California and a partially developed Sunrise community in Torrance, California. Both of these assets possess superior demographics and development potential.", "In addition to the debt discussed above, Sunrise ventures have total debt of $2.3 billion with near-term scheduled maturities of $0.1 billion for the remainder of 2012 and there is $0.7 billion of debt that is in default as of June 30, 2012. The defaulted debt is primarily related to the condominium loan and U.K. project loan I described earlier.", "The debt and ventures is non-recourse to us with respect to principal, payment guarantees and we and our venture partners are working with the venture lenders to obtain covenant wavers and to extent maturity date and also changes in the construction loans of permanent financing provided by financial institutions secured by mortgage or deed of trust on the financed community.", "We have provided operating deficit guarantees to the lenders or ventures with respect to $0.3 billion of the total venture debt. Under the operating deficit agreements, we are obligated to pay operating shortfalls, if any, with respect to these ventures. Any such payments could include amounts arising in part from the venture's obligations for payment of monthly principal and interest on the venture debt.", "These operating deficit agreements would not obligate us to repay the principal balance on such venture debt that might become due as a result of acceleration of such indebtedness or maturity. We have non-controlling interests in these ventures.", "Back to you Mark.", "Mark Ordan", "Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Marc. We will now take any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question with Daniel Bernstein of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. I just want to start off on the G&A which seems to continuing to come down do you have a sense of what your -- what you expect that run rate to be going forward that kind of annual mid-90s million dollar mark based on the 2Q, or do you expect G&A to come down a little further as we go throughout the year.", "Mark Ordan", "We have -- we don\u2019t have a new run rate, Dan, to announce this morning. I would say that we continue to try to find ways to reduce overhead. And as I also said in my comments, we temper those reductions with what we think is necessary in fruitful spending in areas like care and systems. So we think we can be at this level or little bit lower but not prepared right now to throw out any number.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. When I look the U.K. lease of assets, it look like the occupancy declined a little bit and the rate declined a little bit sequentially. Obviously, there is some economic problems in Europe at this time in U.K. Can you talk about little bit about how your operations they are performing and especially on the lease of assets. And is that influencing the length of the negotiations to modify the U.K. loan covenant there?", "Greg Neeb", "Dan, it\u2019s Greg. Let me talk a little bit about, sort of, operations in the U.K. As you'll see, the NOI for the U.K., including the large 15 asset portfolio increase even though occupancy -- unit occupancy decreased. What's happening there is a couple of things.", "One is that we are doing more semi-private occupancy. So what we're doing is actually resident in account of the building has increased. And with that, we have actually more residents in the building paying rent.", "Second thing that\u2019s happening is that there's higher care utilization. The two sort of -- the impact of the two has the impact of actually increasing NOI year-over-year, even though we show a unit occupancy dip. So there is a sort of a phenomenon there that we think as the -- as productives of the bottom line.", "The second part of your question relating to the U.K. loan modification. I tried to do give some guidance on this at the end of the last year that this was going to be a lengthy process based on what we had seen others in the market do and sort of how complex this particular negotiation was going to be. I think its proceeding as we expected. And as we indicated, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll have some progress to report soon.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. It sounded like the tone of negotiation were positive but I was just wondering whether all of the problems in Europe and U.K. is just kind of hindering their decision process. Is that the sense you get or is it just simply progressing as it is?", "Mark Ordan", "We think it\u2019s just as Greg said it\u2019s a practice that we expect. I don\u2019t know whether that was directly tied to Europe. But again we're very hopeful that we will conclude this one.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "And when we look at the occupancy on the stabilized assets, they were really flat. Sequentially, you had very good rate growth on your stabilized assets. If you could talk a little bit more about the trends in the quarter, was there a point where the occupancy trough and continued to trend up when you talked about July being very good.", "So although that an average number of occupancy was flat, what could you tell us about the trends in occupancy in the quarter?", "Mark Ordan", "I made a comment in my comments, that we see differences regionally and that varies by quarter. So there was no particular trend to call out during the quarter. It was mentioned we were very pleased. We have a big investment in footprint on the West Coast and we had increased strength there.", "So it does vary quarter-by-quarter regionally as there are different changes. Our first quarter was a little bit stronger than we expected. We were really disappointed by the results in the second quarter. We were pleased as you noted that that we\u2019ve achieved our results with increased rates.", "And yeah, we are also very pleased that that the third quarter was off to a very strong start. We had several positive weeks and we have a terrific sales team and leader. And I think they are doing a great job, making sure that everybody knows what a strong value it is to have your mom and dad at Sunrise.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Are you able to provide the occupancy at the end of the quarter on those assets and may be where they are today. Just putting some more numbers on the trends that you noted?", "Mark Ordan", "In which the\u2026", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "You could just do to stabilize it, where you ended the quarter and where you\u2019re today or where you\u2019re at the end of July?", "Mark Ordan", "We don\u2019t break that out separately but we could think about that.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then in terms of the rate growth you absolutely did push the rate growth in the second quarter. If you could talk about -- is that something that level, something we continue to expect the rest of the year in response to the higher acuity that you may be having in your facilities just trying to understand the push in rate?", "Mark Ordan", "Well, I\u2019d say a few things. It\u2019s obviously a composite number. We are very need driven, number one. So a lot of this has to do with the care that we provide for our residents. The second is, as I said all these things are regionally driven. We don't set rates as a company. We look at our first-off market and within our markets, we look at our communities.", "So there were times, when it's not advantageous at all to increase rate. There were times when it makes sense. So I don't have a projection for the year. I think we -- I think we\u2019d become fairly good at managing this part of -- this part of our business. And I think because over 30 years now, we understand what it takes to take care of seniors who whose needs are more acute. I think it put us in a good position.", "But -- so we balance the factor if it\u2019s need driven by the factor would be their economic realities. And those vary market-by-market.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. But generally, as your occupancy has improved, you\u2019ve been able to push rate a little bit better?", "Mark Ordan", "No indication of that change.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And on recurring CapEx, I guess, it was about $3 million or so in the quarter. Is that expected to trend up a little bit in the next coming quarters. I would think it would be, may be, more of $4 million, $5 million a quarter range but how was that to you to. Tell me whether I think that characterization is right or wrong?", "Marc Richards", "Hey, David. It\u2019s Marc Richards. You\u2019re correct. We typically, historically incurred the bulk of our CapEx in the third and fourth quarters of the year. So I would expect an upward trend moving through the remainder of 2012.", "Daniel Bernstein \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess, that\u2019s all for me at this point. I\u2019ll see if anyway. I don\u2019t have any questions.", "Mark Ordan", "Dan, thanks very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Okay. And it appears that we have no further questions at this time.", "Mark Ordan", "I will let everybody go to Hamptons with the beach and we\u2019ll continue to manage our communities. So thank you everybody for your support and for listening this morning and we\u2019ll talk to you soon.", "Operator", "And that conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Brooke, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website as well.", "Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman and CEO and President of Health Care REIT, for his opening remarks. George?", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter for our company and its shareholders. Our relationship investment strategy is hitting on all cylinders, driving $1.1 billion of investments for the second quarter and $1.9 billion year-to-date. And the pipeline remains quite strong. Of the $1.1 billion of new Q2 investments, over 50% of them were with existing partners. As we look over the last 3 quarters, we closed over $2 billion of relationship investments that comprised approximately 2/3 of the total.  Importantly, the portfolio generated second quarter year-over-year same-store cash NOI growth of 4.2%. This was led by a strong 7.4% growth from our senior housing operating portfolio. And notably, every category posted at least a 3% NOI growth.", "During the last 5 years, we have taken advantage of unprecedented opportunities to transform our portfolio into the most diversified, highest-quality, lowest-risk portfolio in the sector. And in the second quarter, our portfolio exceeded 1,000 properties for the first time. And we have attracted the industry's finest operators and health systems, largely as a result of our reputation as a value-added partner. Importantly, due to our relationship investment program, we have the most predictable, consistent investment pipeline in the sector.", "We continue to work hard to add value to our operator partnerships. We hold regular meetings to exchange ideas regarding best practices, and we are exploring ways in which our operators can take advantage of joint purchasing programs. One tangible result has been the establishment of a property and casualty program that has produced an 18% average cost reduction with improved coverages.", "Our private pay percentage is now 74% and is expected to reach 80% within 12 months. And with this private pay percentage and the strong contribution from our RIDEA assets, we continue to believe that our portfolio is undervalued relative to other property types, particularly multifamily. And this belief is supported by a number of factors, but including a continuing cap rate compression in our sector and the strong portfolio NOI growth. These properties were the combination of solid NOI growth and relatively low capital expenditure requirements that performed very well even during the toughest economic times.", "On May 1 this quarter, we closed a previously announced $937 million Chartwell transaction. Chartwell is Canada's largest senior housing operator, with high-quality assets in Metropolitan areas. This investment will be immediately accretive in markets with excellent demographic trends, and we look forward to a successful partnership and future growth in Canada and other strong markets.", "Let me discuss another important transaction from the second quarter, and that is our joint venture with Legend Senior Living. Legend and HCN entered into a $279 million joint venture. Of the 15 facilities in the program, 9 were contributed by Legend and 6 by HCN. The real estate will be owned -- is owned 88% by HCN and 12% by Legend. Operations are owned 80% by Legend and 20% by HCN. Legend has been engaged as the independent manager.", "We expect to expand the joint venture over time through opportunistic acquisitions as well as development of additional facilities in Legend's footprint. This is particularly noteworthy for us as we have been doing business with Tim Buchanan since 1995, when we financed his original company, Sterling House. Sterling House is now part of Brookdale. Tim is one of the early pioneers in our sector and is currently on the Board of Directors of ALFA. We have supported Tim through a number of successful ventures since 1995, and we're gratified to be entering into this larger, more closely aligned relationship with Tim and his team, who have always performed at the highest level.", "I'll now turn to some additional commentary on our portfolio performance. We continue to be impressed with how our skilled nursing operators are coping with the previously announced Medicare cuts. The ability of operators to execute on mitigation efforts has been very impressive to us, and we continue to believe that post-acute providers particularly will be a key part of the evolving healthcare delivery system. The recent Genesis announcement of its agreement to purchase Sun Healthcare will produce the largest post-acute platform in the United States. The combined company has complementary platforms, including rehab and hospice, that should drive growth and strong results. Approximately 75% of Sun Healthcare's portfolio will overlap with the Genesis infrastructure. And we believe the increased scale and attendant synergy shall allow Genesis to drive substantial value. And we continue to work closely with George Hager and his team to grow the short stay, post-acute component of their portfolio, resulting in accelerated-quality mix improvement.", "In the MOB space, we have a sector-leading occupancy of 93.6% and excellent retention rates. And with 90% of our facilities affiliated with strong health systems, our MOB portfolio is well positioned for excellent performance. In addition to adding high-quality investments, we continue to enhance our portfolio quality through the disposition of non-core assets. We believe our portfolio rationalization program has helped us maintain a sector-leading portfolio. We have had success this year in disposing of $124 million of non-core assets, with current guidance of $300 million for the year. But if opportunities present themselves, we would dispose of even more non-core assets. And while we experienced some dilution in disposing of certain Medicaid focus-skilled nursing facilities, we continue to believe that the improvement to our portfolio quality far outweighs any near-term costs.", "The portfolio is positioned in the high-end, \"high barrier to entry\" markets. 38% of the portfolio is located in the Northeast, in Mid-Atlantic areas. 76% of the portfolio and 90% [ph] of our RIDEA investments are located in East and West Coast markets for the top 31 MSAs. And facilities in these markets have generally outperformed other facilities.  In addition, these concentrations have provided and will continue to provide opportunities to foster collaboration among portfolio partners across the health care spectrum.", "As the health care markets have changed dramatically during the last several years, Health Care REIT has benefited from extraordinary growth as our commitment to relationships, improvement of health care delivery and collaboration has appealed to operators and health systems. We expect the evolution of health care to continue given the need for professional management, better technology and economies of scale. Partnerships are being formed with other provider types. They will also be formed with service providers that assist the operator to deliver an ever-improving experience to the customer. This will drive continuing change and consolidation, resulting in larger, professionally managed, branded operators and health systems that should further strengthen our portfolio valuations.", "And at this point, I'll ask Scott Estes, our CFO, to address the certain financial and capital markets matters. Scott?", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, George. Good morning, everybody. As George discussed, our relationship investment program continues to generate a steady pipeline of opportunities, and our portfolio continues to perform well. Second quarter portfolio performance is strong across the board, generating blended same-store cash NOI growth of 4.2% year-over-year, led by strong 7.4% growth out of our seniors housing operating portfolio and, as George mentioned, with every category posting at least 3% growth year-over-year. We continue to strengthen and diversify our portfolio and are in a strong liquidity position as we continue to execute our business plan entering the second half of 2012.", "Now turning to the details of the quarter, this is another solid quarter on the investment front, completing gross investments of $1.1 billion for the quarter and $1.9 billion year-to-date. Over $600 million or over 50% of our second quarter investments came out of existing relationships. The majority of the remainder was our Canadian investment with Chartwell that closed on May 1 and is performing slightly ahead of underwritten expectations through May and June. Approximately $550 million of our $1.1 billion in second quarter investments were not included in our previous guidance and, as such, is the primary basis for the 1% increase in our normalized FFO and FAD per-share guidance today.", "As George discussed, our relationship investment program is driving consistent portfolio growth, enabling us to purchase high-quality assets at attractive returns for our shareholders. Pricing in the second quarter for both seniors housing and MOB investments averaged in the low to mid-7% range. Looking forward, our near-term investment pipeline remains primarily concentrated in private pay seniors housing and medical office buildings. Current pricing on these opportunities are generally in the 6.5% to 7% range.  So the highest quality assets with higher NOI growth potential located in the best markets would trade below this range.", "Finally, in terms of second quarter dispositions, we sold $92 million of properties, which consisted primarily of a nonstrategic 12-facility skilled nursing portfolio and a 6-facility seniors housing portfolio, generating total gains of $32 million.", "Turning now to portfolio performance.  Before I begin, I would note the only significant change to the supplement this quarter was the addition of the Chartwell portfolio information as part of our seniors housing operating portfolio on Page 7 of the document. This page includes 2 months of the Chartwell performance as the investment closed on May 1. In our seniors housing triple-net lease portfolio, payment coverage stands at a solid 1.34x before management fees and 1.15x after management fees. Occupancy of 88.2% as of March 31 remains comparable to the NIC industry average and has since increased 20 basis points to approximately 88.4% as of May 31. And more importantly, the stability of our seniors housing triple-net portfolio was once again demonstrated through a second quarter increase in same-store cash NOI of 3.5%.", "Our skilled nursing portfolio payment coverage currently stands at 1.94x before management fees and 1.49x after management fees for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. Our overall skilled nursing occupancy increased 40 basis points sequentially to 88.3%, while same-store cash NOI increased 3.3% in the second quarter versus the prior year. Our coverage declined as expected on a sequential basis, primarily due to another quarter of lower Medicare rates implemented in October of 2011, moving into the trailing 12-month data. However, as anticipated, the recently announced positive 1.8% net increase to fiscal 2013 Medicare skilled nursing rates should help to stabilize coverages beginning later this year.", "Based on our current outlook for state budgets, we are also forecasting roughly flat Medicaid rate increases in fiscal '13 across our skilled nursing portfolio, which was also in line with our previous expectations. Essentially, not a lot of change this quarter regarding our perspective on the skilled nursing segment and our SNF portfolio assumptions. I can report that Genesis' operating performance year-to-date is in line with budget through the first 6 months of the year and that their cross-mitigation efforts continue to go well as they have about $72.5 million of $80 million potential annualized cost savings in place as of today. Our perspective on our overall skilled nursing portfolio coverage run rate for the calendar 2012 year also remains unchanged, about 1.7 to 1.8x before management fees and 1.3 to 1.4x after management fees.", "At this point, to provide an update on our seniors housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA partnerships, our operating portfolio continues to perform well and remains ahead of budget through the second quarter of the year. The blended 87.9% occupancy rate across our 6 operating portfolios for the second quarter increased 60 basis points versus the prior quarter and is up 1.6% versus last year. In addition, same-store operating portfolio cash NOI for the second quarter increased a strong 7.4% versus the comparable quarter last year, driven by a 140-basis-point increase in same-store occupancy and a 3.7% increase in revenue per occupied unit. Through a combination of strong revenue growth and solid expense control, margins in our same-store portfolio expanded 50 basis points year-over-year.", "Moving now to the medical facilities portfolio. Our medical office building portfolio metrics came in slightly better than expectations during the quarter, due largely to the strong leasing efforts by our property management team. The overall occupancy here increased 20 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially to 93.6%, while retention was 83% for the quarter and 80.3% for the trailing 12 months. Same-store occupancy of 92.7% remains among the highest in the sector, while same-store cash NOI grew a solid 3.1% for the quarter. I would note that we have only 277,000 square feet or just 2.3% of the portfolio expiring over the remainder of this year, only 3.1 million square feet or 26% of the current portfolio expiring through the end of 2016. For 2012, our current expectation is that our overall MOB portfolio occupancy will improve slightly to the 94% range and have a tenant retention rate of approximately 80%.", "In regards to our hospital portfolio, cash flow payment coverage remains strong at 2.44x before and 2.09x after management fees. We again experienced strong 4% same-store cash NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the second quarter versus last year. Our life science portfolio also performed well in the quarter as the portfolio is 98% occupied and generated same-store cash NOI growth of 4.3%. We do expect to continue to reap the benefits during the second half of the year from lease renewals in the life science portfolio for approximately 20% of the overall portfolio, renewal rates that average 60% above current rates, which commence in July and August of this year.", "Turning now to financial results and guidance, we reported normalized second quarter FFO per share of $0.89 and normalized FAD per share of $0.79, both essentially flat versus last year. Our year-over-year growth was impacted by both dispositions of higher-yielding, nonstrategic assets over the last 12 months and the decision to prefund much of our investment activity announced year-to-date as we continue to dramatically enhance the quality of our assets and derisk the portfolio. Importantly, our recent success on the new investment front enabled a $0.03 increase in guidance today, as we currently project solid 4% to 6% normalized FFO per-share growth and 4% to 7% normalized FAD per-share growth for the full year.", "We recently declared the 165th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30 of $0.74 per share, representing a 3.5% increase over the same period last year. In terms of capital activity, the second quarter was a fairly quiet one after raising over $2 billion in aggregate through the beginning of April. We did issue 565,000 shares under our Dividend Reinvestment Program during the second quarter, generating $31 million in proceeds, and we assumed $127 million of secured debt at an average rate slightly above 5%. Our line of credit borrowing stood at $393 million as of June 30 or $188 million net of the $205 million in cash we had on the balance sheet. Subsequent to quarter end, we received an additional $249 million through funding our Canadian dollar-denominated term loan, where we'll pay interest of approximately 2.6%, and are in the process of repaying $168 million of convertible debt. So further adjusting for these 2 items, our balance sheet net of cash stands at only $107 million entering the second half of 2012.", "Our capital transactions year-to-date have allowed us to maintain solid credit metrics. At the end of June, our net debt to underappreciated book capitalization stood at 43.8%. Our trailing 12 months interest and fixed charge coverage remained solid at 3.2x and 2.5x, respectively, while net debt to adjusted EBITDA, as reported in our supplement, was 6.0x.", "Finally, I'll provide an update regarding our 2012 guidance and assumptions. And as a reminder, our earnings guidance for 2012 only includes the impact of investments in capital transactions completed year-to-date, the ongoing funding of our existing development pipeline and the $300 million of previously announced dispositions of primarily nonstrategic Medicaid-focused skilled nursing facilities. As I previously mentioned, we've increased our normalized FFO and FAD per-share guidance by $0.03 per share, due to the incremental investments completed through June, resulting in a new 2012 normalized FFO range of $3.53 to $3.63 per diluted share and a new normalized FAD range of $3.11 to $3.21 per diluted share.", "Operator, that, I believe, concludes our prepared remarks, and we'd like to open the line up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jorel Guilloty with Morgan Stanley.", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was wondering, given that SNF coverage ratios are one quarter in arrears, would it be possible for you to give us an indication of where coverage ratios are for the SNF portfolio and where the fixed charge ratios for the Genesis portfolio as of, I guess, the end of the second quarter?", "Scott A. Estes", "Jorel, it's Scott here. I'd say to answer your first question -- really both questions. Not a lot of change in our coverage perspective. The overall portfolio current run rate is about 1.7 to 1.8x before management fees and 1.3 to 1.4x after management fees. And our Genesis portfolio fixed charge coverage or at the [ph] company is really in line with what we've been saying and also in line with the portfolio of 1.3 to 1.4x.", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And it also seems that you, I guess, expect a significant acceleration in SNF acquisitions in the near term. Would that be a fair assessment?", "George L. Chapman", "I think we've been very consistent with our investments. We've made the point that over the last 10 quarters or so, we've averaged over $1 billion a quarter. And I don't think we expect that to continue forever, as a lot of large portfolios have come out, been taken out of the mix. But we have a very strong pipeline right now, and things are going quite well.", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And my last question is, is there any change on your forecast for same-store NOI for any of the asset classes since the 1Q call?", "Scott A. Estes", "Really, no, Jorel. I think that would put us in probably the mid-3% to 4% range for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Milam with Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "My first quick question, G&A was a little bit higher this quarter than I was expecting. I was just curious if that's a run rate going forward? And then also if there's anything we should be looking for regarding one of the executive resignations in the quarter.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, James. Actually, the second quarter G&A did include a little less than $2 million of severance costs. We actually probably could have considered backing that out for normalized purposes. We did not.  It's included in the number this quarter. And I think a fair run rate going forward is probably $23 million to $24 million as a result.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And then can you guys give us just a little bit more color on the MOB acquisitions, just in terms of where they are, who they're leased to, if they're multi-tenant or single-tenant leases? And then you gave some good color in terms of acquisition pricing, but these acquisitions were a little bit higher cap rate than your MOB acquisitions last quarter. So I guess I'm trying to kind of drive at the distinction there and then what your outlook is going forward.", "Scott A. Estes", "James, this is Scott. I'll comment on that. I think of the 7 medical office buildings acquisitions we've completed in the quarter, I know that 5 were multi-tenant buildings and 2 were single-tenant buildings. I think the vast majority of those came out of some existing relationships, so I think that's a factor. As you think about pricing, you got to go and just [ph] -- I would estimate pricing in medical office buildings now are probably right around 7%, most of the deals we're looking at with the larger pools or larger-square-foot buildings with more services outpatient would be potentially below that.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. Great. That helps. And then just my last quick one. Can you guys just remind me what the average rate is in the Chartwell portfolio?", "Scott A. Estes", "Rate meaning projected NOI yield?", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "More of a -- like a per-unit rent.", "Scott M. Brinker", "The monthly rental rate?", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Yes. Exactly. I'm just trying to kind of compare that to the rest of the portfolio, just to get a better -- an idea of how that stacks up.  I know it's obviously a different geography, et cetera.", "Scott M. Brinker", "This is Scott Brinker. It's really 2 different portfolios in Qu\u00e9bec, which is about 1/2 of the portfolio. The average rate is less than $2,000 a month, closer to $1,500, because they're closer to senior apartments with very little care. And the rest of the portfolio was primarily in Ontario. And the average monthly rent there is more like $3,000 a month.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Just in terms of your investment pipeline here.  Now you've got your relationship strategy.  Is this the pace that you're kind of comfortable with the remainder of the year? Do you see any reason why you could increase or decrease?  Are some of your operators finding more opportunities than expected or less than opportunities? Just a little comment on that, if you would.", "George L. Chapman", "We'd love to be able to do $1 billion a quarter every quarter. But these are sort of lumpy kinds of quarters, where you'll sometimes get a $500 million package or not. Right now, there are some pretty attractive packages out there that we're looking at. So it could theoretically exceed the average. But we don't count on it until we close. But we're surprised by the continuing strength of the investment pipeline.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then just a quick detail question. What kind of coverages are you getting on your triple-net investments that you made this quarter?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. The biggest one is Legend Senior Living, and that's in the 1.2x range, Jeff. And the others are around 1.1 to 1.2.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "From the first quarter call, I believe the same-store NOI guidance for the seniors housing operating portfolio was plus 5% to 6% for the year. So you've now been achieving above that year-to-date. So what is driving the ramp-down in growth for the second half of the year?", "Scott A. Estes", "Nic, it's Scott. I would actually say if at the margin anything since the previous quarter, our expectations for the operating portfolio full year NOI growth have probably ticked up about 1%. Everyone seems to be doing pretty well, generally running in line to a little bit ahead of budget. So it's really just the timing.  If I had to roughly  forecast the next couple of quarters, it's in the 5% to 6% range. So I don't think there's really anything specific. You're just looking at year-over-year comps and things of that nature as you look at the individual quarters.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then for the guidance, the $300 million disposition guidance, that already includes all the year-to-date activity?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And so then, as we think about to the FFO guidance range for the year, is there anything else that's driving the bottom end of the range other than -- is the range mostly sensitive to whether or not you get incremental dispositions done for the rest of the year?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. It's essentially due to that and the timing of the dispositions and as well as you do add a little bit of variability, arguably, with an operating portfolio as well.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just lastly, you did end of the quarter, which seems like the actual quarter activity based on the amount of investments you did, mostly funded with debt and some disposition proceeds. I mean, how are you thinking about your leverage ratio right now as you're going into the back half of the year, assuming you do not do any more dispositions for the year?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think we've been pretty consistent with just detailing our longer-term targets for balance sheet metrics. And I'll just reiterate those, I would say target of closer to 40% net debt to undepreciated book, mid-3x interest coverage, high-2x fixed charge coverage and somewhere in the 5 to 6x \"net debt to EBITDA\" area.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to get a little more insight into -- I mean, how have discussions changed, if at all, with your relationships, given the increased size and breadth of your portfolio? I mean, obviously, you have a front-row seat to all of the challenges that these tenants and health systems face, the operators, et cetera. And I know, George, you had mentioned in your opening remarks the opportunities for collaboration. Again, just want to -- given your front-row seat, just want to get a sense of how discussions have changed and the types of opportunities and challenges these tenants face and where you see the opportunities.", "Unknown Executive", "George is having -- it's a little choppy in our room here. He's essentially, I think, asking just why is the relationship strategy successful and kind of our prospects going forward.", "George L. Chapman", "Well, Philip, you've followed us for many, many years, and you've seen the closeness of our relationships over those years.  And I think that the relationship strategy becomes even more important in a time of massive change in terms of how healthcare is delivered and also when there is consolidation going on within the sector. I think everybody is sort of realizing that information systems, technology are extremely expensive but necessary, especially when we have ACOs coming and the need to break down the silos. So I think that we really benefited from the fact that we are immersed in healthcare and tend to foster collaboration, which gives a lot of our operators and health systems some comfort that we can add value. So I'd add also, in a consolidation mode, we are getting perhaps more deals than we ever have for that very reason. And frankly, we expect some of our operators to, over time, become larger companies, either through major acquisitions or through M&A. And I think that, to some degree, we have a seat at the table to try to drive not only the correct consolidation, the right companies coming together, perhaps, but also in terms of putting together the infrastructure necessary for what will be a much more complex time in health care.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And when you look at your existing portfolio, the tenants and the health systems, where are their needs the greatest in terms of infrastructure needs, obsolescence issues? I mean, where are you seeing their needs the greatest?", "George L. Chapman", "That's a very, very tough question. We have seen some top-notch health systems do very well in terms of improving their information systems and technology and, for that matter, infrastructure. But it is very, very uneven, even within the health systems. But when you come down to senior housing, these are companies that were somewhat smaller and have grown markedly. And have generally done a very good job with information systems, adding people, looking hard at themselves and performing, but there's still a long way to go. We need to introduce more really top-notch business people into this field to drive it to the performance levels that are necessary for us to really pound the table and say, hey, they're undervalued and so are we. And that includes all the health care REITs who invest in some of these companies. So I would say there is a need across the board for additional professional management in systems, but people are doing a pretty good job of getting there. We also thought about, actually, as one of our sort of undertakings for our senior housing RIDEA and key operators in senior housing whatever [ph] putting together alliances that would allow for some of these improvements to information systems and technology as we drive senior housing up in the estimation of The Street.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. As I look, I mean, there's a real transitional phase here for health care and certainly the health care REITs and trying to understand the different risk-reward profiles of these individual health care REIT portfolios is becoming certainly more and more important. And being able to shed some light on some of the differences in terms of the opportunities and the risk-reward profiles of your portfolio versus other health care REIT portfolios, I think, is only going to help all of us understand both the opportunities and challenges, et cetera.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A couple of things. First of all, George, you're talking about you may accelerate some non-core asset sales if you had the opportunity. Just was wondering how big of a pool you considered to be non-core? So if you could slice of x percent of it, how big would that be?", "George L. Chapman", "Right now, as a percentage, it is not very large. I mean, we have been, over the last 3 or 4 years, been selling some non-core smaller MOBs and those that are not closely affiliated with the systems, so we have substantially reduced any of those. In the skilled nursing area, frankly, they're all doing quite well, as I indicated in my opening remarks. But we do believe that, over time, it is probably the right thing to do to reduce the percentage of Medicaid-focused facilities that tend to be 25 years old or even older than that. So there could be another $200 million to $300 million, I suppose, of skilled nursing beyond the $300 million. If we had an opportunity to actually dispose of those, we would look hard at that. But I don't want to say much more than that. It's a pretty low number, probably $400 million, $500 million, that we could still, over time, dispose of.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And secondly, talking about the SNFs, can you give a little more color on the transaction where you bought, I think it was about $90 million of -- yes, that may be the right number, $90 million of the SNFs with Genesis?  I mean, can you talk about -- the pricing, I think, was close to a 9 cap.  Is that where you see pricing today? Are the terms similar to the initial batch you did, and are these add-on facilities for Genesis?", "George L. Chapman", "These were buildings that were affiliated with Genesis that they had taken over operations about a year or so prior. These were all in the Maryland, D.C. area and continued to enhance their portfolio there. So generally these were right in their footprint and high-quality assets affiliated with health systems.  They had been owned by health system down there historically. So these were real good add-ons to their portfolio.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. Mike, I'm just going to add to your question about the pricing. You're right. It was 8.9% approximate initial yield, and the underwritten coverages are in the roughly 1.4 to 1.5x range.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And that 8.9% or close to 9%, do you think that's a ballpark for what the market is today overall? Or was there something specific about this portfolio where this is -- that's the number for that portfolio?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think that was the number for that portfolio.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And last question. Scott, not much on the credit line right now, but where do you think the average balance is? Where is the right average balance if we're just thinking of any point in time for the credit line? I mean, is it in the middle of where you are today in the $2 billion max?", "Scott A. Estes", "We've always said the ideal, probably, utilization is somewhere in the -- on average, is roughly in the 30% to 35% area. And I think it's just we've been pretty consistent with that being a rough target utilization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you just share some specifics on disposition timing in the second half? And have you closed on any so far in the third quarter?", "Scott A. Estes", "Todd, it's Scott. Probably, the majority of those would be -- in fairly short order, call it the middle of third quarter for you guys for modeling purposes on average.  I don't think any may have closed -- have not closed yet. So they haven't closed yet, but you could assume modeling-wise that they could close very near to now.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just switching gears. How do you feel about how your concentration looks with Genesis?  Should they be presented with more acquisition opportunities like Sun, would you add to Genesis at this point? How does kind of your 16% concentration feel?", "George L. Chapman", "We're very, very pleased with how the team has performed over at Genesis. We're very, very supportive of the M&A with Sun Healthcare. There are some great opportunities, especially with the 75% overlap, in terms of their facilities, the chance to put hospice and rehab together. But our deal with George is that we will support him, continue to support him. And we're also going to be very proactively improving the quality mix so that on one hand, George can take some of our facilities, perhaps to HUD, to refinance them and own some of his properties and have a lower rate. We, on the other hand, will replace those assets that would probably be somewhat more Medicaid-oriented with a standalone post-acute facility so that we will be improving our portfolio faster than even George's portfolio as a whole. But maintaining somewhere around that $2.5 billion to $3 billion level of investment with George.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just looking at the MOB space. Can you just share what the competition was like for these 7 MOBs you acquired in the quarter?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, the competition is very, very strong out there for any MOB. So a lot of the investments we make are relating to certain of our developer connections and also related to health systems that we have a relationship with or our developer partners have a relationship with. So you have to be out there every day, and it's sort of pricey.  And MOBs continue to be a very much favored part of the health care investing situation.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just lastly, Scott, did you give a current line of credit balance? I wasn't sure if the figure you gave was net of cash.", "Scott A. Estes", "It would be net of cash. The details in the prepared remarks got us to a run rate essentially going into the second half of the year of a little over $100 million.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen & Company.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to follow on a few questions that you've already received that had to do with cap rates on MOBs and then the cap rate on SNFs. And as we look at the acquisition activity over the last several quarters, what was striking this quarter is that the average cap rate on the invested capital, I think, worked out to be about 7.7%. Now I know the SNF cap rate was unusually high here, but cap rates for the other 3 asset classes were also higher on a consecutive quarter basis.  And I wonder if you could just touch on the trend generally in terms of cap rates for the different asset classes.  George, you mentioned that the competition for MOB assets remains pretty strong, a lot of parties are interested. But the cap rates here were 100 basis points higher than Q1, 50 basis points higher than the fourth quarter. Is there something about these assets?  Or is there, in fact -- have you seen cap rates generally tick up across the asset classes in reaction to some other factor?", "George L. Chapman", "No. I don't think there's any clear indication that cap rates are moving up. Quite the contrary.  In my opening remarks, Jim, I mentioned that, if anything, cap rates for the highest-end senior housing assets may be compressing, okay. And Scott mentioned for MOBs that may be 7% cap rate, but you're going to see some great MOBs that are lower than that. It can be 6.25% to 6.50%. And I don't think you should take anything away. The specifics about the assets, we generally continue to invest in very high-end properties, but sometimes you get a little luckier with your initial cap rates than others. And I think it was just -- you shouldn't read into it as any kind of trend at all.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So we have for our modeling purposes, we use an overall average of 7% for acquisitions on a full year basis, and that's still a good number to go with.", "George L. Chapman", "Yes. I think so. I mean, with our focus on high-end MOBs and senior housing, it's a good number, still.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And second question for me, I'm just curious about this. On the senior housing and the operating assets, you've had 4 quarters of exceptional same-property NOI growth. And I just wonder if, as you think about that going forward, when should we expect that to moderate? And on a longer-term basis, presumably this is a number that would just not be sustainable. So should we be looking toward -- what kind of factor should we be looking toward to see that moderating? Would it be the occupancy rate in the portfolio or what?", "Scott A. Estes", "James, this is Scott Estes. I think maybe, answer your question a couple of ways, one perspective, I think, that's helpful for everybody is to look at the difference between -- we do get some benefit from some assets in the RIDEA portfolio that are in fill-up. And if you look at the 7.4% quarter-over-quarter growth here in the second quarter, if you just look at the stable component of that, it would've been up about 5.7%. So you're still seeing some benefit from some assets that are in fill-up.  It's not a lot. We've been pretty consistent with our longer-term growth expectation of 4% to 5% for a lot of these assets. And I think, in part, it is due to some component of fill-up aiding that. But the reality is, I think, the portfolio really had only about 90% occupancy. Still has a reasonable way to go, and the fill-up assets still have a reasonable way to go. So I would hope it could actually continue for some time.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Of course, many of us are used to following the apartment sector as well. We're very familiar with those metrics and how they play out over the course of the cycle, and we've seen occupancy rates typically reach peak levels at the 95%, 96% level. Are you suggesting that, that is also a good metric for the operating senior housing portfolio? Is that what you aspire to?", "Scott A. Estes", "I didn't hear that.  What the occupancy expectation is?", "Charles J. Herman", "Probably occupancy expectation should be in the low- to mid-90% upon stabilization. And what you're also seeing in the marketplace today is some enhanced acuity. So unlike the apartment sector, where there isn't as much ancillary income that can provide some additional services in senior housing, which also drives rate and gets you additional margin.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. That's what I was looking at, Jim.  Sorry I missed the outset of the question, but as we do compare and we think about the aggregate opportunity there, I think Chuck is exactly right. You have at least 3 or 4 of the operators in our RIDEA portfolio have more of an AL/dementia mix. And you think about it, the average length of stay in a lot of these buildings are really only 1.5 to 2 years. And when we look at the components of our revenue per occupied unit growth, we really do get a benefit from the service and care revenue component.  As services are added and acuity increases within a pretty short length of stay, where you may get a negative 3% rate increase, you're also adding a pretty significant component of healthcare services at a higher price. It's a pretty different dynamic that I think is a big factor why health care is both more consistent and can actually generate pretty high growth.", "James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "But actually, in terms of the operating margin, it still is significantly less than, of course, multifamily. I guess, because your fixed cost number is so much higher. But are you suggesting that the significant operating margin expansion, as you move toward that 95% theoretically full occupancy number?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think there is. I mean, I think, when you look at the number for the quarter, I think it's about 32.5%. And that is obviously a blend of IL/AL within our aggregate RIDEA portfolio. The guidance we've always said, the more IL-focused portfolio had margins in the, what, better companies, mid-40s?", "Charles J. Herman", "Mid-40s to high 40s. And assisted living typically ranges from 30% to 35% operating margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Not a whole lot left here. A question on the Legend transaction. Do I understand that you have an exclusive agreement to do any kind of new development or acquisitions with Legend?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, we have future rights to partner with Tim to continue acquisitions and development in these key markets.  He's got scale in the Midwest as well as in Florida, has been successful over the years, and we would expect to grow in both markets with him.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then the Genesis transaction, if I understand it right, those were properties that were previously -- were they managed by Genesis or owned by Genesis?", "Scott M. Brinker", "They were owned by an affiliate of Genesis.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it's just changing the lease owners through the real estate ownership.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Correct.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then when I look at your development pipeline, it seems to be kind of winding down. Is that the right way to look at your view of the development pipeline at this point?", "George L. Chapman", "It is very low relative to some of our other percentages. We want to maintain it at low levels, like, say, 5% max, if we can. But I think it's a little lower than normal right now. I mean, we really have to look at developing some of the state-of-the-art MOBs, which are really almost medical facilities today, with outpatient surgeries and all kinds of testing, et cetera. And you also have to think about expanding the footprint of some of our high-end senior housing folks. So I think we'll always have a certain amount of development. I think the 5% number, as pretty much the usual cap, is still going to be applicable. But while senior housing's changing, and as you well know, Rob, the medical facilities area is changing even more, with a strong commitment to outpatient types of services and the need to put those services in a much more appealing environment than, say, a older, larger, urban hospital. So we're going to be in the game but always keeping some sort of reasonable cap on how much development we do.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then turning to one question, since you raised the topic of medical office buildings. You've had a nice increase in occupancy.  So have some of your peers. And not to take anything away from the efforts of your sales team to lease on new space, but based on some of your prior comments, can we also surmise that there might be a demand component that's helping drive occupancy?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I mean, it's clear that health systems right now are looking hard at putting up state-of-the-art MOBs, especially as they are employing more and more doctors because of some of the issues surrounding reimbursement and some of the issues the docs are facing, too, as separate from the hospitals. So I think there is, but it's -- on the other hand, I think there's so much uncertainty out there that it's been somewhat sporadic in terms of MOB development. So I think that things like the doc fix [ph], waiting for the Supreme Court, there's uncertainty in this space. So we do think there is a demand component, but there is still uncertainty that is weighing against a lot of development at this point.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "But that uncertainty, then, would weigh in favor of occupancy at existing assets?", "George L. Chapman", "Yes. It helps quite a bit, I think.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "My question has more to do along the lines of acquisitions, specifically the appetite you would have to do debt investments rather than buying assets outright and also appetite to do more internationally, whether within Canada or maybe doing something in the U.K.", "George L. Chapman", "Well, you know you're referring to an analogous kind of investment as Jay made over in the U.K. with Four Seasons. We think that's a good investment for him. We probably are a little more reluctant to do mezz or debt investments, but every opportunity that one of our colleagues gets we've probably already taken a look at it as well. And we would be open to it. We wouldn't be that enthusiastic about those kind of investments. In terms of the U.K., I mean, we were there 15 years ago, and a number of us around this table spent a lot of time there. We think we know the U.K. markets well. We have a lot of friends over there still who are doing very high-end private-pay senior housing. So would we be open to it if we had a good opportunity and had a platform that could be expanded so that it would be worth our while.  Yes, we would look at that.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Jana Galan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Scott, I was hoping if you could clarify the 3% guidance increase. Is that solely on acquisition activity or is there some benefit from the preferred and convertible redemptions or your RIDEA investments being ahead of budget?", "Scott A. Estes", "At the end of the day, the increase is really attributable to the increase in acquisitions beyond what we had in our previous guidance. G&A was a little bit higher as well, and we did assume a little bit of secured debt that was also not in our previous guidance. So the net effect would be an approximate $0.03 increase.", "Jana Galan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And then looking at the 2013 lease maturities, there's about, I think, 5% of triple-net senior housing revenues expiring. I was just curious if renewal discussions have begun and if there's any interest in potentially converting those to operating leases.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. There's actually a unique situation in both our 2013 and '14 maturities. The '13 one is actually our Brandywine lease, and that was just the nature of that initial lease term, it's initially just a 3-year lease.  And the 2014 is Chelsea. So we have every expectation to expand those at the time that they come up, if not before. So that was really just a function of the initial structure that was put in place.", "George L. Chapman", "And there is the expectation, especially with the Brandywine lease, that we may be in a position at some point to convert that to an -- operating lease into a RIDEA structure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow up on Tayo's question. George, I think you said in your comments that you would like to grow your portfolio perhaps more in Canada. Can you just talk about how you'd potentially go about that? Would it be through the Chartwell venture? Are you looking at any additional portfolios, and how big could Canada get in your portfolio?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, of course, we're looking to expand our relationship with Chartwell. They're doing a very good job. It's a very good relationship. But we would look at other assets as well in Canada. What's difficult about Canada is that it's so much like the U.S. about 15 years ago. There are just very few large operators. So it's going to be very interesting to see how the Canadian market evolves. But I would imagine that there is going to be ongoing consolidation there as well. And we're just very active and looking out there, and we'll do things through Chartwell and look at other opportunities as well.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Are there any big portfolios on the market today up there?", "George L. Chapman", "We're not going to comment on what may be available. Everybody in Canada and the U.S. is looking at a very fast-moving marketplace, and we're going to be up there and we're going to be down here looking at any kind of opportunities that may come on the market.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And my second question is just on Genesis. Do you still expect the Sun acquisition to have a positive impact on Genesis corporate credit?", "George L. Chapman", "We do. George and Mike and his team are going to have to work with Bill Matthias' folks and really put their mark on the combined hole. So imagine that the first 6 to 12 months are going to be for George to approve up the merger. But we have every expectation with the combined platform, again, involving hospice, rehab and other types of activities as well as the [indiscernible] to be very, very favorable for George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Last question. Regarding independent and assisted living. When you look at your, let's say your operating portfolio, can you talk about some of the trends you're seeing there in terms of traffic, demand, et cetera? Just the differences there in your portfolio.", "Charles J. Herman", "Could you repeat that? Was that a question about traffic and demand at the operating side?", "Scott A. Estes", "Independent living versus assisted living.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I'm sorry, my phone is may be not too good here. But just wanting to get some idea of the traffic at assisted and independent living, the differences. Are you seeing a pickup in either? Again, assisted, more need-driven; independent, more want-driven. Are you seeing a little more pickup, I guess, on the independent living side? Or is that about the same?  Or just looking at the trend.", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes. I think it's generally about the same as it has been, maybe a little bit of a pickup but nothing significant.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Chapman, are there any other closing remarks?", "George L.

My name is Brooke and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations and General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at www.hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may also be accessed through the company's website.", "Certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that it's projected results will be obtained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release, and from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to George Chapman, Chairman, CEO and President of Health Care REIT. George?", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks very much, Jeff. Our business model continues to hit on all cylinders. We completed $2.9 billion of investments today, including $1 billion in the third quarter. And since the beginning of 2011, we have made $8.9 billion of investments through the third quarter. And pro forma for the announced investments, including Sunrise in early 2013, the investments during the last year will total approximately $12 billion.", "The strength of our relationship investing program is also clearly demonstrated by the investments during the last 12 months as approximately $2.6 billion or 64% of the $4.1 billion of investments over that period came from existing relationships.", "We announced the agreement to purchase Sunrise in August of 2012. There were few opportunities, if any, to acquire a company of this scale and quality. The acquisition of Sunrise is a great fit for HCN. It provides us with an exceptional portfolio in the United States, the U.K. and Canada at an attractive yield with strong accretion.  There are meaningful growth opportunities, including both long-term NOI growth and a pipeline of exceptional properties. Moreover, Sunrise has a national platform with a widely recognized brand, which positions it as a vehicle for a future consolidation of a highly-fragmented industry.  Scott Brinker, in his remarks, will provide a detailed update on our Sunrise progress. Let me say this generally. We've accelerated the joint venture buyouts so that by the middle of 2013, we expect to own 100% interest in 115 Sunrise communities, and a minority interest in 10 communities for a total investment of $4.3 billion. Moreover, the overall cap rate will be approximately 6.5%, making the transaction very accretive to us.", "We also previously announced our agreement to sell the Sunrise management company to a group led by KKR and Beecken Petty, with HCN retaining a 20% interest. Our partnership and Sunrise teams have been working hard at organization and integration and expect to hit the ground running when we close the transaction in early 2013.", "I wanted to take a moment to thank Scott Brinker, Chuck Herman and our team. Mark Ordan and the team at Sunrise, as well as our management company partners for putting us in a position to produce terrific value for all parties and contribute to the continuous improvement of the seniors housing sector generally.", "Our existing portfolio continues to perform very well with an aggregate NOI growth of 3.6%, driven by 7% NOI growth in our RIDEA portfolio. In fact, our average same store NOI growth over the last 6 quarters was 4.2% for the entire portfolio and 8.9% for the RIDEA portfolio. We believe that the ongoing repeat business from our RIDEA partners, together with a strong NOI growth on these investments, demonstrates the success of the RIDEA program. And the strength of our existing portfolio and predictable pipeline, of course, allowed our Board of Directors to increase our 2013 dividend payment by 3.4% to $3.06 per share.", "Our senior housing portfolio quality continues to improve. After we close the entire $4.3 billion Sunrise portfolio by midyear 2013, we believe the private pay percentage in our portfolio will approach 85%, the percentage of the total portfolio in the East and West Coast markets and the top 31 MSA should move to 80%, while our RIDEA portfolio will approach 95% in these affluent, high-barrier to entry markets. And at that point as well, our senior housing portfolio is -- a portion of our portfolio should be approaching 2/3.", "In the senior housing and care space, we regularly coordinate best practices sessions among our key operators. We focus on providing the best care for residents. And though -- even beyond those formal sessions, many of our key operators have developed deeper, personal and professional relationships that allowed them to discuss ways to improve care and service.", "We've also driven better results through joint programs such as our group property and casualty insurance program. This resulted in average savings of 18% when cost for such insurance were going up by 5% to 10% otherwise. We're now working on a joint purchasing program. And we're beginning to explore ways to facilitate meaningful IT improvements to make normal operations more efficient and effective, and to ultimately allow interaction between these operators and health systems and service providers with whom they work.", "Let me now turn to the medical facility sector. And we continue to believe that there are significant investment opportunities in the MOB arena. Today, approximately 60% of the acute care services are being provided in outpatient setting, and many of them  where these services are offered, are located close to the customer, in suburban areas that are experiencing the greatest population growth. To provide convenient one-stop venue, MOBs are combining a variety of complementary services, including surgery centers, full diagnostic services and fitness and wellness. Today, we are investing in MOBs that range from 50,000 to 300,000 square feet and these facilities, which some now refer to as hospitals without beds, are becoming the focal point of healthcare delivery.", "Our average MOB size is now approximately 65,000 square feet and due to the superb work of our property management team, our occupancy is a sector leading 94% and our annual retention rate is above 80%.", "With respect to portfolio management, we have a scalable asset management system that is considered to be at the top of the sector. We have added highly-qualified and experienced personnel in key areas to help us effectively manage the substantial increase in investment volumes. Moreover, we have put together multidisciplinary teams for all of our RIDEA investments and for large triple-net relationships such as Genesis, Brandywine and Senior Lifestyle.  As active managers, we enhance portfolio quality by investing in high-quality properties and also by disposing of noncore assets. This portfolio rationalization program has helped us to create a sector leading portfolio. Year-to-date, we have disposed of $257 million of assets. We have now increased our overall disposition guidance to $700 million, of which over $500 million are nonstrategic skilled nursing facilities and much of the balance includes smaller medical office buildings.", "While we experienced some dilution in disposing of the SNFs, the skilled nursing facilities, we strongly believe that the improvement to our portfolio quality far outweighs any near-term costs. We expect our skilled nursing facilities to represent less than 15% of the portfolio by the middle of next year when we close the balance of the Sunrise investment.", "At that point, we will have essentially 5 skilled nursing operators led by Genesis that we believe are best positioned for providing post-acute care.", "Our relationship investment program has produced consistent, resilient external and internal growth. As we may be finally approaching a period of relative normalcy, we will use this period to continue to improve healthcare delivery, facilitate desirable consolidations and drive earnings growth. A high percentage of our ongoing investments will be with our existing partners and this gives us great confidence in our ability to generate annual investment volumes in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range without having to compete for transactions that do not meet our investment criteria.  We have managed a remarkable transformation of the portfolio during the last several years and we will emerge with the highest quality portfolio, most diversified by operator investment type with the least exposure to government reimbursement among our peers and a private pay approaching 85% of the portfolio. We believe this should drive higher relative multiples and strong returns to our shareholders.", "I'd just like to take a moment now before handing it over to the Scotts to talk about super storm Sandy. Our communities weathered the storm very well. We've experienced some damage, but the issue is manageable and we are actively assisting our partners as necessary. We are fortunate. The employees of our operating partners have done an absolutely heroic job of serving the customers. However, some of them have experienced extraordinary loss. We believe great partners are there at the most difficult of times, and so in that spirit, in the spirit of our relationship philosophy and our belief in doing the right thing, HCN and our employees have created a storm relief fund to assist affected employees.", "Now, I'll turn to Scott Brinker to discuss Sunrise and certain other portfolio matters. Scott?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Thank you, George. Execution on the Sunrise acquisition is exceeding our expectations. In September, we signed an agreement to sell the management company to a partnership led by KKR and Beecken Petty for $130 million, which is at the high end of our underwriting with HCN retaining a 20% ownership interest. As part of the agreement, we restructured the management agreements on the existing and future wholly-owned communities in a way that creates significant value for HCN shareholders and aligns the interest of HCN in the Sunrise management company.", "Shortly thereafter, we pre-funded the acquisition by issuing $1.7 billion of equity, in a price that locks in a positive return on investment. When we announced the acquisition of Sunrise in August, the portfolio included 20 wholly-owned communities and a minority interest in 105 communities. At that time, we described our intention and desire to buy out as many of the joint venture partners as possible so that we could control the assets, including decisions regarding CapEx, leverage and management fees. As of the closing date, which we will -- which we expect will occur in early 2013, we will own a 100% interest in at least 58 of the communities and a minority interest in the remainder of the 125 communities. And by July 2013, we expect to wholly own 115 of the 125 communities.  At that point, our investment in this best-in-class portfolio will be $4.3 billion.", "The joint venture buyouts, combined with the new management agreements, will improve our cap rate to approximately 6.5% which is roughly 6.1% yield after CapEx. We believe such a return is extremely attractive on a risk adjusted basis and compares favorably to other large senior housing transactions. This is particularly true, given the growth prospects of this portfolio driven by the quality of the buildings, locations and operating partner. For example, the average building age is 8 years. 90% of the buildings are Sunrise match in prototypes, the median housing in the portfolio is 2x the national median and the monthly rental rate is 2x the industry average.", "We don't place a large emphasis on FFO or FAD accretion in our investment process because these measures did not account for risks. Nonetheless, we are pleased to report that we expect the Sunrise acquisition to be accretive to FFO and FAD per share in 2013 and thereafter. More important, the acquisition has great strategic value, given the unique quality and geography of the portfolio, both of which aligned perfectly with our existing portfolio.", "We received a number of requests to describe our thought process regarding the RIDEA structure versus triple-net leases, so I'd like to share our perspective. There are 3 key points. First, we value returns on a cash basis, that is we fully account for CapEx. We underwrite a full CapEx reserve into every investment, whether it is a RIDEA or a triple-net lease because the structural protection the triple-net lease is illusory if the tenant does not have enough cash flow to adequately reinvest in the buildings. Second, when assessing risk, we do not focus on small, short-term quarterly fluctuations in NOI. Rather, we focus on long-term growth in NOI and asset value which, in our experience, is driven by the quality of the building, location and operating partner.", "Accordingly, we believe that we have more than offset any increase in structural risk under RIDEA with a reduction in the risk of the asset itself. Given that our RIDEA portfolio is comprised of Class A buildings in densely populated affluent markets, operated by the industry's premier management companies.", "The final point is that in some cases the decision is not whether to structure the acquisition as RIDEA or a triple-net lease, but whether to invest or not invest, because certain operators are unwilling to be the tenant under triple-net lease. Said another way, we now have the flexibility to acquire best-in-class portfolios that were difficult, if not impossible, to acquire prior to 2008 when RIDEA was enacted The timing of the legislation and our decision to take advantage of it was favorable to our shareholders.", "We acquired our existing RIDEA portfolio, which is comprised of Class A portfolios operated by leading management companies during a period when private equity and pension fund owners needed to sell and the operating fundamentals of the senior housing industry were at a cyclical low due to the economy. The result has been substantial growth in asset value since the time of our acquisition, due primarily to superior NOI growth.", "The performance of our RIDEA portfolio, coupled with follow-on investments with our operating partners is evidence that integration has been successful.", "Equally important, we continue to view triple-net leases as an attractive investment structure. In the past 24 months, we've closed $2.8 billion of senior housing triple-net leases with a 7.3% average initial yield and 3% average annual escalators. Such returns create substantial value for our shareholders. More than 1/3 of these triple-net leases give us the option to reset the rent-to-market every 3 to 5 years, so there's an opportunity to capture growth beyond our typical rent escalators.", "I'll close my commenting that irrespective of investment structure, the common theme in our investment is high-quality buildings, locations and operating partners. These are scarce commodities and we therefore expect our shareholders to prosper over the long-term from our unique concentration of such high-quality assets and partners.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Scott Estes to discuss our operating results and balance sheet.", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone. As George and Scott discussed, we're very excited about our platform, our relationship and growth prospects heading into 2013. The third quarter was another very active one for our team here at Health Care REIT and we completed another $1 billion of growth investments. We announced our Sunrise Senior Living transaction and then accelerated the anticipated pace of JV buyouts, including announcing the planned sale of the management company. We've raised capital through 2 successful equity offerings to preemptively fund our recent investments, lowering leverage by nearly 7 full percentage points during the quarter. We completed $133 million of dispositions of nonstrategic assets. And during this remarkable period, we have continued to move expeditiously to strengthen and diversify our portfolio, to reduce our exposure to government reimbursement and to position ourselves to benefit from an increasing percentage of future investment opportunities from existing relationship partners.", "Turning first to our investments. We maintained a very solid investment pace during the third quarter, completing growth investments of nearly $1 billion in the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date. As George discussed, our relationship investment program is driving consistent portfolio growth, enabling us to purchase high-quality assets at attractive returns for our shareholders. In terms of our third quarter investments, we completed $880 million of acquisitions at a blended initial yield that averaged 7.1%.", "Our major highlights included, first, 2 triple net seniors housing portfolios consisting of 19 facilities for $459 million operated by Senior Lifestyle, one of the largest private operators in the country, which makes them the 6th largest operator in our portfolio. Second, we acquired the first 5 Sunrise Senior Living operating properties located in the United Kingdom for $244 million. And Third, we completed $56 million of medical office building investments.", "In terms of third quarter dispositions, we sold $133 million, generating gains of $13 million, which consisted primarily of a nonstrategic 9 facility skilled nursing portfolio and an 8 facility portfolio of smaller, older, unaffiliated medical office buildings. We also provided a future  investment update as it relates specifically to the Sunrise transaction, as well as to what was originally announced as a $925 million third quarter acquisition expectation.", "As you can see in our earnings release in the table provided, we have $2.9 billion in pending Sunrise investments anticipated to occur through the first quarter of 2013, plus an additional $291 million of other pending acquisitions expected in the fourth quarter.", "Turning next to portfolio performance. In our seniors housing triple-net lease portfolio payment coverage stands at a solid 1.33x before management fees and 1.15x after management fees. A stable occupancy of 88.7% as of June 30, increased by 50 basis points sequentially and is up 100 basis points versus the prior year, consistent with recent industry trends supporting higher occupancies.", "The stability of our seniors housing triple-net portfolio was again demonstrated through a third quarter increase in same store cash NOI of 2.8% year-over-year.", "Our skilled nursing portfolio payment coverage currently stands at 1.84x before management fees and 1.4x after management fees for the trailing 12 months ended June 30. Our stable skilled nursing occupancy declined slightly as often occurs during the second quarter to 87.3%. However, same-store cash NOI remains strong, increasing 3.3% in the third quarter versus the prior year.", "Our coverage declined sequentially due to another quarter of the lower Medicare rates implemented in October of 2011, moving into trailing 12-month data.", "And we expect that our overall coverage after management fees will stabilize at slightly above 1.3x next quarter when we report the trailing 12 months ended September 30 of 2012.", "We also recently did some work to analyze the dispersion of the rent coverage levels within our skilled nursing portfolio, and believe that once we complete our disposition efforts, our entire post-acute skilled nursing portfolio will consist of 5 operators that all cover rent after management fees by greater than 1.2x as of the 3 months ended June 30, 2012.", "Our [indiscernible], we continue to expect fixed charge coverage levels to range between 1.3x and 1.4x over the longer term after initially stabilizing at about 1.3x for the 12 months ended September 2012. Routine CapEx spending in our Genesis portfolio is currently running at a rate of approximately $1,200 per bed per year thus far in calendar 2012, with their overall CapEx approximating $2,000 per bed when including strategic CapEx, which is running at about $800 per bed per year this year.", "Finally, the Genesis Sun Healthcare merger remains on track to close in December of 2012. We're excited about the opportunities for the combined organization to obtain both operating and cost synergies and to drive a higher skilled mix over the longer-term.", "At this point, I'll provide an update on our seniors housing operating portfolio, which is comprised of our RIDEA investments. Our operating portfolio continues to perform well and remains ahead of budget through the third quarter. The blended 88.9% occupancy rate across our 7 operating portfolios for the third quarter increased 100 basis points versus the prior quarter, and is up 2.3% versus last year.", "Same-store operating portfolio cash NOI for the third quarter, again, increased a strong 7% versus the comparable quarter last year, driven by a 200-basis point increase in same-store occupancy and the 3.4% increase in revenue per occupied unit.", "Through a combination of strong revenue growth and solid expense control, margins in our same-store portfolio expanded 30 basis points year-over-year.", "And moving now to the medical facilities portfolio. Our medical office building portfolio continued to perform well during the quarter. Its overall occupancy increased 80 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially to 93.9%. Our tenant retention was a strong 90% for the quarter and 82% for the trailing 12 months. As a result of recent acquisitions and dispositions, now 92% of our MOB portfolio investment balance is affiliated with a health system.", "Our same-store occupancy increased 40 basis points sequentially to 92.9% while same-store cash NOI grew a solid 1.5% for the quarter. We continue to have very little anticipated rollover in our MOB portfolio with only 5% to 6% of the current portfolio leases expiring per year through the end of 2016. We believe we'll end the year with overall MOB portfolio occupancy in the 94% range and have a tenant retention rate of approximately 80%.", "In regards to our hospital portfolio, our cash flow payment coverage remains strong at 2.35x before and 2x after management fees. We also experienced solid 2.2% same-store cash NOI growth in our hospital portfolio during the third quarter versus last year.", "Our Life Science portfolio also performed well in the quarter and remained slightly ahead of budget year-to-date through September. The portfolio remained 98% occupied and generated same-store cash NOI growth of 3.6%. We're beginning to see the benefit of several lease renewals which occurred in July and August at rates significantly above previous levels.", "Turning now to financial results and guidance. We reported normalized third quarter FFO per share of $0.91 and normalized bed per share of $0.82, up 2% and 4%, respectively. Our year-over-year growth was impacted by both dispositions of higher-yielding, nonstrategic assets over the last 12 months and the decision to prefund much of our investment activity announced year-to-date. And we recently declared the 166th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30 of $0.74 per share, representing a 3.5% increase over the same period last year.", "In addition, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our 2013 quarterly dividend rate to $0.765 per share, or $3.06 annually beginning with the February 2013 dividend payment. As George mentioned, the new 2013 dividend payment rate represents a 3.4% increase over dividends to be paid in 2012.", "The third quarter G&A expense of $23.7 million was in line with our expectations. After the fourth quarter, we're expecting a similar level of G&A of approximately $24 million.", "Our capital expenditures came in slightly lower than expectations during the third quarter at $9.3 million, largely due to the timing of funding in our MOB and operating portfolios. As a result, we are anticipating slightly higher CapEx during the fourth quarter of approximately $14 million to $15 million.", "Next, I'll take just a minute to explain several of the extraordinary items on the income statement that are primarily a result of recent acquisitions and the decision to accelerate our dispositions and portfolio repositioning efforts heading into the end of the year.", "First, we had $8.3 million of transaction costs that were associated with our significant level of third quarter acquisitions. Next, we made the decision to write off $27 million in loans. This is primarily associated with an entrance fee facility that was transitioned to a new operator a couple of years ago and repositioned as a rental model. As occupancy trends have improved more recently, we're evaluating restructuring the current relationship which requires a current update of the collateral analysis for our loan. We believe we're most likely to restructure this relationship at the RIDEA investment which would allow us to capture more of the upside, but a possible sale is also being analyzed where we'd be less likely to recapture the value of the loan. As a result of our analysis, we determined to write off the loan at this time.", "Finally, we took a $7 million impairment associated with 5 smaller skilled nursing facilities in Connecticut based on the estimated value we expect to receive when we sell them over the next 6 to 12 months.", "Now, in terms of capital activity, the third quarter was definitely a busy one for us. In August, we raised slightly over $800 million of equity, largely defined an anticipated $925 million third quarter acquisition pipeline. Then in late September, we were successful in raising an additional $1.7 billion largely to prefund the cash portion of our Sunrise Senior Living acquisition.", "In addition, we issued 492,000 shares under our Dividend Reinvestment Program, generating $29 million in proceeds. And we also repaid $77 million of our 8% senior notes in the quarter. We repaid $168 million of 4 3/4% convertible debt, and completed our $250 million Canadian-denominated term loan.", "We sit in an excellent liquidity position in light of our pending transactions. As you can see on the very bottom right corner of the chart provided on Page 3 of our earnings release, it will require approximately $1.6 billion to fund the remaining cash component of our announced deals that have yet to close.", "We currently have more than adequate liquidity in place to fund this with $1.4 billion in cash currently on our balance sheet, up to $443 million in expected fourth quarter dispositions and our entire $2 billion line of credit fully available.", "Our capital transactions year-to-date not only put us in an excellent liquidity position, but they significantly improved our credit metrics. At the end of September, debt to underappreciated book capitalization stood at 37.9%, an improvement of nearly 7% during the quarter, which I would point out, excludes any benefit from the $1.4 billion in cash on the balance sheet.", "Our trailing 12-month interest and fixed charge coverage remains solid at 3.1x and 2.4x, respectively while net debt to adjusted EBITDA as reported in our supplement improved to 4.7x.", "Importantly, although there are still several moving parts related to closing the remainder of our announced transactions, we will continue to manage our balance sheet in a way that is consistent with our long-term leverage and credit metric targets.", "Last, I'll provide an update regarding our 2012 guidance and assumptions. As a reminder, our earnings guidance for 2012 includes the impact of, first, investments in capital transactions that are pending or completed year-to-date; second, the going funding of our existing development pipeline; and third, up to $700 million of anticipated dispositions of primarily nonstrategic skilled nursing facilities.", "As we detailed in the release, the midpoint of our earnings guidance for both normalized FFO and FAD would've increased by $0.04 per share today, if not for our decision to prefund the Sunrise transactions through a large $1.7 billion equity deal, which impacted our 2012 guidance by $0.11.", "As a result, normalized FFO has been updated and narrowed to a range of $3.49 to $3.53 per share, and normalized FAD has been updated to range of $3.07 to $3.11 per share.", "I think most importantly, we believe we're  in a great position entering 2013 having prefunded our Sunrise transaction as we're accelerating our disposition efforts, and can say that we're all very excited about our platform, portfolio and growth prospects heading into next year.", "Operator, that does conclude my prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the line for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from James Milam Sandler O'Neill.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I'm sorry. Can you just go over the dispositions for me one more time? You guys expect about $440 million this year and that brings you up to 700 -- or I'm sorry, this -- before year-end, then that brings you up to $700 million for the year. And then just as you go through that, can you just let us know if there's any debt associated with those? And then, if there's anything market-related that had you accelerate the dispositions, or if it's just that you guys feel like you're in a position where you can accelerate the portfolio repositioning on your own timing, regardless of what's going on externally?", "Scott A. Estes", "Sure James, this is Scott. The first part of your question, the answer is there have been about $250 million of dispositions year-to-date. And $450 million implied pending in the fourth quarter, about $500 million in aggregate of the $700 million total this year are skilled nursing facilities. And of the remaining $450 million, there is about $80 million in debt on those properties. The bottom line is, it's actually a great time for us to evaluate the portfolio. It's a good environment for us to sell. We're finding that operators are looking at buying back properties and it's really a pretty reasonably attractive financing market. They can take it to HUD, bridge to HUD at rates in the 3% to 3.5% range right now. So that's helping our decision to accelerate some of our portfolio repositioning efforts.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And is that impacting pricing a little bit as well? So are --  yields that you're selling now coming down a little bit?", "Scott A. Estes", "Pricing has been pretty reasonable. I don't think it's really changed too much. Usually, yields on sales, we're often fortunate enough in those with to book a gain. If you look at the cash we received, we're probably in the, I guess you can say, low to mid-9s. I think inclusive of gains.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And then my second question is you guys look out at the markets year end I know you've selected markets that you believe have high barriers to entry and it's harder for new construction. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing anybody looking to build or any competition for builders? Just if you could give us color on the construction environment, that will be great.", "Charles J. Herman", "Sure. This is Chuck Herman. We are seeing some additional construction discussions out there. I wouldn't say the activity has noticeably picked up. But there definitely are some folks out there  discussing it. Good news is that we have some pretty high barrier to entry markets that we're located in. So oftentimes, we're adding units to existing properties and really improving the quality of the assets along the way as well. So we feel we're in a pretty strong position.", "James Milam - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Anybody doing -- the add-on seem to be picking up pace. Anybody doing any conversions from an IL to an AL or adding services or things like that, that you see that -- is that picking up pace at all?", "Scott A. Estes", "It's pretty consistent within the marketplace. We haven't seen as many true conversions from one asset type to another. We hear some discussion about it, but generally, I can't point to a lot of examples at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "You may have mentioned it, what's the current Genesis coverage as of now?", "Scott A. Estes", "Current Genesis for fixed charge coverage is about 1.3x.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, 1.3. And that's decreasing to what after the next quarter, when the last round of Medicare cuts go through?", "Scott A. Estes", "It's actually been stable. So it's still around 1.3x. I don't think we're forecasting too much of a change in that number.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "So they've been able to adjust their business such that another quarter of cuts doesn't really affect it. Is that what you're saying?", "Scott A. Estes", "Essentially yes. It's been right around 1.3x. And longer term, I think as they look to move and close to the Sun merger, hopefully, within the next month or 2, that there's really a nice opportunity for some synergies, as well as an opportunity longer term to improve their skilled mix, which is currently about 23%. And I think that each 1% that they're able to improve can add about $12 million to operating cash flow, if they're able to do that.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Got that. And so that's the reason that, that cover -- you expect that coverage to kind of eke up a little bit to between 1.3 and 1.4, right?", "Scott A. Estes", "That's correct.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. And then do you know what kind of returns they get on the CapEx that they spent, the revenue-generating CapEx?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I mean, they're standards for investments of that type, Jeff. We're in the mid-teens, at a minimum.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, on your disposition program within the skilled nursing portfolio. How are you selecting the properties that you're interested in disposing off? Is it by certain operators, or is it more exposure to certain states that have Medicaid issues? I mean, what's your kind of criteria as you go through that pile of properties?", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "I think we evaluate all of those factors. Sometimes, it's states and sometimes it's particular operators. So it really depends on the situation. In the upcoming dispositions, they are largely portfolios that we're disposing of.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Are there certain states that you really want to stay away from?", "Scott A. Estes", "Not as much state specific as it is really to history of the operator. And they're generally smaller investments that are not really strategic longer term, and they have the willingness and appetite to take -- to pay us off, and we're willing to do that. It's very much in line with our strategic initiatives.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So I think you've said in the past that you think senior housing RIDEA, that type of investments, they're deserving of a cap rate and similar to multifamily cap rates. And I'm wondering why you think that, considering -- I know we've talked about this before. But operating margins for senior housing are about 30%, 35%, and operating margins multifamily are more like 65%, 70%. So why do you come to that conclusion that you think you should be getting a multifamily multiple on senior housing?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think you pick the one -- the factor that probably is a negative to that argument. But in most cases, if you look at the demographics and you look at the relative stability of cash flows, which are being borne out, at least, in our portfolio and, hopefully, will be supported at some point with good academic research, our experience has been that they're amazingly resilient and much more stable than a multifamily. And so that's the essence of our argument, Rich.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "A couple of years ago, maybe several years ago, you walked away from a Sunrise deal from a $700 million, $800 million. I can't remember what the exact number was. But what is -- why, draw the line between then and now? What has changed and -- from a pricing standpoint or what have you?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, frankly, I think we have to give a lot of credit to Mark Ordan and his team in terms of stabilizing the company, taking care of problems and, largely, eliminating market risk or company risk, which was -- had become quite a large factor beyond the portfolio we were looking at it at that point. So I think it was more of a relative stability of maybe the sector, but particularly of how good a job Mark and the team has done to make the company strong.", "Scott M. Brinker", "The other thing to think about that, when we walked away from that transaction was it was right in the middle of the capital market implosion. So we had raised capital, and we were then really well positioned going forward, so.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes, fair enough. So the storyline for HCN in the past years have been combination facilities and kind of age-in-place type of stuff. And you're moving now -- you'd say 85% private pay, 67% of your portfolio senior housing. You're kind of losing the diversification. Is it fair to say that the story is changing? I mean -- and if that's an obvious statement, why now are you doing that?", "George L. Chapman", "I don't think the story's changed at all. We think that any number of the continuums are really appropriate and allow folks to age in place, and generally, they have done better. So almost everything we've done in the large markets have been some combinations of IL/AL dementia or some subset of that. So I still think they're terrific investments.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I mean, I guess going away from the nursing home element is what I'm talking about I mean.", "George L. Chapman", "We have no problem with small SNF units as part of a continuum. We -- actually one of our investments in the skilled nursing side is Trilogy, which has a combination approach of Medicare and private pay-oriented SNFs with AL and dementia. We just think it's the appropriateness of the SNF setting in the right model that really makes a lot of sense. But to diminish our percentage of Medicaid-oriented skilled nursing, especially in certain states, made a lot of sense to us.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Last question for somebody. The 1.15 triple net senior housing coverage and the 1.2-plus percent SNF coverage after you do all the sales, what is the coverage after CapEx in those? Are you covering rent still?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, above that level, yes. And just to be clear, skilled nursing coverage, when we talked about 1.2, that was just the low point of the dispersion. Everyone's above 1.2. So again, our overall coverage is currently 1.4.", "Richard C. Anderson - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "But when you add the CapEx -- because you did have a kind of lengthy discussion about CapEx, you're still above one in that math?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jorel Guilloty with Morgan Stanley.", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "RIDEA is tracking well above your guidance at about 7% in 3Q '12 and you'd said previously it's about -- you'd expect 5% to 6% growth rate for the year. I was just wondering, what is driving the strong performance relative to what you had budgeted at the beginning of the year? And do you expect this to persist, or do you expect some moderation in 4Q?", "Scott A. Estes", "Jorel, it's Scott Estes. You're breaking up a little bit. I'm pretty sure the gist of your question was how is the RIDEA portfolio doing, expectations and what's kind of the factors behind the growth and how we're thinking about it next year?", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Well, basically, I just want to see what is driving the performance relative to what you budgeted early in this year?", "Scott M. Brinker", "We've had some good fill up of some of our assets. The rents that people are commanding are doing very well also. So there's been a combination of factors that have led to the improvement.", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then following the dispositions acceleration that you just announced, how much more of your portfolio do you think you can potentially dispose of going forward?", "Scott A. Estes", "This is Scott Estes. My view is we will have largely completed our major portfolio repositioning efforts through this acceleration. That being said, you should expect us probably to still look at potentially a couple hundred million of dispositions in 2013. Really, the opportunity we saw, in particular, was on the skilled nursing side that we've, I think, been talking to most everyone about, and it's just worked out pretty well that we think we can get a lot of those transactions done in short order. So we've decided to do it.", "Wilfredo Guilloty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then my last question is -- so after this year, you have approximately $250 million in development conversions remaining. Do you expect the development pipeline to increase in the near term? And if so, in what asset classes?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I think it will. Some perspective on our development pipeline, I would say probably 3 -- 2/3 to 3/4 of the opportunities would be in medical facilities area, I think, from the transactions that we generally look at. It's been a pretty low number. It's a nice opportunity we get some nice returns on those, I would guess, in the range of anywhere from, what should I [ph] say, $200 million to $400 million of potential starts per year is probably a reasonable estimate.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "As much as $500 million, depending upon a -- the amount of activity in the senior space. You have to remember, we've added so many strong key portfolio operators in the last couple of years. And as they expect to grow their portfolios and whatnot, we would expect them to grow in the amount of construction they may do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Macquarie.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "I think you said in the same-store senior housing operating, the occupancy was up 200 basis points year-over-year. Could you just give the actual occupancy number?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. It's been -- it's right around 90% currently.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then when I'm looking at that same-store pool, I mean, you have basically 116 assets there today versus the 99 you actually owned a year ago. So some of those, I guess, the assets sales [ph] then were Belmont, Merrill Gardens. Were some of those unstable assets and -- that are actually in the pool today, if we think about that from a year-over-year standpoint?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think, Nick, the best perspective is we do have a little bit of a benefit. But obviously, it also went into our initial expectations when we talked about the initial cap rates we went in at. Exclusive of a good stat, I think it's exclusive of the benefit of anything and fill up our stable, call it, same-store portfolio. It was up over 5%. So you're getting 5.2% an area. So you're still -- you're getting a slight benefit from some of the assets and fill up but still the core portfolio is generating over 5% growth year-over-year.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on Sunrise, I think you said -- Scott, I think you said you're expecting a 6.1% yield after CapEx next year. Is that a number that is sort of an end-of-year figure for the return? Or is that supposed to be sort of an average for the year? I'm just wondering how -- what type of growth in NOI that might assume for the portfolio next year.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. It's probably best to think about the 6.5% as sort of forward-looking yield as of July of 2013. That's the date where we expect to own basically 115 of the 125 properties on a 100% basis. At that point, we're able to reset the management fees. There is some NOI growth built into that number from the historical period, as you would expect. But to date, Sunrise has been right on top of our expectations, if not better.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. So you said -- sorry, the 6.5% would be sort of a forward-looking return, forward 12 months as of next July 2013?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. So if you looked at, say, a quarter of NOI in early 2013, it would probably be a little bit lower than 6.5%. But by the end of the year, you're going to be right around that number.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then just one last question on Sunrise. I mean, based on -- it looks like the way you guys have done some of your same-store pool historically, really relates to how long the assets have been open rather than necessarily you guys owning them in the year-over-year period. So I mean, if that's sort of true, does that mean that the Sunrise assets could be going in your same-store operating metrics as early as maybe first or second quarter next year?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think we'll evaluate that. I think the general discussions and feedback we've received from folks it'd be more of the traditional view, to wait until the full 15 months and start to report once we've had the transition in place. And that's basically the way we've started to do it now. So I think it's more standard. We can continue to discuss it, but that would be my expectation at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Philip Martin with Morningstar.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A question on your medical office building portfolio. Given that MOBs are increasingly becoming more of the focal point of healthcare delivery, what sort of value add and/or repositioning opportunities do you see within your MOB portfolio as they kind of move toward a greater use or a more comprehensive use?", "George L. Chapman", "I think that most of the new ones we've done through development are very well thought through with the right types of complementary services. I think that some of the old ones -- older ones may need some repositioning as we look at how all of the different physician, practices and services fit together. So I think our ability to analyze the clinical integration and to make suggestions to our hospital or physician or clinic partners will put us in a position to really add that value.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Is that part of the longer-term discussion you're having with some of your relationships? I mean, certainly, you have the location, but you may have a facility or a building that might be a bit obsolete. And again are your relationships sinking that far ahead?", "George L. Chapman", "I think that in most cases where we have the larger buildings, they are relatively new. I mean, the average age of our MOBs is, what, Scott, about 8 years, I believe now. So some of those are in very good...", "Scott A. Estes", "12.", "George L. Chapman", "Twelve. So in -- with respect to the new ones, it's just a continuous discussion to see how our leasing is going, how the teams are fitting together, what doctor groups either don't need the same amount of space or need more and then trying to just continuously communicate. Some of the -- any of the older ones that we would take over, I -- the health systems or the clinics are very interested in our input to see exactly what we should do to reposition it, what we should do to renovate and refurbish, add on or whatever. So I think that's -- that really is in our sweet spot, being as immersed in healthcare and where it's going as we are. So we have those and we're in distinct conversations. And we're looking to build a new building or, say, to acquire a building that are somewhat older.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And based on your experience, I mean, would you expect -- and what you see and all the discussions you're having with all kinds of relationships out there, would you expect the tenant mix in some of your older MOBs to shift considerably or change considerably over the next 5 years?", "George L. Chapman", "I think it'll change. I don't know if considerably is appropriate. I think we're just going to be looking at the particular doctor groups, what the health system is doing perhaps in the area, what specialties they might have in a particular location around the MOB, what they're trying to do to rebrand out there. So there's just a whole very, very general discussion. So it's hard to universalize on an answer like that. But it's the kind of the discussions we have.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then with your skilled nursing portfolio. The portion of your skilled nursing portfolio that you would consider core, that you want to maintain in the portfolio, where do you see margins going today to 5 years from now?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I think it depends largely on the ability to continue to add the enhanced services that Genesis has been adding over the last several years. So as they do their transactions and as they grow their company, there should be some additional synergies that you would expect from an operation's perspective, and then there should be some enhanced services that should add as well.", "Scott A. Estes", "[indiscernible] the facilities, Philip, we've talked to the guys, they're going to take a more sophisticated operator, I think, with larger scale, the ability to lower cost, more efficient outcomes and quality of care will become increasingly important. They start to think about we're really focused on who really has the long-term platforms to improve on those metrics over the longer term.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Could you see margins go up 20%?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I think you're more likely to see a differential between the high-quality providers and the low-quality providers. I think the high quality -- people like Genesis are going to do better certainly relative to the rest. So their margins, I think, would stay roughly the same, but they're going to outperform the types of buildings that we're selling. That's our thesis.", "Charles J. Herman", "And in the end, it's all about NOI for us. It's about NOI per unit, what they can generate there. So margins may go down, but if their generating more NOI per unit, you have more valuable assets.", "Philip J. Martin - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And again, to the extent of the repositioning of the skilled nursing assets, are you seeing a better opportunity with -- or is it about the same as what you thought with this core SNF portfolio in terms of CapEx and value-add opportunities from HCN standpoint to fund some of those value-add CapEx initiatives?", "Charles J. Herman", "We're looking at the portfolio as just that, as a core portfolio. So we're adding services where needed, adding new buildings as appropriate as well, where there's ability to enhance the relationship with some of the core health systems out there. So we're seeing opportunities throughout the entire portfolio.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A few questions here. First, Scott, I'm sure you're working on a budget for next year. But can you give us some rough numbers for where you think, say, G&A and overall CapEx pencils out after you layer in the full Sunrise portfolio?", "Scott A. Estes", "I'd really would just be guessing at this point, Mike. I think we'll clearly do that in February when we give the guidance. I would say that we're getting some relative savings as you think of our scalable platform as you add the Sunrise investment into our G&A. As I mentioned, our run rate in the fourth quarter, in terms of G&A, is looking like about $24 million. The aggregate CapEx for this year, what is it, Steve, about $54 million.", "Steven Mohr", "Right.", "Scott A. Estes", "For the full year 2012. So I think I would take those kind of run rate and grow them at some point. At this point, we'll give you more specifics as soon as we can.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then Genesis, I may have missed this. I think you mentioned the CapEx being about $1,200 a bed, and then you said something about strategic CapEx of $800. What's the difference between the 2? And how do you see that extra $800 of CapEx continuing over the next few years, or is it more of a 2012 phenomenon?", "Scott A. Estes", "I'll let Chuck Herman comment on -- help me answer your question. But the short answer is the routine CapEx is about $1,200 and the additional $800 is more strategic. And that would be things that are, in essence, more significant. That would be value adding. So if they're doing rooms or hallways or building out a rehab gym, those are things that essentially get into more of the strategic perspective. It's probably around in that area, I would think, going forward. Don't you think, Chuck?", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes, I think so.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So all-in about 2,000?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question. For the balance of the asset sales that you're expecting this year, what's ballpark cap rate?", "Scott A. Estes", "10%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Truxillo with Bank of America.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I kind of have 2, one for George and probably one for Scott, both have to do with 2 increased exposures from the Sunrise acquisitions. Just looking for a bit of color on each. The first is being the senior housing operating assets, and I do appreciate all the commentary on the call so far on it. But having said that, do you have any new commentary in kind of the strategic goal for how much of your portfolio could end up in senior housing operating? And have you discussed that with the agencies?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, Scott can comment on the ongoing discussions with the agencies, but I think I'd like to go back to the general point we made, both Scott Brinker and I made earlier, and that is that the most important variable in terms of doing an investment relates more to the quality of the operator, its assets and the markets where they're located. And we've been a little surprised at the quality of assets that really wanted to align interest and do a RIDEA deal. And it was, and in our judgment, compelling, even though it has increased the RIDEA components so that it'll probably be in excess of 30% at some point. We just think that much of the discussion has been somewhat misplaced, with all due respect, because it's focusing on more on the structure than the quality of the investment themselves. So we would like to keep some balance between triple net and RIDEA, but the -- and the bottom line is if we continue to have opportunities in the RIDEA area with outsized growth with the best operators, markets and facilities, we're going to continue to do that.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sure. And I understand your point on it, and I tend to share that point. My question is more of how do you balance the way you view it versus what is obviously a negative view from the agencies on growing that exposure? And how do you balance it, too?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think part of it is to continue to communicate. It is also our ability to communicate the quality of the investment, whether it be on a RIDEA structure or triple net. And in triple nets, as Scott Brinker made clear, is no panacea. Simply because people are supposed to pay you, it doesn't mean -- and to make their own capital -- CapEx investments, it doesn't mean that they're going to be capable of it. They're in the wrong markets with the wrong assets and if the operator isn't that capable. But, Scott, just -- want to comment a little bit about the discussions with the agencies?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Sure. I think the answer really, George, is that you're getting at the crux of it. The perception of volatility and risk in RIDEA versus triple net is almost a misguided discussion. Again, when we're looking at the operators, the quality of the assets, clearly, in the best markets with the best operators is a part of our decision-making process. I think one important point is we would acknowledge, obviously, the pace of acquisitions has been significant. We do believe that an increasing percentage of our future investments will come from our existing relationships. So when we've had the discussions, I think, boy, the quality of our portfolio, lesser government reimbursement, greater diversity, larger assets are all things that should be favorable on the rating agencies sides. We've had our discussions with them, again, about the integration. And if anything, I think once we again show that we can successfully integrate these assets like we've done with our other portfolios, and I think we have a good shot at making, hopefully, some good headway there because the portfolio has really improved a lot.", "George L. Chapman", "I think even to the extent that people perceive the matter a little differently than we do, if you look at the outsized returns we make from a RIDEA investment, we think it's more than worthwhile in terms of this somewhat larger perceived risk. And I think, Scott Brinker, you have some numbers on what would happen if we had done Sunrise on a triple-net basis, right, and on a RIDEA basis? You might remind him of those numbers generally.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. I mean, one thing that is important to think about when deciding whether to use a RIDEA or triple-net lease structure is that a triple-net lease requires you to share the cash flows. We're not familiar with too many operators that won't be willing to sign up to guarantee the rent, unless they're highly likely to make a large profit after CapEx. So on Sunrise, in particular, we at least thought about a triple-net lease and quickly came to the conclusion that we'd be giving up way too much of the cash flow over time and, therefore, quickly decided that RIDEA for this type of a portfolio, given it's growth prospects, was a lot more appropriate.", "Thomas C. Truxillo - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And the second one is more of a balanced exposure. You guys are assuming a lot of secured debt with the acquisition, and I have your secured debt-to-assets ratio shaking out kind of in the high teens. Can you talk a little bit about your comfort level there? And if you're not comfortable there, how do you get that ratio down a bit?", "Scott A. Estes", "That is correct. It's probably about the area that we -- we'd shake out if you just take within our earnings release today. We're comfortable with that level that's at the higher end of where we would probably like to see it, and I think we'll look at opportunities right off the bat. There's some -- clearly some of that debt that makes sense to pay off if we're able to do that. So we'd probably hope to keep it somewhat lower than that and we're -- when we're looking at that right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Laetsch [ph] with BMT.", "Unknown Analyst", "Yes. I had a question about the Sunrise deal. HSR was supposed to expire on October 26. Can you guys give us a status on that? Did it expire? Did you do a pull and refile? Or did you get a second request?", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "This is Jeff Miller. We exited 2 separate ones, one for the Sunrise acquisition and one for the main co. FTC and DOJ let the waiting periods expire. So we're free to proceed with the closing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of odds and ends here. Scott, with the sales that you're contemplating, I believe -- did I catch you right, that those are mostly to operators? I'm curious who's buying these.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, that's correct, Rob, operators, yes.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And the MOBs, you've had some pretty nice momentum with occupancy. The NOI growth really hasn't kind of gone along with that. Is that because of -- well, I'm not going to guess. Why is NOI growth been 1.5%?", "Scott A. Estes", "The team has really done great -- I think a great job getting as much of the value added to portfolios as we've been able to do. We have about 70% of the increases in our medical office portfolio are fixed and they range probably in the 1.5% to 2% range. So you generally expect, I would say, probably 2%, maybe a little bit better growth, and there has just been some effect of leasing spreads that our rollover has been very small. So the kind of the number we've seen has been in the 1% to 2% range of late.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And obviously, you've laid out some a number of transactions over this quarter and the next one that's kind of are already on the board. Should we infer from that, that some of the other deals that, obviously, you're not talking about, on -- that, that activity might abate a little bit? Or would that be a misread?", "Charles J. Herman", "We're seeing transaction activity -- we're still seeing a lot of transaction activity. Really, it's a question of whether or not they're of the quality that we want to pursue or not. We do see a lot of SNF opportunities, I would say, more so than the private pay senior housing opportunities currently, although there's still some larger deals out there that we know are being reviewed.", "Scott A. Estes", "you're probably talking about the market, generally. I think what we would do --  is yes, Rob, we very excited about the portfolio that we got. And if we think about what we may do, it's probably 2/3 weighted towards seniors' housing opportunities, 1/3 weighted towards medical office buildings. But yes, I think over the next 6 to 12 months you would see -- expect to see the pace in, at least, for us, about a 2 -- 1 to 2 years ago, we were getting 40% -- 30%, 40% of our quarterly investments from repeat business. Now it's up to about 60%, 65%. So I think that's going to an increasing part as we've added good partners just to grow with them.", "George L. Chapman", "I think if we go back to the thesis, Rob, and that is to -- we wanted to have the highest quality portfolio with the best operators, best markets in the country and with a lot of emphasis on the senior housing, high-end senior housing and MOBs. And we've largely accomplished that, and we're not going to dilute that through lesser types of investments.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. I was thinking also, though, in terms of the relationship investing. Just kind of like, is the total dollar amount in excess of what's in the press release today? Is that likely to come down a little bit for a while as you digest the latest spade of acquisitions? Or would you expect the relationship investing to still provide kind of a steady drumbeat of new investments?", "George L. Chapman", "We think that there probably are some relatively smaller investments out there that we could capture, perhaps apart from the relationships. But as we indicated, 64% of the last 12 months, rolling 12 months, would came from relationships. I, frankly, expect that number to increase after we capture the remaining Sunrise and some other independent investments. And I indicated in my remarks that I think -- if we ever get to that place called normalcy, which we keep looking for, then I think we're going to be more at the steady state $1.5 billion to $2 billion, and we'll be able to drive substantial growth in our FFO through our -- an excellent portfolio.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Then last question. This almost a footnote in terms of size. The entry fee business, occupancy up again this quarter. Could you remind us where you stand in terms of the deferred rent and the ability to capture some of that?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. Our entrance fee facility is currently 13 facilities. It's only about 4% of the portfolio, and we continue to earn about 6.5% overall. It does continue to fill generally, albeit is somewhat slowly, probably a rate of 2% to 3% per quarter. We have some facilities that are doing well. You have a few that are probably struggling a little bit more, I think some more of the resort-like communities in the southeast that has a little bit slower fill-up times. So I think as always, we have a right to capture any of the upside, and I think that just allows us to continue to evaluate all of those buildings, as well as thinking about, if ever, repositioning as a rental model maybe makes sense or selling them ever  makes sense.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alex Fridlyand with BNPP.", "Alex Fridlyand", "Just was wondering if you could remind everybody what the additional compensation in the SRZ acquisition is if the deal does not close by 21st of February, and just if you can say anything in terms of how you're thinking about that deadline.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. The extension fee is down on a per diem basis. It's roughly $550,000 a day, and that starts in late February. But at this point, our expectation is to close in early 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a few more skilled nursing questions. What's the SNF portfolio going to look like after the $700 million are sold, I guess, if you look at it from a coverage standpoint, average age, state exposure? Any details you can share about that?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think the best way, Todd, to think about it is we do have some Sun assets that we talked about. So you'd probably combine the Sun and Genesis portfolios. If we have $3.5 billion today, selling another $400 million to $500 million very short term gets us to about $3 billion portfolio. So genesis will basically be about $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion of the $3 billion total, and then we have a handful of others, as George mentioned, such as Trilogy, that have been -- we've got good relationships with longer term. So that really would make most of the focus in our portfolio will be the Genesis portfolio.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just to clarify, I think you gave a few numbers about the portfolio. What's the in-place yield that the facilities you're selling are generating right now? And what's the pricing that you expect?", "Scott A. Estes", "I guess I didn't average them all. I would think, generally, the in-place yield is usually in the 10% --  they've been in our portfolio for awhile 10.5% to 11%, but we often get a price above our book basis. So with those gains, it's usually a yield on a sales price, more like the 9% to 9.5% range that I mentioned before.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And what do you expect to put that back to work at? What type of reinvestment yield are you budgeting?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think if you'd look at investments that we've looked at the last 3 to 6 months, probably you assume a 6% to 7% area, depends what the asset types ultimately are. But again, we're looking at high-quality seniors' housing assets and medical office buildings primarily.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just finally, if the current tenants appear to be the most likely buyers of these assets and HUD financing usually takes quite a bit of time, how much of the $700 million of sales do you think you'll provide seller financing for, just to bridge financing?", "Scott A. Estes", "Basically, none from our perspective. A lot of these have been in the works for a while. But again, to the operators, we, again, are comfortable with that being a realistic. It's all looking pretty good for fourth quarter closings at this point.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Just a couple of follow-up questions. On the senior housing operating portfolio, the 7% same-store NOI growth, that's trending better than you guys were expecting. Just curious if you're seeing that across all your different operating partners or if there are particular partners that are really driving that number and everybody else is kind of in line versus the expectations?", "Charles J. Herman", "It definitely depends on the operator, but generally, most are performing very, very well. So that's the beauty of having a portfolio of multiple operators doing RIDEA and the fact that it's diversified.", "Scott A. Estes", "We saw nice rent -- rental growth, too. I mean, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, revenue per occupied unit growth of about 3.5% this quarter.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Got it, okay. And then -- so for anyone that's really outperforming, apart from just the rental drive, is there anyone out there where occupancy gains are really doing much better than you expected, even despite the strong rent growth -- the strong rental rate growth?", "Charles J. Herman", "We just had some fantastic operators that are doing well hitting on all cylinders. So some are performing a little better than others, but I would say, we're very pleased with the portfolio.", "Scott A. Estes", "And my view would be about 1/2 were pretty much right in line with budget and about 1/2 are doing significantly above budget, I would say, this year.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay, that's helpful. And then the dispositions, the additional $450 million, any sense of pricing at this point or what the bogey is?", "Scott A. Estes", "Same number, Tayo, as we've been mentioning. It'd be about a 9% to 9.5%, I think, yield on sale when you include the gain.", "Tayo Okusanya", "That's helpful. And then last quick question. When I take a look at all your same-store stats for the quarter, up 3.6% for the entire portfolio. Medical office buildings at 1.5%. I'm just kind curious, on the MOB side, where you potentially see that going to kind of given where current occupancies are? Do you still see there's upside in regards to same-store NOI? Or is that kind of a fair run rate-type number to be using going forward?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. I think the short answer is it's probably a fair run rate going forward. We did a little bit of occupancy improvement -- but again, the guys are doing a great job. The 94 occupancy is getting close to about as good as I think you can get. But I think that's a fair 1.5% to 2% would be a rough expectation for MOB same-store growth.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Can you talk a little bit what kind of mark-to-market you're actually seeing on the MOB portfolio when leases expire?", "Scott A. Estes", "We haven't given too much detail. And again, Tayo, if you look, we have very little expirations at only about 5% to 6% per year through 2016. The 24% in aggregate is pretty low. The spread is really tightened up. It's probably, what would you say, Jay, around 5% area. It's pretty...", "Jay Morgan", "Yes, it's 5.5%, mainly 5%. We're looking at above negotiating replacement tenants, maybe a little bit below that. It's driven somewhat by TI allowances but pretty flat from a leasing spread standpoint.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. It's probably too [ph] conservative.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you guys give us some color on your ownership position in the management business? What's the yield on that investment? And is that a long-term hold?", "Scott M. Brinker", "This is Scott. We're going to own a 20% interest in the management company. The purchase price was in the neighborhood of 6x multiple on EBITDA. So that gives you a sense for the return on investment. And yes, our expectation is that we're going to be a long-term owner. We like the alignment of interests and think that the platform has substantial value going forward, particularly when we think about it overlaid with our current portfolio.", "George L. Chapman", "I think there are 2 reasons why we wanted to be there. One was for alignment. Two, we think we're going to do quite well, either long term or by taking the company public in 4 or 5 years. So we're very pleased with the investment.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you describe the management fee related to the Sunrise portfolio? Are those similar fees to the rest of your RIDEA investments?", "Scott M. Brinker", "They are similar in that we think it's important to have an alignment of interest. So in virtually everyone of our arrangements, the manager participates in any excess NOI above a certain threshold, and they also participate in any shortfall against a certain threshold. And  the Sunrise contracts will be set up in a similar manner.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I may have heard this incorrectly. But, Scott, I believe in your comments, you said there were situations where a tenant wouldn't want to lease a property under the triple-net structure. And in those situations, HCN might be willing to make a RIDEA investment. Did I hear that correctly? And could you expand the comment if I did?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. The comment was that there are certain operators that do not want to do a triple-net lease. They like the alignment of incentives that a RIDEA partnership provides, and they have plenty of capital alternatives. And that is their preference. And for the right portfolios and operating partners, we're happy to use that structure.", "George L. Chapman", "I could give you some color on that for a moment. When we first met Merrill Gardens years ago, probably about 20 years ago now, the first thing that Merrill Gardens wanted to do in forming a new relationship was doing it as a joint venture, and we were not able to do that. As a relationship grew, and then we were able to do RIDEA. It was a natural for Bill Pettit and I to want do it that way, and he really believes in aligning interests. And I can tell you, too, that at least one other of the companies in our RIDEA platform has only done joint ventures, again, for the alignment. I think there's some real strength in it that maybe is somewhat overlooked in some of these debates.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Zach Ottenstein, Director of Marketing and Communications. Please go ahead, sir.", "Zachary Ottenstein", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com.

George?", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks very much, Zach, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. During the last 5 years, we experienced a period of intense investment and capital activity. All of this activity has been purposeful and singularly focused on achieving our strategic objectives. Our goal has been to assemble a vast health care and senior housing real estate, managed by the best internal and external teams, so that our portfolio delivers the highest quality care and the strongest, most resilient growth in the sector. We believe that this ongoing performance can only be sustained by working together with our operators and partners to foster collaboration, best practices and enhanced communication and IT capabilities, so that we are prepared for the integrated health care delivery system.", "During the second quarter, this focused activity continued, as we announced an exciting partnership with Revera that solidifies our leading position in the vibrant Canadian market.", "Early in the third quarter, we closed on the balance of our important Sunrise investment and also completed a $213 million sale-leaseback transaction with Avery Healthcare in the U.K. In addition, we continue to enjoy impressive organic investment growth with our existing partners, including acquisitions and developments with Benchmark, Brandywine, Genesis, Silverado, Legend and Signature. Despite the ever-changing market situation, we believe there is a healthy opportunity to invest in significant portfolios that are consistent with and advance our strategic plans. Scott Brinker will walk through our investing activities in more detail momentarily.", "I've spoken on many occasions about the quality and passion of our partners and our team. A number of you had the opportunity to see that quality and passion first-hand at the Investor Day event we hosted in May. You were able to see the virtual ACO that we facilitated with our partners, Virtua Health Care, Genesis and Brandywine in Voorhees, New Jersey. But you have to go beyond that to understand our portfolio management success. Chuck Herman and our team, as well as our partners are fully immersed in the senior housing and health care sector. And what does this mean practically? One, we are change agents and industry insiders. We can shape and react positively to market and regulatory changes. We thoroughly understand market dynamics and we understand how outstanding care can be delivered in a cost-effective manner. Our long track record of success proves superior knowledge of and immersion in health care leads to superior results. I will continue to speak about our unparalleled immersion in health care and how it adds value to our partners and will continue to add value to our shareholders in the future.", "We emphasized real estate and management quality because it translates into high satisfaction among all stakeholders, residents, tenants and employees. Our operators and tenants shelter and care for tens of thousands of individuals each day in an environment that nurtures not only their physical but their social well-being. Our operators have a strong commitment to delivering the highest quality care and they continuously strive to deliver even better care over time.", "As Scott Estes will report to you shortly, our financial results bear out our investment thesis. During the downturn, our portfolio had the resiliency to provide stable growth. During the moderate upturn that has been ongoing for the past several quarters, our portfolio has grown robustly. As we enter what we believe will be a period of better economic growth, our portfolio is poised for even stronger performance. We have a well-planned mix of longer-term and shorter term leases in the form of triple-net leases and RIDEA arrangements that should allow us to capture upside as the economy picks up steam. In short, our strategic design works through all economic cycles.", "I will now turn the call over to Scott Brinker and Scott Estes, who will summarize our investment and financial performance. Scott Brinker?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Thanks, George. We delivered another quarter of internal and external growth. Same-store NOI increased 3.8% over the prior year. Our internal growth rate over the past 11 quarters has averaged 4%, more than double the rate of inflation. The internal growth rate has also been reliable with exceptionally low volatility, consistent, superior performance, the direct result of our strategy to own the highest-quality real estate with diversification by industry, operator, geography and lease maturity.", "Let's start the detailed review with our RIDEA portfolio. Same-store NOI increased 8.4% over the prior year, above budget due to rate growth. The portfolio is well diversified between assisted living, independent living and memory care. Operating results have been fantastic. In the aggregate, year 1 NOI has exceeded our underwriting by 4% and growth in NOI after year 1 has surpassed our budgets.", "Looking forward, the outlook is favorable. Expenses are under control, new supply is modest in our markets, the housing and employment markets are improving. Most important, the portfolio continues to benefit from demographics and need-based demand.", "Turning to our triple net senior housing portfolio, it continues to produce consistent, attractive growth. Same-store NOI grew 2.7% over the prior year. We expect to see similar growth in future years.", "Moving to our skilled, post-acute portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3% over the prior year. We expect consistent, 2.5% to 3% growth over the long term. Genesis accounts are 80% of the portfolio. Their scale, platform and superior management team make them a leader in the post-acute sector. All 176 of our Genesis properties are bundled into a single master lease. We expect 1.3x fixed charge coverage this year with improvement over time. A rental payment from Genesis is well-secured, and we're expanding the relationship to the construction of state-of-the-art, post-acute facilities. I'll wrap up the portfolio review with our outpatient, medical office portfolio.", "Same-store NOI grew 3% over the prior year, above our expectations due to strong leasing activity, our portfolio's industry-leading occupancy and rental rates. There are a few reasons for this. One, nearly all of our MOBs are affiliated with the health system. This provides a stable base and attracts other tenants. Two, we have the youngest, most modern portfolio in the sector. Three, we have a topnotch in-house property management team. Four, our buildings were designed to benefit from the relentless shift from inpatient to outpatient care. We're actively developing new outpatient medical office buildings with yields that exceed acquisition cap rates by more than 150 basis points. Currently, we have $137 million under development. All 8 projects are affiliated with health systems, and they're 85% pre-leased.", "Turning to investment activity, there are a lot of buyers in the market right now. Like us, they're attracted by resilient returns and strong fundamentals. In times like these, we turn to our vast network of relationships for proprietary deal flow. The headline last quarter was a $1.3 billion investment with Revera. It's another example of our ability to source off-market NAV accretive investments. The portfolio consists of high-quality independent living communities, concentrated in top 5 Canadian metros. Projecting an initial cash yield of 7% with strong NOI growth over time. The investment also highlights our focused approach to external growth.", "Several years ago, we evaluated multiple countries for international expansion. We identified Canada and the U.K. as by far the leading candidates. Fast forward to today, we're the second largest senior housing owner in Canada. We've also partnered with Canada's largest providers, Revera and Chartwell. We have rights to first opportunity to both, which lead to future accretive investments. In July, we expanded our sector leading presence in the U.K. to $213 million off-market sale-leaseback with Avery Healthcare, one of the premier operators in the U.K. These are 14 brand new buildings, the average age of just 2 years. The initial lease rate is 7% with 3% annual escalators. We also negotiated future rights that lead to off-market, accretive deal flow, including the take-out of Avery sizable development portfolio. The U.K. is at the beginning of a massive paradigm shift in moving seniors out of old, government-funded facilities into modern, private-pay facilities. The shift is demanded by both consumers and the government. We've now partnered with 3 operators with the forefront of this shift: Sunrise, Signature and Avery. Our platforms in Canada and the U.K. are unique within the sector. There are 2 differentiators in our ability to generate internal and external growth. Within the next 60 days, we expect to acquire Merrill Garden's minority interest in 38 senior housing communities for $173 million. Merrill recently chose to focus on development as opposed to managing stabilized assets. They approached us about acquiring their 20% JV interest. This is a high-quality, well-located portfolio. We received strong interest from our existing partners, some prefer the RIDEA structure, others prefer the triple net lease. Our decision to convert to a lease is not the beginning of a trend in our RIDEA portfolio. We chose Emeritus for 2 reasons: one, the location of these 38 assets is an excellent match with our existing footprint; two, their proposed lease terms were very appealing. We lock in attractive rent growth while retaining upside to participation in gross revenue from the facilities.", "In early July, we completed our Sunrise joint venture buyouts. These buyouts occurred in 15 separate transactions, all but 1 was privately negotiated outside of an auction process. Our investment in Sunrise real estate is now $4.3 billion, with a yield expected to exceed 6.5% in the second half of the year. The timing and economics of the buyouts far exceed their expectations. It created substantial shareholder value. As you can see, the new investments and portfolio management, continue to position the company to deliver consistent growth.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Scott Estes, who will discuss our financial results.", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Scott just detailed how our investment and portfolio management strategies have generated consistent and resilient results. I'll now describe how our corporate finance efforts support the same strategic initiatives through our capital structure and financial results. In doing so, I'd like to leave you with 3 key thoughts: first, our balance sheet and liquidity are in great shape having completed our $1.7 billion equity offering in May; second, Health Care REIT's blended cost of capital remains near historic lows, allowing us to continue to source investments that are accretive to NAV; and finally, our recent internal and external growth significantly enhanced our visibility into earnings growth, not only in 2013 but 2014 as well.", "Let's begin today with our balance sheet and liquidity. As I noted, our balance sheet and liquidity are in excellent shape. At the end of June, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalizations stood at 39.3%. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA, interest coverage and fixed charge coverage are all in line with our strategic target levels on a pro forma basis. Adjusting for the incremental EBITDA from transactions, which have closed year-to-date, our current run rate debt to adjusted EBITDA level is right at the 6x level, while our interest and fixed charge coverage are 3.5x and 2.8x, respectively.", "We efficiently raise capital to fund all transactions that have been announced year-to-date. In early May, we completed the sale of 23 million shares of common equity at $73.50 per share, generating $1.7 billion in gross proceeds. We also issued 718,000 shares under our dividend reinvestment program during the second quarter, generating $51 million in proceeds. As of June 30, we had $512 million in cash and no borrowings on our credit lines.", "Subsequent to quarter end, we completed both the Sunrise and Avery Healthcare investments and had several other regular fundings occur. So as of today, we have a little less than $600 million in total borrowings on our credit lines. As such, we're in a strong liquidity position with nearly $1.7 billion of line availability having already funded $5 billion of investments this year.", "And now let's take a look at our evolving cost of capital. Although our incremental cost of capital has increased somewhat in light of recent moves in interest rates and stock prices, our blended cost of capital remains near historically low levels. Specifically, we estimate that our cost of issuing new 10-year debt is in the 4.3% range today, representing an increase of approximately 80 basis points from the unprecedented levels seen earlier this spring. Our equity has generally performed in line with the REIT sector in 2013, generating a positive total return of approximately 7% year-to-date.", "As a result, the increase in our cost of capital has driven us to adjust our pricing requirements to some extent, yet we remain confident in our ability to continue to source investments during the latter half of 2013.", "Finally, I'll conclude today with an update regarding our financial results and guidance. Again, the key takeaway here is that the investments we've already completed and financed year-to-date put us in position to generate strong earnings growth not only this year, but next year as well. And for the second quarter, normalized FFO and FAD increased 4% year-over-year to $0.93 and $0.82, respectively. Our results this quarter came in slightly better than our internal expectations. There were 3 primary drivers to our better-than-expected results. First, the strong 3.8% NOI growth from the existing portfolio. Second, our ability to close the Revera transaction in May, only 3 weeks following our successful capital raise. And third, slightly lower G&A and CapEx spending than anticipated. We recently announced our 169th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30 of $0.765 per share or $3.06 annually, as this represents a 3.4% increase over the dividends paid in 2012 and a current dividend yield of 4.8%.", "Our 2013 FFO and FAD payout ratios are projected in the range of 81% to 83% and 91% to 94%, respectively.", "Before I provide an update regarding our guidance and projections through the remainder of the year, I'd like to point out several enhancements to the supplement this quarter. First, on Page 2, we added an adjustments column to the portfolio NOI table. This adjusts for the timing of acquisitions, dispositions and construction conversions, which occurred during the quarter, allowing you to more accurately calculate the quarterly NOI run rate for the most recent period. And next on Page 6, we created a page detailing the stratification of payment coverage across leases in our triple net portfolio. We're happy to provide this increased transparency, which provides detail, both before and after management fees as a percentage of NOI. The bottom table also provides additional detail on any mass release that covers less than 0.95x on an after-management fee basis, which importantly comprises only 1.6% of our total company NOI.", "Turning now to guidance. Our 2013 normalized FFO and FAD guidance remain unchanged at $3.70 to $3.80, and $3.25 to $3.35 per diluted share, respectively. These both represent solid 5% to 8% growth year-over-year. We now forecast approximately 3.5% blended same-store cash NOI growth for 2013 above our original forecast of 3%. This increase is attributable to strong first and second quarter results and the continued strength of our seniors housing operating portfolio, which is now projected to generate same-store NOI growth of approximately 6% for the year.", "As is typical for us, our guidance does not include an assumption for additional investments beyond those already announced. We do continue to expect approximately $500 million of dispositions for the year. Thus far, we have completed $314 million at a blended yield on sale of 7.3%, including net gains on sales. Our remaining dispositions this year consists primarily of a combination of noncore skilled nursing and medical facility assets.", "Finally, we project the total of $287 million of development conversions this year at an average initial yield of 8.5%. Our capital expenditure forecast is currently $67 million for the year, comprised of approximately $49 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $18 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. And finally, our G&A forecast for 2013 has declined slightly to approximately $107 million for the full year from the previous expectation of $112 million. At this point, we anticipate approximately $27 million to $28 million of G&A per quarter during the remaining 2 quarters of 2013.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. But I would like to leave you with my view that we are in a very strong financial position entering the second half of the year as we continue to execute on our strategic plan.", "At this point, I will turn the call back to George for some brief closing comments.", "George L. Chapman", "Thanks very much, Scott. With our $5 billion of investments year-to-date, our total investments since the beginning of 2010, now total $19 billion. Moreover, as our relationships continue to deliver the preponderance of our investments, we will continue to deliver strong investment opportunities even after this period of unprecedented transactional volume is over. We believe that our results clearly demonstrate the success of our business model, as we have continued to add operators and systems as partners. And these new investments, together with our recurring investments created by our existing relationships, have driven consistent growth with asset quality that we believe is the best in our sector. The architecture of our portfolio with a mix of triple-net leases and RIDEA arrangements is positioned to deliver strong shareholder value through all economic cycles. Today, we believe our strong portfolio and sets of relationships in the United States, the U.K. and Canada position us very well for the future.", "And with that, operator, that concludes our remarks, and we're open for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Do you guys still expect to drive 5% same-store growth from the senior housing operating portfolio after delivering what, 5.6% in the first quarter and 8.4% in the second quarter?", "Scott A. Estes", "Mike, it's Scott Estes. Yes, we do. The portfolio continues to do very well on the whole. And as I said, we're forecasting about 6% for the year and hopefully, we'll do a little bit better than that. But everything is going, going well with the RIDEA portfolio.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "All right. What was the sequential same-store occupancy increase compared to last quarter?", "Scott M. Brinker", "In the RIDEA portfolio?", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, the same-store portfolio.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it was down a little bit, I think 30 basis points. But the NOI growth was high, it was in the neighborhood of 5% quarter-over-quarter. So good rate growth, very modest expense growth, more than offset a small decline in occupancy, which we've more than recaptured as of today.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Thanks for the disclosure on the tenant coverage ratios. At what level do you start being more concerned, is it that 0.95 level, because it does look like you have about 8% of your NOI still having a coverage ratio below 1.05.", "Scott M. Brinker", "No, it really depends on the portfolio. We try to produce a little bit of detail on each one. Is there a guarantee, is there a letter of credit, what's the term of the lease, what kind of assets are they? So it really varies. Some portfolios are still in the sort of turnaround phase and we're perfectly comfortable that they're eventually going to hit a 1x-plus payment coverage ratio. So it's hard to say. We prefer to have a [indiscernible] above 1.0 today, but on that list, there aren't too many that, I would say, we're concerned about, if any. And as you can see, all of them are current on their rent payment.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Is there any particular operator that's in that lower group?", "Scott M. Brinker", "No. Like I said, generally speaking, we're very comfortable with the triple net portfolio. We're happy to provide the additional transparency. We're confident it's going to produce consistent growth going forward and we're providing the transparency hoping that they're going to come to the same conclusion.", "Scott A. Estes", "Okay. I would note, Mike, too, of that portfolio, it's only 1.6% of total NOI. Every single one of those lines that we have additional detail is just one facility except for one specific relationship. And that one specific relationship is actually likely to pay us off and remain current on rent throughout and it's projected sometime next year, I believe.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Then how do your current leverage metrics impact potential investment opportunities? I mean, it looks like in the third quarter, your leverage metrics will start creeping a lot higher than your targeted long-term leverage metrics just given the strong investment activity you completed recently.", "Scott A. Estes", "I don't think there's any change. As a reminder to everybody, I think we saw a benefit in our overall cost of capital, given our recent upgrades to BBB flat from S&P. So we're now BBB flat across-the-board and I feel like our general target remains 40% debt to undepreciated book. And from time to time as we raise capital, it goes up or down around that number. But again, that's so we would remain committed to that target long term and I don't think we could've done more than raise $1.7 billion of equity this quarter. So I think we still feel comfortable with our target level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I guess this one's for Scott Brinker. Is the same-store pool this quarter the same as the same-store pool last quarter, those same 118 assets or did it somehow shift?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Same pool, Jeff. Over the next year we'll start adding portfolios like Chartwell, Sunrise, Brookdale, Revera, Belmont Village. So it's -- the total RIDEA portfolio today is 357 assets and about a year from now, you'll have all of those in the same-store pool.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "So looking at it sequentially, it looks like the revenues were relatively flat in that same-store pool, but the expenses dropped by 200 basis points or so. Can you kind of talk about what's driving that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Jeff, let me look at the numbers. But in general, occupancy was down a little bit, but it was more than offset by strong rate growth, and then operating expenses increased only very slightly. So that quarter-over-quarter, if you're comparing 1Q to 2Q, the NOI growth was more than 5%.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, I'll talk to you off-line. And then, how many of those assets in the same-store pool are lease-up assets?", "Scott M. Brinker", "There aren't many at this point. The growth for the whole same-store pool was 8.4% year-over-year, and only 4 of them are lease-up assets. So the 114 stabilized assets NOI year-over-year grew almost 8%.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then, quickly, just shifting gears to investment activity. In terms of the U.K. and Canada, what kind of supply growth do you see in the senior housing market there? And how do you -- does that make you nervous at all or is it less in the U.S.? Where is it in relation to U.S.-based investment in senior housing?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It's modest in Canada, about 2% a year, which is less than the growth in the population. So, throughout the country, occupancy is up, rates are up about 3%, and our portfolios are up even higher. U.K., there isn't good construction in this construction stats, but what you have in the U.K. is really a need to replace the lion's share of the supply that exists. Their older, outmoded buildings, mostly government pay, and the assets that we own, 46 communities now, are modern, private pay assets. So I'm not sure what the stat is, but there needs to be more development, not less in the U.K.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So for the quarter, the guidance -- you guys talk about you're raising guidance on the same-store NOI for the senior housing portfolio, G&A is coming in a little bit lower. You're ahead of most of your expected trends. I'm just kind of curious why guidance was not raised.", "Scott A. Estes", "The factor really -- the #1 factor really relates to the timing of our equity deal and then the incremental investments we've announced since providing our last guidance. So if you take all the parts, we raised $1.7 billion of equity in May, and then really announced only about $1.4 billion of incremental investments through, roughly, our $1 billion ownership of Revera, the Avery transaction as well as the Merrill Gardens and Emeritus transactions. So that $1.4 billion of incremental investments comes out later in the year. I think we're very happy to raise the capital efficiently and do it without any change in our guidance. So the G&A and the CapEx factors are relatively minor and when you put it all together, they're about roughly net neutral given all those parts and we have lower leverage as well, as a result.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "And then Merrill Gardens, I understand this whole idea of them wanting to just focus purely on development. But 2 quick questions on that. One, do you have kind of a right of first refusal on their development pipeline? And then second of all, even with the switch over to the new operator, just kind of curious why you didn't use a RIDEA structure in that scenario.", "George L. Chapman", "Yes, we do have a right of first refusal on future development that -- from Merrill Gardens. Two, it was clearly a desire on management's part at Merrill Gardens to make their company somewhat more simple and to have a development and a fill up platform. Bill and I -- Bill Pettit and I talked about that at length before they came to that conclusion. Now, why we ended up with Emeritus and a sort of modified triple-net structure, is that we thought Emeritus was -- after looking at RIDEA structures, triple-net structures with different operators, we thought they were the best fit, in large part because the footprints are so similar between Emeritus and Merrill Gardens. But what we did, even though we moved to Emeritus' preferred triple-net structure, we added an IGR, incremental gross revenues kind of feature so that we could capture some of the upside. So we thought it was really a good result. Any other comments from...", "Scott A. Estes", "No.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just last one for me. Just from a couple of quarters back, the entrance fee conversion, if you've got an update on that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, the portfolio is doing well, I had it budgeted, current on rent payments, and we're excited about what that portfolio is going to look like over the next few years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria", "I was hoping you could discuss a little bit with regards to the Avery portfolio, what the occupancy is and coverage levels given their relatively new assets, it seems?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, they are new. So several have been opened for less than 2 years and are still in the fill-up stage. So occupancy's in the low to mid-80s, certainly trending up. Payment coverage today is around 1.0, but it certainly it's going to escalate pretty substantially over the next 3 to 4 years as we bring in new facilities as well as seeing the existing assets stabilize. So around 1.0 today but I would expect a 1.2 plus within a few years.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. And then, just on the supply picture here in the States, are there any markets you're sort of watching, that you're a little bit concerned about the pick up there? And are you able to disclose sort of your top 5 MSAs with regards to seniors housing exposure just so we can compare to the industry data?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. I think we're going to actually start disclosing by MSA. We think it's going to show the diversity of our portfolio. We do track new construction pretty closely. We're really not concentrated in any of the markets where there's substantial new supply like Dallas, Denver, Houston. We just don't have much of a presence, particularly in RIDEA in those locations. So we follow it. But as of today, it's not something that we think is going to negatively impact the portfolio in any material way. And to your specific question, the top 5 markets are London, Toronto, New York, Boston, Los Angeles.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just one other question. You kind of mentioned CapEx was a little bit below a normalized level. What should we expect on a normalized level going forward?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, our previous forecast for the year 1 was $73 million. So it's only about $6 million lower at $67 million. So in our medical facilities portfolio, it's something like $5.5 million to $6 million per quarter, and the RIDEA portfolio something in the 13.5-ish million range per quarter.", "George L. Chapman", "One other comment on CapEx. I commented about our portfolio being the youngest and most modern in the sector. The MOBs in particular, that's also true in senior housing. And when you look at our CapEx relative to anyone else in the sector, it's remarkably low, which means we're generating really strong NOI growth without needing to put a lot of money into the assets. So I think it's important thing to keep in mind when you think about the quality of our real estate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Looking at the RIDEA portfolio, could you just talk about how occupancy track through the quarter? I know the average occupancy was down 30 bps. But what did the point-in-time occupancy look like?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, on the same-store pool of 118 assets as of yesterday, it's flat versus the second quarter average. But if you look at the entire RIDEA portfolio of 357 assets, the occupancy as of yesterday's about 100 basis points above the average from the second quarter. So in the aggregate, we're definitely seeing a positive trend.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Are you surprised that the same-store number is flat in the second quarter, usually when you see a ramp, maybe after the holidays and after flu season?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Not necessarily. In the aggregate, the portfolio is trending in the right direction. So we try not to worry too much about month-to-month performance. It's a well-diversified portfolio by operator, by industry type, meaning independent versus assisted, geography. I mean, things are going to fluctuate a bit quarter-to-quarter but in the aggregate, the portfolio is producing superior and consistent results.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then similarly, I thought that your new disclosures around EBITDAR coverage were great. Can you talk about the remediation plan for the senior housing properties that maybe fall under 1.05x? Is that something more occupancy-related or on the pricing side?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It's a mix. We did try to identify the 2 or 3 portfolios that we're in the process of selling. So there are a few that we'd like to exit from. The others, we're perfectly happy to own and think they're going to continue to trend in a positive direction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions on -- I was hoping to get, for the senior housing operating, the rate growth year-over-year and then Q-over-Q?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it was, year-over-year, 3.5% and quarter-over-quarter was about 2.5%.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then going back to the Merrill Gardens as it's being transitioned to Emeritus, can you talk a little bit about how that portfolio did in the second quarter year-over-year? I think that was a portfolio that had lost occupancy, regained occupancy. I'm wondering how that performed, I guess, year-over-year since it's about 25% of the senior housing operating pool, same-store pool?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Right, it's a portfolio that's mostly independent living. So it did suffer from an occupancy standpoint over the last few years. In the past years, the housing markets recovered, it has started to pick up, it's also concentrated in California and the West Coast, so markets that were particularly troubled by the housing market. Again, it's definitely moving in the right direction and we're confident that Emeritus is going to do a great job with it.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "But was that -- I mean, in the second quarter -- I mean, was that -- did that portfolio do better or worse than the average same-store NOI growth for the senior housing operator?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, Nick. It actually is coming back nicely due to the occupancy rebound you mentioned. So at least margins are up year-over-year, occupancy is up in that portfolio and actually, NOI on the second quarter of '13 versus the second quarter of '12 is actually a little bit above the company, Health Care REIT company average for the quarter.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, okay. So that's just -- what I was trying to get at is that -- so that the -- I mean, the 8-point -- the over 8% growth you did in the second quarter in senior housing operating, part of that was due to, I guess, some increased occupancy that the Merrill portfolio, which then is going to, I guess, be removed from your same-store in the third quarter or at least by the fourth quarter?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It depends when it closes. We think the transaction will close within the next 60 days. So it's just a matter of the timing.", "Nicholas Yulico - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And just one last one. I mean, I don't know if you're able to do this now, but is it possible to get an update, I mean, based on all the, meaning you guys have done a lot of acquisitions now, on your breakdown of units in IL, AL, memory care and the RIDEA portfolio versus in the triple net?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Rough numbers, the RIDEA portfolio is about 50% independent living; roughly 35%, assisted; and the balance is memory care. And then in the triple-net senior housing portfolio, it's more like 50% or 55%, assisted living; in the neighborhood of 30%, independent living; and then, the balance is memory care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "Just -- if we looked at the Avery transaction, I know you said they were their newest assets. What was kind of the selection process like? Was it them approaching you or marketing those new assets, or was that kind of the part of the portfolio that you wanted?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Avery is a privately-owned company that was backed by private equity in the U.K. So we've maintained a close relationship with the management team as well as the previous owner. So it was off market principal to principal with us in combination with the management team deciding that we'd like to go forward as partners. So we bought out their real estate and the management team bought out the operations on these 14 assets, and then we're going to develop roughly 4 properties a year going forward that we'll acquire upon opening.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "Got it. And then, George, in your opening remarks, you mentioned in the pipeline for the rest of the year, that there's significant portfolios out there. I know it's a bit early and you guys don't talk about future acquisitions much. But could you give us some detail of what that comment was referring to?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, we're still a fixture in the senior housing arena and we have our discussions with a number of operators, don't know if we'll get home or not. And then, of course, we do know that we have a significant flow of projects, both acquisitions and development from our existing operators. So we're very pleased with our potential pipeline but we're not in a position right now to identify any.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "Okay. Then the last one for me, given the significant growth of your portfolio or your company over the last year, and very solid same-store operating numbers, have you guys looked at sort of a pro forma same-store number? So in the senior housing that 8.4 would've been, what? If the properties you've acquired had been same-store? Is that up, down, sideways?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It's probably about the same. I'm just ballparking it based on the assets that aren't yet in the pool like Revera, Chartwell, Sunrise, I mean, they're all -- those are the big ones. Belmont Village, they're all -- Brookdale in the neighborhood of 8%. So I think it's about the same.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a quick one here. In looking at the lease expiration schedule in 2014, it looks like you have about, I think, it's either $20 million or $25 million of rents coming due on the triple-net senior portfolio. I was wondering if you could just kind of comment on how you see those rolling?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it's primarily 1 big portfolio in the mid-Atlantic. It's a really high-quality real estate. Payment coverage is right around 1.0, so it's a portfolio that we expect to renew at existing rental rate plus the increaser. And if the operators surprised us and didn't renew, we'd have 0 trouble releasing those assets.", "Michael W. Mueller - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Then, one last one. For the $138 million that you said was closing in 60 days, I know it's a small amount, but is that in guidance or is that x guidance?", "Scott A. Estes", "It's in our guidance, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, the coupon you quoted for what you could achieve on a new bond offering, I think it was 4.3%. How much has that moved since mid-May? And about -- where would the change be in your required returns on new investments. Just seeing if they've moved in lockstep?", "Scott A. Estes", "We're always looking at our cost of capital. I think the low we probably saw prior to May 22 was maybe in the 3.5% range on a potential new 10-year issue. The levels we're at now, again, around 4 3, it's probably right about where we're at, at the beginning of the year, notably. So Scott Brinker here can help comment how we think about transactions, which clearly, watching the debt and equity markets has resulted in a lot of discussion in our investment committee meetings as we try to continue to invest at accretive levels of positive spreads and accretive to NAV. But Scott, you want to give a little more color around how we think about the cost of capital?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, I would say the arbitrage between public and private cap rates has certainly declined a little bit. I mean, if anything, we hoped that the recent increase in cost of capital will result in cap rates not falling any further. There's a point where it seems like every transaction that we heard about was [indiscernible] the cap rate than the last one. So I'm not sure if cap rates are going to increase or not, maybe. We're just glad that they're no longer falling.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to the medical office building portfolio, within the same-store pool. Just trying to get an indication of how the health is at the top line. Can you break out what the growth rate was of the base rent, exclusive of any tenant reimbursements?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Todd, this is the medical office portfolio?", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, the operating expense growth was in the 2% range, and the NOI growth was 3%. So you've got in-place rent escalators in the 2.5% range plus the pickup in occupancy generates the 3% NOI there.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Do you guys break out what the base rent change was from the top line?", "Scott M. Brinker", "We don't. We have such little lease rollover that the change in base rent year-to-year is generally going to reflect the in place lease escalators, which is in the 2.5% range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel Nicholas.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "First question, Scott. I can't remember which one, but I can just say Scott. You mentioned that there's a lot of buyers out there, still, for assets. Are you seeing anyone new or different in there in terms of competition, non-public REITs, institutional buyers, private equity or is it mostly the same people you've been seeing for the last, say, year or 2?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it's all the same people plus it's non-traded REITs for sure, 5 or 6 of them that are aggressively looking at senior housing, skilled nursing and medical office. There are pension funds, private equity and certainly, the public REITs, and even some operators. So it's a time where it's particularly important to have a lot of relationships in the industry.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Is it -- did you feel like it's become more competitive than it was a year ago?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. You've talked about your main asset classes. What are your thoughts about hospitals?", "Scott M. Brinker", "We have almost 70 health system relationships that are sponsors of our outpatient medical office buildings. I'd say we're extremely bullish on the outpatient sector. The in-patient sector, I think, you need to be a little more careful with. The volume trends are not positive, a lot of the real estate quality is not very good, hospitals are closing and I think, more will. But if it was the right health system with a good quality real estate, with the triple-net lease structure, I think, we'd for sure take a look at it.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, did I get this right that the same-store senior housing in the RIDEA, REIT annual growth was 3.5%?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Correct.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So, George, during your commentary, you mentioned that you had started to adjust pricing a little bit simply because of the increase in your cost of capital. Could you talk a little bit about that in regards to all the key property types? And just -- when you say adjust in pricing, you're not kind of looking for deals that cap rates up by 25 bps or just kind of a general sense of what your -- what you're indicating -- what you're suggesting.", "George L. Chapman", "Well, actually, I didn't make that comment in my commentary, but we did already comment on that. And that is, as Scott Estes indicated, that is part of our investment process, we have to look at our aggregate cost of capital vis-\u00e0-vis the returns on any assets. And we do that every week. And I don't know if Scott Brinker, if you want to talk about any particular asset class but it is clearly a determining factor in terms of doing a deal or not doing a deal. But if we look at it more on the long term, of what is our long-term cost of capital versus the long-term return from particular assets. Scott, any more color? I think that's the answer, though, Tayo.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "So when you said pricing is up 5%, 10%, is there any kind of indication at this point or you're still kind of feeling things out at this point?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I think it's the latter. Feeling things out. So the recent change was over the past 60 to 90 days, so we'll see. As of today, I don't think pricing again has gone up. It just is not going down.", "George L. Chapman", "Tayo, this is not a science. Even with our existing relationships, we're going to have to look at what our current cost of capital is and to deal with them in a very upfront way and get to a good result for both parties. I will tell you this, that if the rates continue to go up, there probably will be a lag between cap rates following. There always has been. And we're going to have to be very, very careful about how we price any new investment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeremy Metz with Deutsche Bank.", "Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just 2 quick ones. In terms of the investment markets, given -- have you seen any increase in actual deal flow or deals being talked about as sellers look to get off the sidelines ahead of further potential rate increases and capture what seems to be pretty aggressive pricing right now?", "George L. Chapman", "I don't think it's meaningful. There could be, from time to time, that the company, that may have a 2-year or 3-year time horizon, that might ultimately decide to shorten it to take advantage of better pricing. But we haven't seen a lot of it.", "Jeremy Metz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one other one. You only did a little bit of dispositions this quarter but the yield was quite low compared to where you did in the first quarter. Just -- is there anything going on with what you sold this quarter? And then, just the expectations for what you have left to sell in the second half of '13.", "Scott A. Estes", "Jeremy, the expectation for the second half of '13 is still probably in the 9%-ish range. And this quarter was a little lower because we actually got out of an additional entrance fee community this quarter and we had already talked about how the rents on those were a little bit lower.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Does the transfer of the Merrill Gardens portfolio from RIDEA to triple net, should that signal to us a change in your portfolio allocation between the 2 pieces? Or does it free up some additional capacity for you to buy more RIDEA in the future?", "George L. Chapman", "I don't think it signifies anything at all about our commitments to the best operators. And our willingness in the right circumstances to do either a RIDEA or a triple net. And I think, I also indicated to you earlier in the call, Karin, that we selected with Merrill Gardens, Emeritus, because it seemed to have the right footprint to really take over the Merrill Gardens portfolio and move it along quickly. But even there, we added a gross revenues concept to allow us to capture some of the upside as well.", "Karin A. Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So we shouldn't think that you'd be biased to do more RIDEA in your next tranche of acquisitions to fill the gap. It's still going to be on a deal by deal basis?", "George L. Chapman", "Yes, deal by deal basis.", "Operator", "At this time that was our last question. This does conclude the conference.

We've all become accustomed to capital and real estate markets that are increasingly volatile because of fast-moving economic developments and significant uncertainty.", "At the highest level, of course, we are all familiar with the political wrangling, the Affordable Care Act rollout, Federal Reserve actions and international events that have impacted capital markets and fostered uncertainty about interest rates, reimbursement and health care delivery.", "At the industry level, we have seen significant capital inflows and growing developer interest in health care real estate and, as a result, cap rates have tended to remain at historically low levels at least for the best-quality assets. At the same time, the cost of capital for REITs has remained relatively low and very competitive with other capital sources. And against this background, there are 4 important messages that I want to convey to you today.", "First, our investment thesis continues to prove out quarter after quarter. Because of our strong relationships, we were able to close on gross new investments of $1.2 billion in the third quarter that are immediately accretive. That brought our year-to-date total to $5.3 billion. Because we are in the most dynamic markets and have partnered with outstanding operators, our same-store NOI growth this quarter was 3.7%. Also, because we have invested predominantly in private pay assets, we have been able to minimize the drag from reimbursement cuts and uncertainty. We have a good mix of shorter- and longer-term leases and also a good mix across geographic regions and property types, all designed to provide excellent short-term growth, while opening the door for greater upside in an improving economy.", "Second, the Health Care REIT platform, which is our unique combination of people, processes, technology and business culture, has emerged as an industry-leading platform. Let me point out just a few notable accomplishments this quarter that illustrate that point.", "Today, we will issue our first sustainability report, which documents work we have been doing on a number of fronts. I encourage you to visit our website later today to review it.", "Also, through the efforts of our relationship teams, we've arranged for operators to voluntarily participate in a group purchasing organization that could yield meaningful cost savings in food and other items. This is in addition to the property insurance program that we have already institute and have discussed on previous calls.", "At the same time, our relationship teams have developed state-of-the-art benchmarking tools to help us manage our portfolio. So in short, our progressing platform is an important reason why we can deliver consistent returns in a volatile market and provide tangible value to our partners.", "Third, we will continue to be agile and entrepreneurial in addressing market challenges. These include the needs to develop digital care plans, reduce costs, deliver care in the lowest-cost settings and implement electronic medical records. We believe these challenges present major opportunities for us. Through our industry affiliations and an emersion in health care, we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.", "Fourth, and very importantly, you should expect us to continue to invest in strategically important assets. We are not sitting out this market, although we are going to be selective in our investments. Specifically, when there are opportunities to grow in important markets or with important operators in health systems, we will seize that, and we will not hesitate to develop where and when demand justifies it. We take a long-term investment view. We will always balance strong year-over-year growth with strong long-term growth in order to maximize shareholder value.", "I will now turn the call over to Scott Brinker, who will discuss our investments in more detail, and to Scott Estes, who will review our financial performance. Thank you. Scott?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Thank you, George. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share the highlights of another quarter of internal and external growth. Our portfolio is generating consistent superior results, as evidenced by 3.7% growth in same-store NOI. We also invested $1.2 billion in a Class A real estate with an 8% initial cash yield. Our relationships continue to generate off-market accretive external growth.", "I'll start the portfolio review of senior housing, which represents 60% of our income.", "We've got a good mix of short- and long-duration leases, which allows us to deliver an attractive combination of growth and stability. Performance continues to be exceptional. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 9.4% over the prior year, well above budget, driven by a 3.6% increase in rental rates. The short duration of the leases allows us to capture the full benefit of this growth.", "Results in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. have all been strong, and our Sunrise investment is on target to meet or exceed a 6.5% yield in the second half of the year. Our triple net senior housing assets, which are churning out steady growth, are a perfect complement to our operating portfolio. Same-store NOI increased 2.8% over the prior year and we expect similar increases going forward due to contractual escalators.", "We get a lot of questions about new construction and, of course, we're focused on it as well. Supply and demand in senior's housing is all about the local market, so we monitor activity in every one of our locations. Here's what we're seeing: 58 of our nearly 700 season -- senior housing facilities have new supply entering their market area; 35 of those 58 are either in a triple net master lease or are a different service type than what is being built, so any impact on HCN will be negligible; that leaves just 23 facilities, representing only 2.6% of our income, where we'll be directly impacted by new supply. This is just one example why we built a diversified portfolio. It's also why we partner with the sector's premier operators, they'll be ready to compete with the new supply.", "The growth in the senior population and the improved economy and housing market will also help absorb the new supply. The takeaways that we expect continued strong performance in our senior housing portfolio.", "Moving to triple net skilled nursing. Same-store NOI increased 3% over the prior year, consistent with our long-term expectation. Payment coverage after management fee is unchanged from last quarter at 1.33x. Our operators in Genesis, in particular, are effectively managing through a challenging environment. Rate growth and expense control are offsetting weakness in occupancy.", "I'll wrap up the portfolio review with medical office, which represents 14% of our income. This segment is delivering steady growth. Same-store NOI increased 1.2% over the prior year. Our portfolio continues to have industry-leading occupancy and rental rates, a testament to its quality.", "The investment marketplace; it's active across the continuum. Cap rates for high-quality senior housing and medical office portfolio's remain in the 6% to 7% range. We're seeing strong interest from private REITs and private equity. The public REITs are also active. Cost of capital is virtually identical to 1 year ago. The cost of debt has increased, but so have our stock prices. Absent material changes in the capital markets, we don't see cap rates for widely marketed deals moving higher, but keep in mind that public auctions are not our focus. As an example, we invested $1.2 billion last quarter into Class A real estate headlined by investments with Sunrise, Avery, Silverado and Vibra. The initial cash yield is projected to be 8%, with annual NOI growth of more than 3%. The exceptional yield is due to favorable prices on the final round of Sunrise joint venture buyouts and the off-market nature of the negotiations. We also closed the $173 million acquisition of Merrill Gardens interest in 38 senior housing communities that we subsequently leased to Emeritus under a structure that provided HCN the downside protection of a lease, with much of the upside of a RIDEA investment. The operator transition went smoothly and the communities are exceeding expectations to date.", "Looking forward, we have active dialogue with more than 30 of our existing operating partners, for us, a powerful source of accretive deal flow in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. We round out our investment platform with new development. We've got $400 million of projects underway at initial yields that exceed acquisition cap rates by at least 150 basis points.", "Taking a longer-term view of the marketplace, private REITs and private equity tend to have relatively short holding periods. In fact, they were the sellers on many of our past acquisitions. When we're outbid, we can often walk away knowing that the assets will become an acquisition candidate before long, hopefully, with a better spread on investment the second time around. The same is true of new development that this being funded by developers in private equity. We view these buildings as future acquisition candidates. More important, health care real estate is a massive, yet fragmented, market. This creates enormous acquisition opportunities. Consolidation will continue. Over time, market forces will drive high-quality health care real estate to the most efficient owners, which we believe are the publicly traded REITs. The only variable is timing. We intend to be present, but patient.", "That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn the call to Scott Estes to discuss our financial results.", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, guys, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report that our financial position remains strong. Our capital structure continues to provide the consistent and resilient financial results you've come to expect from Health Care REIT. I have 3 simple points that I'd like to emphasize today: first, our recent $400 million debt offering provides incremental balance sheet flexibility and liquidity; second, the significant $5 billion of investments completed year-to-date is now translating into more meaningful earnings growth, both for this year and next; and third, our confidence in future earnings growth has enabled us to announce a 4% increase in our 2014 dividend payment rate today.", "I'll start with some general housekeeping items related to our balance sheet and liquidity. I'm pleased with where the balance sheet stands today. As of September 30, our net debt-to-undepreciated book capitalization was 42.2%. Currently, our debt to adjusted EBITDA is right at the 6x level, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage improved to 3.6x and 2.8x, respectively. These metrics are all in line with our strategic targets. In terms of capital and liquidity, we continue to enjoy solid access to the capital markets and have efficiently raised capital to fund the majority of transactions announced year-to-date.", "There were 3 significant capital events which have occurred since I last spoke to you in August. First, we issued just over 1 million shares under our dividend reinvestment program during the third quarter, generating $62 million in proceeds. Second, $219 million of our outstanding 3% convertible debt was redeemed or converted during the quarter, leaving $275 million outstanding. And finally, in early October, we were able to successfully raise $400 million of long-tenure unsecured debt price deal of 4.6%. This debt fits nicely into our maturity schedule and speaks to the ongoing support provided by the capital markets.", "Let's now look at the anticipated line of credit borrowings through year end, which will exclude the effects of any additional investments.", "So starting on September 30, our balance sheet shows that we had $165 million in cash and $848 million borrowed on our credit lines, resulting in $683 million of net line borrowings at quarter-end.", "After taking into account the $393 million of net proceeds from our October debt offering, these net borrowings are further reduced to $290 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect an additional $375 million of line borrowings as a result of: first, $300 million in unsecured debt with a 6% coupon maturing in November; an additional $75 million of secured debt we intend to pay off; about $100 million of projected fourth quarter development funding; less $100 million of anticipated fourth quarter disposition proceeds. So as a result, we're on track to have about $665 million of net line borrowings at year-end, providing a significant $1.6 billion of line availability net of these borrowings.", "Despite the recent market instability, our incremental cost of capital remains near historically low levels and has actually improved somewhat over the last several weeks. The weaker economic data and the Fed's potential delay in tapering asset purchases has contributed to lower interest rates in, generally, health and health care REIT stocks. Thus far, in 2013, our equity has generally performed in line with the REIT sector, generating a solid total return of approximately 10% year-to-date. Our incremental cost of debt also remains attractive based on current treasury yields and spreads.", "As a result, we continue to have access to attractively priced capital as we source new investments through year end and into 2014.", "Moving now to our third quarter earnings results. Our continued success on the investment front has translated into more significant earnings growth. Normalized FFO increased to a record $0.97 per share for the quarter, representing a strong 7% increase versus last year. Third quarter normalized FAD per share of $0.86 represented an increase of 5% year-over-year. Our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the quarter declined to 79% and 89%, respectively. Results were again driven by the combination of strong internal growth in the form of a 3.7% increase in same-store NOI, and external growth in the form of $6.7 billion of net investments completed over the last 12 months.", "And, finally, I'll conclude today with an update on our dividend payments, our enhanced disclosure efforts and guidance.", "We declared our 170th consecutive quarterly cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30 of $0.765 per share or $3.06 annually. This represents a 3.4% increase over the dividends paid in 2012 and a current dividend yield of 4.7%.", "As we move into 2014, our confidence in our portfolio's internal and external growth has allowed us to announce a 4% increase in our 2014 dividend payment rate. Our Board of Directors has approved a 2014 quarterly dividend payment rate of $0.795 per share, or $3.18 annually, beginning with the February 2014 dividend payment. Importantly, we expect that our rate of earnings growth next year can exceed our rate of dividend growth, allowing us to further drive down our payout ratios.", "Before turning to guidance, I'd like to point out several enhancements to our supplement this quarter, as we continue our concerted efforts to enhance our disclosure.", "Most notably on Page 16, we created a new page assisting NAV calculations, which provides Health Care REIT's pro rata share of both NOI and debt. Next, on Pages 5 and 8, we have added sequential same-store performance data over the trailing 5 quarters for both the seniors housing operating and life science portfolios. And finally, on Page 2, we provide new disclosure detailing our portfolio NOI concentration by asset type, and that's broken down by both country, as well as ranks by our top 20 MSAs.", "Turning last to guidance. We are increasing the midpoint of our FFO and FAD per share ranges by $0.02 today, based on the strength of our investment success and earnings results year-to-date, offset only slightly by our $400 million October debt offering. Both our new normalized 2013 FFO range of $3.74 to $3.80 per share, and FAD range of $3.29 to $3.35 per share represents 6% to 8% growth year-over-year.", "We continue to expect blended same-store cash NOI growth for the full year 2013 of 3.5%, driven by the continued strength of our seniors housing operating portfolio, which is now projected to generate very strong same-store NOI growth of approximately 7% for the year.", "As is typical for us, our guidance does not include an assumption for additional investments beyond those already announced. We do continue to expect approximately $500 million of dispositions for the year and, thus far, we've completed $407 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 6.4%, including net gains on sales. And finally, we project a total of $286 million of development conversions this year at an average initial yield of 8.5%.", "Our capital expenditure forecast remains $67 million for the year, comprised of approximately $49 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $18 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio.", "And finally, our G&A forecast for 2013 remains approximately $107 million to $108 million for the full year, which implies approximately $27 million to $28 million of G&A during the fourth quarter of 2013.", "That does conclude my prepared remarks, but I would like to leave you today with my note of confidence that we remain on excellent financial footing as we head into 2014.", "So at this point, operator, we would like to open the call up for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Scott, I was just hoping you could help us think about your balance sheet flexibility to do acquisitions going forward and how we should think about that? And sort of remind us again what are you targeting from a balance sheet perspective, most importantly, is it the level of leverage to undepreciated assets or more sort of a debt-to-EBITDA number?", "Scott A. Estes", "Juan, I believe we do look at all of those. Our general targets are 40% debt-to-undepreciated-book-capitalization, net debt-to-EBITDA of 6x or below; interest coverage and fixed charge coverage consistent with where we're at today, we're happy with that. And as a reminder to everyone, we were pleased with the ratings upgrade we received in the third quarter, the BBB flat across-the-board, so we're always trying to balance the appropriate combination of debt and equity. I believe, as I detailed in my prepared remarks, we have some nice flexibility with about $1.6 billion of pro forma availability heading into year-end. But as always, we look at the debt and equity markets and again, try to raise money when we can, proactively, and do it around attractive, accretive acquisitions.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And could you just comment just generally on sort of how you see the acquisitions market in terms of what you guys are thinking in terms of cap rates from here? And just what we should be thinking for -- relative 2014 to 2013, in terms of any sort of comfort you can give us on continued growth for the acquisitions?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Juan, this is Scott. The acquisition marketplace is very active and there's a lot of opportunity. The issue for us is a couple of things. One, is being patient, so that we're paying prices that allow us to make money day 1 and over time. So there's no question in our mind that health care REITs, over time, will end up as much bigger companies than they are today, but we have to be patient and not pay prices that don't make sense. So that's point #1. Point #2 is that we really differentiate ourselves on the number of investments, whether it's acquisition or development, that we're are able to source through our existing clients. And that is a source of accretive deal flow for us that has been very meaningful over the past 5 years. We now have a stable of operators. Seniors housing, medical office space, skilled nursing, they come to us with their opportunities to grow in their existing markets or to put up new supply where they see a need. And I think you'll see us focus on those existing clients going forward and selectively adding new ones to our portfolio.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And just lastly, I don't know if this is, maybe, for George. Is there any update to sort of the succession planning, and you've brought it up at your Investor Day a few months back, and sort of what should we be thinking about in terms of timing? If you have anything to share on that front.", "George L. Chapman", "No. In response to your question at our Investor Day, I indicated that I was going to enter into a new 3-year contract, essentially, and what happens after that, will perhaps be driven more by the marketplace and what necessarily capabilities we have at that point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nic Yulico with UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I had a couple of questions. Turning first to the same-store senior housing operating segment. I think you said you had 7% as your guidance for this year for the same-store there. And I was -- I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the non-same-store assets? How they've been performing on an annualized basis this year, since you have about 2/3 of your total senior housing operating assets not in the same-store? And if it's possible, it'd be great to have a breakdown on same-store NOI, same-store revenue and same-store expense trends for these non-same-store pool?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, we wait -- this is Scott Brinker speaking. We wait 15 months to bring assets into the same-store pool just because we didn't own these assets 12 months ago. So over the next 6 months, we'll add the Sunrise portfolio in the first quarter, the remainder of the Belmont Village assets in the first quarter, as well as Benchmark -- I'm sorry, Brookdale, in the first quarter and then, in the second quarter of next year, we'll add Revera. Overall, each of those 4 is performing at or ahead of expectations. Results are strong in all 3 countries that we invest in: U.S., U.K. and Canada. At Sunrise, in particular, is on track to meet the 6.5% initial yield that we've talked for the second half of this year.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And -- but -- I mean, as far as your 2013 results so far, I mean, how is the overall senior housing portfolio tracking? Is it below -- is it at 7%, which is where the same-store is? Or is it below that? It's just -- as we're thinking about how to figure out where the kind of true growth is of this segment, it'd be helpful to have some more statistics for the non-same-store.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, we're going through our budget for 2014 right now, so we'll have better information to share the next time we talk. But, in general, those are high-growth portfolios, so we're not expecting the addition of those portfolios to negatively impact the performance of the same-store pool.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe just another way to ask on this is, is -- I mean, what is -- I mean now that you've had maybe not quite a year but -- and you've had a decent amount of the Sunrise under your ownership. I mean, how has that portfolio been? When you talk about the 6.5% yield going forward, what was the original sort of growth expectation for that portfolio when you underwrote it? So that we can have a feel for -- in 1 year, how much NOI has been growing there.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it was in the mid- to high-single digits, so it's performing in line with our expectations. Occupancy across the portfolio is trending in the right direction. The rate growth continues to be substantially above any benchmarks that we can find and expense growth is in the range of 3%.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I appreciate the new part of the supplement showing all the MSA exposures by property segment. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about which markets concern you most for senior housing supply? I think you said only 58 of your properties are facing supply? And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that, because you have almost 700 senior housing properties and you do have exposures to some places where there are some supply. And then, as well, the -- hoping to get a little bit more clarity on that -- those remaining buckets, which are listed on the the MSA -- under the MSA segment for senior housing, because they account for about 50% of your NOIs and those of your senior housing NOIs, in those remaining buckets?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Nick, we tried to, in the prepared remarks, cut through some of the clutter that could be seen in the supplement where we show NOI by MSA and really focus at the community level. Because, ultimately, supply and demand is very much a local business. So we looked at the new construction in each of our 700 local market communities around the U.S., U.K. and Canada, and evaluated new supply. And we found that 58 of our 700 buildings do have new construction entering their primary market area. But we were able to determine that more than half of those, 35, are either in the triple net master lease or the new supplies a different service type than we provide. For example, independent living is the new supply, while our building might provide memory care services. And that left just 23 facilities in our entire portfolio, where there's new supply entering the primary market area. And that's -- those assets represent less than 3% of our total income.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. I mean, are you saying then that when you look -- first of all, when you're looking -- I mean, this is the MSA breakdowns that if we're looking at, NIC map data, that it's the same MSA breakdowns? And then when you're looking, you're saying, at a specific property level, I mean, are you saying that using a certain mile radius ring or, I mean, are you -- if there's a lot of supply going into Houston, but it's on -- if it's 10 miles away from your properties, is that getting excluded by you guys? It's not being impactful? Or -- anything more on that will be helpful.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. That's right, Nic. So we looked at the local market for all of our properties that tends to be around 3 miles, given the metro locations of these buildings. So something that, say, in Houston, was 10 or 15 miles away, we would not count that as something that is competitive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "Maybe, Scott, we'll just stick to that supply commentary for 1 second longer. In those 23 assets or markets, I guess assets, do you see the new supply impacting occupancy or rate or both? So kind of where do you think you take the hit if a new asset opens down the street?", "Scott M. Brinker", "In most cases, it's either both or neither. We included all 23. The reality is, in a number of cases, there's either a much different acuity level being provided. For example, the Silverado community often receives most of its referrals from other memory care communities, or a different price point. So we could further narrow the 23 down in terms of what's truly competitive, but we've chosen to try to present just a conservative assessment of new supply in the markets.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "If we go back to sort of your earlier comment when you talked about your longer view -- longer-term view for the company, I made a comment that a lot of the acquisition candidates would sort of round trip or come back out to the market. I was a little bit caught off guard by your comment of it being a better spread than -- was that just a fact of the company being bigger? What else do you sort of project that would -- the spread will get better? And secondly, if there are assets you like and you think they're going to come back, unless you think that the pricing is going to be off, why wouldn't you buy them today?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it's really -- the spread that I'm referring to, Manny [ph], is the -- our cost of capital against the yields that we can invest at. So over the past 3 years, there's been a pretty meaningful positive spread on investment. And over the past year, our cost of capital is about the same and cap rates have declined. So the arbitrage from our cost of capital against private market cap rates is just narrower than it used to be, so we're being cautious about where we invest our money.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "What do you see changing that, sort of, in the longer-term world?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, right now, cap rates are being depressed in large part by the private REITs who have a mandate to invest huge sums of money as quickly as they can. So there is a source of capital in the marketplace right now that isn't always present and, at some point in the future, probably won't be present. And at that point, we would expect that spread on investment to be more positive than it is today. And I think you'll see us more aggressive if that's the case.", "Emmanuel Korchman", "And then my last question, just can you remind us on your view of going into sort of new markets, whether it be Asia or elsewhere? I guess, you guys are comfortable with Canada and the U.K. at the moment, but where else might we see sort of HCN banners going up?", "George L. Chapman", "Chapman. I think that we're going to be studying -- continuing to study international markets. We've already identified certain other markets in Europe and elsewhere that are possible, but we're going to do a very exhaustive study on that before we commit and before we give any more information to The Street. But we do think that we have the opportunity to be the largest and highest-quality investor in real estate around the globe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Hey, just a quick follow-up on the supply statistics you're giving. I know you defined the service area as 3 miles, I think you said. What percentage of the residents in your communities come from that service area?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Jeff, it's Scott. I don't know the exact percentage, but we picked 3 miles because that tends to line up pretty well with where residents actually come from for these communities. You're clearly going to get some residents from outside of that primary market, but just keep in mind that, for the most part, our communities are located in top 31 MSAs or coastal markets, so they tend to be pretty dense populations. So 3 miles to us seem like a pretty reasonable estimate of what would represent a primary market area.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Right. So you don't exactly, but you would estimate somewhere over 80% or 90%? Something like that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It's probably in the 2/3 to 80% range for a typical community.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Okay. And then can you break out your same-store operating senior housing growth a little bit more in terms of lease-up in stabilized communities?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Of the 122 communities in the same-store pool, 5 of them are still in lease-up, with occupancy in the low-70s, and the stable portfolio is right around 90%. So for the most part, when you look at the same-store portfolio, you are seeing the stable portfolio, there just aren't that many lease-up assets. And last quarter, the stable portfolio actually had a slightly better performance than the lease-up portfolio in terms of NOI growth.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Okay. And then last on the skilled nursing portfolio. This quarter you had a little bit of a lower Medicare and private pay revenue mix. I know there's some sequester effect, but it's going against what you talked about when you acquired the Genesis portfolio of a continually improving Q-Mix. Can you talk about where you think Genesis is on their Q-Mix transition and where you'd expect them to be over the next year or 2?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Jeff, it's Scott again. It's definitely a challenging environment. Genesis is performing better than most skilled nursing providers, so our payment coverages have held up for the most part. The sequester, for sure, had a negative impact and the level of hospital admissions has had a negative impact on their Medicare mix as well. So I think that's -- those are the reasons for the trends that you're seeing. We do think, over time, that picks up. But clearly, there are some challenges in the operating environment that are going to make it difficult to meet sort of those original expectations.", "Scott A. Estes", "One other thing, Jeff, this is Scott Estes, that I would add is the -- one pleasant surprise has been the great rate growth in Medicaid, as well Medicare, relative to their budgets. So that I think bodes well, looking into -- over the next fiscal year. I think Medicaid rates at their facilities are actually up in excess of 3% and Medicare is up a little bit over 1%. So those are some other positive factors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And you expect a similar rate growth going into next year?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. That was basically for fiscal '14.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Oh, for fiscal '14? Okay.", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I want to start with the group purchasing organization you announced this morning. What are the services that you're including there and what do you think the opportunity is there, either in terms of improved cash flow or coverage in the portfolio?", "George L. Chapman", "Chuck Herman?", "Charles J. Herman", "Yes. It's been a voluntary program that we've implemented. We first started with the -- an insurance program, where we went out to the property insurance market and we were able to save pretty significant dollars as it relates to what they were able to get in the open market, low double-digit kind of savings, and we've increased that over time. I'm not sure the exact percent that are involved with the program this year, but we did increase the program over the first year's implementation. And then the second one that we have implemented is a group purchasing program as it relates to food. And again, this is a voluntary program. About half of our operators have gone and opted in to the program. So we're just in the rollout phase currently. So it remains to be seen exactly what the savings will be. And now we're in the process of implementing a capital expenditure program as well, trying to go out to the market and lever our portfolio so that we can get the most effective -- the effect -- most effective group purchasing possible there. I mean, I think what operators enjoy about our program is not only the group purchasing but, also, our executive forum and the ability to improve best practices because of the sharing that we do there. And we had a very successful best practices sharing meeting at the last month's NIC conference in Chicago.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And then have you looked at the rates that you're spending? Or that you think that you can purchase through that relative to where your operators are doing it today? Do you think low double-digit savings is possible for that as well?", "Charles J. Herman", "We're not exactly sure at this point in time. Certain folks have different preferences to different vendors. So each operator has a little bit different take on whether or not they think it's going to be effective or not. But what we do, because we are able to benchmark all of our statistics, we are able to go and go out to the market and explain to them exactly what the food spend is and we think we can get the best prices. But each operator, again, kind of opts in or opts out as it relates to it, but most are taking it very seriously.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And then just switching topics, the $95 million of possible acquisition in the quarter, it sounded like that was with Vibra. Are they LTAC and was that related to the Kindred acquisition in the quarter?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It was. This is Scott Brinker, speaking again. We have a long relationship with Vibra. Our business model is to identify and then provide capital to the premier providers in each segment. And although the LTAC space is not one that we have a lot of exposure to, it's less than 2% of our NOI, we do have an existing relationship with Vibra that's been very successful. They've proven to be premier operators for stabilized properties, as well as turnarounds. So we were able to buy 5 -- I'll call them post-acute facilities because they really are a combination LTACs and skilled nursing; good geographic overlapped with Vibra's existing portfolio; 2x payment coverage; the initial lease rate of nearly 10%; and best news use of all, we added all 5 of those buildings to the Vibra master lease, which already had 15 buildings with to 2-plus-times payment coverage after management fee. And then, in addition to that, we have 5 standalone leases, all LTACs, primarily holdovers from the Windrose portfolio 7 or 8 years ago that were in, again, individual leases with near-term maturity dates. We were able to add all of those 5 standalone leases into the Vibra master lease, which provides significantly enhanced security, extended the maturity date by 11 years and substantially increased both the base rent, as well as the increaser. So it was a acquisition that allowed us to support a long-time customer and also to make, we think, a pretty strong return for our shareholders.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And I know the strategic focus has clearly been on private pay assets. What gave you the comfort around potential changes in LTAC reimbursement -- that gave you enough confidence to close the deal?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, the big thing is the quality of Vibra's operations. A number of things have been talked about for changes in LTAC reimbursement, whether it's patient criteria or 25% rule, we sort of looked at all of those possibilities. And we think the potential impact on Vibra is very small and the impact on us is completely negligible, given the strong payment coverage. Just as an example, if they implemented the 25% rule tomorrow, and Vibra didn't make a single change to their operations, the impact on payment coverage would be about 3 basis points, 3. And our payment coverage is well above 2x after management fee. Second is patient criteria. And we agreed that LTAC should be caring for appropriate patients, if somebody can be cared for in a skilled nursing facility, that's where they should go. Now there is case mix index, in comparison to national average it's substantially higher, which means that they're already caring for the types of complex patients that CMS wants them to care for. So these aren't -- Vibra's not treating nursing home-type patients, they are providing value to the health care system, even with patient criteria, we think they would perform extremely well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, of the 58 properties that will likely be impacted by supply, how much will the assets be impacted? I guess, how much supply is coming online? Is that 1, 2 or 3 projects?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, it tends to be 1 new competitor for each of those 23. I can't think of any markets off hand where there are multiple new competitors.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So how much, I guess, of the supply in that 3-mile radius is being increased by that 1 asset?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. It varies. An important distinction and it's -- so I'm glad you asked the question. Our buildings are not located in rural markets. When you're in a rural market and a new competitors opens, you can be doubling the amount of supply. And there just isn't that much demand in those rural areas. So we've strategically focused on big metro markets with dense population and a lot of affluence. So even when there is a new competitor and there might be of 5% or 10% increase in the total supply, and there might be a temporary decline in occupancy or rental rates, but, over time, those are the types of markets that can support new supply. And that's why we pick them and, more importantly, why we've acquired modern purpose-built assets, that we think will stand the test of time and operated by what we think are the premier operators in the sector. It's -- in senior housing, it's a combination of you need good real estate and you need good operations, and it's both, it's not either or.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and these projects will be done within the next 12 months or so?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Over the next 2 years.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "2 years?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It takes -- so NIC tracks everything that's under construction. And then in Canada and the U.K., we just, with our partners, have identified all of the new supply. The typical project would take between 15 to 18 months from start to finish, and there will be some outliers, but that would be a good average.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you give us some more color on the operating performance in the senior housing portfolio? Was there any specific locations, regions or markets that drove the results? Or was it pretty much broad-based across the portfolio?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It's pretty broad-based. One thing that we've noticed after 3 years of operating investments is that it's paid off to have a diversified group of operators. So from quarter-to-quarter, one may do a little bit better, one may do a little bit worse. But on average, we've been able to generate extremely attractive growth in the neighborhood of 8%, on average. And it's been remarkably consistent from quarter-to-quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel Nicholas.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I just got a couple odds and ends left here. Scott, the $67 million CapEx guidance, that implies a pretty big number in the fourth quarter. I assume that, that seasonality, as opposed to a much higher level we should look at going forward?", "Scott A. Estes", "I think that's right, Rob. We always see the fourth quarter as the highest quarter of the year.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I noticed that the pricing in senior housing RIDEA portfolio went up pretty dramatically from the second quarter to third quarter. I assume that's because of the absence of the independent living Merrill Gardens assets. Do you have either same-store or non same-store year-over-year rate number that you can share with us?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Rob, this is Scott Brinker. You're asking for year-over-year rental rate growth?", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it was 3.6% in the same-store pool.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I'm assuming, again, the reason why it went up from Q2 to Q3, that it was because of the absence of Merrill Gardens and, I guess, the addition of the assets that came on the quarter. But that -- no -- that was -- yes, because that's not same-store.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Rob, it was due to the elimination of Merrill Gardens.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. Okay. And then the small number, but I noticed that in the disposition schedule in the supplemental, you had one disposition that had no yield. Was that some sort of nonperforming asset, I assume?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it's -- Rob, this is Scott Brinker. It was a hospital in Texas that we just chose to be conservative in how we were recognizing or not recognizing income. And as it turns out, we were able to sell it for a small gain. So, I guess, we could have been more aggressive about recognizing income, but we just, year-to-date, had chosen not to recognize any income on that investment.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question. When you talked about the same-store being predominantly stable. The concern, obviously, comes up that you've been putting up some really good same-store numbers and we kind of wonder when that's going to regress to some sort of long-term average that might be a little bit lower than 8%, 9%. Any commentary around that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, we're feeling the pressure too, Rob. Yes. It's a -- the performance has just wildly exceeded our expectations. So we guided people to 4% to 5% annual growth in that portfolio and it's done consistently 8%-plus. We don't think that continues forever, but we are confident that it will continue to provide growth that's well in excess of inflation and well in excess of what we could get under the triple net lease. So whether that's next year or 2015, I'm not sure, but we don't think 8% will last forever, but we are very confident that we'll continue to produce growth that beats inflation and the triple net lease.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Right. So there's no addition to the same-store bucket or anything like that, that you see running that into a wall?", "Scott M. Brinker", "No, the additions next year: Revera, Sunrise, Brookdale, I think all of those are either accretive or breakeven to the growth rate of the portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple quick ones. My questions revolve around the medical office building portfolio. Just trying to get a feel for the general health of the segment. Can you talk about the change in rents, 1 and 2, the length of leases in the quarter on all renewals?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, the -- this is Scott Brinker speaking, Todd. The renewals -- the terms have been longer than what we have budgeted, 6-plus years, without a whole lot of CapEx or tenant improvements that were necessary. So from that perspective, the activity on renewals has exceeded our expectations. On average, for the portfolio, our maturity date is about 8 years. And an important characteristic for our portfolio is that there is very little turnover, especially for the next 3 years. Less than 20% of our leases in total, over the next 3 years, rollover. So we feel like this is really a steady, predictable, stable base for our portfolio.", "Scott A. Estes", "The only thing I would add to it, Todd, Scott Estes, is the NOI growth projection is about 1% to 2% for the year. And I'm in agreement with everything Scott said to his point. Only 5% of the portfolio is rolling specifically in 2014, so a really low number. And occupancy was down only slightly, 20 to 30 basis points, in the quarter but it's still, I think, the industry leading at 94.1%. And the commentary on that were it was just a handful of different smaller tenants that didn't renew, reasons like retirement and practice breakups that the guys expect the occupancy to be back up in the fourth quarter.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then -- and that attributes to the decline on the retention rate, I assume?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. To a slight extent, yes.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just going back to the change in rates. Have you guys disclosed what the rents moved to or were they flat?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Rents for the whole portfolio this year were up about 1%, 1.5%. So it's not a high-growth sector, but, again, we feel it's a nice predictable, stable base.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just to stay on that theme, Scott. The 6.9% yield you got on the medical office building you purchased, what kind of growth do you underwrite on that? And where is it located? And can you give any -- the primary specs, what does it look like? Whether it's on campus, multi-tenant hospital affiliation, that kind of stuff?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Todd, it's in Boynton Beach, Florida. It is sponsored by the Bethesda Health System, one of dominant providers in that market area. They take the vast of the space. A big building, very much focused on out-patient care, so it has all the characteristics that we look for in a medical office building.", "Scott A. Estes", "128,000 square feet.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. And the growth profile tends to be in the 2% growth-per-year range.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Stephen Mead with Anchor Advisors.", "Stephen Mead - Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC", "Can you talk about the international portfolio from the standpoint of that the issue of contributing to growth and the kinds of returns? And then in terms of the kinds of segments that you would look at for sort of international investment, just in terms of managing risk and balancing return, what are your thoughts on that side?", "Scott M. Brinker", "This is Scott Brinker speaking. We entered Canada and the U.K. over the past 18 months and really that's an extension of what we're doing in the U.S. So our investments are focused on modern, purpose-built, private pay senior housing assets. In Canada, we have nearly $1.5 billion invested, with the 2 leading providers in that country, Chartwell and Revera. Our assets are located primarily in the top 5 metropolitan markets. It's really an independent living facility portfolio, there's not much health care provided. And to date, their performance has been terrific. We've received an initial yield on that investment well above 7% in total between Revera and Chartwell. So we feel like for a high-quality independent living private pay portfolio, the returns are very attractive versus what you would get in the U.S., with an attractive growth profile as well, that we think is accretive to, say, the overall at 3.7% that we reported this year. And then in the U.K., we have, again, over USD 1.5 billion invested to private pay seniors housing, primarily with Sunrise in Metro London. These are really the cream of the crop in terms of assets, all private pay. There is some lease-up potential as well, because the assets are so new. So again, attractive yield that we think is superior to what we could get in the U.S. for comparable assets and an attractive growth profile as well.", "Stephen Mead - Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC", "Okay. But I mean, is the contributing growth from the international, is that at a higher growth rate than with the U.S.?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, these particular portfolios we think, again, are accretive to even the 3.7% same-store growth that we reported this quarter.", "Stephen Mead - Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC", "Well, I was just looking at the 9.4%, on the senior housing operating one.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. Well they are major components of that, Chartwell in particular. So they are growing in line with that rate.", "Stephen Mead - Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC", "Okay. Okay. And then just in terms of that segment and the sensitivity to the economy, wealth creation it's independent -- it's basically housing. It's independent housing at a very high level. And I was wondering what the Canadian and the U.K. competitive position was in terms of new supply and also what you're seeing in the case of new supply in the U.S -- just in that segment, in the senior housing?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. This is Scott again. The new supply in Canada and U.K. is not as well-defined as it is in the U.S. And I see database has been, I think, helpful for everybody to track new supply in the U.S. and that was the basis of our analysis. But we did look at Canada and the U.K. as part of the initial underwriting and then, on a quarterly basis, from an asset management standpoint, to assess new supply and we included both the U.K. and Canada in the numbers that I've provided in the prepared remarks.", "Stephen Mead - Anchor Capital Advisors, LLC", "And what about the ability of the market to kind of absorb the rent increases or to pay those kinds of rents from just a wealth and a segment standpoint?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. I think that's the real question. So we've been purposeful in acquiring the top-quality buildings in markets that are, at least relative to other areas of those countries, affluent and densely populated. So we're doing our best to take markets and buildings that will stand up better than the others. But clearly, at some level, senior housing is impacted by what's happening in the economy. So we can't predict that, we're just doing the best we can to be well-positioned, to outperform.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just along that same line of questioning, giving a major exposure now to the U.K., and as well as Canada, are there any of the developed market that you kind of see out there that have those kind of characteristics that you would be interested in?", "George L. Chapman", "You're talking internationally?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes. It is.", "George L. Chapman", "We have studied a few others, but we're not prepared at this point to indicate a certain direction, Tayo.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "But are there others out there that seem attractive like when you just kind of take a look at the overall landscape, without mentioning any particular market?", "George L. Chapman", "Well, I think we thought the U.K. and Canada were very attractive for a lot of reasons, including similar cultures and backgrounds. So at this point, we're not prepared to suggest other markets, but we do think, over time, that there are some common themes that are arising all over the globe, and that would be that, in fact, there is a movement in many countries toward private pay and for getting the government out of certain activities, given the cost and the burdens on government. But at this point, we're not prepared to talk about any individual countries.", "Operator", "That was our final question. Thank you for joining. This concludes the conference.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations & General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Miller", "Thank you, Brooke. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Health Care REIT's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com.

During the last five years, we have grown our platform by $20 billion of high quality investments, while at the same time disposing of $2 billion of non-core assets. And from our standpoint both are critical to growing a sector leading quality portfolio. And we also believe that these investment results have confirmed our strong leadership position in the healthcare REIT sector.", "As I reflect on what we accomplished last year and the opportunities in the senior housing and healthcare sector moving into 2014 and beyond, a few important themes emerge. First, our team and our operators continue to execute very effectively. Our 2013 investment volume of $5.7 billion including an additional $400 million of gross investments in the fourth quarter, attest to the fact that we build relationships and structure deals that create value. Our operating partners continue to deliver on their growth plans and our property management groups delivers best-in-class service while keeping our outpatient care facilities at industry-leading occupancies with solid rent growth.", "And as our announcement last week of the Sunrise recap demonstrates our excellent working relationships with our current partners, has allowed us to transition to a long-term capital arrangement with a outstanding Revera team, another trusted partner. As most of you know, Revera is wholly owned by PSP, the second largest pension fund in Canada. And based on the strength of this arrangement, Sunrise is and will continue to be one of the foremost international senior housing operators.", "Briefly on the capital side. Our U.K. debt offering and other capital markets activities in 2013 underscore our disciplined management, both of our balance sheet and enterprise risk, and we are executing effectively on all fronts. Second, expect us to exploit market opportunities in order to improve both the stability and growth of our earnings. There is a tendency by many industry observers to view trends in static terms. That is to say, trends are analyzed without considering the fact that we and other market participants will both shape and respond creatively to these trends. We view trends in dynamic terms, so we will always be active in addressing both the opportunities and the challenges many of you have identified. Let me give you an example of what I mean.", "We are a first mover in the vibrant and growing U.K. and Canadian markets because we saw markets that needed capital and were in transition. Our move into these markets was an extension of our relationship partner approach, and has diversified and enhanced our growth. It has also proven to be a significant advantage for us in terms of winning new opportunities going forward. Third, we continue to redefine the healthcare REIT space and accelerate its acceptance as a core property class. I should add that with the addition of Tim Naughton to our board, we look forward to exchanging ideas and processes from the multifamily and senior housing sectors to the benefit of each.", "Our team is doing a great work with regard to data collection and analysis. That will continue to increase the depth and breadth of the information we provide to the investor community. Our operators are seeing this capability in numerous ways, including, state-of-the-art benchmarking work we are doing with respect to operating metrics. We will also be rolling out our new website later this month which will have some features that we think the investor community will embrace. And of course, we maintain our active leadership role in a wide range of industry association initiatives. We are indeed immersed in this sector.", "You will continue to hear us discuss the resiliency and growth of our platform. The two are not mutually exclusive. Our portfolio architecture is designed for both which believe is a differentiator for a healthcare REIT. We all know that the dominant demographic reality of the industrialized world is the aging population. Furthermore, every care provider will increasingly need to participate in the integrated care delivery model. With our immersion in healthcare, we are uniquely and positively positioned to ride that wave.", "I will now turn the call over to Scott Brinker, who will give you additional perspective on the resiliency and growth of our platform over the past quarter and for the year.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, thank you, George. I am happy to share our outstanding fourth quarter and full year performance and our positive outlook for 2014. I will start with senior's housing, which represents 60% of our income.", "Performance in the operating portfolio continues to exceed expectations. Same store NOI grew 6.2% over the comparable quarter and by 7.4% for the full year. Our best in class Sunrise portfolio is performing in line with our high expectations. Last week, we announced an expansion of our deep relationship with Revera and its owner, PSP, a triple A rated Canadian pension fund. Revera will soon acquire a 76% interest in the Sunrise Management Company, replacing KKR and Beecken Petty. The change in ownership is an outgrowth of our discussions with PSP and Revera over the past year on numerous potential projects.", "They share our partnership-based approach to business, our long-term investment horizon, and our commitment to improving seniors housing. Two of the premier senior living platforms will now be united under a single umbrella though Sunrise and Revera will remain independent companies with separate management teams, brands and headquarters. HCN will own the remaining 24% interest and we are essentially rolling over our existing stake.", "Turning to triple-net senior housing. The portfolio continues to churn out steady growth. Same store NOI grew 2.9% over the comparable quarter and by 2.8% for the full year. Senior housing fundamentals remain favorable. Demand has been growing faster than supply and is expected to continue doing so in 2014. Looking forward, there are questions about the impact of new supply. Last quarter we talked about the percentage of our NOI that\u2019s impacted by new construction. This quarter I would like to share with you the actual performance of our buildings that were impacted by new supply over the past few years.", "Despite the new competition, the impacted buildings still produced 5% annual NOI growth over the 2-year before and after measurement period. 5% growth is only slightly below the growth rate in the rest of our portfolio during that time period and is, of course, still very strong. More globally, demand for senior housing benefits from unstoppable forces, such as the growth in the senior population, increased product awareness, and a decline in family caregiver ratio. The short and long-term outlook is attractive.", "So let's talk about how we are positioned to capitalize. We have a nice mix of short and long duration leases, modern buildings, and we are concentrated in growing, densely populated markets. These characteristics position HCN to deliver superior internal growth. We have been more selective about picking our operating partners. They are shaping the future of the industry for the better. They have embraced our executive forum, where we discuss best practices around topics such as resident and worker safety, electronic medical records and tracking resident outcomes. All of these efforts help advance the industry. We are using our scale to do group purchasing that results in savings in food, supplies, CapEx and insurance.", "Moving to skilled nursing. Our portfolio is in good shape. We are very comfortable with the quality of our buildings and operators, thanks our investment and disposition activity. Earnings growth is strong and consistent. Same store NOI increased 3% for both the comparable quarter and the full year. Payment coverage after management fee is stable at 1.33 times. Genesis now accounts for more than 80% of our skilled portfolio. We expect roughly 1.3 times fixed charge and facility level payment coverage this year as Genesis continues to validate our view that it's a premier post-acute operator.", "I will wrap up the portfolio review with medical office, which represents 15% of our income and is delivering steady growth. Same store NOI increase 1.3% over the comparable quarter and by 2.2% for the full year. Looking forward, the ongoing wave of hospital and physician consolidation is a huge positive for our business. Our tenants are becoming bigger and stronger. We also benefit from the relentless shift to outpatient care. We own modern buildings that were purposely constructed to deliver outpatient services. As a result, our buildings are critical to our tenants' ability to capture market share in the local markets.", "Let's turn to investments. Last quarter we invested $410 million with an initial cash yield of 7.1%. The activity was headlined by $99 million of acquisitions with Benchmark, our fourth largest operating partner and a leading provider in New England. We also invested $126 million in the six medical office buildings. The average age was just four years and all six are affiliated with leading health systems. We also had $112 million of dispositions. The yield on sale was 7.8%, an attractive sale price given these were old, non-core assets. More important, we are nearly at the finish line at the $2 billion plus non-core disposition program that we initiated a few years ago. We have emerged with a premier quality portfolio that should produce excellent internal growth going forward.", "After investing $20 billion over the past four years, we are getting questions about a slow down. From our shoes, we see continued opportunity. We are one of the largest owners in this sector, yet our market share is in the low single-digits. Second, healthcare real estate is quickly becoming a core asset class, which will accelerate the movement of real estate to institutional owners like HCN. Third, we have a platform to invest across multiple countries. Add to that our deep relationship with the providers who are at the leading edge of consolidation and the acquisition potential is tremendous.", "So as we move into 2014, expect us to be active in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. As always, we will complement our acquisitions with new development. Our existing partners are doing more than $1 billion of new development each year. A portion of those projects will be funded by HCN and we will be the takeout on many of the others. We also continue to develop more than $100 million of preleased medical office buildings each year. Our investment team has been very busy the past few years and we don\u2019t expect that to change in 2014.", "I will now turn the call to Scott Estes to discuss our financial results and guidance.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning everyone. I will conclude our prepared remarks by focusing my comments on three specific topics today. First, our efforts to provide greater portfolio transparency through enhanced disclosure. Second, the strength of our financial picture and liquidity as a result of our fourth quarter capital transactions. And third, our record fourth quarter earnings results and 2014 guidance, which demonstrates the strength of our internal and external growth vehicle.", "So I will begin with a brief update regarding our latest efforts to enhance our disclosure. As George mentioned, we continue to look for opportunities to improve transparency. On February 24, we will launch our new website. We believe it will provide a more logical, user-friendly interface providing quick and efficient access to key portfolio information. The most significant enhancement will be an interactive property map that will provide a better understanding of our specific locations by property type throughout the U.S., Canada and the U.K. In addition, everyone has wanted our individual property level addresses for a long time and we are excited that our new site will provide that.", "Turning now to our financial picture. In terms of capital and liquidity, we continue to enjoy excellent access to the capital markets and raised approximately $1.3 billion during the quarter through two separate unsecured debt offerings. In early October, we raised $400 million of long 10-year notes, priced to yield 4.6%. And in early November, we completed our highly successful, inaugural U.K. unsecured debt offering by issuing \u00a3550 million of 15-year notes, priced to yield 4.875%. Based on exchange rates at the time, this translated into $887 million U.S. dollars. These offering fit nicely into our maturity schedule and have extended our average unsecured debt maturity to 9 years at a blended rate of 4.4%.", "In addition, we issued a little over 1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program during the fourth quarter, generating $62 million in proceeds. With over $2.1 billion of credit line capacity and $158 million in cash at year-end, we are in a very comfortable liquidity position entering the New Year.", "Moving to the balance sheet. We used the proceeds from our unsecured debt transactions to pay down over $1.1 billion of line borrowings and other debt during the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced our line balance from $848 million to $130 million, paid off $300 million of 6% senior notes maturing in November, and repaid $95 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.9%. As a result, our balance sheet remains in a strong position and note that we have limited near-term debt maturities in 2014 with only $330 million of secured debt maturing this year.", "In terms of financial metrics. As of December 31, net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 42.6%. Our net debt to EBITDA stood at 6.1 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage remains solid at 3.4 times and 2.7 times respectively. In addition, secured debt represented only 13% of total assets. These metrics are all generally in line with our strategic targets.", "I will conclude my comments today with an overview of our fourth quarter earnings results and update on our dividend payments and the key assumptions driving our 2014 guidance. Normalized FFO increased to a record $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter while FAD came in at $0.86, both representing a strong 16% increase year-over-year. Our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the fourth quarter declined to 77% and 89%, respectively. Results were driven by the same store cash NOI increase of 3.1%, the $5.2 billion of net investments completed during 2013, and the fact that last year's quarter was negatively impacted by the capital raised in advance of our Sunrise investments that closed in early 2013. Importantly, for the full year , normalized FFO and FAD per share increased to solid 8% to $3.81 and $3.36, respectively. We will pay our 171st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 20 of $0.795 per share or $3.18 annually. This represents a 3.9% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 5.6%.", "Turning last to guidance. In terms of same store cash NOI growth, we are forecasting growth of 3% to 3.5% in 2014. This is based on the combination of higher growth expected out of our operating portfolio and the more stable growth predicted for our longer-term net lease portfolio. To break down this forecast by asset type. For our seniors housing operating portfolio, we are projecting growth of 5% or better as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operators performance. I note that this forecast includes the entire Sunrise investment beginning with the first quarter and the Revera investment beginning in the third quarter of the year. I'd also point out that since we have only five properties in fill-up in our same store pool, our stable portfolio is also projected to grow same store NOI by a solid 5% in 2014.", "For our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, we are looking for 3% to 3.5% growth. For our post-acute skilled nursing portfolio, an increase of 3%. For our MOBs an increase of 1.5% to 2%. And last for our two smallest portfolios, we expect our hospital assets to generate a 2% to 2.5% increase, while for life science we expect the result to be slightly negative due to 205,000 square feet of space expiring in 2014. But remind everyone, this represents only 1% of projected NOI. In terms of our investment expectations, we do not include additional acquisitions in our formal guidance. However, as Scott mentioned, you should expect us to generate continued investment opportunities from our existing partners. We also intend to develop selectively to further enhance the quality of our portfolio.", "Our 2014 guidance includes $235 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.6%. Our forecast also includes approximately $250 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 9.5%. Our capital expenditure forecast is $66 million for 2014, comprised of approximately $46 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, with the remaining $20 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio.", "Our G&A forecast is approximately $127 million for 2014. We feel great about our platform and have been focused on the balance between appropriately growing our infrastructure while maintaining our focus on operational efficiency. We've seen some nice improvement in this area. Of note, during 2013 our total G&A declined to 46 basis points of average assets, down 7 basis points versus the prior year and in line with the average of the ten largest REITs in the industry. For the first quarter of 2014, we anticipate G&A of approximately $33 million to $34 million which includes about $3 million of accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation. At this point, we believe the vast majority of our staffing needs have been met. We have right sized the platform to accommodate our recent investment activity and we are well positioned for future growth.", "Finally, we expect to report 2014 FFO in a range of $3.93 to $4.03 per diluted share, representing 3% to 6% growth over normalized 2013 results. Our 2014 FAD expectation is in the range of $3.53 to $3.63 per diluted share, representing a 5% to 8% increase. These estimates are driven primarily by acquisitions completed over the last 12 months and another year of strong internal growth expected from our existing portfolio.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. So I'd like to leave everyone with our collective sense of confidence in our portfolio and financial position, and the flexibility provided by more than $2 billion of liquidity entering 2014.", "At this point, operator, we'd like to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Nicholas Yulico with UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS", "Turning to the senior housing operating segment. Can you help us understand how to think about that portfolio, how it did in 2013 going in, versus what you're saying for the same store guidance in 2014 since the pool is changing? I guess, first, how many assets are going to be in that pool for 2014?", "Scott Brinker", "Nick, this is Scott Brinker. By the end of the year, all 327 plus or minus, will be in the same store pool. Most of them come in in the first quarter. That includes Sunrise, Brookdale and a number of Belmont Village communities. And then in the third quarter we'll bring in the 47 Revera communities.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS", "Okay. And as we think about -- because in 2013 it was only about, I think, a third of your entire senior housing assets were in the same store pool which put up over 7% NOI growth. I mean, was the NOI growth much different for the other assets which are now entering the pool this year?", "Scott Brinker", "No. There isn't a material difference in the portfolio quality or the growth characteristics of last year's same store pool versus what will be in the same store pool this year. So, we're still confident about the growth prospects for that portfolio. The guidance is 5%, hopefully we'll beat it.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS", "Okay. And then turning to that 5% guidance. Could we get the breakdown of that as far as the same store revenue growth versus the expense growth for this year?", "Scott Brinker", "Sure, Nick. It's still Scott speaking. Revenue growth is roughly 4% in the budget and that's consistent with what we achieved in 2013 and then operating expenses are expected to increase in the 3% to 3.5% range, which again is consistent with what we've experienced recently.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS", "Okay, great. And just one last question is, if I look at the fourth quarter same store numbers for the senior housing operating segment, you did 4.3% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Occupancy was roughly flat which implies I guess your rate growth was somewhere in that 4.5% range, which seems pretty high relative to the industry. Is there something I am missing there or is that -- are you guys actually getting over 4% rate growth?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. That's exactly what happened, Nick. We've been tracking that for the last three or four years. And the average rate growth in our portfolio has been in the 4% range per year. That compares to the NIC averages in the 1.5% to 2% range. So we think it's a couple of things. One is the quality of the buildings and locations, and most importantly is probably the quality of the operating partners. Because senior housing is unique and that it's very much dependent upon the quality of the real estate, but even more so on the quality of the operating partner and we've been very careful about which operating partners we've put into that operating or RIDEA portfolio.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS", "And just following up on that. So then the 4% same store revenue growth this year expected for senior housing, is that mostly rate growth or is there some occupancy increase assumption there?", "Scott Brinker ", "Well, it's a little bit of both. But we try not to get too specific about whether it's occupancy or rate because you may trade some of that off one against the other over the course of the year. So, we're relatively indifferent between the two. Ultimately, we're trying to grow NOI over the long-term and provide great value to the customers so that they're willing to pay the rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with BMO Capital Markets.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "So I've just got kind of a question for the long term, and it sounds, obviously, you're very confident about how things are looking for the senior housing business today. But what gives you the confidence that there won't be a return to, call it circa 2000, 2001 in terms of supply. What kind of dynamics in the marketplace do you think will preclude an event like that happening another time around, or do you think it will happen eventually?", "George Chapman", "Let me start, Rich, it's Chapman. A couple of things strike me. One, in the earlier period, a major part of the problem frankly related to Wall Street supporting a number of companies. And in order to make the numbers work, frankly, operators that became public were pushed to frankly overdevelop. And I think that's changed considerably. The other thing that happened earlier when senior housing was sort of new, was that folks did not focus enough on just how important the service component was and the care component was. So it's not for everybody, and that should mean that a lot of developers stay out. I think, finally, as you're looking down the road quite a bit, the actual demand component in five years, probably more like ten as you look at the average age today, goes up as well. So I think there is a lot to protect us from that same kind of a problem. I don't know if any of my colleagues want to add anything.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, in terms of the transaction recapitalization of Sunrise. What would you say to the argument that smart money, namely KKR, is bowing out of the business of managing senior housing assets and that we shouldn't be kind of looking at that as a red flag that there's something negative on the horizon? Thoughts on that thesis?", "George Chapman", "Rich, I'll start again and let Scott Brinker take over. But each of KKR and Beecken Petty, and Dan Decker have been in senior housing for quite a while. And KKR specifically, as you mentioned, is a major investor in another senior housing company and is looking for more. So, I think it is more just the timing that is so important here of when we reposition the company from shorter term horizon lenders to a longer term perspective that is represented by Health Care REIT and Revera backed by PSP.", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Rich, it's Scott. I'd also add that there is a long list of private equity and pension funds that are pouring money into the space right now and aggressively chasing acquisitions and new development. So, this is, in our minds, one of the few PE firms exiting an investment as opposed to looking for more. And from everything we know, KKR, they are happy about their investment in Sunrise and are actively looking to do other things in the sector. They have a pretty big investment with a private REIT called Sentio and are actively looking to do other things. So this is not an exit from the business by any means.", "Rich Anderson - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Fair enough. And then last question. In past years, you would always lead off your guidance with some assumption about acquisitions, and you haven't done that in the past few years and yet you sound like you will continue to be very active. I'm curious, what was the reason for taking back that means by which you provided guidance? Is it just you want to be more conservative, or is there something out there different that makes it a little bit tougher for you to target a number?", "Scott Estes", "Rich, it's Scott Estes. I don't think there is anything too much to read into here. I think we've been pretty consistent with how we talk about our base line of investment expectations as a result of our strong operator relationships. And we, again, to remain consistent have chosen not to include the number in our guidance, but I think everyone knows we've been pretty consistent with sourcing a nice base line level of incremental investments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citi", "Scott, maybe if we can just stay on that same point for a second. If we look at the relationship deals that you guys typically do, how much sort of foresight do you have on those deals and what volumes might close even if you are not sharing that number with us?", "Scott Brinker", "So I can take this, Scott Brinker. Mannie, it's always hard to predict the exact timing, I think that's the biggest issue. It is very much a partnership approach. So we're ready to buy when they're ready to sell, and we think that some of that will happen in 2014, some of it will happen in 2015 and maybe some after that. So we have an identifiable pipeline of acquisitions. I think that's unique. Our existing partners by our count, own or control more than $20 billion of real estate that we don't own yet, that at some point I think we could. But whether that happens over one, two or five years is very difficult to predict.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citi", "Great. Maybe we can talk about deal cost for a second. They seem to be pretty high quarter in and quarter out whether or not you guys close sort of high volumes of deals or lower ones, obviously higher in the quarters where you do close a lot of deals. Should we be reading into those at all? Are those deals that just didn't close and maybe will? Or do you run other costs through that line that we should sort of be aware of?", "Scott Brinker", "Mannie, you're referring to the transaction cost line...", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citi", "Yes.", "Scott Estes", "And it's been, I would say, running a little bit higher than normal. And an in short, we would expect that to generally run probably 1% to 1.5% of investment volumes. And the main reason it's been running a little bit higher through 2013 was the nature of the transactions we completed, the larger size. Such as the Sunrise transaction, acquiring a public company where you have fees and severance and legal and other associated costs. So, there's nothing really to read into that. We would generally expect it to trend more towards the 1% to 1.5% range of investments going forward.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citi", "And then Scott, just to wrap up. How do you think about your investment spreads? Like where do you think, given the cap rates that you disclosed in the release, where do you see your weighted average cost of capital and how do you guys think about that internally?", "Scott Brinker", "That seems to change quickly. But if you look at just the trailing reasonable period of time, it seems to be in the low-6s as today's cost of capital. And then importantly, we know that equity shareholders are looking for growth in the dividend, so we try to find investments that are going to provide that 3% plus, hopefully 4% and 5%, annual growth rate to the equity shareholders. So, low-6s and targeting IRRs in the high single-digits.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays", "I am here with Jack as well. And I appreciate the coming new disclosures, looking forward to that next week. But just maybe staying on that capital issue, I think you have about 43% debt-to-cap. Even with some of these divestitures, I think it comes down but still above 40%. So now in terms of equity raises, would you guys be amenable to raising equity in this environment or would you only do that if there was a significant transaction that would require an equity raise?", "Scott Estes", "I don't feel like we need to raise any money anytime soon. You did point out the dispositions that are in our guidance. We have our full line available. So in essence that's $2.25 billion plus $250 million of dispositions. We also receive a rate of about $240 million a year through our dividend reinvestment program, which is a nice help. So, in short, we do remain committed to getting our debt to undepreciated book cap down towards the 40% range over the long-term. But there's no pressing needs to do anything, it really is contingent as always upon our pace of new investment.", "Joshua Raskin - Barclays", "Okay. That\u2019s fair, Scott.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays", "Hi, this is Jack everybody. Maybe for Scott Brinker. You mentioned you are expecting consistent coverage at 1.3 times for post-acute this year. What are some of the underlying expectations for Genesis in terms of admissions, length of stay and rates for 2014?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, in 2013, census was a bit down. That was true across the sector. Genesis had very nice rate growth and controlled expenses well and I would expect really a continuation of that trend in 2014. So we're not expecting massive increases in occupancy and low single-digit increases in Medicaid and Medicare rates, and expense growth in the 3% to 3.5% range.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays", "Got you. Okay. So it sounds like continued progress admissions, length of stay pressure and then the rate should be relatively consistent. Does that sound about right?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. I think that's right. Our increases are just below 3.5% each year and the roughly growing NOI at the same rate. So that ultimately leads to the flat payment coverage.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays", "Got you. Okay. And then looking at the RIDEA portfolio, is there anything else that you are seeing in terms of occupancy in the quarter? I liked some of the comments around supply. I guess I was just expecting a little bit more sequential improvement given the NIC data trends in that. Again, we're using average occupancy and we've had an upward slope throughout the year.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. Nothing to read into it. We're reporting our fourth quarter results here. That tends to be a pretty slow quarter for senior housing, just because of the weather in particular. So this isn't unusual at all. In our minds, we see occupancy to be a little bit down and hopefully it starts to pick up in the second and third quarter in particular.", "Scott Estes", "We had a pretty solid growth in the comparable quarter last year. I think it was up 8.6%. So, I think that played a little bit into it, but 6.2% is still a pretty strong number.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question come from Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "What was the valuation of the Sunrise operating company on the recent sale and how did that compare to the valuation during the acquisition?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Jeff, from our standpoint, we're really just rolling over our investment, and PSP as a private company has asked not to talk about purchase price. That's not something that they have to do, unlike us. So we are honoring their commitment.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Fair enough. So, Scott Brinker, you mentioned the 5% NOI growth in the senior housing properties that were directly affected by new supply. Were there any redevelopment costs or excess capital that went into those properties to help generate that or is that really just an apples-to-apples number?", "Scott Brinker", "It's pretty apples-to-apples. I mean, there are situations where you want to invest in front of new competition coming into the marketplace and we are doing some of that. But it's not like we hoard hundreds of millions of dollars into these assets so that they could compete with the new supply.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. Along those lines. It looks like your CapEx guidance for the senior housing operating portfolio in '14 is about $1,300 a unit, which is about what you spent this year. I'm just trying to square that with $2,000 plus a unit CapEx requirements I hear from private operators. Was there a lot of capital put in at the time of purchase or what should I be thinking about as a run rate going forward?", "Scott Estes", "Jeff, it's Scott Estes. I think the number, I don't know how you're calculating it, and it's a little tricky using unit counts based on our ownership interest. We're calculating about $1,700 per unit and that's been fairly consistent. But your point about the average age of the facilities and the money that has already gone into them, I think keeps that number a little bit lower and fairly consistent by our calculations, about the $1,700 per unit range.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. So, you think you're at a good run rate now going forward?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors", "Okay. Last question, you have $21 million or so of senior housing rental income expiring in 2014. Is that tied into your disposition guidance, or how should we be thinking about that?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Jeff, it's Scott Brinker. That's a portfolio in the mid-Atlantic that is super high quality. We did a shorter-term lease on that acquisition a couple of years ago, so that's the reason that it's expiring. We fully expect that operator to either renew at the current rent plus an increase there, or if they surprised us and didn't renew, we would have plenty of people that would love to take over that portfolio.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I was just wondering if you talk a little bit about your life sciences....", "George Chapman", "Would you speak up a bit?", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you hear me okay now? I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your life sciences portfolio. I know it's small, but it is looking like it's maybe underperforming a little bit. And kind of what you're thinking long term you're going to do with those assets?", "Scott Brinker", "Juan, it's Scott Brinker. It is a small part of our portfolio, less than 1%. I would characterize the NOI decline as volatility more than a problem. We just have some big spaces that are maturing in 2014. We haven't yet found the right tenant. This campus is literally surrounded by MIT. So there isn't any question in our mind that over time and I mean the relatively short to intermediate term, the portfolio is going to be fine and the space will lease up. It's really a matter of getting the right tenant into these spaces. So you may see some volatility for the next year plus or minus, but long term there is no question about the value of this real estate.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And any plans to keep or grow that portfolio or dispose of it?", "George Chapman", "Let me respond to that. We had hoped to grow that part of our portfolio because it was directly linked to health systems, especially academic health systems, and to date we have not had much luck in doing that. So, we'd like to either grow it or at some point it might be available for sale. So we continue to evaluate that as we've said in some previous calls.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. I think in your intro remarks you talked about your partners doing, I think it was about $1 billion of developments. Can you just talk about, if you are funding any portion of that or what portion of that you may have purchase options on upon completion?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Juan, it's Scott Brinker again. On an annual basis we have been funding in the neighborhood of $100 million to $200 million of new construction on balance sheet and I think you will continue to see us in that range for the senior housing and post-acute. So the balance would be funded by our operating partners. On the vast majority of it we have some level of right to the acquisition when and if the operator looks to monetize. In general, they are raising private equity for these types of projects. And the whole concept is, build it, stabilize it and then look to get out. So it's been a nice way for us to acquire assets over the last several years and we would expect that to continue to be a nice pipeline of really high quality projects with existing partners going forward.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "The equity component there is not necessarily people that have been involved in seniors housing. I'm just thinking about your previous point that in the early '90s it was sort of people developing that weren't focused on the care component. Are you worried at all, anecdotally we hear some feedback that people who haven't been involved are increasingly looking to play on the space given how stable it was during the last downturn, that that kind of maybe creeping back in at all.", "George Chapman", "The folks that we're talking about who were doing PE work there or doing mezz or other types of financing for construction, are doing that at the behest of our very strong operators and then it is flipped to us. So it is the operator really making the call on when to proceed with development and where. So, we don't think it is at all comparable to, at least within our portfolio, to what happened previously. Assuredly, there will be some folks, some people that come in to develop because, frankly, senior housing has become a core property type. But we don't see it at the same extent as the previous time.", "Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just last question. You kind of have a slide kind of guiding people towards some of the building blocks to construction NAV. I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on what your net asset value may be, and kind of your thoughts around where you feel comfortable issuing equity relative to that.", "Scott Brinker", "You know it depends on quality of the assets, of course with cap rates. But when we do our own assessment, it's in the high 50s, low 60s. If you were to break up the portfolio into pieces, we think that's what you would net to the shareholders at the end of the day. Now, when you account for the fact that it's a $30 billion portfolio with all of the relationships and the pipeline of future growth, I would expect there to be a pretty substantial premium to that price.", "Scott Estes", "And in terms of raising capital, we're obviously seeing investment opportunities, looking to invest accretively. So, I think that to the extent that we're potentially trading at maybe a slight premium to NAV, we'd obviously consider that, but as a part of a larger picture.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Just a couple of questions along Juan's line of questioning and the life science portfolio. George, the comments you made about building that portfolio. I mean, are assets like the F&H [ph] Fan Pier acquisition, is that the kind of asset you would be interested in? And are there opportunities to kind of get your hands on those type of assets in Boston to build out your presence in that market?", "George Chapman", "We would certainly look at Boston. I'm not going to really comment on another REIT's purchase. It's just, it doesn't work. But certainly what we wanted to see develop over time was a drive into urban areas with direct linkages to some of the better academic health systems in the country. And to date, in part because of pricing, we've not been able to achieve that.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just again, conversation on pricing. You take a look at the cap rates on some of your acquisitions this quarter, I'm just kind of trying to get a sense of, was there something unique about these deals? Or is that really where kind of market is at this point and things just seem to be getting tougher and tougher with more private equity players in the space?", "Scott Brinker", "It's a little unique. I think it was a bit higher than you might have seen had we acquired all those through auctions. The lion's share of it was driven off-market by existing relationships. So a blended yield in the mid-6s for the quality of assets that we brought in senior housing and MOB. I think you'd be challenged to reproduce that kind of a yield if you were buying things through auctions.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Okay. And all these assets have pretty high occupancy at this point or is there lease up opportunity in any of these assets?", "Scott Brinker", "Not so much lease up opportunity. Benchmark is taking over management at two of the properties and they tend to have a little bit different revenue model, that I think they could see some substantial NOI growth there over time. But it's not really driven by occupancy as much as it is by rate and service.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And in the quarter you did take about a $2 million provision against your loan. Is that a general provision or is that a loan specific provision?", "Scott Estes", "It was a specific provision related to a small loan for our property that we've had in our portfolio for a very, very long time that was a potential development candidate and we've been carrying a lot of cost taxes on it, and we sold it in January for $500,000. So we wrote it down to $500,000 at year-end. That's the only actual loan on non-accrual as of year-end and then sold it in January.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one more from me. Thanks for your patience. A lot of conversations recently about the doc fix, some concerns about post-acute care, may have to cough up some funds to help with funding that. Just kind of curious what you are hearing at this point from some of the operators around this issue.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, we don't have any more insight than you do, other than we're taking a pretty conservative view of what reimbursement rates look like for the foreseeable future.", "Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies", "When you say conservative, are you thinking flat or are you thinking down?", "Scott Brinker", "Flat to slightly up. It may be down in any given year but we don't invest with one-year time horizons. So, if you look at this over a three, five and ten-year horizon, I think it's pretty reasonable to expect slightly positive rate increases.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "I might have missed this, but in the fourth quarter it looks like you registered $15.7 million of transaction costs. And that struck me as a large number against $278 million of acquisitions because it would be 5.6% of that acquisition number. How did you rack up transaction costs that high?", "Scott Estes", "There are three components to it, Ross. First, there was some Sunrise related fees and just timing of some tax and other advisory services. As you mentioned, we did have a handful of other deals in the quarter. And then the third part, there was actually a termination fee related to just a restructuring of a lease. And when we revalue a lease when it was stayed with the same operator, you can't mark up the value of the asset through a lease restructuring. So you have to run the increase in value through transaction costs. So there is nothing more than those three items in it this quarter.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "So of the $15.7 million, how much do you think was really transaction cost? Is it sort of standard 1% of your acquisition?", "Scott Estes", "We actually did that analysis. Just seeing how the transaction costs have been running, I think about 2.3% for the year. And by our characterization, what would be common usual items or factors related to really the bigger deals that I mentioned in my previous remarks such as the Sunrise transaction, we think it was running right at 1.1%. So that's kind of the flavor from my comments. So I think it should run between 1% and 1.5% going forward.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "Okay. If I switch over to the MOB portfolio, I didn't see a disclosure of re-leasing spreads in the supplemental. Can you give us a sense of what the re-leasing spreads on new and renewable leases have been running?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, overall rate growth for the portfolio last year I think was 2%, plus or minus, for the whole portfolio. It's unique we have such a little rollover. Less than 30% of our square footage expires over the next five years, so there just isn't much to worry about. And we have been able to keep the retention rate really high which helps us renew tenants without putting a bunch of money into the buildings and we're getting long leases on those renewals. So the activity viewed in the aggregate has been very positive. Occupancy remains strong. NOI per unit or per square foot is still at the very top end of the industry. So Mike Noto and his team are doing a great job. We've got great buildings. We think that portfolio continues to produce that steady, solid, low single-digit NOI growth.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "So just to understand. The 2% number you threw out, that's a cash re-leasing spread of the new cash rent versus the expiring cash rent?", "Scott Brinker", "That's the rate growth for the entire portfolio year-over-year, which is sort of the [indiscernible]", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "So including contractual bumps?", "Scott Brinker", "Correct.", "Ross Nussbaum - UBS", "Okay. I think it would be helpful going forward if in the supplemental you could add some disclosure on what new and renewal leasing spreads are on a cash basis, because most of the office REITs that's a pretty standard disclosure, and I think it's tough for us to get our arms around the true performance of that portfolio. We see the occupancy number but it would be helpful to understand on the leases that are expiring, what's really going on there.", "George Chapman", "Got it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan with Cowen Group.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "First question I think is for you, Scott. In the supplement you have your NAV NOI reconciliation page, and on a sequential quarter basis that number actually went down. But it appears you may have changed how you calculated that. Was there a change in the calculation method from Q3 to Q4?", "Scott Estes", "There was. We intentionally moved it to just show Health Care REIT share of NOI.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "So in terms of the adjustment, the interest income piece wasn't changed?", "Scott Estes", "I'm not sure what you are talking about there. Charles, you want to help him?", "Charles Herman", "Were you were referring to, Jim, the interest income?", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "Yes, the interest income. I know that you have -- this reconciliation is keyed back I guess to page 16 in the sup, where you have the other assets and loans receivable kind of move down into the other asset from the NOI section. I just wondered if there was any change in that, but I thought you were doing it in both cases on HCN's proportionate share.", "Charles Herman", "That's right. And we did move the value of the loans down below. So you can see that, the real estate loans receivable line is new as opposed to showing the interest.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Second question, in terms of the operating senior housing piece. Can you just remind us what percentage of the operating costs are labor cost related?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, it depends on the property type. For independent living it tends to be 40% to 50% of total operating expenses. And then for assisted living, it would be more in the 60% to 65% range.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "And to what extent, given what we're hearing about minimal wage pressure in certain states as well as at the other end of the per employee cost, kind of standard of care questions and recommendations that standard of care be increased given the acuity level of the patients? To what extent are your operators feeling upward pressure in terms of personnel cost?", "Scott Brinker", "Nothing to date. I mean the operators in our portfolio have staffing levels that are at or well above any industry standards or requirements. So, that's not really a concern. And wage growth, it's been pretty manageable for the last several years, and at least in our history the wage growth tends to move with the ability to move rental rates as well. So there hasn't been tremendous pricing power for the past several years and consistent with that the wage growth has been pretty controllable.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "And, finally, in terms of the expense ratios there. We hear in some other property types, certainly over the past year, significant increases in real estate taxes and insurance, and real estate tax is obviously a function in part of revenue growth and what's been happening with cap rates. And to what extent has that been a kind of a major factor in the expense growth that we've seen year-over-year or to what extent do you expect it to become maybe more of a factor going forward?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, it hasn't been too far outside the other expenses but it is growing more quickly than, say the staffing costs. So on average it's been well above 3% for sure. That tends to be property specific. So one building maybe 2% and another maybe 10% plus. So, that is an area that is maybe subject to a bit of excess growth right now.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "And so overall on balance, you may have indicated this before, but what level of expense growth on a same store basis are you anticipating in 2014?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Jim, 3% to 3.5% is our estimate.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then finally from me, just a follow-up question to the earlier questions on life science. I think you stated in the prepared comments that you're attributing the decline in same store NOI to, I guess, a lease expiration next year. And I think but I wasn't sure, that you indicated that was one operator and I think you identified the amount of square feet. First of all, is that accurate, number one? And number two; is the tenant that's not renewing either Vertex or Ariad?", "Scott Estes", "As it relates to the same store NOI, a slight negative decline. We're talking about very small numbers here. It was about $200,000. And in total, it was $100,000 increase in ground rent at one building and then there's just some timing of revenue and expense recognition. So overall, we hadn't made this point in our comments. Our life science portfolio is actually generating a current cash yield of 8.4%. So, again, 1% of NOI, doing very well, creating a very nice yield. So, Scott, you want to take his other question?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. Vertex is one of the tenants that is vacating in 2014.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "And is there any issue with exposure to Ariad in terms of -- and do you know if they are planning to renew the space they currently leased from you?", "Scott Brinker", "They are a tenant on our campus. They lease roughly 125,000 square feet and they take one entire building. Mostly the lease matures in 2019. And our expectation had been that they would be moving to their new campus at Kendall Square. But I think that situation there is dynamic and I'm not sure if they will stay or they will go. Our expectation had been that they would be leaving and we would find a new tenant over the next couple of years.", "Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then finally in terms of the space that's being vacated next year. You had talked about your confidence in the quality of the real estate and the demand in the market. Can you give us some indication as to where you think the market rent is versus the rent currently in place?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. We're in the mid to high-50s, and the market for new construction is in the high-60s. So, given the quality of the real estate in the locations, again we're confident that over time we're going to find the right tenant for that space.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Just for the Sunrise recap. Is Health Care REIT funding any of Revera's new equity stake?", "Scott Brinker", "Are we funding their equity stakes?", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Yes.", "Scott Brinker", "No.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Are you providing any loans? No.", "Scott Brinker", "Well, we'll see. PSP owns Revera. They've got a $75 billion balance sheet. But how they finance the acquisition, they are still working through that. We'll probably close in the next 90 to 120 days.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thanks. And George, I would imagine you brought the buyer and seller together in the Sunrise recap, unless I'm reading too much into that. Just wanted to expand on your thoughts on the deep relationships across all your operators really culminating and pulling this recap off.", "George Chapman", "I think that our team has great relationships. And we thought this would be a great partnership with Revera and PSP and we plan to do, hopefully, more business with PSP in particular. I think they're going to be a great partner, even perhaps internationally over time. So, yes, I think that our relationship approach helps. And our whole team helped to bring the, perhaps the most appropriate partner to the table for this transaction. Clearly, we view that as a company strength.", "Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. And Scott Estes, you provided same store guidance for MOBs of 1.5% to 2%. Just as a reminder, what percentage of the portfolio is multitenant and if you could break that growth rate out, just for that piece as well?", "Scott Estes", "I don't know that off the top of my head, do you Scott? I don't have that number right with me, Todd. I'll just have to get back to you on that one.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Mains with Stifel.", "Robert Mains - Stifel Nicolaus", "Just three kind of mop up questions here. First of all, I noticed that you're doing more expansions reported this quarter than last. Should we read anything into that other than it's just opportunistic or is this kind of a strategic direction.", "Scott Brinker", "Just opportunistic, Rob.", "Robert Mains - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then, am I clear on this that the switch from KKR et all to Revera, since Sunrise will remain a different company you don't see this affecting the operations of the Sunrise portfolio in any way?", "Scott Brinker", "Correct.", "Robert Mains - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then last question. Scott Brinker, you said that you're nearing the end of the asset recycling. The guidance includes $0.25 billion of dispositions. Is that recycled or are some of those purchase option exercises?", "Scott Brinker", "I think it's recycling. There's one -- about 80% of it is in hospital area, Rob. So we really have smaller seniors housing component to the disposition guidance at this point. I think there is, again, one hospital towards the middle to the back half of the year in the budget right now, as for as dispositions.", "Robert Mains - Stifel Nicolaus", "So we should view this more as kind of an opportunity as the prior dispositions have been to kind of upgrade the portfolio rather than something getting taken away that you'd rather not lose?", "Scott Brinker", "Absolutely. Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Mueller with J.P. Morgan.", "Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan", "Just one quick question. On page 4 of the supplemental, looking at the tripe-net coverages. It looks like about 10% of the NOI, I guess tied to the senior housing triple-net assets, is covering at about 1 or less, 1 time or less. I was wondering, can you just give us a little bit of color on what's behind that and where you see it trending over the next few years?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Mike, this is Scott. We try to also provide a little context on that same page, because there is more to the story than just payment coverage. We've tried to give people a sense of what level of corporate guarantee is there, security deposits, letters of credit, all those types of things, that also help pay the rent. And, importantly, there are some portfolios in that table that are still in the sort of turnaround or lease-up phase. So, over time we of course expect to have zero, below 1.0 coverage. But there will always be a portion that underperforms, and that's why we ask for corporate guarantees and ask for letters of credit etcetera, so that we make sure we get the rent payment.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Two quick ones. First on the Sunrise recapitalization, were there any changes to your management contracts with Sunrise in the deal?", "Scott Brinker", "Only very modest changes. The management fee will go down but not in any material way.", "Karin Ford - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And then second question is, given your comments about where you think NAV is and where the stock's trading, should we expect you guys to likely tap the ATM in 2014?", "Scott Brinker", "We could. I think in general we'd look to be more nimble. We have, I believe, over $450 million of availability on our ATM. We'd been obviously working larger transactions so it didn't make as much sense to -- we have had some very large less frequent transactions. But it's nice to have that tool in the toolkit as we think about deploying capital effectively.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citi", "Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just thinking about the transaction cost for one more second. How much of those costs are full onetime write-offs or write deal costs and how much are more sort of, maybe G&A-sque, where they are deal related but sort of more run rate?", "Scott Estes", "Again to get into a lot of the details, I would say $3 million really are the deal related costs this quarter, truly about a 1% number. You had some Sunrise cost, just the timing of when those hit. They hit a little bit later in terms of some of the tax and advisory services. And then probably about half the number was the termination fee that I mentioned as a part of the lease restructuring. That was a specific onetime item.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citi", "So they will actually be closer to that 1% looking forward on volume?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations & General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN's first quarter 2014 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com.

Tom?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. It's a pleasure to be the speaking with you as the new CEO of HCN. I know many of you from my long career in healthcare and real estate, and I'm looking forward to meeting those of you that I don't know over the coming weeks. HCN had a strong first quarter, delivering outstanding portfolio NOI growth and investing $542 million with both new and existing partners. As you'll hear from Scott Brinker and Scott Estes, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates that the HCN strategy works. Establish long-term partnerships with the best-in-class healthcare operators, and those partnerships provide access to the best healthcare real estate in the best markets. Before we get into a more detailed discussion of the quarter, I want to mention that we had the opportunity to honor our friend and former CEO, George Chapman, at our annual shareholders meeting last week. We posted some pictures and a video of George speaking at the meeting on the HCN website. And I hope you all take a look. I know that many of you on the line have known George for many years. And I know you will enjoy seeing this emotional, heartfelt tribute as well as hearing George's remarks about succession planning at HCN and my appointment as CEO.", "During George's tenure, HCN's assets grew from $500 million to $22 billion, and, more importantly, the company delivered an average of 14% annual total shareholder returns. That's an enviable record, and we thank him for his contributions to the company. Also at that meeting, our Chairman, Jeff Donahue, was pleased to announce that all of our proxy proposals passed by wide margins. On behalf of our Board of Directors, I want to express our appreciation for your trust and confidence. Many of you know that I have been associated with HCN for over 20 years, and I'm intimately familiar with the company's management, business and strategic initiatives. I have deep experience with public real estate companies as well as healthcare, both in the U.S. and abroad. One thing you should all know is that the experienced and talented team we have at HCN is just remarkable. Whether it's on our unique campus here in Toledo or at our offices in Minneapolis; Jupiter, Florida; Newport Beach; or London, England, you sense a dynamic, vibrant culture and commitment to excellence as soon as you walk in the door. That, my friends, is our secret sauce. Let me be clear: HCN is not just some financing source chasing deals. We are deeply engaged in the seniors housing and the broader healthcare industries and have a seat at the table with healthcare systems and senior housing operators who are driving efficiencies and improvements in healthcare delivery. What underlies this team is the dynamics of an aging population. You're all aware of this, and it's a global issue. We're spending a lot of time thinking about what aging means and positioning HCN to align with this powerful trend. You'll be hearing more about this from me in the future. As Scott Brinker will describe in greater detail, we are delivering consistent, strong external and internal growth. During the first quarter, we secured a new partnership with Senior Resource Group, yet another leading U.S.-based operator. We also continued to innovate and improve our best-in-class portfolio management systems, like our expense benchmarking tool, which provides our operating partners with information to drive even better results. We have also been the most active player outside of the United States. And, just like in the U.S., we focus on the best markets with the best operators in healthcare property types that we know well. For example, let's take the U.K. HCN has invested over $2 billion into high-end seniors housing, primarily located in the dynamic London Metropolitan area. One year ago, HCN opened an office in London, which is staffed both by local hires and some members of the Toledo team that have transferred there. The point I'm making here is that we are extremely well covered in Europe. A market, by the way, that I know, exceedingly well, having lived in London, and I've been working there over the last 20 years in both real estate and healthcare. I'm also pleased to tell you that we just reached terms this week with a senior U.K. healthcare investment professional to join our London office, someone that I've known for 2 decades and is well known to the HCN management team. We are excited about what he will add to our international efforts. And now Scott Brinker will review our investment activity. Scott?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Thanks, Tom. The year is off to a great start with sector-leading 4.4% same-store NOI growth, and our investment activity was once again the highest in the sector. I'll start with some color on the portfolio, beginning with seniors housing. Results this quarter were way above guidance. Same-store NOI growth in the operating portfolio was exceptional at 8.1%. Rental rates led the way with 4.5% growth. Results were strong across the U.S. and Canada and were especially robust in the U.K. In Metro London, the source of more than half our U.K. income were benefiting from incredible affluence and tight supply. Results in the operating portfolio continue to be exceptional in comparison to every benchmark. Our locations and physical plants are sustainable advantages that will drive continued outperformance. And with occupancy at 89%, there is still plenty of room for upside. If you want to play in a healthcare REIT with the highest organic growth, HCN is the pick.", "Turning to triple net senior housing, the portfolio continues to generate strong, predictable growth. Same-store NOI grew 3.3%, in line with guidance. Payment covered was unchanged and remains at comfortable levels. Moving to post-acute, results continue to be remarkably consistent. Same-store NOI, once again, increased 3%. Payment coverage after management fee improved to a healthy 1.34x. Many of you will remember touring a Genesis PowerBack facility at last year's Investor Day in New Jersey. HCN and Genesis will open their seventh PowerBack this summer. PowerBack is redefining the standard for rehab therapy. Patients and families love the private rooms, therapy pools, full-time physicians and large therapy gyms. Medicare and commercial payers love that PowerBack delivers tremendous value per dollar spent. This is just one of many examples of HCN partnering with operators to move the industry forward.", "Medical office. Same-store NOI increased 1.5% last quarter, in line with guidance. This is a low-risk asset class with predictable cash flows. We like the business because of its stability. Equally important, it allows us to build relationships with hospitals and physician groups. Over time, it will be a huge advantage for us to have scale across the continuum. Healthcare is becoming more integrated and more collaborative. The days of silos are numbered. Our relationships across the continuum will put us right in the middle of the collaboration.", "Investments. As you've come to expect, we're finding accretive deal flow, thanks to the breadth and depth of our relationships. Investment volume last quarter was more than $540 million with a Year 1 cash yield of 6.5%. The activity included follow-on acquisition to a Sunrise and Genesis, a continuation of our longstanding history of growing with our partners. The headline last quarter was a nearly $400 million investment with Senior Resource Group, who's been on our wish list for years. The assets are concentrated in highly affluent Southern California markets. These are among the highest-quality assets in our entire portfolio. And that's a very high bar to exceed. Importantly, SRG becomes another high-quality partner to help grow our business. The ownership group is a joint venture that includes the SRG management team and PSP, the Canadian pension fund who's our partner on the Revera portfolio and the Sunrise management company. Note that our relationships include capital partners, not just operators. The ability to collaborate with partners is increasingly important in healthcare, and HCN excels at it.", "International. We were the first mover in the U.K. 2 years ago, and we quickly established a leading market position. It's exciting to see that our relationship investment strategy can be translated into overseas markets. To date, we've invested nearly $2 billion in the premium quality U.K. real estate. Our senior team based in London has decades of experience in the U.K. They know every portfolio, operator and market just as we do here in the States. This is -- this allows us to invest strategically, and helps explains why our NOI growth rate exceeds every benchmark. Looking forward, we have active dialogue with 30-plus existing partners. They are the sector's best origination team. The deals are big, small and in between. The common link is high-quality real estate that will appreciate in value over time. Accretive investments have been an important part of our story, and that will continue. Two final points about healthcare real estate: One, it's a fragmented business. Two, it's evolving into a core asset class. The upshot is that, over time, the real estate will flow to large, efficient owners like HCN. With our vast network of relationships, we're going to be at the leading edge of the consolidation. I'll now turn to Scott Estes for our financial results.", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'll center my remarks today around 3 core themes: First, our first quarter financial and operating results were outstanding; second, our balance sheet and credit metrics remain solid, and we retain considerable capital availability at quarter end; and third, we've increased our 2014 guidance to reflect the strength of our first quarter results. So I'll begin by taking a look at our first quarter financial performance. I think the most important thing for you, all, to pay attention to is the rate of earnings growth our platform is generating. Normalized FFO increased to a record $1 per share for the first quarter, while FAD came in at $0.90, representing strong 10% and 11% increases year-over-year, respectively. Results were primarily driven by the same-store cash NOI increase and $3.4 billion of net investments completed over the prior 12 months. G&A for the first quarter came in at slightly under $33 million, in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this quarter included about $3 million of accelerated expensing of stock and options that will not be included in our run rate entering the second quarter. We will pay our 172nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of $0.795 per share or $3.18 annually. That's 43 years of dividends. Our new 2014 dividend payment rate represents a 4% increase over the dividends paid last year and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our FFO and FAD payout ratios for 2014, based on the midpoint of our revised guidance ranges, have declined to 78% (sic) [80%] and 88%, respectively. We continue to enhance our supplement this quarter. The most significant change was standardizing the presentation of our portfolio and investment balances at HCN's pro rata share throughout the entire document. In addition, we've provided a new chart on Page 1 that details bed and unit mix by asset type within our seniors housing and care portfolio. And on Page 5, we've added disclosure detailing same-store CapEx as a percentage of NOI within our seniors housing operating portfolio. I would also point out that we've begun adding pictures to the portfolio map on our website starting today, with the 10 SRG assets located in California, Arizona and Oregon and plan on adding a more significant number soon.", "Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. In terms of capital and liquidity, it was a fairly quiet quarter for us. We repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.7%. In addition, we issued a little over 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program during the first quarter, generating $64 million in proceeds. We ended March with $562 million of line borrowings, largely as a result of completing $542 million of net investments during the quarter. We are in a solid liquidity position at quarter end based on the following items: As of March 31, we had $1.7 billion of credit line capacity and $186 million in cash. We have $250 million of pending dispositions throughout the remainder of 2014, and we continue to raise over $60 million per quarter through our dividend reinvestment program. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position and know we have limited near-term debt maturities, the HCN's share of debt maturing through year end 2014 at only $218 million. In terms of financial metrics, as of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 43%. Our net debt to EBITDA stood at 6.2x, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage remains solid at 3.6x and 2.8x respectively. As a result of the secured debt paid off during the first quarter, our secured debt as a percentage of total assets declined to 12.6%. I'll conclude my comments today by providing an update regarding the more significant assumptions driving our 2014 guidance. I'll begin with our same-store cash NOI growth outlook. Given our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our 2014 forecast from the previous range of 3% to 3.5% to a point estimate of 3.5%. The increase is based on the better-than-expected results now anticipated from our seniors housing operating portfolio. More specifically, we're now projecting strong growth of approximately 6% in our seniors housing operating portfolio for the full year. Our 2014 same-store cash NOI forecast for the remaining components of our portfolio remain unchanged. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we've completed in the first quarter included in our formal guidance. Our guidance does include $163 million of additional development conversions throughout the remainder of the year at a blended projected yield upon conversion of 8.6%. Our forecast continues to include approximately $250 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 9.5%. I'd note that approximately $200 million of these dispositions could occur in the second quarter. There is no change to our annual capital expenditure forecast of $66 million for 2014, comprised of approximately $46 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio and the remaining $20 million from the medical facilities portfolio. Our 2014 CapEx as a percentage of NOI for both segments is expected to run in the 7% to 9% range, which we believe is an appropriate level to maintain our premier quality portfolio. In terms of G&A, we're reducing our annual forecast to approximately $125 million from the previous $127 million. We continue to believe that our overall platform is in great position, and we're making a concerted effort to drive down overhead expenses. We're reducing our forecast for the full year primarily as a result of reductions in professional services and consulting costs relative to our initial expectations. I would note that our revised forecast excludes any costs associated with our CEO transition that will impact our second quarter results. Finally, we've increased our normalized FFO and FAD per share guidance for the full year. As a result of our strong first quarter operating results and investment activity, we have increased both normalized FFO and FAD guidance by $0.02 per share. Our normalized FFO guidance was increased by another $0.08 per share to reflect $23 million of additional straight-line rent as a result of the recent Genesis lease modification. Effective April 1, our lease was modified to replace the CPI-based component of the annual increaser with a fixed annual increaser, providing us with a certainty that our full annual cash rent increase will be achieved. So as a result, we are increasing our normalized 2014 FFO guidance by a total of $0.10 to a range of $4.03 to $4.13 per diluted share from the previous range of $3.93 to $4.03, which now represents 6% to 8% growth. We're also increasing our normalized 2014 FAD expectation by $0.02 to a range of $3.55 to $3.65 per diluted share from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.63, now representing a strong increase of 6% to 9%. That does conclude my prepared remarks, but I would finish by saying that we're pleased with our strong start to the year and feel great about our portfolio and financial position at the end of the first quarter. So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. I'd like to highlight a few points before we take questions. First, our platform is stronger than ever. Our network of partners in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. continues to give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. I think our Q1 results speak to that. We have a strong pipeline of accretive deals that our team is working on as we speak and expect that to grow throughout the year. We are maintaining a financial position that enables the company to execute on these opportunities, and most importantly, we have the best team in the sector. Our results this quarter are exciting, and we're very pleased to share them with you. But, we remain laser-focused on our mission of delivering superior long-term total shareholder returns. Holly, now we'd like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question is going to come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Scott, can you give us some more details for the reason of the Genesis lease modification? Was it just a straight-line PPI, I guess, bumps switching to a fixed bump, and what is the fixed bump?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Scott Brinker speaking. The increaser with Genesis was 3.5% for the first 5 years, and then 3% the final 10 years of the lease. And a portion of that increaser was tied to CPI, and then a portion was fixed, and with inflation seen as low as it has been, this year, there might have been a shortfall in the cash ramp that we actually received, and Genesis was a good partner and agreed to essentially fix the increaser for the remainder of the lease term so that we could ensure ourselves of getting the full cash rent. The result is that, for GAAP purposes, we have to now straight-line all the rent.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so there is nothing changing I guess in the current run rate. It was just that slight adjustment to the CPI portion of that rate?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Correct.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then how you guys are thinking about your current financial position? I know that Scott previously indicated that he is comfortable with a little bit of a higher leverage ratio because of the strong liquidity. Now that you have about $500 million drawn on the line of credit, are you still comfortable with that liquidity position?", "Scott A. Estes", "We are, Mike. I think, most importantly, we look at the flexibility by having over $2 billion of available capital. But our answers as always were timing of any future capital raise is contingent upon future acquisitions and our investment pipeline.", "Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question is for Tom. I know, in your comments, you kind of highlighted the expertise you guys have internationally, mainly in the U.K. Should we read into that, that the company wants to expand more meaningfully in the U.K. and then London?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "I think that is a good read on where we're coming from. I think that -- as I mentioned, we've just hired a quite experienced senior guy that we've all known for a long time to join our London office. I think we have great relationships there with the best operators, and we are going to continue to look for good opportunities for accretive investments in the U.K., and we will be looking even outside the U.K. but very carefully and staying with the strategy that we delivered on for many years.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just going back to the Genesis lease, again, I understand the modification. I'm just curious, it seems like you guys got all the upside from that to the detriment of Genesis. Just wondering on the other side, what are they getting that made them comfortable with basically fixing that piece of the rent bumps?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Tayo, it's Scott. I mean, this is a long-term fixing your partnership with Genesis. We're doing active investments with acquisitions and new development. So there's no tradeoff other than it's a partnership, and we work together when they need a favor and vice versa. That's the way HCN works.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "All right. I appreciate that. And then for the quarter, I believe this was the first quarter where we -- for the senior housing operating platform, the same-store numbers were impacted by the addition of some of the recent transactions that were done, I think, last year. Could you just talk a little bit about what that net impact was on those numbers from the change in the same-store pool?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Let me make sure I understand your question. The same-store pool has increased, and you're asking if the composition changed the growth rate?", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes, and if it did by, how much?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I see. Well the same-store pool grew 8.1% over the prior year, and the major addition was Sunrise, and their performance was sort of right in line with that overall average. So I would say, on average, it had really no impact.", "Scott A. Estes", "The only thing I would add to, Tayo, I think is an important point. It's largely a stable pool. So the stabilized result of that same-store pool, there's not a lot of assets until up [ph]. It was within 50 basis points of the 8.1% if you just looked at the stable component.", "Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Great. Okay. Last one from me. I get it. It definitely sounds like acquisition activity you guys are feeling much better about that. Your name, along with some of your bigger peers has kind of been thrown around on some fairly large potential deals in Australia and as well as the U.S., and even in the U.K. You've made some comments about the U.K., just curious about domestically with Griffin-American and Australia with Healthscope, whether those are things you're looking at, and where things may stand on that?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Well, we look at everything. And we have a pretty high bar here. So if there's a large transaction that you're hearing about, assume that we've looked at it, but we're certainly not going to invest in everything that comes across our desk. We're going to invest in the good ones with the operators that we believe we can establish long-term partnerships with. It's not just about a deal for us.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was hoping you guys could just talk a little bit about your relationships with PSP and more broadly with pension funds for PSP. Are there other opportunities to invest alongside some of the investments they have made. And are you having more broader discussions with other sort of long-term capital partners like a PSP, where you could see opportunities to invest in joint ventures, and if you could just speak a little bit to that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Sure, Juan, this is Scott. PSP became a partner of ours last year through the Revera portfolio in Canada, 47 private [indiscernible] assets. We own, let's see, 75% interest in that portfolio and PSP owns the balance. We're also joint venture partners in the Sunrise management company where we have 24% and they have the balance. And we're now partners with them in this SRG portfolio that we talked about where we each have roughly a 47% interest. That said, the dialogue is active and ongoing. I would think that all 3 of those joint ventures are going to grow, Revera, Sunrise and SRG. And we may look to do other things with them. One thing that became apparent to us over the last 2 years is that getting direct access to these pension funds instead of doing things via private equity companies was maybe a better route for a company like us as a long-term partnership focused company.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Juan, just picking up on what Scott just said, I think that PSP is an example of the value of investing directly with an HCN versus accessing our type of investments through the private equity funds. And I want to make -- I want to mention that this is an area that I have a lot of experience with. In other businesses that I have been involved with, I have relationships with a lot of the large sovereign wealth and pension funds around the world. I will tell you that I've got a lot of calls. They're all interested in talking about healthcare. So I think you should look at PSP as a model for how we will establish financial partnerships with the best quality financial partners in the world.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just on the G&A front, can you just walk us through what the expectation is for costs related to the change in CEO, and would that include the payments to George to stay on as an adviser and what those are?", "Scott A. Estes", "Juan, this is Scott Estes. I think -- we don't have any specific comments ready on the number as we're still finalizing some items, but I can say, it will be expensed in the second quarter. And the details will be made available, generally, in the retirement and consulting agreement as well as the employment contracts that will need to be filed with the SEC. So we will have the full detailed results. Those are all a part of it, and we'll provide that in the second quarter.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And just lastly on the financing front, what's assumed -- is there any equity other than what you guys talked about via the distribution reinvestment plan assumed in guidance, and is there anything assumed with regards to putting in place long-term debt, or is it basically the balance sheet as is on a go-forward basis for the guidance that was revised?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes, it's per our usual, it's essentially the balance sheet as is at any one point in time.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Manny Korchman on the phone with me as well. Tom, I'm just wondering if you can sort of share a little bit on the board process and the decision on your appointment, and whether that was always a plan from a succession perspective. There's a couple of analogous situations recently in REIT land. You had HCP, which terminated their CEO and put a board member in place. You had Digital, which the CEO effectively was asked to leave, and they put an interim CEO in, who is the current CIO and CFO, and they're going through a search firm and a process. You had Equity One where the CEO announced that he was going to go off and take a new job and the board went through a process and ended up bringing in external candidate. And I'm just curious sort of what the board went through. I've known you for a long time. I understand and clearly you have the background and the history of the company. I'm just trying to understand the process that, that went through.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Well, appreciate the question, Michael. Just understand that we've been talking about succession planning at HCN for a number of years. And while the timing of the announcement might have caught the people by surprise, I just -- you should know that there was not a decision made on a Friday that was announced on a Monday. This had been an open discussion with George, and I think, many of you have heard George publicly talk about succession planning. I think my appointment has a lot to do with the fact that I've known this company for so long, and I know the management team very well. I know the business very well. And I think it's unusual when you have someone who can step into the CEO role who is supported by the retiring CEO of the board and, most importantly, the management team. I think that's a unique situation, so while I can't comment on the other scenarios that you've raised, I think you have to look at what are the unique aspects that allowed this transition to happen so seamlessly here. If you came here, Michael, the day after the announcement -- or actually the afternoon of the announcement, it was business as usual. Everyone was doing what they do best here, and it's all -- I sometimes feel like I've been here forever. It's a strange feeling. But I think what I'm saying is this is very different than you normally find in a -- when a quasi outsider comes in as the CEO.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. I guess to that point, you talked about it was ongoing open, I guess this has happened almost 1 month ago. Why don't you have the costs and things nailed down or agreements nailed down? I'm just -- it's just strange not to have that detail to be able to share with us.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "The agreements are nailed down. There are some moving pieces that we wouldn't be quoting numbers to you on this call today, but rest assured that everything is nailed down to everyone's satisfaction here. It's just that we're not prepared yet to be putting numbers on a conference call related to that. But when we can, you'll know all the details. But also assume that George's departure was very much in -- along the lines of what his contract was, which is disclosed, and assume that there is additional compensation because he is staying on as an adviser to the company.", "Unknown Executive", "It may be worth noting that those contracts will be filed with our 10-Q this evening.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Right. So you'll get -- you're saying he's going to get some amount of severance or other payments, and I guess you're saying that there's some inducement package to you, Tom, that will come, that this could -- I mean, could HCP cost, I don't know, it was like $50 million or $75 million, something that crazy. I mean, what are we looking at in terms of -- just by -- ballpark it for us in terms of cash or stock that will be given here.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Given to George?", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just between both. I assume you're going to be induced with some contract to take the CEO job, and I assume George is owed a certain amount of money, and I think we're just trying to get a perspective of what does the CEO transition cost shareholders.", "Scott A. Estes", "Mike, it's Scott Estes. I think it's an important issue, philosophically, seeing Tom come in. I think you'll see in the document Tom got a very small stock grant, it was $1 million.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Yes, $1 million stock grant that is totally based on performance in the future.", "Scott A. Estes", "And his long-term incentive opportunity is essentially that of a high-performing CEO in the sector. George's package and the only variability why we don't share a number is, effectively, he is an employee technically until June 30 and a few of the performance measures need to be determined at the time. So there's still some work to be done. But in essence, it's largely contractual plus the long-term incentives and plans that have been in place that are part of the calculation. So it's nowhere outlandish in terms of a number.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Michael, you'll see that my compensation structure is very ISS-friendly.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Now are you going to step off the other public company boards to free up your time to be full-time CEO?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "At the moment, no. If those responsibilities became overbearing, both companies know that I may have to. But at the moment, I think it is an advantage to this company and to -- that I sit on the boards of those companies. Those are very -- the businesses are relative to what we do, both of them are real estate companies today. And I think there are numerous synergies that -- and knowledge that I learn from sitting on the boards of those companies that are relevant to HCN and vice versa.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just last one from me. Would George have a non-compete after he has a certain advisory relationship with the company?", "Unknown Executive", "The arrangement does include a noncompetition arrangement, yes. That's all detailed in the agreements to be filed.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "To be filed?", "Unknown Executive", "Yes.", "Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And how long does that last for, just out of curiosity?", "Unknown Executive", "It's a 3-year consulting arrangement, but each party has some rights to terminate along the way.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "It's Ross here with Nick. I've got 2 questions. The first is back on Genesis. Maybe I'm just not understanding it, but Genesis is a big boy. You're a big boy. You entered into a lease, just because inflation is lower than, perhaps, some expected, I guess, I'm missing why they'd feel so generous as to say \"Hey, we're just going to pay you some more rent out of the goodness of our heart without expecting,\" and I think, Scott, you used the word some favor in return. It would seem to me, that that's an awfully generous thing to do all else being equal.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Ross, it's not that really unusual. There's a catch-up provision in the lease. So they would have repaid us at some point. It's just a matter of when do we get the cash rent, and we prefer to get it now rather than later. So, I mean there's really nothing to this other than Genesis and HCN are partners in this portfolio, and we're growing the business together. There's no -- there's nothing else to read into this.", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. No, but that catch-up point is an important one because I don't think that was stated before, so that now actually makes sense. Okay, second question I have for you is on the disclosure front with respect to the senior housing RIDEA portfolio. Can you guys break out of the 4.5% rate growth that I think you cited in the same-store pool, how much was the renewal rate growth and how much was the rate growth on new leases?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I'm not sure offhand, Ross...", "Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And this I guess speaks to sort of the question I was going for, which is, if we think about the multifamily REITs, and you guys own a portfolio that's bigger than many of the multifamily REITs, those guys do provide renewal rents, new lease rents, they provide all of their metrics by state, and I would just sort of think about trying to provide a little more color around those kinds of topics going forward because I think it's something that investors are going to want to focus on.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Okay. We'll do it.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is Nick Yulico here. Just a question on acquisition pricing. It seems like it's now getting a lot more aggressive out there in the market, whether it's big diversified portfolios in the U.S. or even in the U.K., seems like a lot. A lot of people are trying to be buying in the U.K. right now, and so what I'm wondering is how do you think about -- what's your minimal acceptable initial yield that you would do deals at that you think would be accretive for you guys today?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, Nick, we don't make investments unless we think we're going to make money at it. And we prefer to make money on Day 1 and over time. I'd say the SRG portfolio is sort of the low bar, and that's the highest-quality portfolio we've seen -- our private pay, the markets are exceptional and that was a 6% Year 1 yield. That's moderately accretive. Not in a major way, but at our cost of capital today, we make money today. More important, over time, it's really strong growth rate in that portfolio. So we think that, over the long term, that's the type of investment that will make our shareholders a lot of money.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Well, I guess what I'm wondering is 6% is sort of as the low end of cap rates for higher-quality operating senior housing. Does it make any sense to pay fixed cap rate for anything else, so even below a fixed cap rate for medical office, for U.K. going overseas and taking more currency and other risk? I mean, should we think about this as the pricing of senior housing operating in the U.S. that you've done over the past couple of years is -- that's still is going to be lowest cap rate that you guys are going to pay for this -- any kind of real estate?", "Scott M. Brinker", "I mean, Nick, it's hard to predict the future. It's interesting though, what we see is that senior housing medical office has been an extremely strong performer over the past decade. It's been outperformer in up cycles and down cycles, and it's finally attracting the interest from institutional investors that it should. So we've seen the cap rate spread for healthcare versus other asset classes compressed, but there's a still a big gap. And I think there's still room for that gap to narrow. So 6% seems low. We can make money at 6%, but it's still substantially higher than the cap rates that people are paying for other asset classes that to us have lower growth expectations and less resiliency from year-to-year.", "Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Right. I guess, just for the final question. I guess my point was, I think we've all sort of understood that senior housing, we've got our hands around it, senior housing operating cap rates could be 6%, but does it really make sense to pay below 6% for medical office? It seems like a lot of the incremental sort of -- do you think about maybe a larger portfolio, that there were people trying to push pricing, they're pushing it on skilled nursing, they're pushing it on medical office, and they're trying to drive down cap rates with that? So that's what I'm wondering -- is why -- what's so attractive about those other asset class? Are they at all similar to the senior housing? Or should we think about senior housing as just this isolated lower cap rate investment within healthcare?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Nick, I think they're all potentially attractive asset classes for us. And I wouldn't just focus on the initial yield. I mean that's important, but there's a lot more to it from our perspective, including the growth rate over time, most importantly, but also the relationship, and is it one that's going to grow? Or is it a static one-off investment? SRG is an example. It's a best-in-class portfolio, but we're also going to grow with SRG. They're an active developer. They're actually into turnarounds, so they're going to grow that business, and we're going to be their capital partner. So that impacts our thinking, too, when we talk about what's an acceptable initial yield on an investment.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Nick, we don't feel the need to throw around money at low cap rates just to demonstrate that we can do a deal. That's not the way we do business. And that money -- there's a lot of that money out there, let him go do it. We're looking -- if you're to see us go into opportunities that are -- that you may determine are a lower cap rate, assume that there is, as Scott said, it's part of perhaps an initial relationship. There's an opportunity to really grow with that operator or healthcare system, if it weren't in a, for instance, in a medical office situation. If it were an initial opportunity to get in with one of the largest health systems in the country and we saw an opportunity to do more with that health system, that might be a reason to do that 6% deal.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "On your senior housing operating portfolio, I think you mentioned that you saw particularly strong performance in London. Can you put some numbers around -- just kind of what the NOI growth rates were for the U.S. versus Canada versus the U.K. and whether you see any difference in longer-term NOI growth rates for those different geographies.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Jeff, it's Scott. The U.K. was right around 10%. U.S. was right around 8%, and then Canada was more like 5%. And I would say the longer-term difference, especially in Canada, is that our portfolio has very low acuity. It's like senior apartments, so a lot less care services being provided. So if you were going to rank them by long-term NOI growth, I'd probably put Canada at the lower end of that range and the U.S. and U.K. at the high end. The tradeoff with Canada is that it's a very, very stable stream of income. I mean, it really functions more like an apartment building with very long lease terms. I mean, there's very little turnover. So we look at this as a diversified portfolio, and it's a combination of resiliency and strong growth. But does that answer your question?", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that does. And then lastly, one of your peers just made a significant investment in entrance-fee CCRCs. I know you've had some experience with those assets in the past. Do you share their view that this is a good time in the cycle to get into that product? And is this something that you might consider increasing your investment exposure to over time?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Jeff, it's Scott. We do have a small portfolio of CCRCs. I think it's about 1% of our portfolio. They're performing fine. Brookdale is a great operator, so that's a positive for the investment. I don't know what kind of yield they got on it. But traditionally, entry-fee CCRCs would command a much higher cap rate. So that would impact my response, and I just don't know what the purchase price was. So it's hard to say much beyond that.", "Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "But this doesn't -- you haven't thought of this as a particularly good time to get into that product, is that fair to say?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, I wouldn't say that we're looking to substantially grow that asset class, Jeff.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I want to start with the RIDEA performance. Obviously, really good in the quarter. I guess my question is, maybe around the weather, do you see any sort of downward pressure from that? Was it on the occupancy line or operating expense. And did you try and parse that what that could be?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Jack, it's Scott again. We took a best guess. We do have a large portfolio in New England that was heavily impacted by the harsh winter. And just looking at utilities alone, they dragged down our NOI growth for the whole portfolio by over 100 basis points. So it did have an impact. Had the weather been normal, I think our NOI growth rate would have been closer to 10% rather than 8%. But there's always something that's happening. It's a hurricane or it's the flu or it's winter weather, so we try not to get to into that.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, difficult to predict the weather. And on the moving side, I guess, one of the things we've been thinking about is, is it possible that, somebody was planning a move-in in the first quarter, maybe it gets pushed into the second quarter. Did you see any change in move-ins maybe in the New England market, and then has that changed as you go into April and now into May?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, occupancy was surprisingly strong in first quarter. It was ahead of our expectations. And the traditional seasonality in the business is that occupancy increases from the first to the second, and then also the third quarter. So I would expect, our centers to continue increasing. But we didn't necessarily hear people saying that the weather caused occupancy to be challenged in the first quarter.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, good to hear. And the last one, obviously there's been a lot of talk around international market, both one in where you're already at, and then Australia, which I think is a little bit new. I was wondering, maybe if you could just walk through some of the criteria you think about when you're trying to pick new markets that you would enter?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Well, the most important thing for us other than the risk-adjusted return is whether we can pick the right partners and buy the best real estate. I mean, that's how we've established a competitive advantage in the U.S. And that means, being deeply connected into the healthcare markets. And that's why when we approach the U.K., we hired what we think are the 2 best investment professionals that are tightly networked into the senior housing operators, the medical office developers and operators, and the best health systems. They can help us pick the best partners and the best assets. So that -- that's really the starting point for us, is knowing the market.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Since the door is open for me there, I'm going to ask a weather question as well. Some of the other healthcare REITs with medical office building investments have talked about some reimbursements that might come back to them in the second quarter from the utility storm or [ph] that sort of thing. Is there anything that -- like that that's going to affect MOB performance in the current quarter?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Rob, it's Scott speaking. Our MOB NOI growth rate last quarter was 1.5%. And we true-up the operating expenses at the end of each quarter. So there's no catch-up concept. But similar to my comment about the weather impacting the senior housing performance, we think, likewise, it impacted the medical office portfolio by about 50 basis points. So again, we would have done a little bit better had the weather been more normal.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then when we look at the SRG investment. Since that's primarily independent living, is that going to reduce consolidated RevPAR in -- going forward?", "Scott M. Brinker", "It might by a bit. It's about 55%, 60% independent, and the rest is assisted, Rob, but the markets that these asset are in are so affluent that it's still a very high number despite being mostly independent living.", "Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "And then my last question, staying on the independent living theme, you're not developing anything in independent living, and I know that the [indiscernible] data suggests that that's the one asset class where clearly there's a favorable demand/supply relationship. Just curious about your thoughts about IL as a development opportunity.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, we're not doing anything directly, Rob, but indirectly, we're doing still a fair amount of new construction in IL. Merrill Gardens is an example. They're actively building 3, 4, 5 new projects a year, and we've got the right to buy those if and when they seek to sell, which they certainly will when they stabilize. So we're doing a lot of that type of thing, Rob, with development even if we're not funding it directly. A lot of that stuff will end up within our portfolio.", "Operator", "And your next question is a follow-up question from Michael Bilerman.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's actually Manny Korchman here. When you look at sort of the press reports that were out end of last year, beginning of this year, there was reports out there that you and Ventas were in discussions to potentially merge the companies. Was that a part of sort of the succession process, or was that something else and sort of -- did that have any influence on the fact that now the CEO has transitioned to a new person?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "I can't comment on those rumors about conversations between Ventas and Health Care REIT. I would say that has nothing to do with a process that has been under discussion here for many years. This is something that -- these were discussions between -- as I told you between George Chapman, the management team and the board, regarding what was the right way to put a good succession planning program in place because George was going to retire. At a certain point, and as I said earlier, I think the stars lined up pretty well here. It's very different than what you find with some of the other situations that are out there. So, there's always people speculating -- in an industry like we're in where there's so much runway for growth and you're delivering every quarter for your shareholders, why would we even consider that at this point, any kind of a combination. That makes no sense to me.", "Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So M&A was not one of the options that the board explored?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Absolutely not.", "Operator", "And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Tom DeRosa for some closing comments.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Well, I thank you, for all your participation today. I hope we answered all your questions. And I hope you're as excited about HCN as we are, and I look forward to getting a chance now that I could get on the road now that we've released earnings, I look forward to the chance to get to see all of you over the next couple of weeks. All the best.

My name is Holly, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey H. Miller", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although HCN believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tom DeRosa. Tom?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Thanks, Jeff. The strong third quarter financial results we announced this morning are a tribute to HCN's people, partners and industry-leading business model, a model that has been built not over years, but decades. Our unique model provides strong and predictable cash flow growth, new investment growth, dividend and debt coverage and access to capital that is delivering for our shareholders on all fronts.", "Here are a few highlights of the quarter. Same store NOI for the entire portfolio grew 4.3%, and our seniors housing operating portfolio posted an outstanding 7.6% growth. I'll let Scott Brinker provide you with more detail about how we achieved these industry-leading results. But as I've said in the past, it's about partnering with the top operators in health systems who own the best health care real estate in the best markets.", "We were happy to welcome HealthLease and Gracewell to the HCN family during the quarter. With HealthLease, we will acquire an excellent portfolio of seniors housing and Class A post-acute assets for a blended cap rate of approximately 7%. This acquisition also gives us a development pipeline with Zeke Turner's Mainstreet development business to acquire $1.4 billion of their state-of-the-art, next-gen, post-acute facilities.", "Our Gracewell acquisition in the U.K. provides us with another senior housing brand and develop a pipeline in the more affluent London and Southern England markets. I would also note that Sunrise U.K. will manage the Gracewell assets for us, which is a value add that we were able to deliver to our largest operating partner, Sunrise Assisted Living.", "Also in the quarter, we were pleased with the announcement that Genesis HealthCare agreed to combine with Skilled Healthcare. This gives HCN's second largest operator access to public capital, further improving the credit quality of our portfolio. We're also happy to see our friend, George Hager, back in the public markets, and we're excited about what this means for the future of our relationship with Genesis.", "We generated $757 million of accretive investments in the quarter, of which $558 million was generated from our existing team of operators. We've been speaking to this every quarter, as it's another example of the predictability and unique transparency of the external growth component of the HCN model.", "Our financial results also reflect our history of financial and strategic discipline, whether it's the discipline to dispose of over $2 billion of non-core assets over the past 4 years or the discipline to have raised over $2 billion in equity in the last 6 months to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. We believe that these prudent actions are what enables us to deliver strong earnings growth over the long term. As Scott Estes will speak to later, despite the enormous growth in our business, our balance sheet and financial metrics have never been better.", "With that, I'm now going to turn the mic over to Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Thanks, Tom. I have a lot of good news to share today. The HCN team delivered another outstanding quarter. Our investment activity and proactive asset management are driving best-in-class internal growth. We've averaged 4% same store growth over the past 4 years.", "I'm going to start with outpatient medical office. This portfolio has been completely transformed in the 8 years since we entered the business. Today, on every important metric, our outpatient medical office portfolio is at or near the top of the peer group. We've added a slide to our corporate presentation showing how we stack up to our peers.", "Operating results in this portfolio are very steady. Same store NOI grew 3.3% over the comparable quarter. Looking forward, we see strong demand for space. The shift to outpatient care is a fundamental change in health care delivery that greatly benefits our portfolio.", "Let's turn to seniors housing. Same store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 7.6%, extending our history of superior results. Performance continues to be exceptional in the U.K., strong in the U.S. and steady in Canada. This portfolio has averaged 8% NOI growth since inception 4 years ago, substantially above all benchmarks. The outperformance is driven by the quality of our real estate and operating partners. We were highly selective in picking both our partners and our acquisition targets. The consistency is driven by purposeful diversification by operator, geography and service type. Our well-diversified triple net senior housing business continues to generate steady growth. Same store NOI increased 2.7%, continuing a nice history of inflation plus growth.", "Moving to post-acute. Our rental income is well secured and growing consistently. Same store NOI increased 3% over the comparable quarter. The big news last quarter was Genesis agreeing to combine with Skilled Healthcare. This is a big win for HCN. Genesis will become a public company with improved liquidity and higher payment coverage. You might remember that we received warrants in Genesis as part of the sale-leaseback in 2011. We'll convert those warrants into common stock at closing, giving us ownership in the public company that's worth about $40 million. With a cost basis of 0, we'll make a nice return on that investment.", "A small note on Life Science, which represents just 1% of our income. This Class A portfolio sits in an irreplaceable location at the doorstep to MIT. NOI declined last quarter due to a large anticipated lease expiration. We'll soon recapture the lost income. More than half the space has already been released, with a 2Q '15 commencement date. Term sheets are outstanding for much of the remaining vacant space on the campus.", "Turning to investments. Our partners helped us generate more than $750 million of new investments last quarter. Consistent with our long-time strategy, the lion's share of the activity was with existing partners. For example, we expanded our relationship with Sunrise through a $250 million acquisition in the U.K. that also comes with a large pipeline of to-be-developed communities.", "Looking forward, we secured partnerships with the leading private pay operators in the U.K. and Canada. These partners will help us deliver significant internal and external growth. This is the same blueprint we've used so successfully here in the U.S. In sports terms, if you held a draft and gave me the first 20 picks, there are only a handful of operators I'd pick that aren't already in our portfolio. That's a competitive advantage that cannot be replicated. These are the operators who are best positioned to consolidate what remains a fragmented market.", "The $950 million HealthLease acquisition is on target to close this quarter. The assets are primarily seniors housing and Class A post-acute, with a blended cap rate of 7%. We like to get more than just a collection of assets when we do a big deal. HealthLease is a good example. We received a $1.4 billion pipeline of brand-new assets being developed by Mainstreet. The cap rate on the pipeline is nearly 7.7%, highly attractive given the Class A building quality and 100% Q-Mix. The pipeline beyond HealthLease is exceptionally strong and dominated by off-market deals with existing partners.", "We get lots of questions about selling assets. The transaction market is strong, so why not take advantage? It's a good question, and it's exactly what we've been doing. We raised more than $2 billion over the past 4 years by selling non-core assets. We Got rid of our bottom 5%. This allows us to feel even more confident about the future.", "In summary, our portfolio, people and relationships position HCN for continued outperformance. I'll now turn the call to Scott Estes to discuss our financial results.", "Scott A. Estes", "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. From a financial perspective, we sit in a great position entering the final 3 months of the year. My remarks today will focus on our financial results, balance sheet and guidance.", "First, our continued success on the acquisition front and strong portfolio performance drove another quarter of meaningful earnings growth. Second, we have strategically positioned the balance sheet to produce the strongest financial metrics that I can remember, which includes sitting on $1 billion in cash as of September 30, effectively prefunding all acquisitions announced to date. And third, the strength of our results have allowed us to maintain the midpoint of our 2014 guidance despite increasing our annual disposition forecast by $175 million and raising over $1 billion of additional equity in the quarter.", "So I'll begin my more detailed comments by taking a look at our third quarter financial performance. Our platform continues to generate consistently strong earnings growth. Normalized FFO increased to $1.04 per share for the third quarter, while normalized FAD came in at $0.91 per share, representing solid 7% and 6% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were primarily driven by the same store cash NOI increase and the $2.3 billion of investments completed over the prior 12 months.", "In terms of operating expenses, our G&A for the third quarter came in at $31 million, in line with expectations. Regarding our dividends, as we move into 2015, our confidence in our portfolios' internal and external growth has allowed us to announce a 4% increase in our 2015 dividend payment rate. Our Board of Directors has approved a 2015 quarterly dividend payment rate of $0.825 per share or $3.30 annually beginning with the February 2015 dividend. And in terms of our disclosure, I would note we added pictures of our MOB portfolio to the website today, which I believe is a nice addition.", "Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. In terms of third quarter capital markets activity, the highlight was our secondary equity offering, which settled in mid-September. We completed the sale of 17.825 million shares of common equity at $63.75 per share, generating $1.1 billion in gross proceeds. We have now completed the 2 largest overnight offerings by any New York Stock Exchange company in 2014 based on total gross proceeds.", "In addition, we issued 982,000 common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $62 million in proceeds and generated $376 million of proceeds through the sale of nonstrategic assets and loan payoffs. We also repaid approximately $54 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and assumed $51 million of secured debt associated with acquisitions at a 2.9% rate.", "As a result of our third quarter capital activity and new line of credit, we're in an outstanding liquidity position at quarter end and have raised the capital to finance all acquisitions announced to date. More specifically, as of September 30, we have our full $2.5 billion line of credit available and $1 billion in cash, an additional $152 million of pending disposition throughout the remainder of 2014, and are generating an additional $60 million of equity per quarter through our dividend reinvestment program. We have limited near-term debt maturities, with only $51 million of debt maturing through year-end 2014.", "Our balance sheet and financial metrics at quarter end improved to the strongest levels in recent memory as a result of our improving portfolio performance and capital markets activities. As of September 30, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 36%, and net debt to enterprise value was 30%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to just below 5x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage improved to 3.9x and 3.1x, respectively. Our secured debt as a percentage of total assets declined 30 basis points to 11.8%. All of the preceding credit metrics are now comfortably inside our targeted levels.", "I'll conclude my comments today with an update on 2014 guidance and our supporting assumptions. I'll begin with our same store cash NOI growth outlook. Given our strong third quarter results, we're increasing our 2014 forecast from the previous range of 3.5% to 4% to approximately 4%. The increase is largely based on the strength of the seniors housing operating portfolio as our same store cash NOI forecast for the remaining components of our portfolio remain unchanged.", "In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions included in our guidance beyond what we've announced through the third quarter. We do continue to expect an additional $1.05 billion of previously announced acquisitions to close in the fourth quarter, which are included in our guidance. Our forecast now includes $625 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 9.5%, representing an increase from the previous expectation of $450 million.", "Finally, we have narrowed our normalized FFO and FAD per share guidance ranges for the full year around the midpoint of previous guidance. I believe this is a positive result, given the additional $1.1 billion of equity raised in the third quarter to significantly strengthen our balance sheet and the incremental $175 million increase in our disposition expectations for the year. As a result, we're narrowing our normalized 2014 FFO guidance to a range of $4.07 to $4.13 per diluted share, representing a 7% to 8% annual increase, and our FAD guidance to $3.59 to $3.65 per diluted share, representing a strong 7% to 9% increase.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. But I will conclude by saying we're very well positioned to execute on our growth pipeline, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash available to close all investments announced year-to-date.", "So at this point, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. So as you've heard, our third quarter results underscore the power of the HCN model. We continue to deliver strong, predictable growth and financial performance through our unique, diversified, global operating partner network as well as embracing a disciplined and conservative approach to managing our capital position. Our external growth is equally disciplined and conservative. The fact that I can tell you that $1.2 billion of our total year-to-date new investment growth of $1.8 billion has come from our existing operating partners truly demonstrates the transparency and predictability of our external growth model.", "I'm proud to say that HCN is now the fourth largest publicly-traded real estate company and is truly a global business. We know that investing outside the U.S. requires dedicated knowledge, skill and feet on the street in order to properly manage the opportunities and risks in these markets. I'm delighted to tell you that last month, HCN moved into its new London offices on Cornhill in the city of London, just a few paces away from where John Goodey, our SVP International, and I worked together in the 1990s. I invite all of you to visit John and the team when your travels take you to London.", "During the quarter, we welcomed Serge Rivera, President of The Americas for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, to our board, which adds additional bench strength and lodging and hospitality industry knowledge to an already outstanding group of directors.", "Finally, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of a great friend of HCN, Mary Wolf, wife of our founder, Fritz Wolf. For over 40 years, Mary was a strong supporter of our company. She was a passionate patron of the arts here in Toledo and in Palm Beach, Florida. Mary's intellect, kindness and humor were an inspiration to all of us. We will miss you, Mary.", "Now Holly, please open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "A question for you, Tom or Scott, on your thoughts on the cost of capital environment. And Scott talked about the forward pipeline being strong. Just curious if you want to add any more color to those comments, what we might expect to see you guys do over the next 6, 9, 12 months.", "Scott A. Estes", "Let me just kick it off on the investment pipeline. We'll talk about cost of capital...", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "I can talk about the investment pipeline. Michael, it's consistent with our history, so you're going to see us be active in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, high-quality assets, major metro markets, mostly private pay, and importantly, the lion's share of it will be with existing partners. And this is referring to the pipeline beyond HealthLease. So some of it will close in the fourth quarter, the rest might spill over to the first, but it's definitely an active time for us.", "Scott A. Estes", "And from a cost of capital perspective, we obviously are sitting on a nice bit of cash today. But given the solid stock price performance and debt markets performing pretty well, I think we can absolutely continue to invest accretively.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "I would support that, and look -- because of our cost of capital and access to capital really be opportunistic when we think about the business going forward.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a question on the operating portfolio senior housing. It sounds like you're increasing your guidance. I think before it was 6% to 6.5%. And it seems like you guys could hit 7% for the year if you can finish it maybe 4%, 5% or better in 4Q. I was just curious if you want to comment on operating guidance.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Yes. Michael, the fourth quarter is usually a little bit lower, so it's hard to say for sure, but I'm not sure that we'll get to the high 7s, low 8s like we have over the past few quarters. We won't know for sure for a couple of more months, but our best guess is that it will be a bit below that.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So just to clarify, what then is the new bogey for the full year?", "Scott A. Estes", "We would hope it would range 6.5% to 7%, if not toward the higher end of that range, depending on Scott's comment on the fourth quarter performance.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then last question for me. Tom or Scott, when you look at Life Science and you see kind of an ugly NOI print like you had this quarter, and then also you maybe think it -- maybe it doesn't quite fit your passion for improving health care delivery like your other business lines, do you sort of say to yourself, I've got some really valuable Cambridge properties, like you noted on the call and maybe, think about maybe time to recycle that and focus on your other business lines? Is that a thought that you guys have?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Michael, that's an asset that we're quite proud of, and I think the decision to invest in that asset a number of years ago has really proved to be a very good one. As you look at the Life Sciences market, we think that's probably, in the United States, among the very best locations you could find. So we think owning the best-in-class asset in the best market kind of fits our strategy, and we don't worry about that asset at all. As Scott mentioned already, we'll see very -- we're seeing very good lease-up of that available space.", "And that being said, you know that we always actively manage our portfolio, and we look -- we know that's a very valuable asset. We know it's an asset that -- where we have a very large gain in. And there may be an opportunity at some point in the future where we would consider doing something with that asset. But today, we're very happy to own it, and we feel very good about how it's being managed. And we like seeing it in the portfolio.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays.", "Rachana Fellinger - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is Racha Fellinger on behalf of Josh. Just a couple of quick ones. Do you have any plans around pub development in England in the RIDEA portfolio in the near future?", "Scott M. Brinker", "We do. This is Scott Brinker speaking. And we've been actively developing in that market for over 3 years now. It's interesting, if you go do some site visits, the quality of the stock in the U.K. is quite low on average, so we feel like there's a real opportunity as that market transitions away from government pay and towards private pay to build high-quality assets that people will actually want to be in and want to pay for. And that's what we own.", "So we've got 60-or-so communities in the U.K. right now, and these are all very new purpose-built private pay assets, and that's not typical in the U.K. So we've been very purposeful about what we bought. But frankly, there's not a whole lot left to acquire. There certainly are portfolios we're looking at, but there's really a development opportunity. So we're actively developing with Signature, Sunrise and Avery, all 3 of our partners. So you could easily see us do 10-plus projects a year going forward. And they've been extremely successful to date, with yield on cost in the high single digits or low double digits.", "Rachana Fellinger - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one other question. Are you seeing anything particular in terms of demographics of individuals that are moving in and out of your RIDEA portfolio? Are they younger, living longer, utilizing more ancillary services?", "Scott M. Brinker", "No, we haven't seen a material change there. They continue to be in the mid-80s. They're still staying 2 to 3 years on average, so these aren't -- I wouldn't say that the demographic profile of our communities has changed materially over the past few years.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "It's just that demographic trends are going to mean there are going to be more people attracted to these assets in the future, so we just see more demand coming. And I think we see that across the U.S., we see it in Canada and we see it in the U.K.", "And just to add to Scott's comment on the U.K., you're seeing a real change in the U.K., a societal change there. Elder care has been in existence there for a long time and offered by the National Health Service. You're seeing a change in the U.K. in that people are now willing to pay for their elderly care. There is a more affluent market, and so the product that's being developed is really being developed to meet the demands of that market.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup.", "Archena Alagappan", "This is Archena for Manny. In early September, there was a press release regarding the acquisition pipeline being around $1.7 billion for the second half of 2014, including $535 million of expected future acquisitions. So we were hoping that you could give us maybe some color on the composition of those remaining deals.", "Scott M. Brinker", "This is Scott Brinker. I'll try to answer that. The press release in August included the HealthLease portfolio, which was the lion's share of the $1.7 billion. That accounts for about $1 billion of it. And then most of the balance is what we just announced for this quarter. So it's the Sunrise deal; there's a big private pay senior housing acquisition in the U.K. with Avery Healthcare, an existing client; and then we did some MOB acquisitions. So the third quarter activity plus HealthLease will -- should total to $1.7 billion.", "Archena Alagappan", "Okay, great. And in terms of like the international pipeline, could you give us a sense of the acquisition or investment pipeline that you're seeing today? You just made some recent comments about like U.K. being a little difficult in terms of acquisitions, and it's going to be more development focused. Are you looking at any other additional markets? So maybe some color there might be helpful.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Well, I'd say we continue to see good opportunities in the U.K. As Scott did mention, a lot of it is development-oriented, but there may be some additional acquisition opportunity there as well. So I will tell you, as I've said in the past, we see tremendous opportunities in the U.S., number one. And then we are also seeing good opportunities in Canada and the U.K. I'd say our plate is quite full today with those markets.", "So we're not spending a tremendous time looking outside of those markets, but I can assure you that we're on top of where there may be opportunities in the future outside of those markets. I think having a strong team on the ground in Europe helps us understand those opportunities and gives us a competitive advantage at seizing whatever opportunities may come out of the existing markets we're in -- the existing market we're in, in Europe and other markets that we may choose to go into in the future.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Pretty good. All right. So I've heard -- Tom, I've heard that you might be more upbeat or sanguine on Life Science than your predecessor and maybe even willing to increase your exposure in that business over time. Is that a fair characterization?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Rich, when I've talked about Life Sciences in the past, it's been Life Sciences that are related to academic medical centers. And we still believe at some point in the future, there are tremendous real estate investments for us that may come out of those large academic medical centers that lead many of the Life Science efforts in this country. So to the extent that there are Life Science assets that may provide a connection to one of those or a few of those institutions, that's where I'm interested. We don't see it as a leading business for us going forward, but it may be a bridge into the type of business that you -- or the type of assets that you like to see us invest in.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good stuff. In the U.K., first a big-picture question. A lot of talk of deflationary pressures in Europe, and U.K. being kind of close proximity, do you worry at all about that in terms of expanding your platform there? Or are you just going to kind of plow through at this point?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Rich, so much of our portfolio is concentrated in the greater London, MSA and southern England, so I think that there are issues in England as you go throughout the country. We are very deliberate about where we own and develop assets. So -- and I can't underscore that enough, because we know the U.K. market quite well. We -- our assets, again, are largely around London. We see London as perhaps the most resilient market in the world. The amount of wealth that continues to consolidate into London is extraordinary. So we feel that being there is very important.", "And when you look across any property type owning assets in the U.K., I think investors should want to see a focus on the greater London markets, southern England and the other market, where there -- which is attractive because it's the second-largest market at England is around Birmingham, England, which is the middle level of the country. I think as you get above Birmingham we pause,, because we worry about some of the demographic issues from the mid- to northern England markets.", "So I think, like a lot of markets, Rich, if you're with the best operators who own the best real estate, generally you've got -- you create a bit of a strong competitive advantage. I could say that about certain markets in the United States, too, that -- where people will say might be overbuilt, but if you're in the best submarkets in those larger markets with the best operators, we think we're in a great position to capture growth in the future.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And specifically, the Gracewell deal, if that company is winning awards for managing their assets, why replace them with Sunrise? Or did they want that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Rich. It's Scott speaking. I wouldn't call it a replacement. It's more like an addition to Sunrise's already strong team. So Tim and Danny, the 2 principals at Gracewell, really have a development expertise. They're real estate guys, and they're going to continue in that function going forward. They're going to deliver this pipeline of assets in London and southern England. And then the best of the operating team from Gracewell is joining Sunrise. So to me, we're just combining 2 good platforms.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. Scott, maybe a question for you. The 7.6% same store NOI growth this quarter for RIDEA, when you think about sustainability of that number -- Ventas is producing a number lower than that. Do you think the number is more like in the 5% to 6% range when you kind of get through some of the occupancy lift? Or do you think a long-term number is close to 7% for now?", "Scott A. Estes", "Rich, I hope it's 7%. We've said, when we started doing RIDEA 4 years ago, that 4% to 5% long term in a static environment was probably realistic. I don't think our view has changed. I mean, we are confident that because of the assets and the operators, we'll outperform the industry. But in terms of continuing at our current pace of 8% per year, that would be very difficult. It's just the comparable quarter becomes so difficult to see.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Rich, you've heard us talk about the operating initiatives that we lead for our operating partners. That's real stuff. That's not made up. And so we'd like to think that because of our relationship and the skill set that we bring to the operator that we have a direct role in driving that same store sales growth, and I think that's just a unique aspect of our business model.", "Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I don't know if anyone has asked you about this, but with the problems that Ventas had with their Sunrise in Canada, do you have any comment about why that might have happened since you're a part owner of the management company?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Rich. We're a minority investor. We have 0 input on what Sunrise does operationally, and there is a strict Chinese wall. So I couldn't even begin to comment on it if I wanted to. We have nothing to do with their portfolio.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "I actually wanted to start on entrance fee properties. Some of your peers have been making investments in that space, and I'm not -- I don't feel like you've done a whole lot since development a few years ago. If you can talk a little bit about how your entrance fee portfolio is performing and maybe how you feel about increasing investments again in entrance fee CCRCs.", "Scott A. Estes", "Dan, I can comment on the existing portfolio performance. It's obviously very small. We have only 8 properties at about $390 million investment balance, but they actually continue to fill pretty well. Right now, the overall occupancy is in the mid-80s. It's about 86%. And the entrance fee community component of those properties are filling up. They're over 80%, and the rental part is in the low 90s. So I think they're doing fine. We just have chosen not to make additional investments in that portfolio.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Dan. It's less than 2% of our income today. And we've been in that business for over a decade, and we've just found that the cash flows are too volatile. Not saying that we would sell this portfolio that we have. It's performing well, but that's not an industry that we're looking to expand in. Just we like the consistency of our results, and it's very difficult in that business to generate any level of predictability.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then I was thinking about your dividend growth was a little bit -- is coming in a little bit below your FAD growth. Can you talk a little bit about goals for the FAD payout ratio or however you're thinking about the payout ratio for the dividend going forward?", "Scott A. Estes", "Yes. We like to be in a position where we can increase the dividend meaningfully but still push the payout ratios down pending earnings growth. So where we're at today I think we can get our FFO payout ratio down into the mid-70s or below and FAD in the mid-80s or below over the next several years pending our rate of earnings growth.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then in terms of -- I'm trying to think about -- a lot of investors I think have been concerned in the Health Care REIT space about investment spreads over cost of capital. You addressed a little bit about your strength in your cost and your capital availability earlier in the call, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about investment spreads today versus where you've seen them in the last couple of years? Just want to hear how you're thinking about your ability to invest accretively.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Dan. We've spent a lot of time looking at that. This is Scott Brinker. The spreads haven't changed that much. It's important that we're doing the vast majority of our investments off-market with existing clients. And the yields are pretty good if you compare that to what people are paying in auctions. So if we were generating all of our volume through large public auctions, it would be difficult to maintain a positive spread, but we feel like we've continued to do that. And it's still in the 50 to 150 basis points, given our current cost of capital, which, for us, is plenty of cushion to make a profit.", "I think what you are seeing, though, is just the company's getting bigger, so it's more difficult to, on a percentage basis, grow the company through external growth. But we knew that was coming, and that's why we're so focused on the performance of the existing portfolio and have these systems in place to improve NOI growth.", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Yes, and I -- Dan, on the external growth, I think, again, our operators, who we say we're aligned with the best national operators and the best regional operators, these operators are seeing tremendous demand and need to grow their businesses. And we are at the table with them and working with them to deliver the capital to realize their business plans. And I think that's where, largely, you've heard us say that over the last few quarters, and we said it strongly today, that's where our external growth is coming from. So again, we think we're -- and as Scott said, these are not opportunities that are being put out to auction. They're opportunities that are coming directly to us, and we think that we're still able, as you've heard today, generating plenty of accretive investment opportunities for our shareholders here.", "Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Given what you said about marketed transactions, does this also suggest that you're going to pick up more development as we go forward in the next couple of years? It looked like your development picked up a little bit. Are you -- I think you're running CIP to gross book below 1%. Do you see that increasing significantly over the next few years, given where cap rates are for marketed transactions?", "Thomas J. DeRosa", "Dan, you've heard us today, for instance, talk about the $1.4 billion development pipeline with HealthLease. Here's a situation where we're developing with them the next generation of post-acute care. These assets need to be brought to the market in order to have a health care delivery system that will lower costs and improve outcomes. So there is development that needs to be done in health care in the U.S. today because the product just doesn't exist. You don't see us investing a lot in old -- what we would say, our old-model SNFs because we think they're -- that business will be challenged in the future.", "But we are very bullish on what we call post-acute and the next-generation post-acute, things that you've seen in our portfolio with the Genesis PowerBack facilities and what you will see more of through Mainstreet and its next-gen, post-acute facilities.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Dan, the other thing I'd mention, this is Scott speaking, is that a lot of the development that we're involved with right now is really not our capital. I think we've been -- we've tried to be smarter about this round of development so that we're not taking as much risk if 2 or 3 years from now when these projects open, the market is not conducive to new supply.", "So Mainstreet is an example, and we have an option to buy those assets once they're built. So we're not putting out the $1.4 billion of capital. They build it, and then we have the option to buy it when it's complete. And that's the case with a pretty large number of our development projects right now. So the dollars you see on our balance sheet and in our supplement are actually a lot lower than what the potential pipeline could be.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I was just hoping you could give specific numbers on the RIDEA portfolio's growth by geography.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Sure, Juan. This is Scott. The U.K. led the pack at about 11%. The U.S. was right in line with the overall portfolio, about 8%. And then Canada was right around 4%.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the previous question on the developments. With Gracewell, are those options to acquire those assets upon completion? Or are those -- or do you have to take those out upon stabilization?", "Scott M. Brinker", "The Gracewell assets are set up as more of a guaranteed takeout at a slight premium to their build cost. So we underwrite the project alongside Sunrise, take -- they take all the predevelopment risk, being the developer, so we're not involved there. They find the land. They get it approved. Sunrise and HCN agree to the project, and then they build it. And 12 months later, we buy it at a fixed price.", "Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And just in terms of quantifying that potential pipeline of opportunities that we don't necessarily see. I mean, is there a way to -- for you to quantify kind of what your funding may be off-balance sheet, preferred or mezz lending, that maybe it's not as apparent just on some of your disclosure that would help us get a sense of that?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes. If you include the Mainstreet pipeline, Juan, the potential pipeline of new development projects is in the range of $1 billion a year. But again, most of those are set up where we have the option to buy, not an obligation.", "Operator", "And your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to clarify on the operating expenses for the senior housing operating portfolio. I think they were about 6% higher this quarter, and I think they were about 3% higher year-over-year last quarter. And I just wanted to see if you could give some color on why that ticked up so much. And then also, just can you talk about, to the extent that most of your operating costs there are variable to some extent, which I think is the case, just maybe chat about -- if the top line growth were to slow a little bit, you would be able to sort of reign in that operating expense increase, is my understanding.", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, Michael. It's Scott Brinker. It's tough, with just 3 months of data, to draw any conclusion. So operating expenses were a bit higher this quarter, but there is nothing dramatically out of line and nothing that we view as a long-term issue to be concerned about. Occupancy was up substantially year-over-year, 180 basis points, so that certainly impacted expenses a bit. But again, hopefully there is room for improvement if at some point in the future revenue growth is a little bit slower.", "And in terms of your last question, it's an important one. The vast majority of the expenses at these communities is variable, so when occupancy declines at some point in the future, we do think that there's a real opportunity to reduce costs and maintain NOI growth. And we saw that happen during the recession. And that's really a difference in seniors housing versus some of the other real estate asset classes. People talk about our operating margins being in the mid-30s rather than 70% like multi-family, and that's true. But it's also true that most of our expenses are variable. So when you have issues with revenue or occupancy, you can adjust and maintain NOI. So we've seen that happen in the past, and we think it could happen in the future if revenue growth ever slows.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you just talk about the pricing power in your top line revenue growth that you reported this quarter and what you're sort of seeing looking forward? It seemed like it was mostly occupancy And maybe on the rate or services revenue side it was maybe in the mid-3% type range? Can you just talk about any change or maybe no change that you see on the pricing power side?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, the pricing power is huge, Michael. That's been the main driver of our outperformance over the past few years. The same store rate growth this quarter was 4.6%. It's a little different than the supplement because I'm giving you a same store number. The supplement is the whole portfolio. So that's roughly 2x what the industry is achieving. And we've tracked that over a number of years. And we've been about 2x the national average consistently, and that's driving most of the substantial NOI growth that you see.", "Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division", "And then last question is on the U.K. You mentioned the NOI growth there in that portfolio is double digits. Can you remind us where that has been in the last few quarters and then kind of what's driving that substantial rate of growth? Is it occupancy pick-up? Or is it the pricing power?", "Scott M. Brinker", "Yes, it's been double digits for a year now, and it's a combination of occupancy and rate growth. So all the numbers that I just gave you, which is our entire same store portfolio, the U.K. is even better.", "Operator", "And that will conclude today's conference call.

My name is Espalane, and I will be your operator today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Miller", "Thank you, Espalane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at hcreit.com.

Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, the CEO of HCN. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning from Toledo, Ohio, where it is minus 12 degrees and we are on emergency generator power. So if we cut out at any time through this call just stand by because we will be back.", "By all measures, 2014 was an outstanding year for HCN. Our 48.5% total return made us the top-performing large cap REIT in the S&P 500. Simply put, the best portfolio of health care real estate in the top markets in the U.S., UK, and Canada, occupied by best-in-class operators in health systems provides our shareholders with consistent resilient portfolio on earnings growth.", "Our 2014 results demonstrate just how our shareholders benefit from our unique position in the health care real estate space. We completed $3.7 billion in new investments of which $2 billion were generated from our existing operators. The quality and transparency of that investment growth is unparallel than our industry.", "Our normalized FFO per share increased 8% over 2013, and if you follow the NAREIT definition of FFO that was a 15% increase. This earnings performance was generated by industry-leading 4.2% same store NOI growth across the portfolio and a remarkable 7.3% same store NOI growth in our operating portfolio.", "But that my friends is the old news. Why are we so optimistic about our business? We\u2019ve been telling you for some time that we have a differentiated model that is driven by our unique alignment with the best senior housing and post-acute operators in the U.S., UK and Canada, as well as top health systems.", "We are relentless real estate asset and portfolio managers. Keep in mind that our FFO growth has occurred while we have sold over $2.5 billion in assets over the last five years. We have always believed that a strategic disposition program is in the best near-term and long-term interest of our shareholders.", "Hence, we enter 2015 with perhaps the most modern, best located and relevant real estate portfolio in the health care real estate industry. A portfolio that is increasingly concentrated in markets with superior demographic and economic drivers that are attracting global wealth like New York, London, and Washington D.C. And because we have sold older non-strategic assets, we can focus on driving the performance of our A quality health care real estate in 2015 and beyond.", "Having raised over $3 billion in capital last year, we are in one of the strongest credit and liquidity positions in our 45-year history. This will enable HCN to continue to meet the capital needs of our partners as they drive the future of health care delivery. Further, 2015 will benefit from the dominant position we have built in high-end seniors housing in London and the innovative post-acute platforms we are building with Genesis and Mainstreet.", "When you combine this with our deep engagement with our operators to drive growth through best practices, innovative transaction structuring, our focus on technological innovation and good old-fashioned Toledo-style hard work, all the pieces are in place to deliver the quality of growth that you\u2019ve come to expect from HCN.", "Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer, will give you a closer look at our portfolio performance and growth, including details on the fourth quarter. He will be followed by Scott Estes, who will do a deeper dive on our full year 2014 results as well as our fourth quarter financial performance. Over to you, Scott.", "Scott Brinker", "Okay, thanks, Tom. Our positive momentum continues to our very good results this year. Strong demand for our real estate through a 3.5% same store growth last quarter and 4% average growth over the past four years.", "The sector leading quality of our real estate and operating partners is the main driver of our outperformance. I\u2019ll provide some color on each business segments, starting with seniors housing. Same store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 5.7% last quarter, occupancy was up 1.6% and rate was up 3.6%. Importantly, we\u2019re getting these results without pouring money into the buildings. We own Class A assets that need relatively little CapEx.", "Performance continues to be exceptional in the global wealth centers where we purposely have a large footprint. This includes markets like London, New York, and Los Angeles. Just under 60% of the operating portfolio is located in the 10 largest MSAs in the U.S., UK, and Canada. Our decision to concentrate in these markets is paying off.", "Moving to triple net seniors housing, same store NOI grew 2.6% last quarter. We don\u2019t include any one-time fees or CapEx funding, so our triple net growth is very consistent and predictable. We do triple net as a nice complement to our operating portfolio.", "Next up is medical office. Our platform delivered sector-leading rental rates and occupancy. Same store NOI increased 2.5% last quarter as expected. The outlook for this segment is continued steady growth, driven by our modern assets, a larger ensured population and the shift to outpatient care.", "Turning to post-acute and long-term care, our rental income is well secured and growing consistently. Same store NOI increased 3.1% last quarter. We had a big win two weeks ago when Genesis completed its combination with Skilled Healthcare. Genesis became a publicly traded company within improved access to capital.", "Payment coverage is solid at the corporate and facility level and we are excited by the likelihood of improvement over time. In particular, Genesis is projecting higher coverage from expense initiatives, synergies, new development, debt pay-downs and re-financings.", "We continue to grow the relationship with brand new rehab focus buildings that are highly demanded by patients and payers. Importantly, all of our Genesis properties are in a single master lease that matures 17 years from now. This gives our rental income long-term visibility.", "Beginning this quarter, we moved our nursing homes and post-acute hospitals into a single reporting segment for our long-term and post-acute care. This better reflects the services provided and the moment toward site-neutral payments.", "We also added a table in the supplement that details our quality mix, which will improve over time as we acquire the Mainstreet development projects. In our experience, payer mix impact value. Hopefully, this information helps your analysis.", "Turning to investments, we had a fantastic quarter. Our partners helped us generate $1.8 billion in new investments. Initial cash yield was 7.2%, substantially above our cost of capital. We completed the acquisition of HealthLease and we\u2019ve already begun acquiring properties from the Mainstreet pipeline.", "As usual, we completed follow-on investments with several existing partners, including industry leaders like Sunrise, Genesis, Silverado, Avery, SRG and Kelsey-Seybold. Expanding with known trusted partners is our primary avenue for growth, leads to better execution and higher returns.", "Bigger picture, our investment strategy is to lock arms with premier operators and grow along side them. We bring them opportunities and they bring us opportunities. Both parties benefit. Over time, these strategic partnerships between capital and operations will capture market share and outperform. This strategy is far removed from growth fueled by paying the highest price in an auction.", "When we do make an investment there is always a longer-term plan. Here is an example. The initial investment with our top ten operators totaled $6.5 billion, it\u2019s a big number, but we\u2019ve more than doubled that amount in follow-on investments with those same ten operators and there is a lot more to come.", "We are actively growing with more than 30 of our partners. It\u2019s the breadth and depth of these partnerships that differentiates HCN. It leads to superior internal and external growth. We\u2019ll add to this foundation in 2015 with a handful of new partners, who\u2019s long been on our wish list.", "We actively manage the portfolio and always looking to maximize value. Sometimes the best answer is to sell assets. Last quarter, we sold an entry fee portfolio for $441 million; which was a mid-5% cap rate on the rent. Entry fee assets tend to struggle during downturns and this portfolio was no exception.", "The $94 million gain on sale highlights our ability to work with operators through up and down cycles to maximize value. This sale was a fantastic outcome for all parties. In summary, last year finished strongly and we are ready to build on that success for 2015.", "Scott Estes will now discuss our financial results and guidance.", "Scott Estes", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The performance of our portfolio and the success of our partnership-based investment strategy translated into another year of strong financial results. My specific remarks today focus on our recent financial performance, our current balance sheet and liquidity, and the key assumptions driving our 2015 guidance.", "I\u2019ll begin by taking a look at our fourth quarter and calendar 2014 financial results. Normalized FFO increased to $1.03 per share for the fourth quarter, while FAD came in at $0.91 per share, representing solid 4% and 6% increases year-over-year, respectively. More importantly, for the full year, our normalized FFO increased 8% to $4.13 per share and FAD increased 9% to $3.66 per share. Results were driven by the strong same store cash NOI increase and the $2.7 billion of net investments completed during 2014.", "In terms of dividends, today we will pay our 175th consecutive quarterly cash dividends of $0.825 per share, a rate of $3.30 annually. This represents a 3.8% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%.", "We finished 2014 with our most significant investment quarter of the year totaling $1.8 billion for the period. As Scott mentioned, approximately half of our fourth quarter investments came from our existing operators with the remainder as a result of our HealthLease acquisition.", "Turning now to the liquidity picture and balance sheet in terms of fourth quarter capital markets activity, the highlights clearly was our second successful UK unsecured debt offering completed in mid-November, when we issued \u00a3500 million of 20 year notes priced to yield just over 4.5%. Based on exchange rates at the time, this translated into approximately $783 million. These offerings fit nicely into our maturity schedule and have extended our average unsecured debt maturity to nearly 10 years at a blended rate of 4.4%.", "In addition, we had a number of other capital activities during the fourth quarter. We issued just over 1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program generating $70 million in proceeds. We generated $558 million of proceeds through the sale of non-strategic assets and loan payoff, including $111 million gains on sale, resulting in a blended yield on total proceeds of 5.5%.", "We repaid approximately $39 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.7% and assumed $142 million of secured debt associated with acquisitions at a blended 5.5% rate. And last, we repaid the $250 million of 5.875 senior notes that were to mature in May of 2015.", "So as a result of these activities, we have no unsecured debt maturing in 2015. We ended the year with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion line of credit and we had $474 million of cash, leaving us in an excellent liquidity position entering the new year.", "As a result of our recent financing activity and portfolio performance, our balance sheet and financial metrics at year-end remain at or slightly better than our targeted level. Our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 38.6% as of December 31, and net debt to enterprise value was 28.3%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.5 times while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the fourth quarter were a solid 3.8 times and 3.0 times respectively. Our secured debt as a percentage of total assets is 11.9%.", "In light of the recent strength in the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and Canadian dollar, I\u2019d like to take a minute to provide an update on our hedging strategy and positions entering 2015. We have minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 97% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 75% hedged from an earnings perspective.", "So, as a result, the significant strength of the U.S. dollar versus both the pound and Canadian dollar earlier this year is only expected to negatively impact our 2015 earnings results by $0.02 per share and is already reflected in the earnings guidance provided today. In terms of future sensitivity, it would take a meaningful 10% move in both currencies from current levels versus the U.S. dollar to move our annual earnings either up or down by an additional $0.02 per share.", "I conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2015 guidance. In terms of same store cash NOI growth, we\u2019re forecasting a blended growth rate of 3% to 3.5% in 2015. This is again based on the combination of higher growth expected out of our operating portfolio and the more stable growth predicted for a longer term net lease portfolio.", "To breakdown this forecast by asset type, for our seniors housing operating portfolio, we are projecting growth of approximately 5%, as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operator\u2019s performance. This forecast includes projected revenue growth in the mid-4% range and operating expense increases of roughly 4%. Due to the more severe flu season and harsh winter conditions experienced in much of the Northeast and Midwest this year, we are anticipating that our first quarter growth is likely to be slightly lower than the average for the year.", "For our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, we are anticipating growth of approximately 2.5%. For our long-term care post-acute portfolio, we\u2019re projecting an increase of 2.5% to 3%. For MOB\u2019s, we project an increase of approximately 2.25% which is driven primarily by annual rate increases, stable occupancy, low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%.", "And last, for our life science portfolio, we expect overall growth for the year of approximately positive 10% which is driven by more significant increases during the second half of the year and signed leases to backfill the vacancy at our 88 Sydney property take occupancy during the first half of the year, which should bring aggregate portfolio occupancy to over 97%.", "In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we\u2019ve announced today in our formal guidance. As a result, the only acquisitions included in our guidance are the approximate $250 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership, at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%.", "Our 2015 guidance also includes $196 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.4% and approximately $400 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale based on book value of 10%. When potential gains on sale are included, we believe that the blended yield on sale, based on total proceeds will be closer to 8.5%.", "All of these assets sales are expected to occur during the first half of the year and are primarily composed of the final government reimbursed acute care hospital in our portfolio, a long term care portfolio in Texas that we\u2019ve held for over 12 years and the non-strategic seniors housing portfolio.", "In terms of CapEx, our capital expenditure forecast is about $63 million for 2015 comprised of approximately $40 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $23 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. These amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 6% to 7% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories, as we have a newer portfolio that is almost entirely been acquired within the last five years.", "Our G&A forecast is approximately $145 million for 2015. We continue to build our organization into a global healthcare leader and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the appropriate people and infrastructure to support our premier portfolio. During 2015, we will enhance our efforts on the marketing and branding fronts, improve our information technology platform and continue to invest in the training and education of our employees. We have expanded our sector-leading presence in the UK with an office that is staffed with seven professionals and are excited to be opening a new office in Toronto, Canada around the middle of the year.", "We\u2019re confident these expenditures will protect and expand our market leading franchise while longer-term, we remain focused on running the organization with expense ratios that are in line with the best-in-class REITs in our industry.", "So finally as a result of these assumptions, we expect to report 2015 FFO in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share representing 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2014 results, while our 2015 FAD expectation is the range of $3.83 to $3.93 per diluted share representing a solid increase of 5% to 7%.", "So, I conclude by prepared remarks by saying that we remain focused on maintaining the access to capital and consistent financial performance that you\u2019ve come to expect from us in supporting our market leading platforms.", "So at this point, I\u2019ll turn it back to you Tom for some closing remarks.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. I think as you\u2019ve heard from both Scott\u2019s, we\u2019re quite optimistic about where we sit at this point in 2015 and we\u2019re looking forward to a great year \u2013 this year and beyond.", "And with that I\u2019m going to ask Espalane to please open up the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Tom DeRosa", "Good morning, Juan.", "Operator", "Juan, if your line is muted, please un-mute your phone.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hello, can you hear me?", "Tom DeRosa", "We can now.", "Scott Brinker", "Can hear you, Juan.", "Juan Sanabria", "Sorry about that. Just wondering if you guys could give some color on the acquisition pipeline in terms of the make-up of the asset types you\u2019re looking at. Is there any change in mix? Had a few of your peers talk maybe a little bit more about going towards the skilled nursing assets, either the old model or the new short-term post-acute, and kind of what you\u2019re seeing on the CapEx front by asset classes. We\u2019ve seen some anecdotal evidence at senior housing assets trading sort of sub-6%. Are you seeing that or do you expect to transact with those types of price points?", "Scott Brinker", "Hey Juan, this is Scott Brinker, I think it\u2019s fair to say senior housing cap rates are in the mid-5%s to mid-6%s. medical office is just probably a bit below that, and then post-acute is more in the 7% to 8% range. There is a lot of activity, a number of large, medium and small-sized auctions. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be very active in any of those. Again, our pipeline is as full as it has ever been. We\u2019re growing with so many of our existing partners, they bring us deals. So it\u2019s seniors housing, it\u2019s medical office, it\u2019s a select number of post-acute, it\u2019s Canada, it\u2019s U.S., it\u2019s UK. The investment team is as busy as ever.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thanks and if maybe you could share just a little bit of color on the expectation by geography on the RIDEA platform?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Juan, we made a very purposeful decision four or five years ago when we first started doing RIDEA to really only put class A assets \u2013 class A operators into that portfolio and there is a heavy concentration in major Metros. So we don\u2019t have any major concentration in any one market, but where we do have some concentration it\u2019s exactly where you\u2019d wanted to be in terms of the affluence in growth. So cities like London, New York, Los Angeles and they have continued quarter after quarter to outperform the other markets in our portfolio.", "Tom DeRosa", "Juan, let me just add to that. We look at healthcare real estate like many of other REITs look at healthcare real estate. We wanted to be in the best markets and we\u2019re very focused on markets like a New York, like a London where there is a concentration of global wealth and where there is a trend towards increasing urbanization, people moving in from the outer rings towards the urban core. We like those markets and frankly many of those markets are unreserved in senior housing assets and modern outpatient medical.", "You\u2019re probably aware we\u2019re in the process of developing an outpatient medical facility adjacent to Maimonides hospital in Brooklyn, New York, which is one of the most vibrant urban markets in the country. So we feel that we want to always manage our portfolio to be in the best markets and when we think about adding new assets we\u2019ll also be in the best markets around the U.S., Canada and the UK.", "Juan Sanabria", "But do you still expect the UK to be like a 2X number or whatever it is of the U.S. growth, particularly on the RIDEA portfolio?", "Tom DeRosa", "Not indefinitely, but it continues to outperform our expectations for 2015, I think it will still be at the high end, but by a small number, not twice as high, like it has been in the last two year\u2019s.", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, what\u2019s happening in the UK is you have a growing affluent population that will opt out of NHS senior housing and opt into private pay senior housing assets. And so that market has been at the upper end, has been supply constrained and we\u2019re focused on meeting the natural demand we see growing in that market.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great, and just one last question. You mentioned 5% expense growth on RIDEA. Could you just comment on kind of what\u2019s driving that? Are you seeing any increased level of competition for employees given the labor market and the new supply that \u2013 as to staff up?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yeah, Juan, it was just over 5% in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s higher than our expectations in 2015. I think low 4%'s is more in line with what we expect. The primary driver is staffing of course, and wage growth continues to be in the 2% to 3% range. Food and electric is in the 2% to 3% range as well. And then a bit higher would be things like insurance, workers' comp and things like that. So, blended, about 4% is our expectation.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay, great, thanks. Stay warm guys.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yeah, thanks Juan.", "Scott Brinker", "You too.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thank you. Just sticking to the RIDEA portfolio, maybe can you just talk about expect \u2013within the same store revenue growth, what are you baking in for occupancy? And just maybe longer term, given kind of the locations of your assets, what do you view as kind of structure of peak occupancy?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Vik, it's Scott Brinker. I can see today is in the low 90s; so we do think there is maybe 100 basis points to 200 basis points of upside, best case. And it\u2019s trending in that direction. So I think you could see us get in the 92%, 93% range over the next 12 months to 24 months.", "In terms of the mix of revenue growth between occupancy and rental rates, it\u2019s always hard to predict, but our expectation for total revenue growth next year is in the 5% range and that\u2019s a blend of rate growth and occupancy growth; is probably the fairest way to break it down.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, and then just on the CapEx in the shop portfolio, I'm assuming just most of that is general maintenance given the age of the portfolio. But just wanted to clarify, is there any kind of revenue enhancing, any investments within the portfolio that you\u2019re making, or it\u2019s all just maintenance stuff?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, it\u2019s mostly maintenance. Five years and 10 years or 15 years from now we might be having a different discussion, but our assets are extremely young, modern; they don\u2019t need major structural enhancements or renovations. That\u2019s an important distinction when you look at the NOI growth. We\u2019re generating that performance without pouring money into the buildings. And I think people really need to think about that.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao.", "Vincent Chao", "Good morning, everyone. Scott, you did a nice job talking about the limited FX impact at the FFO level. I was just curious for your same store NOI guidance for the full year, is there much of an impact at that level since you don\u2019t have the natural hedging in place with the debt? And just curious what the SHOP same-store NOI outlook would be \u2013 I guess, absent FX impacts.", "Scott Estes", "The same-store NOI growth forecast is on a constant currency basis. And if you did look back, I think we\u2019re not going to predict forward; but if you think about maybe what happened last year, what was the impact -- I think it was like 50 basis points or 60 basis points. Our same store NOI growth would have been a little bit lower by about that level, due to the currency changes that occurred last year. So we\u2019re generally, again, we\u2019re trying to minimize taking any currency risk, as much as we can.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks. And then in terms of guidance, specifically calling it out as NAREIT guidance, and I know there\u2019s a big push from NAREIT to kind of have everybody report on that basis. Is that the idea going forward, is that that will be the way you present guidance? Or will we still get the normalizing items, and normalized guidance, going forward?", "Tom DeRosa", "We have always in our financials had the NAREIT FFO, but we'll be giving guidance on a normalized basis. We think it provides a clearer picture of the performance of the company.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays.", "Josh Raskin", "Hi, thanks.", "Tom DeRosa", "Hey, Josh.", "Josh Raskin", "Hi, good morning. On the theme I guess, the RIDEA portfolio, the 5.7% in the fourth quarter obviously very healthy above what you expecting in the future and above the normalized portfolio, the triple net portfolio. I mean you guys have outperformed that number pretty significantly last couple of years. I guess there has been a little bit of a slowdown in the growth more recently. So I\u2019m just trying to understand what drove sort of that excess growth historically and what\u2019s not included going forward?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, we\u2019ve had four years of outperformance, so the treadmill keeps spinning faster. But yeah, the 5% is something to be excited about. So we are very pleased with it. Our expectation next year is for the 5% range which is still outstanding. I think a couple of things drove the, if you want to call it a slowdown. One, the occupancy growth this year was a little bit less than in prior years and the rate growth was at more the lower end of what we have been able to achieve. And at least in the fourth quarter you had higher expenses. So it\u2019s a combination of all those things.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned first quarter you\u2019d expect a little bit of weakness relative to the full year number based on weather and flu. Any sense in the magnitude, I mean, is that 100 basis points lower or is this going to be a more significant impact, understanding that we are only halfway through the quarter.", "Scott Brinker", "I think you are talking about the magnitude that we would see. You're right; we are only halfway through the quarter, but we are not seeing a major change. I think some of the early results, there is \u2013 yeah, there has been some occupancy pressure in January as a result of those factors. So we just wanted to alert people. We are comfortable with a 5% range for the year, but it looks like, I would probably say 100 basis points is about a fair estimate that gets at this point, so call it 4'ish in the first quarter if we had to peg a number right now.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay. Thanks, Scott. And then just a last question on post-acute. You talked about cap rates coming down a little bit there. Should we think of \u2013 I guess I\u2019m just curious to get your perspective on external new partners, et cetera, versus just continuing to grow with your existing partners. Has that dynamic changed, as cap rates have come down? Or do you still think that there\u2019s opportunities with new partners in post-acute?", "Scott Brinker", "Josh, most of the growth will continue to be with Genesis. We think the most about their platform and their position in evolving healthcare landscape, but we did pick up a number of new partners through the Mainstreet partnership and we'd except to continue to grow with them as well. So there is a list of three to five, like Ensign and Trilogy that we expect to be growth partners going forward.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay, thanks Scott.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, it's Smedes. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about supply in the U.S. for senior housing overall. It sounds like you are pretty protected in the MSAs where your \u2013 the bulk of your portfolio is, but do you see an uptick in supply kind of nationwide?", "Scott Brinker", "The new supply continues to be at really a local level, so some markets do have a high amount of new supply like Houston and there are a number of markets that have virtually none. Now if you look at it at a national level, we think supply and demand are roughly in line. If anything, demand is growing faster than supply, which is why you see our occupancy increasing year-over-year, the NIC National occupancy is increasing year-over-year and is predicted to do so again in 2015.", "So we still feel like the dynamics are positive for occupancy, but for sure there are certain markets where you should be more concerned than others. In terms of the change, if anything it's slowing down, so there certainly is still projects; our new project's been put under construction, but there is an uptick from what we\u2019ve seen over the past few years.", "Tom DeRosa", "And Smedes, we are very focused on working with our national and top-quality regional operators to bring supply into markets where there is very little supply. Think about a market like Washington D.C. - in Central Washington D.C. we have a Sunrise asset on Connecticut avenue very close to the National Zoo, which is a great example of an urban senior housing property where there needs to be more of \u2013 this is in a market that is very densely populated. The population is getting older, and people want to stay where they lived prior to entering senior housing. So that\u2019s an area that we are very focused on and working with our operators to be able to bring that supply to the market and we are very optimistic that that will be very well received.", "Smedes Rose", "Thanks. And the other thing I just wanted to ask you, it looks like you've pretty much exited your investment in hospitals and I was just wondering, is that an area that you would see returning to at some point or\u2026?", "Scott Brinker", "With respect to hospitals, historically, our hospital portfolio did not mirror the quality of our seniors housing and post-acute portfolio. If in the future there were opportunities to buy high quality hospitals, we would consider that.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Hi, good morning, everybody.", "Scott Brinker", "Hi, Rich.", "Rich Anderson", "So anybody in the room there, would you be as comfortable being twice the size the company you are now or less comfortable or are you kind of neutral on that topic?", "Tom DeRosa", "Rich, this is Tom. We \u2013 you know Scott mentioned the investment we\u2019re making in people and infrastructure. We are attracting very talented people from the industry to come work with us because they see we\u2019re an outstanding company that really invests in its people. And as you think about growing our business \u2013 think about how we've grown in the last five years. It\u2019s all about people.", "So, we are always thinking about where we will be in the future, and do we have the right team, do we have the right infrastructure. And so, I\u2019m confident that we have the right human capital strategy in place to take this company wherever opportunities may take us in the future.", "Rich Anderson", "Do you think the issue with the HCP and HCR ManorCare and that whole subpoena issue, is that something we should be worried about generally, or what is your thought about just looking at the kind of the post-acute business and how it might be exposed to issues like that as a general rule of thumb?", "Tom DeRosa", "I can\u2019t comment on HCP and ManorCare. What I can comment on is Genesis and we are \u2013 and Mainstreet, as Scott was discussing as well. We are very bullish about the future of post-acute in this country.", "And we are investing with Genesis and we\u2019re investing with Mainstreet. We\u2019re very excited that Genesis is now public. We are big believers in George Hager. We think it\u2019s terrific that there is a public post-acute company now and we have every confidence in George and the Genesis team that they are going to take that business to where it needs to go. We need a strong, vibrant, post-acute product in the healthcare delivery system in this country. And we are betting that Genesis is going to bring that product \u2013 continue to bring that product to the market.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Turning to the SHOP, or the Senior Housing Operating Portfolio, so in 2013 \u2013 I think I have these numbers right \u2013 you produced 6.2% same store NOI growth. In 2014, I did the average, I think it was 7.3%. I don\u2019t think you disclosed that number in your supplemental, the full year, do you?", "Tom DeRosa", "No, we hit the same, just averaging the quarter.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. So average in the quarter is about 7.3% and it trended down from 8.1% in the first quarter to 5.7 % in the fourth quarter but compared well to your original guidance which was 5% or better for 2014, that\u2019s what you said a year ago. And now you are saying 5% \u2013 you took out the 'or better' comment, not to be nitpicky. So, it went from 6% to 7.3% to now expectation of 5%. Do you think that we are kind of in that sort of other side of the bell shaped curve or is it flattening out? What is your view about the business vis-\u00e0-vis its historical same store growth pattern?", "Tom DeRosa", "I\u2019m not sure about the bell shaped curve, but we think a lot about the portfolio and operators that we've put together and think that the 5% for next year is achievable despite some very difficult comps in a relatively slow economy. And longer term, our expectation, our guidance has always been 4% to 5% is our best guess.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay.", "Tom DeRosa", "If that changes materially, we will definitely let everybody know.", "Scott Brinker", "But we are always looking for ways to improve on that. That\u2019s one of the things that differentiates us, Rich, is that we have a lot more oars in the water than a typical owner of healthcare real estate to try and move that number forward. And we talk about that and we actually see real results from that. So I think we are as well positioned as anybody to drive same store sales growth from our RIDEA portfolio.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay.", "Tom DeRosa", "[indiscernible], Rich, just a quick comment from Scott Estes here. We initially went into RIDEA and we\u2019re talking about 4% to 5% long-term growth and we had a lot of debate about how you are going to outpace inflation and we've put out probably like you said, 6%, 7%. 8% numbers for four years now. So I think we just to need to get perception is if we can generate outpaced growth and we are adding value at the property level and we are outperforming our sector, I mean that\u2019s really the things we can control.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. How often do you look at your ownership in Sunrise OpCo vis-\u00e0-vis your \u2013 how you book it and what\u2019s valued on your financials right now? I mean in terms of potential \u2013 I don't know, impairment I don't \u2013 not discussing that's coming, but is that an annual event or ongoing or how does that take place.", "Tom DeRosa", "We look at it \u2013 I mean we have a 24% approximate ownership in the management company and that investment is in our investments in unconsolidated entities and we haven't really talked more about it. I don't think it's meaningful from an aggregate balance sheet perspective.", "Scott Brinker", "It\u2019s a small investment.", "Rich Anderson", "Small, and more a canary in the coal mine type stuff, but just curious. And then the last question from me is what would you say \u2013 how would you think the history would look like if you were to compare the share account \u2013 the growth in your share count versus the growth in your FFO, over an extended period of time? What do you think that would look like? Would it be greater share count, or greater FFO growth?", "Scott Brinker", "We could probably sit here and think about that. I think the most important thing you need to think of is looking at what type of total return and shareholder value creation we've had by \u2013 the reason why if FFO ever was slower is because of the dramatic portfolio enhancements we've made over the last five years.", "I mean, we had about $5 billion of assets five years or six years ago and we sold $2.5 billion to $3 billion of those and we've bought the best assets in the industry. And now we are trading at the highest multiple in that great return. So you can focus on a little bit of the tinkering about how we financed it and what results. But we have been able to grow our dividend nicely and get great total shareholder returns. So I think that\u2019s what we are supposed to do.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yeah, I can underscore enough what Scott just said about the fact that we've disposed of $2.5 billion in assets over the last five years. That is difficult when you are trying to grow FFO when you are selling assets of that magnitude, but that\u2019s why we feel so good about the future and that\u2019s what you should be expecting any company in the real estate sector should be doing. And you know what? They don\u2019t do it.", "So, look across the real estate sector, and the companies that have active asset disposition in asset management programs should be trading at a premium and those that continue to hold on to assets because they don\u2019t want to jeopardize their FFO growth should be trading at a discount.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. I\u2019ve taken too long. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Scott Brinker", "Thanks, Rich.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.", "Scott Brinker", "Hi, Ross.", "Ross Nussbaum", "I\u2019m \u2013 clarify the same store NOI guidance. So I think your guidance for 2015 is 3% to 3.5% and I think I heard you say that the shop portfolio or the RIDEA portfolio is going to do 5% is your guidance or do I have the...", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, that's correct. Yes.", "Ross Nussbaum", "So that would imply for the medical office, the triple-net, the life science, it would imply I think 2% to 2.5% same store NOI growth? Is that about right?", "Scott Brinker", "That\u2019s the way the math works. We already gave you the guidance for each of the subcomponents; the MOBs was 2.25%, the rest were around 2.5%. Yep, long term care [indiscernible].", "Ross Nussbaum", "Wondering why \u2013 maybe I missed this, but why the slowdown on the triple-net side at least from where it was in the fourth quarter?", "Scott Brinker", "It may be a couple of basis points below the fourth quarter but it\u2019s in line with historical averages. I mean the triple-net business is a 2.5% plus or minus growth business and its all contractual rent increases so there are no one-time fees in that number or anything like that. So it\u2019s very predictable but it\u2019s not a super-high growth part of the business.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Great. I can follow-up with you guys afterwards. That\u2019s sort of where I was going, which is saw the 3.1% number for the fourth quarter. I said, wow, that looked good, but it felt like there might be something one-time-ish in there.", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, there may be. The 3.1% was for the post-acute long term care portfolio, and that's still primarily Genesis is two-thirds of that category. And our increases of course are still on the 3.3% range, so that drives it. Then we do have the CPI catch up language on number of these leases where the escalators are not fixed and that can create some noise from quarter-to-quarter.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. On the disposition front \u2013 I might have missed this earlier, the $400 million of sales that you guys have planned for the first half of this year at 10 caps, what do you guys have in the portfolio that would sell at double this cap?", "Scott Brinker", "I did mention that Ross in the comments, but just to say again, one, there is one acute care hospital in there and a nursing portfolio that we\u2019ve had in our overall portfolio for over 12 years that are more than half of that aggregate total.", "Tom DeRosa", "And a big part of it is \u2013 that yield is based on the book value and we\u2019ve owned these assets for quite a while, so if you do the yield on the actual sale proceeds, the cap rate is a lot lower than 10%.", "Scott Brinker", "I mentioned that. So, it should be more closer to 8.5% roughly depending upon how the final prices come in.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Last question, can you talk a little bit strategically about the life science business? It feels like it hasn\u2019t been much of a focus for you guys. There have been some assets that have been coming up for sale that the Alexandrias and BioMeds of the world have bought. Where are you guys with respect to strategically expanding the portfolio in that segment?", "Scott Brinker", "Ross, we made a very good investment when we bought this \u2013 the Cambridge portfolio with Forest City, it\u2019s turned out to be an outstanding asset for us to own. We\u2019ve looked around, we see things in that space, there has been nothing to date that has really captured our attention. We have found that we have better places to invest our capital.", "Ross Nussbaum", "So that makes sense to monetize the seven properties you have in that segment or \u2013?", "Tom DeRosa", "Ross, to my point earlier, we are active portfolio managers and we look at any asset, we are not in love with any asset over the long-term in a way if there is a good opportunity that makes sense to sell an asset. So we will always evaluate it, reevaluate the assets in our portfolio and that\u2019s one of them.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay. If I could sneak in one last one, what do you guys thinking at this point in terms diminishing reimbursement of Medicare front in terms of what CMS is going to come out with this year?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, for the first time in a while, it\u2019s pretty steady. So we are expecting any big news. I guess the biggest question mark would be whether Congress or CMS does anything with the physician reimbursement system. That seems unlikely. They haven\u2019t done anything for 10 years now other than do temporary extension. So I guess our best guess is more of the same. But that would be the only uncertainty on the horizon, but we are expecting flat to slightly positive reimbursement increases for the foreseeable future.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Thank you.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Ross.", "Scott Brinker", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies.", "George Hoglund", "Yeah. Just want to get a little more color behind the thought process of combining the hospital portfolio with the SNF portfolio from a reporting perspective, I mean, given 3Q, there is still \u2013 there was pretty much a significant difference between occupancy levels, EBITDAR coverage levels and then also sort of facility revenue mix?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, there are a couple of factors. I mean the ones I mentioned on the call, I think, are the most relevant. When you look at the actual buildings and the patients that are served, those three product types look a lot of like, skilled nursing, rehab hospitals LTACs. They don\u2019t look like hospitals.", "And in fact that we are now selling out of our remaining inpatient hospitals, we just thought it made more sense to have this post-acute category. Because over time, we really feel like these artificial distinctions will become even less important. So that was really the driver.", "We are thinking about maybe going forward providing specific information on the Genesis portfolio, which is the lion\u2019s share of the skilled nursing business anyway. And then you can have very detailed information on payment coverage and payer mix and occupancy. So hopefully \u2013 I mean, the goal here is to make things more transparent and give you better data. So if that\u2019s not the case, definitely let us know. But I think that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re heading.", "George Hoglund", "Okay, thanks. And all my other questions were answered. Thanks.", "Scott Brinker", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC.", "Michael Carroll", "Hey, can you guys give us some color on the potential coverage improvement at Genesis? Does this improvement mainly stem from the corporate fixed charge coverage ratio? Or do you also expect this facility coverage to improve?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Michael, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. I think most of the improvement will be at the corporate level. The facility level coverage fluctuates in the 1.2 to 1.3 times range, after management fee. And there may be some slight improvement there as they bring on new development with better coverage, the expense initiatives that they are working on. But the real movement is going to be at the corporate level with a better balance sheet, debt refinancing, corporate synergies. So I think that\u2019s where you are going to see the material 10 basis point to 20 basis point type improvement.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. And then Scott, do you also find large portfolio transactions attractive in today\u2019s market, or has pricing gotten a little too ahead of itself?", "Scott Brinker", "Well, we still look at everything. And at least the deals that we\u2019ve been able to execute, there\u2019s still a material spread between our cost of capital and our return on capital. So it still feels like a good time to be in the marketplace. That being said, there are some bigger portfolios that are being shopped and looked at by a lot of people and I think it does become a bit more challenging to grow the company that way. The spreads get tighter. The execution risk increases. So, say we\u2019re more likely to pass on the vast majority of those unless for some reason we find it really strategic.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Michael Mueller", "Yeah. Hi. Just skipping the 2014 disposition volumes and the comments you made about 2015, I mean what should we be expecting if we\u2019re looking out to 2016 and beyond for normalized disposition volumes? Would it be significantly below this $400 million for this year?", "Scott Estes", "Tough to say. I mean, my gut would be, yes, it would be, other than if you see something that would be strategic that would make sense. And it feels like we have great assets. I think the portfolio quality is the best it\u2019s ever been. So if you\u2019re just talking about a general sense for incremental dispositions, it feels good about where we\u2019re at. But like Tom said, we\u2019ll always do something.", "Tom DeRosa", "Right. Because there is something that looks really good today in the portfolio that in three years there may be something that\u2019s happened beyond our control that may make us not like that asset as much. And we will \u2013 I think we\u2019ve demonstrated we will take a very proactive approach towards making sure our portfolio is always in the best quality \u2013 best position that it can be.", "Scott Estes", "And even some of the dynamics around those, we call, strategic. We sold $900-plus-million of assets this year and still had 9% FAD per share growth. So that was an example of being opportunistic and generating some capital that I think is prudent. And that\u2019s the type of thing we\u2019ll do. So I still think we are focused on earnings, earnings, dividend growth, the whole package.", "Tom DeRosa", "Exactly.", "Mike Carroll", "So a base case of 250 to 500 a year may not be unreasonable just to assume, because you will probably have something going on.", "Scott Estes", "That\u2019s as good a guess as ours, Mike.", "Mike Carroll", "Got it, okay. And then going back to life science just for one second. The building that\u2019s vacant that was hitting the same-store NOI comps, can you talk about the leasing prospects for that?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, so it\u2019s been fully released, so occupancy is temporarily down. But we\u2019ll be back at 97% by mid-year, and potentially 100% by the end of the year. But just because of the timing of that releasing report negative NOI growth again in the first quarter, then it will be roughly flat in the second quarter and then a huge increase in the third and fourth quarter.", "Mike Carroll", "Okay. That was it, thank you.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "Scott Estes", "Hi, Dan.", "Tom DeRosa", "Hi, Dan.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Hi, on the SHOP portfolio, I think some of your operators are starting to develop a little bit more. Are they coming to you for financing, or are they going elsewhere? And then also if you could remind us, what right do you have to buy assets that they develop?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. There are 10, maybe as many as 15 operators in our portfolio that hey are active developers and we participate in one form or another in virtually all of their development. And it takes a range of structures. Sometimes we partner with them 100% from day one. So we\u2019re doing that with Sunrise in the UK. We are doing that with Merrill Gardens. Sometimes we do a triple-net lease development. Examples of that would be Brandywine on the East Coast, and then Avery in the UK, or Silverado on the West Coast. And then sometimes we have purchase options when the building stabilizes. So, in all events, the assets end up in the Health Care REIT joint venture, it\u2019s just a matter of timing.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yeah, I mean, Dan, whether it\u2019s contractual or not contractual, I think if you polled the top operators, they\u2019d say they like working with us, and will continue to direct their \u2013 look to us to direct their \u2013 to work with them on their growth programs. So it\u2019s just the way we\u2019ve organized the business. It\u2019s the quality of the relationships. It\u2019s the value-add that we provide keeps them coming back to us.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay, okay. And then in terms of overall development of your portfolio, just given some of the previous comments on the call about maybe your pricing competition getting a little bit tough, do you see yourselves increasing development over the next couple of years, relative to where you are now? Thinking like CIP to book or our overall development to book. Do you see a little bit of a maybe shift at some point into more development versus acquisitions?", "Scott Estes", "As it relates to the on balance sheet development, I think you\u2019ll still see it be a relatively small number. We are bigger company but it\u2019s still a meaningful number and we\u2019re growing across different asset classes; and as Scott said, programs with all of our best operators. So, you can also look at that as just from the \u2013 if I have to think about what percentage of our growth roughly each year could come from development or acquiring assets as they\u2019re stabilized, I think it\u2019s a nice supplement that\u2019s meaningful could be 20%, 30% of the total growth could be brand new assets at attractive yield.", "Daniel Bernstein", "And I might have missed this earlier. You have your generator out; we had a false fire alarm here in Baltimore. Not quite as cold as you guys, though.", "Scott Estes", "No.", "Daniel Bernstein", "But on Genesis, what was the fixed charge coverage for the quarter, if you gave that out? And then also, is that normalized in any way for any \u2013 or has there been any impact from, say, non-normal costs of the integration between Genesis and Skilled in that fixed charge number, so that it \u2013 I think about how it might progress through 2015, those integration costs come out. I\u2019m just trying to understand, what are the drivers that are going to move the fixed charge coverage up?", "Scott Brinker", "Daniel, it will be a little confusing, because Genesis is now publically traded, of course, and result \u2013 reports their results in real-time. And we always report one quarter in arrears so\u2026", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay.", "Scott Brinker", "\u2026so they are never going to perfectly match up. It\u2019s fair to say that Genesis ended the year, at the corporate and facility level in the low to mid 1.2s. And our expectation is that at the corporate level, they\u2019ll be in the high 1.3s by the end of 2015.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay, okay. Was there any \u2013 again, was there any like integration costs, or unusual costs that might be in that? Or is that kind of a normalized number, that 1.2s?", "Scott Brinker", "I wouldn\u2019t call it normalized. They did have a number of expenses in the fourth quarter, that were unusual by their standards.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay.", "Scott Brinker", "And that drives some of the improvement next year is just\u2026", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay.", "Scott Brinker", "\u2026adjusting those expenses that were outsized in the fourth quarter.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay, okay. We\u2019re getting late in the call. I\u2019ll hop off, and take anything else offline. Thanks.", "Scott Brinker", "Thanks, Dan.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And you next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "Hey, guys. The cap rate you acquired, four senior housing operating properties in Q4, was definitely done at a pretty compelling cap rate of 7.9%. What\u2019s represented in those properties? What kind of growth rate is baked into that?", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, Todd, those are all brand-new properties. One is with Silverado that they developed in Texas. And then we had essentially a purchase option on that building, so that drives a very favorable cap rate than what would be paid in, say, an auction. And then we did three acquisitions of essentially brand-new private-pay homes in the UK yet compelling cap rates.", "So all four of those buildings are with existing partners, brand-new buildings, major metros, off-market. It\u2019s all the things that you would want to do to drive a premium yield. It\u2019s not like we bought low-quality government reimbursement homes. These are premier, brand-new assets with our best operators.", "Todd Stender", "And a market cap rate would be closer to 6%. Is that fair? It\u2019s pretty good value creation.", "Scott Brinker", "Yeah, exactly, if not lower. But exactly, I mean that\u2019s how we like to do investments. So they bring us those deals, and we are more than happy to help them grow their business by being their capital partner.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yeah, you don\u2019t get that from a broadly marketed auction, Todd.", "Todd Stender", "And then just kind of sticking I guess in the development theme. Memory care is represented in all of your senior housing triple net development projects, but only a handful have independent living. You really should have exposure to memory care, insulate these projects from any threat of new supply. Is that kind of how you think about kind of weighing the risk and reward about building at this point in the cycle?", "Tom DeRosa", "Memory care is distinct competence of a number of our operators, most notably Silverado. Todd, you know that dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s is going to be an epidemic in this country, and we need to have a greater supply of memory care communities to house, people who cannot live in their traditional homes.", "So we see that as a market that is undersupplied, with a growing demand that is going to be a challenge for our country, and some of the other countries where we operate, and countries where we don\u2019t operate. Managing that growing population is probably the biggest challenge to healthcare delivery. And so we feel very well positioned there, and are focused more in the senior housing with memory care space than we are in independent living.", "Todd Stender", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Tom. And just quickly, last questions for Scott Estes. Thanks for the details on your CapEx budget. As we kind of look out for the next couple of years, what are some good numbers to use for CapEx per unit, for your senior housing operating units, and then when you look at medical office on a price per square foot basis?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, Todd, medical office is in the $1.50 per square foot range, which reflects the young age of our properties. It\u2019s about 12 years average age, same is true in senior housing.", "Scott Brinker", "$1,700-ish [ph] probably.", "Scott Estes", "Yeah. We really look at it, and I think everyone should look at it, more on a percentage of NOI basis, because that\u2019s where you really benefit from having properties in the major metros that have really high NOI per unit. Because it ends up being a very small percentage of your NOI. And that\u2019s ultimately what you care about, is the cash returns.", "So if you got a low-quality independent living building that generates very little NOI, $1,000 per unit of CapEx is a huge [indiscernible]. If you\u2019ve got a Sunrise building in London, that\u2019s charging $10,000 a month. $1,000 per unit of CapEx is nothing. That\u2019s how we look at it as a percentage of NOI. That number tends to be in 6% to 7% range for our operating portfolio.", "Todd Stender", "Very helpful. thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott", "Hey, guys.", "Tom DeRosa", "Mike, good morning.", "Scott Brinker", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael Knott", "A question for you. Given how mega is valued in the public market, have you thought about spinning out your skilled nursing post-acute portfolio?", "Tom DeRosa", "We like our skilled nursing post-acute portfolio, Michael. We see it\u2019s an important part of our business, and we think we\u2019re clearly aligned in the right piece of that sector. And one of the areas that we are seeing is the increasing connectivity between seniors housing, post-acute, and acute care. We as a company are driving that connectivity. So it\u2019s very important for us to be in that space. It\u2019s not important for us to be in low-quality mix skilled nursing homes.", "Scott Estes", "And we have kind of spun that out arguably over the last five years, via selling, I think, a lot of the older skilled nursing assets in our portfolio. I bet if you aggregated that, what would it be, guys? $1 billion plus, at least, $1 billion, $1.5 billion, would be my guess.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. And then from an investment standpoint, I don\u2019t think you guys talked about investments you\u2019ve done so far this year. And there\u2019s been some media reports and such about a large deal you did with Benchmark. Just curious what you guys have done so far this year, and may be what \u2013 any color on that.", "Scott Brinker", "Well we don\u2019t talk about investments until quarter-end. But given that the Benchmark news was public, I\u2019ll go ahead and comment on it. That wasn\u2019t our decision, but we\u2019re more than happy to talk about it because it\u2019s exactly the type of portfolio that we want to own, and that you would want us to own.", "So Benchmark has been a partner of our since 2010, they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. I mean, they have outperformed quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. Based completely in New England, so primarily Massachusetts and Connecticut, which is where this portfolio is, particularly in Boston. And they have managed it for a long time. Their joint venture partner was at the end of its life, and was looking to exit, and we were more than happy to step in.", "So Benchmark will continue to operate. They\u2019ll be our 5% JV partner. The cap rate\u2019s in the high 5s, which for these assets in this market feels like a really good deal, especially given what I\u2019m seeing for much lower quality buildings in rural markets throughout the U.S.", "Michael Knott", "Okay, thanks for that color. And then last one for me, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 maybe any color you guys have on how crowded auction tents are today. I know you said you look at everything, even though you\u2019re not necessarily always winning auctions. But just curious how crowded those might be, and if you are seeing any new types of capital with interest, or even preliminary interest in healthcare real estate.", "Scott Brinker", "It least in the auction intent, it\u2019s dominated by the REIT\u2019s \u2013 the public REIT\u2019s, the non-traded REIT\u2019s. We\u2019re not seeing any new sources of capital, at least in the auction tent but what we are seeing is the major pension funds wanting to partner with us on particular portfolios or asset classes. So, at least in our experience, they are bidding on their own for this stuff, but they see the value of healthcare real estate, and they want to partner with us to enter this space.", "Tom DeRosa", "Michael, it kind of fits with something we\u2019ve talked a bit about on this call today, which is our growing concentration in the key urban markets in the U.S., Canada and the UK. That is where the global pension funds like to invest across real estate classes. If they\u2019re going to make an investment in healthcare, it\u2019s going to be in one of those markets.", "So I will echo something that Scott just said. We know all these players, they want to work with us, because they understand the quality of the real estate that we own. And they have historically not invested in this sector, so they need a partner. And we continue to look at opportunities that may be of interest to that new group of capital providers.", "Michael Knott", "Thanks for that color. And just how recent is that change that you are seeing? Or those expressions of interest?", "Tom DeRosa", "I think this has happened over the last nine months.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Tom DeRosa", "All right, Michael. Take care.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. This does conclude today\u2019s call.

My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Miller", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower\u2019s third quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, the CEO of Welltower. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Jeff and good morning. I am pleased to tell you that our financial results for the third quarter were the strongest we have reported this year, an 8% increase in FFO per share overall Q3 2014. The performance as well as our confidence in future earnings potential allows us to increase our 2015 guidance and announced a 4.2% increase in our dividend for 2016, the largest dividend increase in a number of years. ", "I'm also pleased to be speaking to you for the first time as Welltower, a name that speaks to the promise of the extraordinary business model that we've built over decades, a model that will continue to lead the evolution of healthcare delivery infrastructure. ", "Now I know that you are all trying to understand the impact of new supply on our Q3 same-store results. So let me hit that for you right upfront. ", "First, our Q3 same-store results for our entire portfolio are in line with what we expected and our guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 3% to 3.5%. In the US, we have seen new supply impact some but not all of our markets. Scott Brinker will give you more detail here. ", "We are encouraged by the 60 basis point occupancy improvement in our same-store operating portfolio from Q2 to Q3, and we continue to benefit from pricing power as our best-in-class operators command premium rates over the competition. So going forward we feel that our portfolio is positioned to grow. ", "As in the prior two quarters, our same-store operating growth continued to be negatively impacted by a historic flu season that crushed the occupancy rate of our UK portfolio. As you will see in our supplement, if you exclude the UK from our same-store operating results, the year-over-year Q3 increase would've been 3.4% versus 2.7%. I hope this helps put the growth of supply issue into perspective. If you want to know more about supply in the markets where Welltower operates, see our new disclosure in our supplement. It will give you greater insight into our major and sub markets. Hopefully you'll see why we are bullish about the performance of our senior housing portfolio going forward. ", "Scott Estes will provide you more information on our financial performance. Our great operating results were generated from our best-in-class real estate portfolio enhanced by over $20 billion of accretive investments and approximately $4 billion in dispositions made in the last five years. Our operating results also greatly benefit from our strong balance sheet which gives us great financial flexibility as we prepare for a potential increase in interest rates. ", "Remember we\u2019ve raised $4 billion in equity in the last 18 months and our leverage has been reduced by over 5%, no easy feat for a $35 billion plus enterprise. Frankly given the schizophrenic rhetoric coming from Janet Yellen and company, I'm very glad delevering is behind us. As Scott Estes will tell you, now it\u2019s our time to drive earnings growth. ", "Let me say that transparency has always been a hallmark of Welltower and our financials should provide a good clear roadmap to understanding our third-quarter performance and where we are headed. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer. ", "Scott Brinker", "Thank you, Tom and good morning to everyone. I want to start with the themes that drive our investment strategy. They provide a framework to think about how our portfolio has performed to date and how it should perform going forward. One, align with best-in-class operators and buildings, because our building, our business is driven by real estate and operations. Two, concentrate in large metro markets that have superior demographics and higher entry barriers. Three, diversify by geography, operator and lease maturity and fourth, actively manage the portfolio. ", "The payoff is visible in our results. The long-duration triple net portfolio contributes half of our earnings and is a steady strong performer. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.3% while post-acute increased 3.4%. That's awfully attractive with inflation at or below 2%. Payment coverages were flat and remained at secure levels. ", "The median duration outpatient medical portfolio is 15% of our earnings. We hit all time highs in occupancy and tenant retention. This led to a solid quarter with 2.5% same-store growth which is right in the range we expected. ", "The final segment is a short duration operating portfolio. Same-store NOI grew 2.7% last quarter. That number requires some color and context. One, we own a modern portfolio that allows us to drive NOI growth with very modest capital expenditures. This is a really important point when comparing same-store results across companies. Less CapEx means more free cash flow to grow the dividend and acquire new properties. ", "Two, and as expected, the UK dragged down results for the entire operating portfolio. This is a finite-12 month issue and we are now three quarters of the way through it. A record flu season wiped out more than 300 basis points of occupancy in the UK earlier this year. ", "But we are turning things around. Occupancy is up 110 basis points sequentially and the momentum has continued in October. The UK was a same-store growth engine for us in 2013 and \u201814 and we think it will be again in 2016. ", "Three, the US is strong. That represents 70% of the operating portfolio. Our core markets like Southern California, New York and Washington DC are thriving. The US portfolio is on target year-to-date with 4.7% same-store growth and a positive outlook in 4Q. ", "Four, we were up against the tough comp. And finally new supply. This is the time to use a sharp pencil not a broad brush. We\u2019ve added a huge amount of information in the reporting package. We included color commentary to give you context to all the numbers. The color is important because not all new supply is equally competitive due to services offered and price point. ", "As you do a deep dive, the data will confirm that on a relative basis our markets have less new supply, better job growth and superior demographics. That doesn't mean we\u2019re immune from new supply but we\u2019re entering a period in which dispersion is going to widen. This is the time to align with the best real estate and operations and that\u2019s exactly what we are. ", "That takes me to our outlook for the overall operating portfolio. And as a reminder, we don\u2019t update NOI guidance throughout the year for each segment only for the aggregate portfolio. But the question has come up quite a bit and we want to be responsive. ", "So looking forward. Occupancy was up 60 basis points sequentially with solid growth in all three countries. Occupancy has continued to move higher in October. We have pricing power in the vast majority of our markets. So from where we sit today, despite one more week quarter coming from the UK, we\u2019re optimistic that NOI growth for the overall operating portfolio will move higher sequentially in 4Q. We\u2019re in the middle of the budgeting process with our partners and we\u2019ll provide 2016 outlook in February. ", "Turning to investments. Our model is privately negotiated high quality real estate with existing partners. It\u2019s simple and perhaps a bit boring but it works. The initial cash yield on our third-quarter investments was a very strong 7.2% and we expanded our relationships with both Sunrise and Genesis, two industry leaders. ", "That brings me to a critical point of differentiation: our deep relationships with best-in-class operators. We\u2019re extending that advantage in a highly targeted way. So far this year we\u2019ve formed new relationships with Aspen, Oakmont, EPIC and most recently Leisure Care, one of the 20 largest operators in the US. These relationships extend our leading market share in London, California and New England. And all four partners will be a source of future growth. ", "We\u2019re off to a strong start in 4Q. Alongside our partner Revera, we just completed the acquisition of Regal Communities. The assets are concentrated in our core Canadian markets, including Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver. We will receive a 6.1% preferred return that escalates over time, which is highly attractive in comparison to recent public auction M&A in Canada. The opportunity set is never a problem. We have active dialogue with 30 plus existing partners and a long list of operators who want to be part of the Welltower family. We expect this will remain a unique way to create incremental shareholder value. ", "In summary, we\u2019re looking to end the year with momentum heading into 2016. And Scott Estes will now discuss our financial results. ", "Scott Estes ", "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. From a financial perspective, our message over the last several quarters had focused on strengthening the balance sheet. Importantly, as Tom discussed, we took the opportunity to consistently raise equity over the past 18 months that we are currently in a position of strength and flexibility. ", "More specifically, our leverage and balance sheet metrics have continued to improve, give excellent liquidity with our entire line of credit available and approximately $100 million in cash, we are not reliant upon the equity markets over the near term and our multiple pension fund partners provide flexibility in financing new investments. ", "So as a result, the key financial message today is that we've shifted our focus from improving our balance sheet and credit metrics to one where we are driving more meaningful earnings growth for the remainder of 2015 and 2016. ", "I will begin my more detailed remarks with some perspective on our third-quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure. ", "Normalized FFO came in at a record $1.12 per share and normalized FAD was $0.99 for the third quarter, representing strong 8% and 9% increases year-over-year respectively. Our results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase and the $3.6 billion of net investment completed over the past 12 months. ", "There was one notable expense item in our numbers this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to clarify. You'll note on our income statement that we recognized a tax benefit of about $3.3 million. You would typically see an expense on this line but we recognized approximately $5.4 million of tax repayments this quarter for amounts overpaid in previous periods.", "Importantly, we did not take this benefit to normalize earnings this quarter. I think this is another good example of the financial transparency Tom mentioned in his opening remarks. We arguably could have taken these repayments to normalize earnings this quarter since we did include the overpayments in previous periods but we are excluding them in an effort to show a more true operating result. And you can see where we exclude these repayments in our normalizing items on page 8 of our earnings release. ", "In terms of dividends, we will pay our 178th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 20 of $0.825 per share representing an annual rate of $3.30 and a current dividend yield of 5%. I'd note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the third quarter declined to 74% and 83% respectively. And as we move into 2016 our confidence in our internal and external growth has allowed us to announce a 4.2% increase in our 2016 dividend payment rate today, representing our highest dividend growth rate in four years. ", "In terms of our supplemental package, we continue to enhance our disclosure in response to investor and analyst feedback. A few items of note \u2013 first on Page 1, we added a footnote regarding our hospital portfolio. This is notable because you'll see that our London hospital portfolio derived 80% of its revenue from outpatient services and 93% of revenue from private pay sources. ", "Next on Page 9, we added new disclosure comparing our Canadian seniors housing operating portfolio to benchmarks in the country. And on Pages 10 through 14 as Scott Brinker discussed, we've added significant new disclosure detailing new supply related to our seniors housing operating portfolio on a 3 and 5 mile radius, including detailed descriptions of the local market dynamics for a significant number of properties. ", "Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. As the third quarter was relatively quiet from a capital raising perspective, we did issue 1.2 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $78 million in proceeds which was the most we've ever raised in a quarter through the program. ", "We also generated $171 million of proceeds through the sale of non-strategic assets and loan payoffs which included about $2 million of gains and represented a blended yield on total proceeds of 5.7%. The remaining $57 million of our 2029 convertible debt either converted or was redeemed during the quarter, which eliminated the final convertible debt instrument on our balance sheet. And finally we\u2019ve repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.4% and assumed to refinance $108 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. ", "Subsequent to quarter end, we did complete several additional capital transactions. In early October, we completed our first significant capital raise under the Welltower flag when we reopened our 4% senior unsecured debt through June 2025 through the sale of 500 million of notes priced to yield just under 4.3%. And also in early October, we utilize our ATM program for the first time since 2011 by issuing 696,000 shares at a gross price of $69.23 which generated $47 million in proceeds. ", "So as a result, pro forma for both our October capital raising activities and financing the Regal transaction earlier this week, we are in an excellent liquidity position today with our entire $2.5 billion line of credit available and approximately $100 million in cash. ", "Our balance sheet and financial metrics at quarter end continued to strengthen. As of September 30, net debt to un-depreciated book capitalization was 37% and net debt to enterprise value was 30%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 5.2 times while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter improved nicely to 4.5 times and 3.5 times respectively. Our secured debt level also declined by 40 basis points to only 10.8% of total assets at quarter end. ", "I will conclude my comments today with an update on guidance and our key assumptions. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth, as Tom and Scott discussed, we continue to forecast blended same-store growth of 3% to 3.5% for the total portfolio in 2015. We can't stress enough the consistency and lack of volatility in our same store NOI results over the longer term. Specifically if you look over the last 16 quarters, our total portfolio same store NOI growth has only varied between 3.0% and 4.4%, and I think this number becomes more impressive considering the low-inflation environment we've seen over the same period. ", "In terms of our 2015 investment expectations, in addition to investments completed through the third quarter, our $4.1 billion guidance does include the Regal Lifestyle communities transaction that closed earlier this week, the Genesis acquisition and loan expected to close late in the year, approximately $50 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership and $73 million of development funding. I would also note that we increased our disposition proceeds expectation for the full year to a total of $1.1 billion and an expected average yield on total proceeds of approximately 6%. ", "Our CapEx forecast is now approximately $60 million for 2015 which is comprised of $40 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $20 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. These amounts continue to represent approximately 6% to 7% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories. ", "Our G&A forecast is now approximately $145 million for 2015 which is about $2 million below our previous estimate. And finally in terms of earnings guidance, we\u2019re in position to increase our normalized FFO forecast to a range of $4.32 to $4.37 per diluted share and tightening our FAD estimate to a range of $3.84 to $3.89 per diluted share which both represent a solid increase of 5% to 6%. ", "In conclusion, we feel very positive about our overall results today. We are on pace on complete over $4 billion in investments this year. We've enhanced our leverage and credit metrics. Our total same-store NOI growth forecast is unchanged at 3% to 3.5%. We delivered quarterly FFO and FAD growth of 8% to 9%. We raised our FFO guidance for the year and our confidence in our future earnings growth potential allowed us to increase our dividend at the highest rate in four years. ", "So with that, that concludes my comments. I will turn it back to you, Tom, for some closing remarks. ", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. Before we open the line for questions, I just want to speak for a moment about the compelling long-term investment and growth opportunity we see before us. ", "This past Tuesday, the front page of the New York Times reported on a study that concluded that the money to treat a person suffering from dementia in their final five years of life is 80% greater than the cost of treating someone with heart disease or cancer. Dementia is a disease where there is no cure. Dementia patients need constant care for years but these costs are not covered by insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. This is a crisis for families impacted by this disease today and will become an enormous crisis for society at large in the future. ", "Welltower offers a solution. We are focused on providing the capital necessary for our operating partners to build the infrastructure needed to deliver wellness and a healthy and safe quality of life to our cognitively impaired seniors. And we are focused on providing capital to the most prominent health systems as they exit their old outmoded acute-care hospital buildings in favor of more modern efficient outpatient focused settings that can work effectively with post-acute and senior housing to manage the challenges of healthcare delivery in the future. We, with our shareholders, are the catalysts of capital to make this all happen. ", "Now Holly, please open the line for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Juan Sanabria ", "My first question is for Scott Estes. I think you mentioned shifting of the balance sheet to more meaningfully driving growth as we look towards \u201916. Does that mean any change in how you're looking to financings going forward, is the plan to lever up or to maintain sort of a leveraged mutual approach?", "Scott Estes", "Hey Juan, the short answer is leverage neutral approach. We don't intend to increase leverage. I think it's more of a comment that we\u2019re happy with the general levels we are in now, so you\u2019d expect us to maintain our typical 50%-ish equity, 40% debt capital raising ratio from these levels but we don't intend to increase leverage. ", "Juan Sanabria ", "And then just on RIDEA, I appreciate the comments to the new disclosure around supply but for the US specifically what\u2019s the view on kinds of levers with occupancy, kind of rate and expenses as you look forward and how should we be thinking about sort of a steady-state growth from here for the US?", "Scott Brinker", "Juan, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. The major drivers of NOI growth for the business are occupancy rate and staffing. So if you understand those three components you\u2019d I think underwritten 90 plus percent of NOI growth and we can't see too far into the future but from what we do see the trend is very positive. So occupancy across our portfolio is moving higher since June and that\u2019s continued into the fourth quarter. Rate growth continues to be 3 plus percent in most of our markets and that's generally in line with compensation. So things bounce around a bit from quarter to quarter, 90 days is just a very small amount of time and unusual items can have a big impact. So don't read too much in any particular quarter but over time we see rate growth generally in line with wages. ", "Juan Sanabria ", "And then just one last quick one from me on the RIDEA business, can you give us any sense of what the typical turnover at the senior management level, executive director et cetera is and if that's changed at all with new supply?", "Scott Brinker", "We haven't seen a major change, Juan but you raised an interesting question because that position drives performance at these properties. And one of the things we've done with our executive forum is really dig into employee turnover at all levels, including the executive director, so that for the first time all of our operating partners can compare how they perform against their peers. And we talked about that report at our last meeting about a month ago and that was a real eye-opener for 12 of the leading operating companies in the country, because they had not seen to date how they compared on that very important metric. And that's the type of thing that we\u2019re doing in our portfolio that's totally different than the typical capital partner and helps explain why we have such close relationships with the best operators in the country. ", "Tom DeRosa", "Juan, I will just add to that, at the NIC conference where we brought together a number of the operators in our forum that Scott was referring to. We brought in a senior executive from the Ritz Carlton Company to meet with these executives and talk to them about building a positive culture in an organization. So these types of efforts -- which these individual operators couldn\u2019t do on their own, because of the scale we offer we can bring in someone like this executive from Ritz Carlton and expose them to best practices which they might not otherwise be able to take advantage of. ", "Juan Sanabria ", "And just what is the actual average turnover you guys are seeing at the level?", "Scott Brinker", "Juan, it varies because buildings are at different ages. But if you were to take just a pool of typical buildings that have been opened for 10 to 20 years in our portfolio, it tends to be in the five-year range. So there is turnover at that position but the higher turnover is really at the line staff level, like the direct care giver level, that tends to be more in the 30% to 40% range, so a bit higher for the lower wage employees. ", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays Capital.", "Nihal Shah ", "This is actually Nihal Shah filling in for Josh Raskin. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to kind of go into the 2.7 growth that you guys had. I appreciate the comments on the UK portfolio. But I was wondering if there was any particular operators that might be driving this, to the positive or the negative?", "Scott Brinker", "The only operator that I would think about in the U.S. and it's not by name, but just by region is New England because like the UK they had a devastating flu season in the first quarter. So occupancy is quite depressed and as I mentioned in the UK comments, it takes a full year to get out of that, because it's in the current year's numbers for 12 entire months and until you do a lap a year later it's a drag. So even though our New England portfolio is building back occupancy, it's starting \u2013 or you\u2019re comparing against a big hole and that is an issue. And the other one is just a couple of outliers drive huge variance. So in the US we had five properties that if you were to take them out of the pool, the same-store growth rate would've been more than 100 basis points higher than we reported. So remember, we have 250 plus properties in the US. So a very small number of properties can drive a huge variance from any one quarter and that's why it\u2019s just tough to look at only 90 days. Focus on a longer period of time. ", "Scott Estes", "Yes, I think that\u2019s important that we don\u2019t take facilities in and out of the portfolio. We will give you that -- that information we can and a lot of times it does get to you. ", "Tom DeRosa", "So please we ask you to look at the consistency of what's in our same-store portfolio because it would be very easy to manipulate the number by -- when you see a problem taking it out of the portfolio but we don't do that. We maintain a very transparent approach to this calculation. ", "Nihal Shah ", "And one more question if I may. We\u2019ve been seeing a lot of activity in the hospital space both on the REIT side as well as the operating side. Are you seeing any increased opportunities in that space given all the action?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well the opportunities we\u2019re seeing are to help the major systems build out much-needed modern outpatient infrastructures. You\u2019ve heard me say many times we stop at the front door of the hospital. In fact, I think we\u2019re about to see the last of our US hospitals out of our portfolio this year. So we do not believe that investing in acute care in the US makes sense for our shareholders. Now we do like the private hospital market in the UK. You saw us make a significant investment there that continues \u2013 we\u2019re very bullish on that business. But we don't care for the reimbursement paradigm of acute care in the United States and we\u2019ve been watching the results of the public hospital companies recently and I think our thesis is being supported by some of the results that were reported this past quarter. ", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel. ", "Daniel Bernstein ", "I just also want to go back into the same-store seniors housing NOI growth. Is that on a constant currency and how did the currency impact that number? Just trying to think about how it compared to peers?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, it\u2019s on a constant currency basis, Dan.", "Daniel Bernstein ", "Did currency impact that number at all or \u2013", "Scott Estes", "No.", "Daniel Bernstein ", "And then also I was just thinking about the development opportunities that are out there, are you getting any opportunities to do something more of like what you\u2019ve done at 4Qs where you had the Surgery Center, MOB and hospital coordinate with the skilled nursing, coordinate with the assisted-living, are you getting any kind of more opportunities where you\u2019re able to do that thinking about where the future of healthcare is going. It seems like that you might have that opportunity. I just want to think about \u2013 a little bit more in depth about what kind of construction development you are doing out there?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, Dan, we are very focused on that. And I will tell you that the dialogues with health systems about the very subject you bring up have increased dramatically. So we are very focused on creating connectivity between acute-care, postacute and seniors housing and I would -- and we are -- as we think about the future we\u2019re thinking that's an area that we will commit scale capital to. It\u2019s early days, I am not saying that -- and again these are development opportunities, these are not acquisition opportunities. This is where we will be doing new development. But we are very excited about that. We think that\u2019s the future of an important part of the growth profile of Welltower in the future. ", "Daniel Bernstein ", "If you look back at the last couple of weeks, maybe more than couple of weeks ago, you had an expansion of the bundled payment into 75 MSAs. Are you getting any \u2013 do you have any thoughts on whether and how the construction might head in the postacute sector, are we going to see more \u2013 the silos are going to go away \u2013 are we going to see more construction that\u2019s simply rehab and have you had any inquiries or thoughts about what kind of construction or development properties you need to invest in going forward in the post acute space?", "Scott Brinker", "Dan, it's early days in that but our view is that it supports our thesis which is to back to support the best in class scale operators like Genesis. We think that they are best positioned to live in that kind of a world where they're negotiating with huge health systems, huge managed-care payers. There is massive infrastructure needed to do that effectively, technology and these small companies in our view cannot live in that world effectively. So our view is that in the skilled nursing business people are very focused on reimbursement rates and whether that means that the outlook is good, bad or benign and we think that is a small piece of the story, because underneath all of that is a massive change to how that business is going to work going forward. And I don't think people fully understand that. So we\u2019re not focused on next quarter or two quarters from now. It\u2019s what is that business going to look like in five years and in 10 years and it's a lot different than what it looks like today. ", "Tom DeRosa", "And the other piece of this, Dan, is the aging of the population which has really got to drive a profound change in healthcare delivery. I was struck this morning watching Squawk Box where you had the CEOs of the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and NYU Langone and they really didn't touch on that. And I sat there in amazement because that is one of the biggest looming problems for the healthcare delivery sector is how you\u2019re going to manage this aging population and it has to be reinvented and it's not going to happen in the traditional brick-and-mortar that exists today. You will get a lot of hospitals in America, they were built in the 1930s and those are hospitals of many brand-name -- that are belonged to many brand-name health systems. That\u2019s going to be a challenge in the future and that's one of the reasons why we get up every morning here and work so hard to tell our story and attract new sources of capital to invest in making it all happen. ", "Daniel Bernstein ", "We want to take that conversation offline because it sounds like it could be a very long conversation but we tend to agree that there's going to be a pretty big upheaval. I want to understand more how the operators are trying to deal with it. The last question I have is going back to the wage pressures, it sounds like you think your wages are about in line with revenues. But when we think about -- what we hear on the wage pressures are some minimum-wage, there\u2019s poaching of executive directors maybe in seniors housing and then maybe on the operator side, it seems like there's -- if you listen to most of the post-acute and hospital calls, there\u2019s some increased contract labor maybe in therapy and skilled nursing. So if you could talk a little bit about more in detail about where you are seeing wage pressure and how concerned you are about that, even if your rates are keeping up with that, how concerned are you about wage pressure going forward here?", "Scott Brinker", "Dan, it\u2019s Scott. I will take that. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on. As I mentioned it's one of the three primary drivers of performance but my comments reflect our view that rate growth is generally in line with compensation. So there are some markets where there's a shortage and that may drive labor costs higher, it may require a bit more contract labor which is more expensive. But there are an equal number of markets offsetting that so that the average is in the 3% range. And we haven't seen any material change in turnover in any of the positions. But this report or study that we have underway I think will start to chip away that. So we\u2019re optimistic that turnover can actually go down rather than go up. ", "Tom DeRosa", "And we just need to attract more people to this industry, to work in this industry. I think that's an issue. We are not at the top of everyone's list as the most glamorous businesses to build a career in. But that has to change because there's huge opportunities for people to come into this either the seniors housing or the post-acute sectors, and that's something we work very closely with our operators on as how they can work towards in recruiting and attracting people who are looking to change careers or people that are looking for encore careers. We\u2019re going to live a lot longer, so the idea that you\u2019re going to retire at 60 and then start collecting government benefits and live a happy life is probably a bit a thing of the past. I think there are lot of 55 to 60-year-olds that are going to need jobs because they are living to a 100 and you know what I hope they come calling us and work in the senior housing industry.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi Research. ", "Smedes Rose ", "Hi thanks. I wanted to ask you just as you look at the acquisition opportunities going forward, would you expect to sort of go with maybe more joint ventures and bringing in pension funds or other institutional investors? I think you said in the past they were looking more seriously at this asset class and I'm just thinking that in the context of you\u2019ve said you want to remain leverage neutral and just kind of presumably a higher cost of equity here. Is that \u2013 would that be a way to continue the pace of acquisition activity in line with what you would like to be?", "Tom DeRosa", "Definitely Smedes. Scott and I will both comment on that but that's not an area that we\u2019re spending a lot of time in and CCP becoming one of our joint venture partners was very noticed by the large sovereign funds around the world and we\u2019ve been in significant discussions with many of them as they try and understand an investment class that they've had no exposure to in the past. And as we told people and I think they recognized the Canadian pension plan spent more time underwriting Welltower than they spent underwriting the investment in the Beverly Hills portfolio. And I think that has not gone unnoticed. Scott?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, I would add that we were ahead of the game on this. So we established a partnership with PSP almost 3 years ago and have significantly grown that partnership in the interim. And if you look at the recent track record of investments, including the big one we closed this week in Canada where Revera is a 25% owner, remember Revera is owned by PSP, and think about the Beverly Hills portfolio and stay tuned for other things that we\u2019re working on. A large percentage of them have a joint venture partner and we think that's really important because as a public company our stock price is a little bit volatile and yet we see fantastic opportunities that strategically will be really important for us to own, whether their assets or operators as we look into the future and to be able to tie up those opportunities without spending 100% of the capital, sometimes can be really helpful. And it's nice to have friends to call on when you're in one of those periods of time. ", "Smedes Rose ", "I just wanted to ask you too, in the UK, I mean adjusting for the flu issue that you\u2019ve talked about, it seems like it\u2019s obviously a market with compelling demographics, are you seeing a lot of or more elevated supply coming into that market or if not, what kind of the governor that\u2019s stopping new capital coming in to build more senior housing?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, the UK is a fascinating market. I wish we could spend the whole day on it because it's so intriguing to us. But the bed supply in the UK for the most part is declining and if you do site visits in two or 95% of the homes there you would not want to stay there. They are obsolete and they need to be replaced. And what we own in the UK is literally the top 1% of the estate. So these are modern properties, private pay not government pay and there is virtually no new supply other than what we\u2019re building with our partners. So we picked Sunrise, Signature and Avery, the three leading private pay operators in that entire country and we\u2019re building out there development pipeline. And with a concentration in London which is the hardest market we have exposure to, to build in. It\u2019s remarkably difficult. ", "Tom DeRosa", "So London, it's so important to know that our UK business is concentrated in London and it would be -- as Scott said we are bringing the new supply to the market, it will be very difficult for anyone else to come into that market and bring new supply in any scale. And I think London serves as a good example of the type of market that we want to be in over the long term. And again it\u2019s like any sector of real estate, if you're in places where it\u2019s easy to bring new supply and financing is available, new supply will come. But when you're in the very densely populated centers of urban markets where there is job growth, there is population growth, it's very difficult to bring supply into those markets. So that's why the bump that you see in our same-store results in this quarter is really not an indicator of the future performance. I think you have to go look more deeply at our portfolio and see that London is not an outlier, that London is basically characteristic of where we have placed our shareholders\u2019 capital. And because we\u2019ve sold so much over the years, we've been able to redeploy that capital in those -- in the most attractive markets in the US, Canada and the UK. ", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler ", "I guess my first question is a little bit of a follow-up in terms of new supply in sort of protected markets vis-\u00e0-vis your commentary with London, Tom. I really appreciate the new disclosure. Can you guys maybe give us a sense as to why the 3 mile or five-mile rings are appropriate and versus maybe a seven or 10 mile ring around some of these properties, in these MSAs? And then separately I know on the five-mile ring at least you\u2019ve identified this 4% of NOI, of your potential NOI being impacted. I'm just -- maybe you could hone in on that and maybe we could expand on that as it relates to sort of widening the ring a little bit.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. I will take that. And we chose 3 miles because we've done a lot of work about historical referral patterns in drawing networks for our portfolio in terms of where did the residents actually come from. And we characterize the entire portfolio into really three categories: urban, suburban and rural. The vast majority of what we own fell into the urban category. We had virtually nothing in the rural category and in general the median drawing area for these urban markets is about three miles and for suburban assets it's more like five. So for our portfolio 3 miles make sense. When I think about a 7 mile radius that's 150 square miles in London or Boston or Los Angeles. And frankly as developers are using the 7 mile radius there's going to be a lot more new development but that is not an appropriate drawing radius. When you get some people from 7 miles, sure but the vast majority in these densely populated markets are coming from a much smaller radius. ", "Jordan Sadler ", "And then as sort of a follow-up on capital allocation, I noticed the dividend increase, larger dividend increase this coming \u201816 and I guess when I look at \u201915 versus \u201814 it's going to be more than an 8% increase. But at the same time I see that you guys were issuing on the ATM post quarter end and using the DRIP during the quarter. Can you guys talk a little bit about dividend policy and sort of capital allocation vis-\u00e0-vis sort of equity versus the dividend?", "Scott Estes", "Scott Estes, how are you doing, Jordan? We review the policy once a year. Over the last three or four years we\u2019d increased the dividend at a rate of about 3.5% and we agree in what we actually do, we wanted to both acknowledge our confidence in our growth potential looking to next year but also acknowledging retained earnings as one of the best sources of capital. So we didn\u2019t go with a more significant pace of increase. So we\u2019re trying to balance the two, I think and thinking about what our shareholders would want, whether they be income oriented funds or more focused on the earnings growth. ", "Jordan Sadler ", "So it would be something less than your AFFO growth, some portion of that, is that sort of how you are thinking about it?", "Scott Estes", "You can\u2019t hold me to any numbers, we don\u2019t have guidance out there but we've been driving down our payout ratios pretty consistently and I still think there's an opportunity to do that from current levels. ", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord. ", "Paul Morgan ", "Just to get back to the -- you cited that there were just five properties that if you excluded them from the same store pool, it would have been 100 basis points higher. That's a pretty big \u2013 that\u2019s just a pretty big double-digit decline in those. Do you have any more color about those \u2013 those five specifics and I mean is that kind of typical that you\u2019d have that or when you talk about maybe seeing higher same-store numbers in the fourth quarter, could that be one of the drivers?", "Scott Brinker", "We think so, because there are specific issues at each of those five buildings that can be fixed. And the exact number was 130 basis points. So that takes our growth rate all the way down to 3.6, would have been 4.9 if you take out those just five properties, and it's a combination of flu, it\u2019s a combination of new supply in certain markets and there was some turnover at the ED level at one. So it's a mix of things but in each case I think an identifiable issue that can be fixed. The one subject to new supply maybe it takes a bit more time for those but it shows you that with a portfolio of 250 plus properties in the US, 245 plus did very well growing right at the 5% mark and we had five that we needed to fix. ", "Scott Estes", "And if I could add to, I think it's important because everyone is so focused on the rate of growth and the actual percentage change and to me from a financial perspective to put the supply issue in some context, a 1% variance in our overall same store operating portfolio NOI in a quarter is actually less than $2 million or half a penny per share, it\u2019s less than half a percent really to our total earnings. So we obviously acknowledge we\u2019re all focused on it but financially I still think it\u2019s important for everyone to remember it\u2019s not a big impact.", "Paul Morgan ", "I mean I think I heard you right where you said that it looked like the same-store could move higher in the fourth quarter. I mean is some of that also just the comps getting marginally easier in some of the subsectors or some of these specific issues, could you just give me color sort of kind of what would be the driver of moving higher?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, the comps really get easier next year, 4Q is still a pretty difficult comp for us. So we\u2019re not giving specific guidance for 4Q but from what we see today we feel like the US in particular will continue to be strong. It\u2019s grown in the high 4% range year-to-date and it looks like it could be in that range in 4Q as well.", "Paul Morgan ", "And then I mean you commented on your focus on kind of the structural changes in the post-acute reimbursement setting and there has been kind of a lot of angst in the industry I guess over the past few months about the Medicare\u2019s joint replacement program and the implementation next year and the potential profitability for SNFs in the postacute space. How do you think of that as a risk factor sort of in the near-term and everything you do about in terms of your appetite for development or investment in that segment?", "Scott Brinker", "It\u2019s just a reason to be even more discipline about which properties we acquire or develop, which markets, which operator. It's definitely a business that\u2019s going to have some challenges. I think there are a lot of obsolete buildings that will be taken out of service. ", "Tom DeRosa", "And it\u2019s why we don't own a lot of SNFs. Our capital is being invested in state-of-the-art postacute, we\u2019re not going after portfolios of SNFs. We've been selling portfolios of SNFs. So we do think that's an area \u2013 that while cap rates might look attractive for acquisitions, it\u2019s not an asset class that we would feel comfortable owning long term. ", "Scott Brinker", "And also underwriting really high payment coverages, so the development that we\u2019re doing generally can be comfortably underwritten to a 2 plus times payment coverage before a management fee. And leaves a lot of cushion for any deterioration in margin and that makes us a lot more comfortable to invest into that sector. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra ", "Just on the UK, there is -- at least in the budget, there's a plan to increase minimum wages by 10% next year. Just wondering how much of an issue or specific issue is that for the staff [ph] portfolio there, and if it is, kind of what percent of the employee base do you think could get impacted? ", "Scott Brinker", "I will take that, Vik. It\u2019s one of many reasons that we chose to focus on the private pay side of the business in the UK because if you are in the government reimbursement business the rates there are increasing at 1% to 2% at best and if your wages are going up 5%, 10% that's a really challenging situation. And in the private pay business we have a much better shot of increasing rates and pointing to the minimum wage is a reason why. And that is definitely part of the plan and a lot of businesses are proactively raising their wages and increasing their prices because of it. So that\u2019s happening in the UK and again ahead of time, so we\u2019re already seeing some of that because Sunrise and others have been proactive about what they need to do to continue to attract staff but also continue to drive profitability. ", "Tom DeRosa", "And remember there's still very limited supply of high-end private senior housing in and around London, which is again where we are focused. So as Scott said, obviously it's always a concern when you\u2019re seeing the government edict for wage increases but I think our operators are very on top of it and prepared. ", "Vikram Malhotra ", "And so if they do go up say 10% and I'm assuming wage or staffing costs are what 40%, 50% of the operating expenses, then if you have sort of 4%, 5% increase, I am assuming that, that minimum wage doesn\u2019t impact all the staff you have, is there like a proportion that's more and probably they are more kind of not at the ED level but just like what proportion of the staff could get impacted or where we could see price increases?", "Tom DeRosa", "One of the things \u2013 Vik, in the UK what\u2019s different about the model there is that they don't have -- for instance much of the staff are what we would call registered nurse, so they don't have for instance the LPN category which is what you largely would find in the US. So the staffing model is a bit different in the UK. ", "Vikram Malhotra ", "So it would be a broad-based increases is what you are saying?", "Scott Brinker", "Not necessarily, Vik. I mean very few of the actual employees are being paid at the minimum wage but you do have people like housekeepers, dietary, some of the direct caregivers, maybe they are not at a huge premium to the minimum wage. So if you increase the minimum wage they probably will have some pressure on those positions, just to maintain that parity. But it's not all of the staff. ", "Tom DeRosa", "It\u2019s a small percentage actually. We are thinking it somewhere around 10%. ", "Vikram Malhotra ", "And then just on the pricing model in the UK, there is a sort of a tiered pricing. At least when I was visiting some of your assets, it seemed like there was this tiered pricing where some of the additional services are rolled into one price, and it's maybe four or five tiers. Do you think there's some -- in the US there could be some changes to the pricing model that may impact when we look at the average RevPAR, that may impact that number going forward? ", "Scott Brinker", "No, Vik, I wouldn\u2019t say that, each operator does its pricing a little bit differently, whether it's tiers, some closer to an all in rate, and some are very specific about amount of care use to drive their pricing. But each operator has their preference and seems to work for them in their local market. I don't see that changing or driving RevPAR in any material way.", "Vikram Malhotra ", "And then just last one, you talked about the potential pricing power, given the markets and the quality of assets that you guys have. But given sort of the broader -- just the challenges we've seen more widespread, have you seen any peers or competitors cutting prices to get occupancy up? ", "Scott Brinker", "Not any meaningful trend or change, Vik. There are specific markets that are bit more challenged but where we\u2019ve seen the price discounting tends to be more at the unit level, so particular rooms in a particular building that have been more challenging to lease and people being I think a lot more intelligent and specific about, hey, this is a difficult unit to lease for whatever reason and maybe we do need to make a price adjustment. That\u2019s I\u2019d say more of what we've seen rather than across the board rental concessions. The occupancy drop that we saw was really impacted by the weather not so much supply and demand. So there was really no reason to cut rate to drive back the occupancy. ", "Vikram Malhotra ", "And just one last quick clarification: The Chartwell options to buy some of the assets, when does that expire? ", "Scott Brinker", "It lasts through the life of the joint venture, Vik, where we have certain non-compete rings that you draw around each of our 40 or so joint venture properties and if there's an opportunity inside any of those rings, we work together on it, or at least have the option to work together on it. ", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Mike Mueller ", "I guess in terms of postacute, I mean this wasn't a big deal, but it looks like during the quarter, you bought something, Genesis, at a 9 cap. You also put some capital to work with the Mainstreet properties at about 7.5 yields going in. Can you talk a little bit about the differences, why one was 7 -- 7.5 like held for 7.5, why it was held at Genesis printed 9, and then just a little bit bigger picture about where you see skilled nursing cap rates? ", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Scott. A lot of that differential is because when we negotiated the 2011 sale-leaseback with Genesis we secured future rights to do all their new acquisitions and developments in it, included a pricing grid for acquisitions at specific rates of return and increases that are driving I think the higher yield on that acquisition, whereas our arrangement with Mainstreet is again contractual but it\u2019s at a lower cap. So it\u2019s 7.5 for some of them, 7.7% for others and there is a difference in the building itself as well. The Genesis assets are in core markets in New Jersey that we like but they are not brand-new whereas the Mainstreet property I think you\u2019ve seen them a brand-new, 30% of the building is private pay senior housing. And so that drives some of the difference too. ", "Mike Mueller ", "And then if you're just thinking about, generically, postacute cap rates, I mean where do you put the band today for the different parts of it? ", "Scott Brinker", "Postacute is still in the 7.5 range plus or minus and skilled nursing seems to be in the 8.5 plus range. We\u2019re not very active in the second category though. So and probably not the best source of information on that business but that's \u2013 I read the same press release as you do and that seems to be the general market. ", "Mike Mueller ", "And then going back to Page 10 in the sup, looking at the three-mile ring that you talked about, looks like about 10% of the portfolio has some impact, some new direct supply impact. And can you -- I know you touched on this a little bit before, but just talk about what you are seeing there specifically in terms of occupancy and pricing trends in those markets, if there's any difference from the other markets, where there is not impact, just what you're seeing at this point? ", "Scott Brinker", "Michael, it\u2019s Scott again. I will try to respond and we did look at historical results when a new building opened over the past couple of years just to try to see what happened in the past, not that that's necessarily an indication of what will happen going forward. But there were 21 of our same-store properties that over the past few years have had a new competitor open inside the competitive ring and we looked at NOI 12 months before the competitor opened and then 12 months after to see how NOI changed. And in the aggregate occupancy was flat on average and NOI was up more than 4% on average. So were some buildings down? Yes but on average the buildings were remarkably resilient in the face of new competition. So it's another more context that new supply is not necessarily a doomsday scenario, especially if you're in markets that have a lot of affluence density and you have differentiated operations which in a lot of cases we do, I think about Silverado. So in the supplemental we give you some color commentary behind each of the properties that is impacted by new supply. And Silverado shows up on a number of this range, because they have buildings that are impacted by new supply. But the reality is that their operating model is vastly different than what anyone else does and more often than not, a competitor is more like a referral source. So it's more than numbers on a page and it's hard to get that across, we try to provide some color in the supplement to help do that. I guess the takeaway is we do have some new supply, it's less than others, it\u2019s less than the industry and we have a very differentiated platform in terms of which operators we\u2019re doing business with and markets that have a lot of people, lot of job growth, a lot of affluence and they are just -- I think better equipped to deal with new supply. ", "Tom DeRosa", "Not so different than other sectors of real estate Mike.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Michael Mont [ph] with Peachtree Advisors.", "Kevin Tyler ", "It's Kevin Tyler here. I just wanted to check with you in terms of flu season. What are you hearing currently from operators about the outlook for flu in the US and the UK for next year? I guess we are into it already or at the start of it, but how does it look to be shaping up? ", "Scott Brinker", "Kevin, I don't have any indication on that yet unfortunately. ", "Tom DeRosa", "I can tell you everybody here in Toledo has had it. And I am the one who hasn\u2019t had it, and I'm trying to stay away from all of them. ", "Kevin Tyler ", "And then, we spent a lot of time on new supply, appreciate the disclosure, guys. One question to make sure I'm understanding correctly. The analysis excludes properties that have been recently opened, correct? It's only new construction? ", "Scott Brinker", "Right, these are projects that are currently under construction, Kevin.", "Kevin Tyler ", "And it sounds like you did some of the historical analysis, that was my second question, in terms of seeing how sensitive it would be in the past. But as we look forward, if construction levels head higher, it sounds like, from what you're saying, you don't forecast this changing all that much. ", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, we will see, I mean we hope like others that new supply slows down a bit. It\u2019s at a level right now that is a concerning which was lower. I like the markets that we\u2019re in, I like the operators that we've chosen but all things being equal more new supply would not be helpful. ", "Kevin Tyler ", "And then last question on capital allocation, you've been able to capture some pretty healthy pricing on the sales front. Just wondering if that will continue to be a focus for \u201816, and what's really the right balance for dispositions versus acquisitions as we look forward into next year?", "Scott Estes", "I think it\u2019s maybe a more balanced expectation for both. We had a big year for investments this year and a big year for dispositions. My estimation is we\u2019d probably see a similar ratio, we will make more acquisitions and dispositions but I think the pace on both, it obviously depends on both. So I guess maybe to put more granularity around your disposition amount question, we talked a bit about our Genesis alone, those would be included in the disposition number next year. So excluding those, you probably assume another $300 million to $400 million of dispositions in addition to those and you all know we have a great deal of success on the investment front just focusing on our existing partners that\u2019s averaged $600 million or $700 million per quarter. So those are probably the way I would think about those numbers. ", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson ", "So, Scott or whomever, you said just a few properties had the effect of driving down same-store by 100 basis points. I don't know that that registers as a risk to me, not a good thing, if it only takes a handful to disrupt the entire group. How would you respond to that? ", "Scott Brinker", "That is just as likely to go the other way. ", "Rich Anderson ", "That\u2019s true, high data type stuff right?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, which is why we built an overall diversified portfolio. RIDEA is 35% of what we do, so despite the volatility that you're referencing our same-store results for the whole portfolio have been remarkably consistent quarter to quarter. ", "Rich Anderson ", "And long term, we understand this is a great organization. But in the here and now, to Scott Estes' point, the impact of supply is minimal when you look at the broader story. But I guess it isn't what's happening now, it's where is it going, right? I think the uncertainty is having a lack of visibility of what the bottom is in terms of same-store growth out of your senior housing operating portfolio. We know in 2000-ish or whenever that was, it really nosedived before RIDEA even was a glimmer in NAREIT's eyes. But what do you think about the downside of all this? If we are at 2.7% this quarter, is there a risk it can go negative? Do you have any color at all that you could share on that topic? ", "Tom DeRosa", "If we went into a deflationary environment maybe it could go negative and if wages continue to increase in a deflationary environment, that doesn\u2019t make any sense but that\u2019s kind of what I hear from the Fed. So anybody\u2019s guess what might happen, I think as Scott said we have a diversified portfolio. We\u2019re located in the best markets and we have the best operators, that's how you protect yourself from these types of phenomenon and I think that -- so I think we\u2019re well-positioned there Rich.", "Scott Brinker", "Rich, the other thing I\u2019d add is we did share with the rating agencies a couple of years ago. It wasn\u2019t too long ago, six or seven years ago that the world was coming to an end financially. I mean the decline in late \u201908 and \u201809 was pretty devastating and our senior housing portfolio at the property level NOI was remarkably resilient, basically flat and I think about the other real estate sectors that had drastic declines in NOI, occupancy, rental rates, in a lot of ways they are restoring what they lost over the past years rather than actually growing whereas our base stayed absolutely flat during what was really a remarkable downturn in the financial markets. And it just I think underscores that this is not just a real estate business. ", "Tom DeRosa", "The other thing, Rich, you have to keep in mind this is an industry sector, the senior housing industry sector is still largely unknown. It is still a early stage industry. It is just starting to be recognized as a solution to an enormous problem that's coming down the road. So when I look at the past it's hard to say what happened 5, 7 years ago is a good indication of what\u2019s happening in the future, because five or seven years ago was a much smaller industry than it is today and in a way I think you see some new supply coming into the markets, I think that's a good thing because every year more and more people are going to embrace that keeping your 88-year-old mother in her apartment with your wife or a niece as a part-time caregiver is not a solution to keeping her safe and healthy. And that is -- that's why I raised that article that was on the cover of the Times this week because people have to wake up, hospitals need to wake up, everybody needs to wake up that we have a crisis occurring and we offer the best near and long-term solution to manage this problem. So I guess that's why we're less troubled by our same-store sales number this quarter because we\u2019re looking to the future and we believe there is going to be -- there may be ways of absorption that we can anticipate today because there's still such a small level of penetration in our population of this asset class. So I think you got to stay tuned and I think what we're doing as a company is making sure we have \u2013 we\u2019re in the strongest position, that we have the best access to capital, diversified access to capital, a clean balance sheet to perhaps weather any short-term dislocations and allow us to keep our eye on the big prize of the future.", "Rich Anderson ", "Yes, no one is debating the quality of your organization. There's just times for the stock and times not for it. And so that's really the debate. Someone brought up the issue of bundling. Do you have any concerns about how that could impact Genesis's business platform in the next couple of years, should that pivot from being pilot programs to real law? ", "Scott Brinker", "Rich, our general view is that there probably will be a few years of challenges with margins declining but taking a longer-term view I think it's going to really shake up the industry and result in the exit of a lot of companies and a lot of buildings. So longer term I think Genesis, companies like it, capture market share and are able to be successful just in a different way, probably at a lower margin in reality but again very successful because they play such an important role in managing the post hospital discharge in these elderly residents. ", "Tom DeRosa", "And Rich, I want to leave you with one thing. Given what's happened in our stock since last Friday, I think there's never been a better time to buy our stock, Welltower. ", "Rich Anderson ", "Last question, and it's really more a statement, but you can respond to it. I think you got halfway there. You have this fortress balance sheet. Kudos to you for the deleveraging that you've done. Now we are faced with potential higher interest rates. Now there are some question marks in the industry, whether it's senior housing supply or bundling in postacute or the risks going on in the hospital sector. Maybe the second part of the strategy should be, you know what? We're going to stop right here, and we're going to protect our portfolio and our balance sheet, and we're not going to continue to push forward with an investment platform in the billions per year. What do you think about that in terms of just acknowledging what's out there? ", "Tom DeRosa", "Well I think you\u2019ve seen, if you just look at this quarter, our investment activity was lower than you\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. We have passed on lots of things because we saw cap rates going to levels that just made no sense to us and it\u2019s the whole argument now that everyone's talking about that public market valuations are below the private market valuations. Well we were seeing that, we\u2019re seeing a lot of crazy prices and we\u2019ve stood on the sidelines but I can think of one large opportunity that was taken down and at a very high price and from what we're hearing that transaction unravelled. So because and maybe that's a sign that the bubble might have burst. But I think that look, we are the major player in the sector and I've actually told our operators don\u2019t bring us low cap rate deals because you want us to have a high stock price, you want us to have growth because if we can't raise capital you can't grow your business, so simple as that. So I am going to tell you, Rich, we have been very judicious and we will continue to be. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya ", "First of all, thank you for all the additional disclosure around the senior housing operating platform. As we try to figure all this stuff out, I think information like that, you guys being so responsive, is definitely a move in the right direction. My question is specifically on skilled nursing. Just following up on some of what Rich said, a few weeks ago, saw Genesis stock and some of the other skilled nursing stocks go crazy on this Office of the Inspector General news about them looking very closely at overbilling issues on the therapy side. Just kind of wondering what Genesis at this point thinks about that and how you guys think that could potentially impact the outlook of the company?", "Tom DeRosa", "Are you talking about the billing issues, maybe you could provide a little more on that \u2013 ", "Tayo Okusanya ", "Yes, this was the news that came out just around NIC, when the Office of the Inspector General was actively calling for CMS to reduce reimbursement rates to skilled nursing, because they felt or they were concerned there were overbilling issues, especially as it pertained to therapy, over the past few years. ", "Scott Brinker", "Tayo, I didn\u2019t see this specific article, that\u2019s certainly a conversation that has been ongoing for years. I don\u2019t think anyone believes that the current reimbursement system across the board is a good one, whether it\u2019s skilled nursing, hospitals, LTACs or inpatient rehab and you're going to see a significantly different payment system as you look forward that's based on value, not services provided. And we think that's a great thing and that includes companies like Genesis in particular that are low-cost option and help save the system money. So they live within the current reimbursement rules today and I think you\u2019ve seen a very good track record of performance within the rules for Genesis. ", "Tom DeRosa", "And other than that, we can\u2019t say anything because they haven\u2019t reported.", "Tayo Okusanya ", "But do you see any risk around us given we're still working within the confines of the current system that we go through what we went through in 2011, where CMS has a big knee-jerk reaction and just makes a big cut to reimbursement? ", "Scott Brinker", "Tayo, I tried to refer to it but maybe to indirectly in the prior response. We\u2019re less focused on the reimbursement rate risk. I don't see that happening but there is a lot of risk in that the system is changing in a very significant way. And we do think that a lot of buildings and operators are going to have a real challenge as we look out 5 to 10 years in that business. So our overall view is that the marketplace is underestimating the risk profile in that business but also not giving enough credit to the higher-quality scale providers like Genesis because I think over time they will survive and they will capture market share. ", "Tayo Okusanya ", "Okay, that's fair. You've made some very pointed comments about the UK. Could you talk a little bit about Canada and what you're seeing out there at this point? ", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, be happy to. So Canada is 15% of our operating portfolio, it's a different portfolio in that it's very much independent living and senior housing, so very little healthcare provided. But what's consistent common theme is that we\u2019re focused on the big markets. So a huge percentage of the NOI comes from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, markets that you want to be in long term because of population density, affluence, job growth but it's a lower \u2013 I\u2019d say lower risk, lower growth portfolio. So residents tend to stay for much longer than you would find in the senior housing business in the US or UK just because they're moving it at a young age and they have a lot fewer health issues. So much lower turnover, therefore higher occupancy and much higher operating margins because a lot of these buildings look more like an apartment building for seniors than they do a high acuity assisted-living facility. ", "Now the challenge we\u2019ve had in Canada is that inflation is really low the past few years. So the GDP, CPI are hovering around zero to 1% to 2% and as a result our business has been in that 2% to 3% range for the past few years, now it bounces around a little bit quarter to quarter but we\u2019ve generally been a bit slower in Canada just because that marketplace overall has had very low growth and low-inflation.

My name is Colia, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Miller", "Thank you, Colia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tom DeRosa. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased that we finished 2015 with our strongest quarterly performance of the year. These results are driven by solid fundamentals, a disciplined investment thesis and the unique operating platform that we have developed and employed at Welltower over many years. Today I want to highlight three topics that are top of mind; capital allocation, Genesis and seniors housing supply.", "On to the first topic; capital allocation. This is the most important exercise of any management team and how I spend most of my time. We think about this as a framework for how we maximize shareholder returns. Essentially every public company has five primary ways to deploy capital; acquisitions, investing in the existing business, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock, and four ways to raise capital; internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposing of assets. So, when the equity capital markets were favorable we took full advantage and built the industry leading healthcare real-estate portfolio.", "For us it was not about winning a pie eating contest but building unmatched, local scale in major metro markets with the best operators in the business. Simply put we've created a real operating platform, not a passive collection of assets in which success is measured only by year one FFO accretion. The good news for our shareholders is we don't take access to the capital markets for granted and we don't gamble with our shareholder capital. Hence we took advantage of the strong equity market to significantly delever our balance sheet. Now in a less than accommodating public capital market we are sitting in an enviable position. We are also proud that in 2015 the Canadian Pension Plan; one of the largest investors in commercial real-estate in the world chose Welltower to be its joint venture partner to make its first investments in healthcare real-estate. Scott Brinker will talk about our most recent venture with CPP as well as our ongoing successful partnership with PSP.", "Welltower has always seen targeted dispositions as an important component of our capital allocation strategy and 2015 was no exception. We sold less strategic assets such as our last U.S. hospital asset realizing an 11% unlevered IRR. And we took advantage of robust pricing and sold our life science portfolio at a 5% yield realizing an unlevered IRR of 15%. May I remind you that we have sold $4 billion in assets over the last five years for cash and used that cash to buy better quality real-estate and delever the balance sheet. Over the medium-term we still see opportunity for targeted acquisitions to go deeper into markets where we have local scale in our senior housing business and we also see enormous opportunity to grow our outpatient medical business, but only with the best health systems in this country.", "I talked about our desire to develop relationships with the leading academic medical centers on my very first investor call in May 2014. I told you that this would not happen overnight, as institutions like Johns Hopkins and Cleveland Clinic really don't need our capital. However, increasingly what they do realize they need from Welltower is our expertise in seniors housing, residential Alzheimer's care and read my lips post-acute-care and the connectivity the best-in-class operators that we bring to the table. I'm happy to tell you that these discussions are now starting to bear fruit and for example we now own three facilities with Johns Hopkins, which is the number one rated health system in the United States.", "So, let's talk about Genesis, I want to make it very clear we believe in Genesis and the value that post-acute operators like Genesis bring to lowering health care costs and improving our comps. The challenges facing the post-acute industry as it transitions to a value-based care system are well known. If you sit with the CEOs of the leading non-profit health systems in the U.S., like we do at Welltower, they realize that they need to connect to this expertise more than ever as they move to the reality of bundled payments. Have you seen the performance of the for-profit acute-care hospital sector lately? After a brief benefit from the HCA that peaked in the second quarter of 2015, the cold reality is that higher co-pays are translating to a drop in hospital visits. This is why Welltower as of year-end 2015 no longer owns acute-care hospitals in the U.S.", "We believe operating and margin pressures will push acute-care operators to move patients to lower-cost outpatients and post-acute settings. We are optimistic that operators like Genesis that are delivering next-generation post-acute care will become the preferred providers to the top end health systems and have a large inventory of low Q mix SNFs get taken out of service. We understand the market as a voting machine in the short run and the votes are in. While the market has implied a disruption of the majority of the equity value in our investment in Genesis, I can assure you that there is significant value in this relationship and in this investment. Scott Brinker is going to talk more about that in detail.", "Finally, to the topic of seniors housing supply, you may recall we had a long discussion about this topic on the third quarter call. We continue to believe the fear of supply in the U.S. is overblown. There's no doubt that certain markets are oversupplied, but we are primarily in markets where it is difficult to build and hence believe our performance will be resilient. You can look at the portfolio performance this quarter as evidence of this resiliency. As seniors housing operating occupancy has rebounded sequentially up 80 basis points and same-store NOI was up 4.3% in the U.S.", "Like most companies in healthcare and I know you're seeing this in the retail sector as well, we're seeing wage pressure in some parts of the U.S., due to increases in the minimum wage and we're seeing it in the U.K., due to the imposition of the national living wage. Increased supply where it has impact will most likely exacerbate that problem. We are working with our operating partners to capture new labor efficiencies and identify opportunities for enhanced pricing power.", "In conclusion we believe we have a superior portfolio in superior markets, best in class operating and capital partners and a seasoned team to execute across all markets. With the right assets in the right markets we will prove the thesis that healthcare real estate has lower downside and better upside over a cycle. Now I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker.", "Scott Brinker", "Okay, thank you, Tom. We took full advantage of the up cycle, we now have unmatched scale in the markets where you want to own real estate; 77 properties in Southern California, 47 in Greater London and 281 on the eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. Our history in the business tells us these markets will produce superior results. We're entering a period of increased separation among companies. Our real estate quality will stand out more than ever. Each business segment turned in a strong fourth quarter. The results show that our capital allocation is paying off. The operating portfolio trended higher with 3.3% same store NOI growth, fundamentals are solid, occupancy was up 20 basis points and rates increased 3.2%.", "Importantly we're not buying the growth, as CapEx remains at very modest levels. The age of our properties is a material competitive advantage. Performance in the U.S. continues to be strong with 4.3% same-store NOI growth. Large metro markets once again outperformed, validating our capital allocation. Same-store NOI in Canada grew 4.6% despite an economy with near zero inflation, highlighting the resiliency of our business. The U.K. portfolio is poised for a rebound this year based on recent revenue trends.", "Several Wall Street analysts recently ranked our outpatient medical portfolio as number one in asset quality. The impact can be seen in our results. We hit all time highs in occupancy and tenant retention last year, leading to another solid quarter with 3.1% same-store NOI growth. Visibility is the key word here and there are three drivers; one, very little lease rollover; two, when leases do roll we typically renew more than 80% of them; and three, nearly all of our buildings are sponsored by a health system. That's important because they act as a magnet for other tenants. The space leased directly to a health system is climbing and now sits at 60%. We see that number moving even higher as hospitals transition more and more services to outpatient settings.", "I'll move to Triple Net, a highly visible income stream that contributes half of our earnings. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.3%, while post-acute long term care increased 3.1%. We've been eagerly anticipating a chance to talk about the next topic, which is Genesis. Dramatic underperformance by ManorCare who is not in our portfolio is unfairly implicating Genesis if not an entire industry. Industry headwinds clearly exist but they are not new. In fact we've been preparing for years including selling nearly $1 billion of last generation skilled nursing assets. And rather than focusing exclusively on the short term headwinds we also considered a bigger picture.", "According to Avalere, a highly regarded research firm, the dramatic increase in the Medicare population will more than offset the decline in length of stay and per capita utilization. As a result the number of skilled nursing Medicare days is expected to increase by more than 10% over the next five years. That data reminds us that skilled nursing plays an important role in cost effective healthcare delivery. There's a reason we haven't suffered any lease rejections or rent reductions like other skilled nursing landlords.", "One, strong payment coverage. The cash flow from the Genesis properties that we own fully supports the rent payment to Genesis and so to ourselves. Our Genesis properties generate nearly $1.60 of operating income for every $1 of rent. Given the profitability inside the walls of our buildings, the parent guarantee is simply an additional security blanket. And that parent guarantee does have value. Parent company's fixed charge coverage increased last year and Genesis expects further improvement this year to north of 1.3 times.", "Two we've been actively managing the portfolio since the day we closed the sale leaseback five years ago. That includes selling underperforming buildings, funding new development in acquisitions with strong coverage and facilitating mergers that generate synergies. And three Genesis is a superior operator. Despite the challenging environment our property level Genesis payment coverage is only 1 basis point lower than it was four years ago, 1 basis point. Property level EBITDAR increased a healthy 2.5% per year during that period and remember that we own the legacy Genesis portfolio, which is concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic and New England.", "These are hands down, their absolute core assets. Final comment here is that we expect Genesis to refinance our mortgage loans with significant pay downs coming this year in line with the business plan.", "Turning to 4Q investments, we closed $1.5 billion at a 6.8% initial yield. It\u2019s fair to say that 2016 investment volume will look much different than previous years. Capital allocation helped drive our historical outperformance and remains a top priority. Every day we look at the relationship between cap rates and our cost of capital. Discrepancies plus or minus provide an opportunity to create value. We have the luxury of not needing to make any rash decisions but if buyers have an aggressive view of asset value we'll be happy to crystallize value in select properties. By design our investment pipeline is quite limited today and we can fully fund it with operating cash flow and in process asset sales.", "I want to share color on a new relationship, it's a curb operator called Discovery Senior Living. Last quarter we acquired six high performing independent living communities in Florida that Discovery built and will continue to co-own and manage. The properties are typically 100% full with a waiting list. Significant renovations are nearly complete which will allow Discovery to market the properties at a higher price point generating strong earnings growth. To fund the acquisition we partnered with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board or CPP. This marks their first investment in U.S. seniors housing, again highlighting the confidence in our platform by one of the world's leading investors.", "The other major acquisition last quarter was with Revera where we parted with PSP a long time and important pension fund partner of ours. The acquisition deepens our large Metro market footprint. Welltower will receive a 6.1% preferred return that grows by 4% per year through 2020. We sold our final U.S. inpatient hospital last quarter. The number of hospital beds has been nearly cut in half in the past few decades. And there are more closures coming. The old physical plans require massive CapEx and even [indiscernible] the buildings are often unprepared for advances in technology. We also see an adverse selection problem. The hospitals looking for sale leasebacks are too often the ones you don't want to do business with.", "I'll wrap up with our excitement about the current environment. The last down cycle laid the foundation for what Welltower has become. The next few years will be the ideal environment to take another leap forward. Now to Scott Estes.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, Scott and good morning, everyone. My financial message today echoes the capital allocation team that has been essential to our long-term successes and organization. Calendar 2015 was an important year for HCN and that we positioned the balance sheet for the current period of volatility by opportunistically raising equity in response to the strength of our investment pipeline. 90% of the investment closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 were negotiated during the first half of the year. And while there's always an urge to perfectly time the equity market, we're glad that we chose to pre fund the majority of this activity allowing us to end the year with essentially the same conservative leverage ratios that we started with in 2015.", "While we're poised to generate another year of solid financial results and dividend growth in 2016, our net asset stellar message and public guidance for the upcoming year reflects our current mindset of remaining both disciplined and opportunistic while protecting our downside. More specifically our ability to utilize dispositions as a source of capital in the current environment should provide multiple benefits. It should allow us to maintain our further reduced leverage. We can enhance our asset quality and try to tame it and we can maintain adequate liquidity and execute our 2016 capital plan within a self funded framework. Given the recent uncertainty surrounding the macro economic backdrop our conservative approach leaves us well positioned to wait out the current storm as we continue to appropriately allocate capital to maximize shareholder value.", "I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our fourth quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure. As Tom said, we had a great fourth quarter as normalized FFO came in at $1.13 per share and normalized FAD was $0.99 per share representing strong 10% and 9% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase averaging 3.1% for the full year and the $3.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 12 months. I note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the fourth quarter declined to 73% and 83%, respectively. There were two noteworthy items on our income statement this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to explain.", "First we incurred $35.6 million in other expenses this quarter, which represented a non-cash charge related to marking the value of our Genesis stockholding the market at yearend. And as a reminder we essentially received our initial $58.5 million in stock for free, as it represented the amount of purchased options for 9.9% of Genesis within the money is the time they went public. Conversely on the positive side of the ledger we realized a gain on the sale of assets of $31.4 million in the quarter, which is largely due to the profitable disposition of our final U.S. acute-care hospital during the period.", "In terms of dividends, we will pay our 179th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 22nd of $0.86 per share. As this new annualized rate of $3.44 per share represents a 4.2% increase over our 2015 dividend level and a current yield of 6.1%. In terms of our supplement this quarter the only notable change is on Page 2 where we did add a table providing detail on the number and dollar value of the individual acquisitions and joint ventures complete each year.", "Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The fourth quarter was an active one in terms of capital raising activity for the company. In October we completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured debt price to yield just under 4.3% through our reopening of our 10 year notes through June 2025. And in November we successfully tapped the Canadian senior note market for the first time in our history, completing the sale of C$300 million of 5 year notes price to yield just over 3.4%. In terms of equity, we issued 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program generating $66 million in proceeds and we tapped our ATM program for the first time since 2012 issuing 696,000 shares at an average price of $69.23, raising another $47 million.", "We also generated $225 million of proceeds through the sale of non strategic assets and loan pay offs and finally we repaid approximately $104 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.9% and assumed to issue $674 million of secured debt at a blended 3.3% rate. So importantly as a result we have over $2 billion of liquidity entering 2016 with only $350 million of line borrowings net of the $361 million in cash on balance sheet and the $124 million of cash receive from CPP's Discovery portfolio buy-in subsequent to year end.", "Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of 2015 remain in excellent shape. As of December 31st, our net debt to un-depreciated book capitalization was 39.9% and net debt to enterprise value of 32.7%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.6 times, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage for the quarter was strong at 4.3 times and 3.4 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets at quarter end.", "In light of the recent strength of the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar I would like to remind you of our hedging strategy entering 2016. We have minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 87% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 83% hedged from an earnings perspective. So as a result the sensitivity of both currencies moving 10% in relation to the U.S. dollar from current levels would impact our earnings either up or down by only $0.01 per share this year.", "Finally I'll conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth we are forecasting blended growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2016, as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio. To further breakdown this forecast by asset type, first for our seniors housing operating portfolio we are projecting growth in the 2% to 3% range as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operator's relative performance. For our seniors housing Triple Net portfolio we anticipate growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. For our long-term care post acute portfolio we are projecting an increase of approximately 3%. And last for our outpatient medical portfolio we project an increase of approximately 2% to 2.5% driven primarily by annual rate increases, continued strong occupancy, very low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%.", "In terms of our investment expectations there are no acquisitions beyond what we've announced today in our formal guidance. As a result the only acquisitions included in our 2016 guidance are the approximate $163 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. Our 2016 guidance also includes $419 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.2%. In terms of dispositions we have included $1 billion of dispositions in our forecast. This is comprised of $178 million of proceeds from assets currently held for sale at a blended yield on sales of 7.2% with the remainder representing loan pay offs and other potential property sales.", "Although we prefer to avoid any specifics of what we might sell this year, as Tom said earlier, we have a successful history of selling not only non-strategic assets, but also more opportunistic asset sales to lock-in attractive values. My point here is that we have multiple options in our approach to sales this year and believe there are no pools of assets that are off limit as we evaluate asset sales to most efficiently allocate capital. Our capital expenditure forecast this year is $83 million which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $28 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio.", "As Scott mentioned these amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 7% to 8% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories due to our generally more modern portfolio. Our G&A forecast is approximately $160 million to $165 million for 2016, as the majority of growth on a year-over-year basis is due to the annualized 2016 impact of hires and infrastructure investments made during 2015. We remain very comfortable with these spending levels to support the continued growth of the organization. I would also note that we expect first quarter G&A to be slightly higher than the average for the year as it typically includes accelerated expensing of stock based compensation for certain employees and directors.", "We anticipate incurring income tax expense of approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016, based on our latest estimation of taxable income that is largely generated by our seniors housing operating portfolio. And finally as a result of all these assumptions we expect to report 2016 FFO in a range of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.", "So, in conclusion our focus on capital allocation entering 2016 prioritizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage and retaining ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improves. At this point Tom, I'll turn it back to you for you for your closing remarks.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. I want to leave you with the message that we are confident in our ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. Let me remind you that when senior housing was in disarray because of lack of capital post financial crisis or because of the oversupply in the early part of the century, our shareholders benefitted tremendously and we grew exponentially by recapitalizing the industry. Today we are in the strongest position we have every been with our leading balance sheet, long-term institutional capital partners, like CPP and PSP, our portfolio of best-in-class operators, significant local scale in top markets and a deep understanding of how all these work together as a real operating platform, not a financially engineered yield portfolio. I cannot be more excited about what lies ahead for Welltower.", "So, for the Q&A we have a few other folks in the room here. We've got two that are well-known to you, Paul Nungester and Steve Schroeder and two that are new on the Q&A but who I think are well-know to lots of people on the phone, Tim Lordan and Shankh Mitra.", "So, now Colia, please open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin of Barclays.", "Josh Raskin", "Good morning and appreciate the time you guys hitting all of the hot topics in the prepared remarks. One, a question about this shop same-store cash NOI the 2% to 3% in 2016 and want to understand sort of what the buildup is there and how you think about that sort of long-term sustainable -- I know you guys have talked about a range, maybe slightly higher than that and obviously you've operated a lot higher than that. And then I guess as part of that I know last quarter you talked about these five facilities in the Northeast that have some flu issues that were a 130 basis point drag, any update on those specifics and I'm assuming the flu is a little bit more helpful now?", "Jeff Miller", "Yes, that's for sure. Less flu and less snow this year in the markets that kind of crushed us last year with snow removal costs and labor costs because of difficulty in getting to and from the facilities.", "Scott Brinker", "Great, so, Josh I'm happy to answer that, Scott Brinker. There're a couple of questions I'll try to remember them one at a time, the first I think was the 2% to 3% growth outlook and how did we get there? And from where we sit today our same-store occupancy is slightly above last year, so that's a good starting point. I've said on a number of occasions that 90% plus of NOI in the seniors housing space can be explained in three variables; occupancy, rate and labor. So I just talked about one of them, occupancy looks good, but we've been conservative in our guidance and assume essentially no change in occupancy through the year just given what's happened in the economy and there's some new supply, now hopefully will be better than that but that's what's within our guidance. And then on rate, we continue to grow in the 3% to 3.5% range and that's generally what we expect in 2016. And the third component is labor, and that's probably the one where, I wouldn't say we're worried but it could be a bit higher this year than it has been recently.", "A number of states and cities have increases in their minimum wage and certainly the new supply in certain markets does impact the labor pool. So we're expecting compensation expense to be a bit higher than rate growth this year in our budget and that's what leads into the 2% to 3% projection for the year. Now longer term what I'd tell you is we projected in the 4% to 5% range when we made our first RIDEA investment more than five years ago, obviously we've done better than that on average. There will be fluctuations, we also probably didn't expect that inflation would be virtually zero. When we made that projection which is where it's at today in a lot of our core markets and yet we're still drilling in the low 3s. So what we feel confident in is that we'll continue to outperform the sector which we've done year after year after year. And that we'll outperform our peers. And that's probably a better way to answer the long term growth outlook Josh. It's so hard to say for sure what the overall economy is going to look like.", "And the only thing I'd add to that is you have to really look at the markets where our assets are located. These major metro markets are very difficult to bring new supply. You know we're very focused on major metro markets where we already have assets and where we're looking to bring additional supply. And I -- if you look at the aging of the population there's going to be more and more demand and limited options particularly for people who have dementia and Alzheimer's disease. So that's one of the reasons why we're still pretty bullish on at least our portfolio and how it will perform over the long term.", "Josh Raskin", "Got you, that's particularly good. And then just one quick follow up on Genesis and I think the answer to this is no just based on your prepared comments. But will you guys think about sort of joint marketing a few assets or I know you talk about dispositions as part of the strategy, I don't know if it's in that $1 billion but is that something within the relationship that you guys are talking about?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, we talk a lot about -- we're close with the Genesis management team and also with their financial partner Formation Capital and so we have lots of discussions about how do we best position Genesis and how we best position Welltower. So all options are considered, Josh.", "Josh Raskin", "Okay that's fair.", "Operator", "Your next question's from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Hey guys, good morning. Couple of different questions. The first is Genesis related, they obviously reported Q4 numbers back on January 25th. Is -- why are you still reporting the September 30 coverage, is there any hope that we can get that sort of reported up on a real time basis and is there anything you can say anecdotally I guess about how the coverage changed in Q4 based on that result?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes Ross I'm happy to answer that, it's Scott Brinker. So they announced -- pre-announced their corporate just a couple of weeks ago but you will probably remember it was quite limited on what they talked about. And until they announce their full earnings next week we're just unfortunately not in a position to really say much more. It's just we have the data we'd like to talk about it, we can't.", "Ross Nussbaum", "That makes sense. Number two, Scott can you talk a little bit about those loan advances you made in the fourth quarter, you guys lent out a $183 million or as to the full year total up to over a $700 million. Can you talk a little bit about what type of loans were these? Were these construction loans, bridge loans, term financing and then maybe talk about the underwriting? What were the LTVs, interest coverage, can you give us some color on all that? Thanks.", "Scott Brinker", "Be happy to Ross. These are mortgage loans that are very similar to what we did to help them finance the Skilled Health acquisition in early 2015. So when they closed on the portfolio acquisition with Revera in the fourth quarter we provided some short term fully secured mortgage financing to help them accomplish that transaction. Now the long term plan in both cases is that they will bring these properties to HUD, and replace our, I'll call it high cost financing at 8% plus with very high escalators with lower cost in the 4% range HUD financing that's non-recourse and has a 30 year term. So that's what the majority, the vast majority of the loan volume in the fourth quarter represents, Ross, it is just a mortgage loan to help them finance that Revera acquisition and we expect it to be repaid over the next call it 12 months.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Okay, and then last question from me, just based on kind of sources and uses of capital, if I look at the remaining development spend it looks like you've got just a little over, maybe $550 million something for 2016 and '17 to fund in the development side. So if I think about match funding and capital recycling of call it a $1 billion, that just in rough numbers would leave another call it around you can say $400 million that could be deployed toward acquisitions on a leverage controlled basis. Is that a wrong way to be thinking about in rough terms what the acquisition volume would be on leverage neutral basis without returning to the equity markets or increasing dispositions?", "Scott Estes", "I think that's generally right. Ross, Scott Estes. We do have a -- one thing you didn't mention is we have $400 million of debt maturing in March so the only other item that is contemplated in guidance is that we replace that with prevailing rates. So 10 year to debt for us today is probably in the 4.4% to 4.5% range. But the three pieces for the sources other than that are retained earnings. We obviously get about $300 million from our DRIP and then the $1 billion of dispositions in addition to that.", "Ross Nussbaum", "So you are going to leave the DRIP on?", "Scott Estes", "Yes the DRIP, yes. Not the ATM.", "Ross Nussbaum", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Company Markets.", "John Kim", "Thank you. Good morning. On your joint venture with CPPIB, can you just discuss if there was any discussions on partnering on your existing assets rather the new acquisitions?", "Tom DeRosa", "We have many discussions with CPP. They are a close partner of ours now and so you should assume that, any and all possibilities are discussed with CPP.", "John Kim", "And then what about right of first offers in Florida? Do they have any as far as new acquisitions for you or dispositions?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. John its Scott Brinker. There are mutual rights of first offer based on defined radii around the properties that we acquired that is limited to independent living buildings since that's what we acquired with them.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then on your $1 billion of disposition guidance can you jut elaborate who the buyers in the market are today and how we should be thinking about cap rates -- those 9% in dispositions in the fourth quarter but as you mentioned 7.2% on assets held for sale so how should we think about cap rates going forward?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well lot of this $1 billion is loan repayments, so the buyer's HUD rather than -- HUD you wouldn't ordinarily think about as buyer. The others that we have in process it's for the most part private equity groups. You have to ask them about the return expectations. I know ours have increased a bit. But I don\u2019t think they spend enough transaction volume, at least in seniors housing to know where cap rates are going. I would say medical office is such a liquid market with a lot of buyers that I don\u2019t think the impact of the public REIT share prices or the non traded REITs no longer raising money has much of an impact in that sector. And we have seen several skilled nursing portfolios very recently transact to cap rates that are really no different than what we have seen for years in that business. Seniors housing is where it slowed down a bit. So I think a lot of people are wondering where cap rates will ultimately head.", "John Kim", "Okay. And then finally on Genesis, I appreciate that they haven\u2019t reported full year results yet, but they did guide to a sequential decline in EBITDAR in the fourth quarter. Can you just elaborate why are feel confident that their headwinds are not the same as ManorCare's given the patterns seems like it's very similar?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes I mean there are a long list of things that are different. Now I know a lot more about Genesis but not to about ManorCare. So I will this time focus my comments on Genesis. But it gets back to the comments, I made in my script, John. They clearly are facing some industry headwinds but those headwinds are not new. Medicare Advantage has been an issue for years and years putting pressure on length of stay and rate and Genesis has stayed ahead by getting out of certain assets, acquiring assets that are better fits for the current environment and actively managing their labor costs, which again is the most significant operating expense. And the other thing I would mention is they have a much lower Medicare mix and that probably has an impact on why they have held out better over the past four years, because a lot of the pressure has been on the Medicare side of the business. And the other distinction I would make is the results at the corporate level. So I talked about property level cash flow being more than adequate to pay the rent but there is also a huge difference in terms of the corporate cash flow which provides a significant security blanket for our rent payment. And they've been able to grow that cash flow through merger synergies and they will grow it going forward through refinancing and probably some asset buybacks.", "John Kim", "Can you just remind us what percentage of the Genesis equity that you own?", "Scott Brinker", "It's just over 4% John.", "John Kim", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore of Stifel.", "Chad Vanacore", "Good morning, all. So just looking at the shop portfolio occupancy has actually improved for the past couple of quarters. What are you seeing or expecting that you are factoring in to get to your flat occupancy in 2016?", "Scott Brinker", "Chad we like the market position of our buildings in the vast majority of our locations. But I just remember just 12 months, when it seems like the day after we hung up on our fourth quarter earnings call, occupancy started to drop pretty quickly because of the flu. So there's just some things you can't predict and we're taking a conservative approach here. I mentioned earlier that occupancy today in the same-store pool is above last year. So, that implies that we should be in a good position and we continue to see positive trends really in all three countries.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, so speaking of three countries, I think Scott you might have mentioned that you expect a rebound in the U.K., how should we think about that given your occupancy starting at a much lower level now and how should we think about that growth?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, it is and it will probably ramp up over the course of the year. When I get back to the comment I made about the three variables that really impact performance; the first is occupancy and there's clearly a rebuilding that was necessary after the flu season last year but we've seen it, across that portfolio occupancy is coming back very strongly. The second variable being rate and we continue to increase rates in the 3% range if not higher this year. The third variable is more challenging and that's labor because of the impact of the living wage which is up 7% throughout the country and even higher in other markets. So, unrelated to anything that Sunrise can control, there's just an external factor that's going to be a headwind on NOI growth this year.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right and then just one last one. So you've done several JVs with capital partners now, can you just talk about your thoughts on what these capital partners are bringing to the table and why don't just go it alone?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well they bring some of the largest pools of capital in the world and Chad we believe that there is going to be an increasing need for senior housing in the major metro markets. And if you think about the cost of building in Midtown Manhattan or Central Washington, D.C. or San Francisco, it's significant and it's important that institutions like CPP now understand the investment thesis for deploying capital to seniors housing. The other piece of this is that we again very much believe is that it's going to take trillions of dollars to rebuild the acute-care hospital system in this country to basically accommodate technology that is with us today or will be developed in the future that will dramatically allow us to lower healthcare costs and improve outcomes. We have a lot of antiquated acute-care hospital infrastructure in this country. So, while I'd like to think we could go it alone and the capital markets will accommodate us to fund every bit of capital need that we will need to build this infrastructure, we aren't -- we're not that big a gambler. So, it's been very important for us to spend time with institutions like PSP and CPPIB and we'll bring others in because I think they understand we're smart and we can provide them opportunities that they cannot find on their own and they will also see interesting opportunities to deploy capital at returns that possibly aren't available in other sectors -- in the traditional sectors of real-estate where they are one of the major owners.", "Scott Brinker", "And Chad the other thing I would mention is they give us a lot of flexibility. Keep in mind that at as a Healthcare REIT we can't own operating companies. At least we can't own more than 35% of them. So Sunrise is an example, we'd love to own the whole thing but we can't. So, this is a company that's worth probably $500 million plus, this is a big profitable company and the question is, if Healthcare REIT Welltower can only own up to 35% of that company who owns the rest? There are very limited people that could write a check that size, private equity is one but frankly generally speaking they don't align with our approach to business. So, PSP acting through Revera owns the balance of Sunrise alongside of us and that's just one example of how we are I think controlling our own destiny, helping shape the future of the industry through these ownership stakes that without a group like PSP we would not be able to do.", "Tom DeRosa", "Scott just said it, we're a long-term investor and these are long-term investors, they're not managing to a 7 year fund return. So we think we are much more aligned with this investor class and I think you'll see more of that from us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Just going back to the RIDEA growth across the different geographies, could you maybe just give us a range of how that 2% to 3% would pan out in the three different regions?", "Scott Brinker", "I will be happy to. The U.S. is 70% of that portfolio and drives the majority of the growth rate so you should expect it to be right in the middle of that range. The U.K. probably a bit higher but backend weighted in the second half of the year and then Canada a bit lower, mostly because of the economy there. Inflation is zero.", "Vikram Malhotra", "And you obviously talked about the expense or the wage pressures in the U.S. -- in parts of the U.S. and then in the U.K. Anything, any similar trends in Canada or pressures in Canada?", "Scott Brinker", "We haven't seen as much in Canada, Vik, probably driven or just by the health of the overall economy there, the labor market is much more reasonable. It's really the U.K. because of the change in the living wage and then particular markets in the U.S. which have a higher minimum wage.", "Tom DeRosa", "And the U.K. has a tight -- particularly around, London has a very tight labor market. There is a demand particularly for people with nursing skills and a lot of that is -- it's complicated because a lot of that demand is being met through nurses that are coming from other countries and you actually get into a whole immigration discussion. So it's quite complicated but that's where a lot of the pressure's been in the U.K.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, and then just, just to understand kind of the methodology we use to kind of to come up with your RIDEA growth numbers and kind of what the impact of supply is? I think some of your peers use sort of a 3% absorption number factored into that equation. Just wondering what you guys use and can maybe just give us a little bit more color on how you -- what sort of industry trends you assume in that model?", "Scott Brinker", "I think the number that you're referring to is in the supplement. So I'll just use the 3 mile radius as an example because we still think that's the most appropriate for our urban locations based on where residents usually come from. We had a more suburban or rural market portfolio I think 5 to 10 miles is more appropriate but for Welltower I think 3 miles really is the best radius to be looking at. So in this quarter's supplement we say that 1.7% of our total NOI is impacted by new supply, okay, and that assumes that all of the NOI from the properties that we own will be impacted 100% by the new supplies. So it's kind of a worst case scenario, meaning if you take all the properties in our portfolio that are impacted by new supply, that 1.7% assumes that NOI at those properties goes to zero, which is obviously not going to happen. In fact our history is that properties in our portfolio that are subject to new supply have actually held up quite well when new supply enters the market and we studied it for years, looked at their performance before and after the new competition enters the market. And on average occupancy is pretty much flat and NOI has been up 4% on average. So it's not the Draconian downside necessarily that people assume.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, that makes sense, and then just last one on Mainstreet, correct me if I'm wrong but I believe when you had announced this in '14 you talked about potentially a $1 billion worth of acquisitions or at least the option to buy them and you baked in if I'm not wrong about a $160 million. Can you just talk about incremental opportunities from over and above that?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, there were two different pipelines. There were 17 buildings that we are committed to acquire and now closed on 12 of those, so there're five more to come. And then there were 45 additional properties that had yet to be started and those are starting to roll out and the structure on those is that we provide a small mezzanine loan. Mainstreet puts in lot of equity and then obtains a third party construction loan and when those 45 buildings open, one at a time we have the option to buy each one at a 7.7 cap rate. So it's one building at a time, our option.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vin Chao of Deutsche Bank.", "Vin Chao", "Hey guys. My question's been answered actually, thanks.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thank you, good morning. Question on the proposed acquisition mix, I mean I know there's nothing embedded in guidance today, but I'm curious given sort of the dislocation at least in the public markets, related to the ManorCare news if you will. If there's any opportunity to get -- any opportunity in post acute if you'd look to get bigger there, invest incrementally and then maybe any other comments of any other vertical within the portfolio you'd be interested in? Sort of the deploying incremental capital.", "Tom DeRosa", "Not sure I understood. You're saying has there been interest from other parties in our skilled nursing assets either buying them from us or investing helping us fund development of skilled nursing.", "Jordan Sadler", "I'm more interested to know what you want to do with your capital as you look forward, so obviously we saw DSL but I'm curious what you would do in the post acute space?", "Tom DeRosa", "So what we're interested in post acute is investing in the next generation of post acute care. We are not interested in owning lots of low Q mix on nursing assets and we sold lots of them over the years that Scott mentioned, that's been a component of the $4 billion in dispositions we've made. We believe in the post acute sector. We do not think it's going away. And so we will deploy capital into the next generation of post acute of which Genesis is one of the operators that is offering that product through its PowerBack facilities. We think that as a good place to commit capital. We think -- recently just this past Monday we were with Cleveland Clinic and they mentioned that they had just formed a relationship with Select Medical where they are actually in a new suburban setting, where they have an outpatient in a smaller hospital they are actually putting Select Medical post acute bed attached to the hospital that Select Medical will run. So hospitals more than ever need strong post acute operators and so that's where we will deploy capital. We are not looking to acquire skilled nursing beds because the cap rates look attractive. That is not what we do as a company and I think that's a very important differentiating point about Welltower.", "Scott Estes", "I might answer that question Jordan in a little bit of a different way to that of Tom's comment just focused on post acute. But really in a time where capital is more precious we are really focused on our existing partners. You all know that we have a partnership based approach and we have 30 partners that we have been growing with historically. So if you had to think about asset mix, As Tom said, post acute maybe a part of it but I think primarily seniors housing is where we have our largest share of relationships. We are always going to be I think focused in seniors housing area first and foremost.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on returns in cap rates, Scott Brinker I think I heard you sort of in response to a question mention that you had ratcheted your return expectations higher. I'm curious how much or to what degree what assets classes?", "Scott Brinker", "It's hard to even say what the number would be because we just think at our current stock price there is no reason to do anything. It's ridiculous price to try to raise money at. I don\u2019t think it has any connection with intrinsic value of the company let alone the platform. So we are not really thinking about acquisitions right now. There is a pretty large gap between market expectations for cap rates and what would make sense for us and that means we are going to keep relationships warm. And when that discrepancy flips and at some it will, we will be active again.", "Jordan Sadler", "Is there a difference between sort of that comment regarding the equity and keeping the DRIP on?", "Scott Brinker", "I guess yes. We would say -- I would say, couldn't hurt to look at it. Actually we never turned it and off and fortunately been in a position and if we stated what we would argue is a depressed stock price for a period of time we could do it. So I think it's worth looking at again to the extent we are traded at a lower value for a longer period of time. Really raising only about $50 million-ish or $60 million-ish per quarter in terms of the number of shares that typically come in.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Good results good to see. Two quick questions. First of all the JV with the Canadian Pension Fund. Just kind of given how some of the -- how large some of the other JVs have been in the U.S., just kind of curious how big do you think that could potentially get or whether this is more just a one-off thing?", "Tom DeRosa", "Tayo, I don\u2019t have that information because they are not a public reporting entity. But you should assume they own some very large -- for instance, central business district metropolitan office buildings. You know what the -- you have better idea of knowing what those are worth than we do. But just assume that they have billions of dollars allocated to top end commercial real estate around the world.", "Tayo Okusanya", "But is the expectation that this JV gets bigger with you over time?", "Tom DeRosa", "As we present them opportunities that meet their investment targets, yes, I would assume that will get bigger over time.", "Scott Brinker", "Part of the relationship goes both ways, think about PSP who owns Revera, they have brought us $2 billion of opportunities over the past four years that are now in our portfolio. So it isn't a one way partnership.", "Tayo Okusanya", "And then the $1 billion of dispositions, any sense timing wise as we try to model that? Should we just go to median convention or spread it evenly throughout the entire four quarters? So just curious because it does make a big difference to the numbers.", "Scott Estes", "It's probably best to spread it evenly throughout the year, Tayo. I mean what's held for sale on our balance sheet is about a $110 million MOB portfolio and a $60 million seniors housing Triple Net portfolio. Scott Brinker mentioned loans is clearly a component of that. Again like using the potential, Genesis refinancing as an example will take time to play out throughout the year. They go through the whole process and then everything else would be opportunistic, so I do think it's probably best to blend it throughout the year.", "Tayo Okusanya", "And then last question is U.K. related. I know Avery is a little bit different because of the amount of residents in most Avery facilities that get assistance from the local authorities is lower than the national average. But just when we think about the U.K. as a whole, this combination of wages going up dramatically, this idea that a lot of the local authorities are trying to lower or not increase payment rates as aggressively as it's been in the past few years. And we think about a lot of care home operators in the U.K. being fairly levered entities. I mean what do you actually think is the ultimate outcome here in the U.K.? Do we go through a round of consolidation or do you kind of somehow think that somehow the other local authorities will be forced to continue with the [custom rate] as is?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Tayo, there are really two businesses in the U.K. 95% plus of what exists there are buildings that we wouldn't want to own, because the real estate quality is pretty bad and the payer mix is virtually all government pay and I think that business is in a lot of trouble. That's why we did not invest any capital into that space over the past four years when we so aggressively pursued the high end private pay market. I say that because one, the real-estate quality is low, but two think about the minimum wage impacts when government reimbursement rates are increasing maybe 1% a year and your staffing costs are going up 8% to 10%. That's a tough dynamic to manage through. And I can trust that with the three portfolios that we own in the U.K.; Sunrise, Signature and Avery, all of which have 90% plus private pay. They actually increased rates at pretty substantial percentages this year to offset most of that wage increase and that\u2019s why you really do need to think about two different sectors that are targeting two very different residents.", "Tom DeRosa", "Tayo we offer an alternative to either local authority when it comes to elder care or even on -- in acute-care as you know we own four hospitals in London that are private pay hospitals. So if you think about a network of in London today of over 70 elder care facilities that are private pay that are networked with four private pay acute-care hospitals, that is a formidable entity. Because the fact is you have -- in the U.K. they can't afford to treat their growing elderly population in NHS beds, they just can't do that, and I think that there's going to be an increasing demand for private pay healthcare options as more and more of the population will not get what they want from the government.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital.", "Michael Carroll", "Scott you indicated in your comments that HCN has been preparing for the changing reimbursement environment for the skilled nursing facilities base over the past few years. Can you quickly highlight what those changes were? Were those just mainly the sale of lower quality assets and retaining some of the higher quality assets, you think that could benefit from these changes?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, exactly. Michael I talked about Genesis increasing property level NOI by 2.5% per year over the last four years. The assets that we sold would not have held up that well. They had very low coverage, older buildings, really no corporate credit and that's important to understand in the skilled nursing business. Generally speaking there's no corporate credit behind these leases. Although there may not be AAA there's a substantial entity standing behind all these and we're happy to invest more. With Genesis we've been doing that but we've been focused on the modern post-acute properties that often have higher payment coverage as well, so that there's an even bigger cushion.", "Michael Carroll", "Do these modern facilities have a higher percentage of Medicare patients that would see more pressure or do you expect that the modern facilities will be able to capitalize because with a bundle of payments they can capture more of that volume?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, they'll capture more volume without question. When you think about the healthcare business really transitioning to more of a consumer based industry, where would you rather go given the choice. If you've been in one of their Mainstreet properties or PowerBack, these are very nice properties. In terms of a private room, big rehab space, the amenities, in comparison with a typical 50 year old nursing home, semi-private rooms.", "Tom DeRosa", "The future is what I mentioned with Cleveland Clinic which is in your backyard and/or what we have with Virtua in Voorhees where you have got a PowerBack contiguous to the outpatient and the acute care hospital. That's the future. That's what hospital systems have to embrace that they need to partner with the best in class post acute operators. And Genesis is one of them.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, and then do you guys know the breakdown of the Medicare mix for Genesis and Mainstreet and if they're being impacted by Medicare Advantage and I guess what of their Medicare mix how much of that is Medicare Advantage?", "Scott Brinker", "Michael in the supplement we give the quality mix for Genesis which would include Medicare, fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage as well as any other private payer, commercial insurance and it's right around 48%, so slightly below half. We don't disclose the specific breakdown among those different payer classes, the rates are generally in the same range. Anyway I can tell you that of their Medicare revenues roughly two-thirds is traditional fee-for-service and the rest is Medicare Advantage and that's pretty consistent with the national average where if you look at all Medicare beneficiaries about two-thirds of them are still in the traditional fee-for-service business and the other third are in the Medicare Advantage business.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi, thanks. I just had a quick question on your loan portfolio. Are the -- is the interest on that all cash from the borrowers or is there any kind of pay in kind arrangements for some of that or is it all just cash?", "Scott Estes", "The -- I think it's all cash, the current rate is 8.1% on the blended loan portfolio, Smedes. A very small part is not cash.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, all right, back to you, you covered the rest of my questions, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to get back to post acute. You know it's been said a few times on the call that this is not a new issue and I think we can all agree with that but now the rubber is kind of meeting the road and operators are having to point out the pressure that they're seeing and I would argue that that is not or is a new issue. And so there is a need for post acute of course over the long term but the question is no one really knows what the ultimately landing point of all this is. And you know could there be a significant enough spread versus your rents to their profitability that will ultimately make this okay. So while the temptation is to maybe goose the rent escalators as much as possible. Do you think the end game here ultimately over the long term will be lower rent growth in the industry so that you're partnering correctly with the post acute operator Genesis and others? Just want your comment on what the ultimate end game could be here when you consider the newness of the impacts from these not so new events?", "Tom DeRosa", "That's a tough question Rich. You're asking us to make some predictions which we don\u2019t like to do. It's hard to say. The way I'd answer the question and I would invite anybody in the room here to answer this as well. I mean the way I'd answer it is that you have acute care hospital providers that are going to be under increasing pressure because of bundled payments. They are going to need to align with post acute and seniors housing operators. So I think if you're focused on working -- and also Scott mentioned a word that you don't often hear with respect to healthcare which is called consumerism. As the consumer is forced to have more choices in the future because they're paying more, you're going to -- there's all these phenomenon that to us say if you are aligned with the leading surviving health systems and you have a post acute business that helps them manage in a new reimbursement world more effectively, I think that leads to a good outcome for both the acute care hospital as well as the post acute provider, as well as the consumer. And that is a new way of talking about healthcare.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, I guess the ultimate question is, you know where does this all end and you're saying right now that you're not expecting anything in the way of rent cuts down the road, no matter how far out you look?", "Tom DeRosa", "I mean it's hard to say. I mean I think that this is a complicated area, there will be bumps in the road. It's very hard to answer that but we feel we're very well positioned.", "Scott Brinker", "Rent cuts are something that we talk about, I mean that think about the facility level payment coverage which again is the cash from the buildings that we own. It's patched up by corporate guarantee, so we feel very comfortable with where we're at from both levels.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay and then the comment was just made about your acute mix with Genesis being below 50% and I remember having this discussion with you guys, about maybe we should be focused more on low acute mix on assets and that concept was kind of pushed aside. Now you were talking more swimmingly about low acute mix asset classes or assets within the post acute world. Do you think that's the next generation of thought process given that all the pressures going on?", "Scott Brinker", "No. And I think there is a huge miss understanding on that point, because the pressure that you are seeing from managed care in the Medicare business will also come from Medicaid. The states are throwing up their hands and giving their entire programs to commercial insurers who will continue to squeeze this business. And to me government funded long-term care is the high cost setting for those residents. We are considered the alternatives. Post acute is the low cost setting for those residents. So you have to think about a market and what it looks like five to 10 years from now, not just what the headlines suggest. So we continue to be a lot more bullish about the sector for post acute than for the long-term residential care, which frankly every state is doing everything they can to keep patients out of long-term care nursing homes.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, fair enough. Then just a quick turn of the topic, U.K. there was a doctor strike a month or so ago for younger doctors. I don\u2019t remember specifically where that has gone since then, but I'm just curious if you can give any color on that? How much it concerns you, even though it may not have been a direct hit to your business?", "Tom DeRosa", "I don\u2019t think it was something that we focused a lot of attention on because it's been affect us. I guess there are longer term big issues in the U.K. regarding medical professionals I think it affects mostly the National Health Service.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And then last question is a little bit of a brainstormer but do you have any concern -- you are partnering with the large pension funds out of Canada. It's a country that is highly dependent on energy. Is there any -- have you given that any thoughts about the longevity of them as partners if we continue to see depressed nature of oil and other commodities?", "Scott Brinker", "Rich, CPP and PSP have been around for decades. They are the -- every day they are receiving millions to billions of dollars which have to be invested in safe assets, so they can pay out these pensions over time. They've been around across many cycles, whether oil was a $100 a gallon or whether it's $20, whatever it's -- we don\u2019t worry about that. They are stable, a institutional partner as you can find in the world.", "Rich Anderson", "I was brainstorming. So appreciate the color.", "Tom DeRosa", "Rich we like it when you brainstorm. We enjoy that. Come see us and you can brainstorm -- come see us since we don\u2019t. We can brainstorm even more.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, sounds good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.", "Karin Ford", "Hi. Good morning. Recognizing that you can't speak to your specific coverage in 4Q 2015 ahead of Genesis' earnings report. Can you just talk generally about what you think the direction of the coverages will be for 2016 given your escalators and the ratcheting interest rates on your loans?", "Scott Estes", "Well fortunately we can talk about that because, they talked about it in their press release a couple of weeks ago and the specific comment was that at the corporate level fixed charge coverage is 1.31 times in 2015 and they are projecting 1.35 times in 2016.", "Karin Ford", "Okay, thanks. And then second question is just I want to ask about your 3% to 3.5% assumption for shop rate growth in 2016. Did Sunrise and your other operators push through rate increases on most of their units on Gen-1 and given that you are seeing occupancy perform pretty well here is that what gives you confidence on that assumption?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. That's a good question Karin, I'm glad you brought it up, because of our shop portfolio roughly half of the properties do increase rents for existing residents on January 1. But the other half do it on the anniversary date of when the resident moved in. So it takes some time to impact revenue and I'll contrast that with wage pressure which increases for everybody on January 1 and that's a main reason why we think the second half of the year probably looks a little bit better than the first half. This year just given those dynamics and when it comes to rates for new residents coming in off of the street we do know what the operators are planning to charge in terms of an increase, but the variable is the timing right, they come in throughout the course of the year so it doesn\u2019t impact revenue on day one.", "Karin Ford", "Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Tyler of Green Street Advisors.", "Kevin Tyler", "Thanks guys. Just a quick one on the Genesis side. I know that there has been some additions for the loan portfolio there. What's the total balance today stand? Is it about $450 million on my math or?", "Scott Estes", "Yes it's $440 million.", "Kevin Tyler", "And then is there anything contractually that obligates them? I get the fact that the loans become more expensive as time goes on, but contractually anything obligating them to pay you back when HUD funds?", "Scott Estes", "Yes. If HUD funds, they clearly have to cash back. I mean we have the first mortgage on their properties, so HUD won't close without taking that back from us and economically they have a strong incentive to cash back. I think the rate escalates by 100 basis points every 90 days and it's at least twice as high as what HUD will charge them. And so the incentives are well aligned here.", "Kevin Tyler", "And then Tom just, kind of building on some of the points earlier related to CPP. In your conversations has there been anything from others, almost like a follow-on effect from others of the likes of CPP that are now potentially interested in more in the medical office, senior housing, healthcare space in general as they see maybe CCP being -- or CPP being one of the first movers?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes. Good question, Kevin. I think it's early days. I think that clearly these big institutions that have not invested in this sector before are typically more interested in either urban outpatient medical buildings or I would say that would be their prime -- it's easy for them to get their hands around that sector. But I think this announcement that we made today that now again you have another big global institution partnering with us like PSP in the senior housing space, I think raises a flag to others that maybe you should take a look as well. So, I think it's early days, but we are in conversations with a number of them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan.", "Mike Mueller", "So, thinking about new investments, it sounds like new acquisitions are on hold here, but that's -- how are you thinking about RIDEA senior housing investments compared to Triple Net's just given the comparable same-store NOI outlooks that you have over the near term? And then also are you still pursuing new development opportunities considering the yields are higher?", "Scott Brinker", "On the first question, Mike Triple Net versus RIDEA, it's a good question. It becomes a bit more nuanced because most of the Triple Net opportunities that we see recently have been, I'll call them lower quality properties, they're not in our core markets and the payment coverage tends to be quite low without much corporate credit standing behind the lease. And if I can trust that opportunity with a RIDEA Class A investment in Los Angeles or New York, I still prefer the risk reward of RIDEA even though structurally that first Triple Net investment looks more attractive. I think that's -- you need to think about it in a little bit more detailed way. And now if I could get Triple Net coverages at 2 times, that may change my opinion, but for the most part the market today is in the 1.1 payment coverage range which to me they are not really getting as much protection on a Triple Net lease as the structure may imply.", "Mike Mueller", "And then development, once you work your way through this part of the pipeline are you refilling that just given the yields are higher or are you pulling back on that as well?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, we are very selective when it comes to development and again if you could see us develop -- now you know we are developing in London because there's no -- we have already rolled up the existing supply of high-end private pay elder care in the London market. There's still a demand and that's where we are doing some development. We look very selectively at markets in the U.S. where we know there's no supply or very limited supply of high-end private pay senior housing and that's where we on a very selective basis will allocate capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "Just for probably for Scott Estes. You have about $170 million of properties included in the available-for-sale bucket. Just because dispositions seem high this year, what kind of visibility do you have on the remaining portion of assets and what's in that available-for-sale group?", "Scott Estes", "The held for sale is two portfolios, again about $170 million; like I said $110 million of medical office buildings and $60 million senior housing Triple Net portfolio. I would say probably have -- getting us up to our -- from that $170 million up to roughly half of the total disposition number with potential loan payoffs and there's a little bit of variability again largely to timing of Genesis going through the HUD process. And then the rest is really probably the most flexible piece. So, I think we really just want to maintain that flexibility. We have the luxury of time here. We feel good about where our leverage is. But do you have a more specific question, because again we didn't want to identify specific assets. There's a lot of options and where pricing is in certain markets we can be opportunistic and if we can also do some things that you know enhance the quality of the portfolio we would look at those too.", "Todd Stender", "Now that you're going into Florida with the CPP deal, any overlap with your existing footprint down there?", "Scott Estes", "No, we don't have much in Florida actually. It hasn't historically been one of our targeted markets. We just happen to like these assets in particular. These are big campuses that stay virtually full 100% of the time and equally important Discovery as good as we've seen, especially the marketing side of the business and controlling costs. So it\u2019s I think a reminder that our business is driven not by real estate but also by the quality of the operations and that's what we found so attractive about this particular portfolio.", "Todd Stender", "Great, thanks Scott.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James.", "Jonathan Hughes", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question, long call. I just had one. I know you laid out your strategy and rationale for exiting U.S. hospitals and that was very helpful. But would now be possibly a good time to increase exposure to the asset class given operators better understand the ACA impact and hospital value is probably more attractive than before last year's 2Q peak? I'm just trying to understand your strategy to remove exposure to that sector while one of your competitors is selling out now.", "Tom DeRosa", "So this is where we -- this is our -- where we come out on that. The hospitals that we would want to own are not available. You can only buy hospitals that we would today -- that we consider not good long term investments. We believe that much of the hospital supply that exists today in this country will be taken out of service. It will follow the path of many other sectors of real estate that you've seen taken out of service. We got a lot of empty department stores anchoring struggling malls in this country. Remember there was a day that every city in America had its own unique department stores that were part of the social fabric. And those don't exist today because most of them have gone away or they're called Macy's. And you -- I predict that many of these communities that all have numerous acute care hospital systems, in the next 10, 20 years you will see very few and you'll see the big not-for-profit brand names in healthcare. So the Cleveland Clinics, the Mayo Clinics, the Johns Hopkins, start to proliferate into other markets. So I think you can look at a little bit at history and from a real estate perspective to know that a lot of hospital supply that you can buy today is probably going to be -- if you think the cap rates are attractive today just wait a little while because they're going to be more attractive when you\u2019re buying buildings that are being taken out of service. So this is not an area that we will deploy capital. We think that is not the right strategy for our shareholders.", "Jonathan Hughes", "Okay, fair enough, thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thanks guys for sticking around. Just on Genesis, could you give us any sense of what the coverage would be at the facility level EBITDAR if you excluded the therapy billings? And just on that same point, does Genesis have any ability for whatever reason if they want to sell their therapy business under the master lease, is that permissible as the way it's structured?", "Scott Brinker", "They cannot sell assets without complying with the financial covenants and where they sit today there's no chance that they'd be able to sell an asset that's valuable like the rehab therapy business without our consent. So that's easy, I am not sure I follow your first question though about rehab.", "Juan Sanabria", "Is there a way to strip out the therapy billings, sorry, from EBITDAR coverage, what would it be if you exclude that?", "Scott Brinker", "I'm not even sure what you mean exclude, I'm not sure Juan where you're going with that. The rehab billings, I mean they own their own therapy company. So they charged -- the rehab therapy company charges the facilities for rehab. And that's what's in our number.", "Juan Sanabria", "Other companies may not have that therapy billing so I'm just trying to get an apples to apples comparison.", "Tom DeRosa", "That's because Genesis owns its own therapy company.", "Juan Sanabria", "Fair enough. Just one question a follow up on G&A. What's driving the 10% increase in guidance? And what would you expect that number to grow kind of on a go forward basis?", "Scott Estes", "Sure, Juan we have you know a guidance range that implies about again 10% growth like you said. The majority of it is actually the run rate on existing hires and processes have been put in place in 2015 that's about two-thirds of the growth. And then we have a pretty limited remaining amount call it $5 million to $6 million that's largely what I would call professional services related. So those would include items like consulting, tax, legal, HR. And what I would actually give as an example because we are very focused on lowering our G&A costs. Included in that G&A estimate is about $2 million to $3 million of consulting work we are doing in the tax area. But it's projected to generate savings of $6 million to $7 million on the tax expense line so we actually have a little bit of a shifting that's going on this year where we are incurring a little bit higher G&A. But net we should save the company actually a good bit of money.", "Juan Sanabria", "Can you give any color on what those tax savings may be coming from or look like?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. Yes there is a -- well again like we -- tax expense guidance of $16 million to $18 million did include the benefit of those savings. So that number is lower in our forecast as a result. And in example if something like rehab, pretty complicated number of structures in terms of the sheer number of TRS' in our idea portfolio. So if we can consolidate a 125 TRS' into one that gets a lot more efficiency on which of them are generating income, the efficiency of it, the tax returns and it reduces your overall tax expense. That's one of the projects that we are working on.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Miller", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower's fourth quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tom DeRosa. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thank you Jeff. Hello this morning I want to talk to about real estate. The power of real estate. What I mean by that, I mean Real estate then locations and markets it cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble and adaptive to changing consumer Preferences. Real estate that defies conventional wisdom about supply and retains value across economic cycles. Overtime the lease that class a real estate has reproduced superior and resilient results compare to others that have not followed this strategy. Our quarter is yet another example of the phenomenon that began in 2010. This is my friends is why you own Welltower.The headline number is that our operating story grew by 5.5% in the first quarter. This numbers have not come as a surprise to us, in fact it's totally consistent with the operating same store in a wide growth portfolio over the last five years. Our total portfolio is now around 3.8% and FFO is 9%. All thanks to our business produce good results but we did have a phenomenal quarter in our senior housing for portfolio.", "While there have been real headwinds from increases in labor costs and other operating expenses our class A real estate was able to pass this along to the consumer in strong rate growth while at the same time increasing occupancy by 60 basis points to 90.7%. Now the last few earnings calls we told you that we remain bullish about the senior housing business and continue to believe that that's the spike pocket of oversupply in the industry. Our portfolio once valued entry markets from operators in the modern assets will continue to create tremendous value from shareholders by generating attractive growth with minimal CapEx.", "We see the market taking the data on new supply and applying it broadly across the entire senior market. We think that is a mistake and our performance supports that. We had a long conversation about our strategy around Post skewed and Genesis last quarter. Despite short-term challenges we continue to believe in looking beyond headlines and understand how the skilled nursing industry fits in the continuum of care.", "I am very pleased by the fact the CNF's recommended at 2.8% rate growth last week. You the biggest Medicare increase in seven years. And I think this supports our thesis. May I remind you that our Genesis portfolio is currently traded in high density east coast markets with significant form of profitability? Our last call we also discussed in length our capital allocation framework. Our sustained relative outperformance in the same store in a wide growth is a product of the strategy as well as smart and highly targeted investment discipline.", "Capital allocation is not about when to buy and what not to buy. You may have heard about the acquisition of the site on the corner of 56 Street and Lexington Avenue in New York City that together with Heinz we will build the Welltower, a State-of-the-art largely dementia Alzheimer care facility. The supply of residential care options for the growing elderly population in Manhattan is at best pathetic. For a population of over 1 million people there are only 70 marginal care facilities in Manhattan and I can tell you that they are marginal quality because we used to own them.", "So well tower will be an anchor for in affluent Challenge population has been forced to live in the shadows. The Welltower Will make them part of the larger community which includes billionaires row one block away. Now we are limited by nondisclosure agreement in what I can share with you today we hope to give you more color in the coming months. But what I can tell you is that we didn't sacrifice our return expectations and underwriting criteria to be In Manhattan.", "Frankly I cannot think for more class A Real estate opportunity. What that I'm going to turn the call over to Scott Brinker.", "Scott Brinker", "Okay. Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned. The answer today is very positive. Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets are the same and not all operators are the same. Our portfolio outperformed in the upcycle and today we have seen that continued.", "Each segment turned in a strong quarter with same stories above guidance. That being said, I wasn't to repeat something we said in the past. We don't over emphasize any one quarter good or bad. We think about results overtime, to reduce the noise that can occur over 90 day increments. I will start with the operating portfolio where top line fundamentals were incredibly strong.", "We increased rates 4.2% out sacrificing instances as occupancy increased 60 basis points. The result was 5.5% same store NY growth. CapEx remains modest levels, the age of our properties is a material advantage. It allows us to generate superior economic growth while retaining earnings to fund new investments. Here's some color on each country. Performance in the U.S was outstanding. Same story in the wide growth 5.1%. This is not a case of easy coms as we reported 5.2% growth in Q1 2015.", "Not to mention, an 8% in the first quarter of 2012, 2013 and 2014. An important takeaway is that our core markets extended their long track record of outperformance. It will continue to prioritize these markets with our capital allocation. Turning to Canada, our two partners Riviera and Hartwell delivered strong results despite a sluggish economy. Same-store NOI grew 7.2% last quarter, revenue increased nearly 5% while expense growth was in the mid 3%. It's reminded that seniors housing isn't perfectly correlated with the broader economy. The UK bounced back with 6.1%, same store NOI growth. We're seeing very strong demand for our properties. Revenue grew by more than 5% while expenses increased in the high 4%. By design we're a private pay high-end business in the UK. This gives us the ability to better offset cost pressures like the increased minimum wage. It's equally true in the U.S.", "Next, I want to share an observation on a broader topic. Seniors housing is a private-paid business, the laws of supply and demand apply. That's why we chose to concentrate markets with the ability and willingness to pay. This also happen in the markets which are more difficult to bring new supply. We know that location impacts performance because we've been tracking the data inside our portfolio for years. Our data is very powerful in a sector where the window in the industry level performance is limited to asking grants in occupancy.", "As result, seniors housing remained an inefficient market. Cap rates hardly vary at all based on location. We think that will change as operating data in the industry becomes more transparent. When that happens, our unmatched scale in premier markets will be highly valuable. Turning to outpatient medical. We extended our track record of consistent results with 2.6%, same store NOI growth. We have excellent long-term visibility into this earning stream driven by low rollover in our history of renewing the vast majority of maturing leases.", "Next up is the triple net portfolio. Quarter after quarter including Q1, the blended growth rate in this segment is in the 3% range. The lease structure gives us consistent and growing rental income not withstanding any volatility in the underlying operations. That's especially true of skilled nursing - a business that's long been subject to cycles. Public sentiment is even more volatile than the underlying business and right now, the pendulum has clearly swung toward the negative. I'll contrast to this volatility with skilled nursing valuations in the private market which have been remarkably consistent over time. If there's a prolong disconnect between public and private valuations, we may look to take advantage through selected asset sales.", "Moving to investments. Our activity in Q1 was intentionally low given the environment. We funded $350 million at a 7.7% initial cash yield. As usual, these were done in private negotiations - not auctions - which helps explain the healthy yield. We expanded relationships with leading health systems like Essentia and Adventist and we grew with core partners including Sunrise, Silverado and Signature. Each investment builds on what makes Welltower unique: premier markets, leading operators and modern buildings.", "Our stock has come back a bit since our last earnings call, but this still feels like a time to be highly, highly selective with new investments. Our strong balance sheet and unmatched relationships allows to be flexible if conditions change. As expected, we had $160 million of loan pay offs last quarter including $68 million of Genesis mortgage loans. We'll receive continued repayments from Genesis throughout the year. The bridge to HUD business plan is working as planned, we'll benefit Genesis cash flow and enhance the credit that stands behind our master lease.", "Now here's Scott Estes.", "Scott Estes", "Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start to the year with strong quarterly earnings growth and an increase in our same store NOI forecast reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significant stock market volatility occurred during the first quarter, we remain highly focused on capital allocations. Our current earnings guidance continues to assume that we remain net sellers of assets for the full year. We were also able to enhance our liquidity position during the quarter by opportunistically raising $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt. Importantly, we were able to raise this debt in an overall leverage neutral manner through offsetting debt payoffs and a small amount of equity rate through our DRIP and ATM programs.", "As a result, we had no senior debt maturing until September of 2017 and have only $398 million of secured debt maturing over the remainder of the year. With other $2 billion of current liquidity and a continued focus on capital allocations, our strong financial position allows us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year.", "I'll again begin my detailed remarks with perspective on our first quarter financial performance and a minor change we made to our supplement this quarter. We started off the year with strong quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons generating normalized FFO of $1.13 per share of 9% versus last year and normalized that of $1.01 per share increasing 10% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same store cash NOI growth and the $1.8 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters.", "I'll comment briefly on several of the more noteworthy income statement items this quarter. First our G&A came in at $46 million for the first quarter. This was in-line with our expectations as the first quarter is typically our highest of the year due to the timing of expensing stock compensation grants for certain employees and directors. After a detailed review of our cost this year, we now expect to come in toward the low end of our initial guidance range of $160-$165 million for the full year.", "We recognized impairments of slightly over $14 million in the first quarter. These impairments were a result of slight reductions in the carrying value to relatively small seniors housing portfolios currently held for sale which are now expected to be sold for roughly $167 million in the aggregate. And last we recognize the tax benefit of $1.7 million in the first quarter. Taxes came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter as a result of both tax planning initiatives and several revisions to our TRS taxable income forecast. Based on these revised expectations, we now anticipate incurring quarterly tax expense of approximately $1-$2 million per quarter for the remaining three quarters of the year.", "In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 28th of $0.86 per share, rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.9%. In terms of our supplement, we made only one relatively minor adjustment this quarter as we moved our UK-based private pay outpatient facilities from our hospital category to our outpatient medical category. This was done to reflect the fact that the vast majority of revenue comes from outpatient care and elective short-phase surgeries just like our outpatient surgical facilities in the U.S.", "I'll turn now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. I think the highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity was the unsecured debt offering which closed on March 1. We completed the sale of $700 million of 10-year's senior unsecured notes, priced to yield just over 4.3%. We took advantage of strong investor demands to upsize the transaction from the originally announced size of $400 million. This offering helped extend our way to the average senior note maturity to 9.2 years and as a reminder, this debt offering was not included in our initial earnings guidance for 2016.", "In terms of equity, we issued over a million shares through our DRIP and ATM programs this quarter raising $93 million in proceeds. As Scott mentioned, we generated $116 million of proceeds through loan pay offs which included the $68 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. In term of debt repayments, we repaid all $400 million of the five-year three and five-eight senior unsecured debt that matured on March 15, 2016. And last, we've repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5% while refinancing $75 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. As a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.2 billion available at quarter end, with only $645 million of line borrowings and $356 million in cash on balance sheet.", "Our balance sheet of financial metrics at the end of the first quarter remains strong. As of March 31, our net debts-to-undepreciated book capitalization of 39.6% was consistent with last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 40 basis points to 32.3%. Out net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA sit at 5.7 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.1 times and 3.2 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12.1% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to receive an affirmation of our BBB+ ratings from Fitch last week, and as a reminder we sit at BAA2 BBB flat ratings with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P.", "I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. First, in terms of same store cash NOI growth. Based on our strong first quarter result across our entire portfolio, we're comfortable raising our same store cash NOI guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 3.25%. Where same strength across virtually all of our respective portfolio components, and as Scott mentioned I think it's appropriate to remained focus on the blended forecast for our entire portfolio for the full year.", "In terms of our investment [ph] expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast beyond those closed in the first quarter are an additional $98 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of 7.5%. In terms of development, we expect to fund an additional $363 million on projects currently under construction and expect $283 million of additional development conversions at a blended projected yield of 7.9%.", "Moving to dispositions. We continue to include a total of $1 billion in our forecast. This is comprised of the $116 million of loan payoff during the first quarter. Our current projection of $303 million in proceeds from properties currently held for sale at a blended yield bond sale of 6.5%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and the other potential property sales over the rest of the year.", "Our capital expenditure forecast remains $83 million for 2016 which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $28 million coming from our outpatients' medical portfolio. We typically see a lower CapEx spending during the first quarter, so we do expect the remaining CapEx will be higher during the last three quarters of the year.", "As previously mentioned, our G&A forecast is tracking around $160 million for the full year of this point, and as I also discussed earlier our tax expenses are likely to be about $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining three quarters of the year. So finally as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.", "I think it's important to note that our decision to maintain both our FFO and FAD guidance ranges today was related to the fact that our $700 million bond offering was not in our original forecast, and that the results are still considerable variability around the timing of the approximate $900 million of dispositions that have yet to occur. Most importantly, we continue to focus on making prudent capital allocations decision to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity in the current environment.", "So in conclusion our continued focus on capital allocation this year will continue to prioritize enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage and retaining ample liquidity and greater stability in the broader capital markets environment.", "So at that point, I'll turn it back to Tom for some closing comments.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. So as you've heard we're quite pleased with Q1 results. It's all about the real estate and how we are driving better performance and value from our industry-leading healthcare real estate platform. Our optimism and our ability to sustain this performance is reflected in our decision to raise our 2016 guidance for same store NOI growth to 2.75% to 3.25%.", "And with that I'd like to ask Holly to open up the lines so we can take your questions about rack audits.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord.", "Paul Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Tom DeRosa", "Good morning.", "Paul Morgan", "Can you talk a little bit about kind of what came in above your expectations in the quarter and in terms of the idea portfolio and, I mean, you talked about kind of being able to pass through the kind of the labor cost you've been talking about in the past few quarters and, I mean, is there anything sort of at the market level that gave you the confidence kind of early in the year to boost the guidance or any color there?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well we all have something to say about this, but I would say again, not to be the dead horse, it's about having the best located senior housing assets in their markets with the quality operators. So there is demand to be in these buildings and as the operators are sustaining real increases in expenses largely due to labor, they can pass it along because there is demand to be in those buildings. I think it's that one of the simple, probably the most simple answer I can give you. Scott, any other thing you want to say?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, Paul on the out performance, really three drivers of the business, operating expenses and those were up in the low to mid force, sort of where we expected and the other two drivers are occupancy and rate, and we out performed them, so we were expecting occupancy to be roughly flat to up slightly for the year instead we're up 60 basis points and rate growth at 4.2% was quite a bit above where we were projecting.", "Paul Morgan", "I mean is there kind of color, you said it's not really kind of a regional thing or in terms of kind of maybe the parts of your portfolio that are exposed to supply kind of hang in there better or kind of more than just sort of a macro perspective?", "Scott Estes", "The color is that the majority of our portfolio is located in, at least in the U.S. in six core markets, and those markets continue to outperform by a very meaningful factor. So from quarter to quarter it might be two times, it might be five times which was what we saw in the first quarter and those are the markets that we've prioritized for years and we'll continue to prioritize. So that doesn't mean you'll see SP 100% concentrated in six U.S. markets, we like some level of diversification. But frankly, we just see much better supply demand over long periods of time in these core markets, and we've established partnerships with the operators that essentially control the markets. So a company like Sunrise that has 30 plus buildings in Southern California, that's tough to replicate when it takes four to five years to see approvals to build a new project.", "So we're very selective going back years and who we chose to do business with and which markets they had a concentration. You're seeing the benefit of the discipline we have had just fell out of those marginal markets over time. I mean that is paying dividend today. You know for a rate that's a difficult thing to do. But our shareholders have been on that ride with us now for a number of years. We've sold a lot of assets, we've acquired a lot of assets, and it's all about having the data and the discipline to allocate capital into the best markets and de-emphasize the markets that just will not perform over time. That's what we do. To get one of the keys to this company's strategy and its success.", "Tom DeRosa", "And one final point I think it's important to add to in your question was I guess largely based on seniors housing, but I think it's important to note that out performance this quarter was beyond just the seniors housing portfolio at least in relation to our initial guidance. And our MOB performance was above our initial guidance for the full year, as well as the post same-store NOI. So we saw it really across the board this quarter.", "Paul Morgan", "So you think that's sort of equal contributors to the boost in the guidance?", "Tom DeRosa", "We're not quantifying it in particular, and we think about it as the whole portfolio for the whole year.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Good morning, thank you. I had a couple of questions on your same store numbers on Page 29 of your supplemental. Are the Canadian and U.K. figures on a constant currency basis?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes.", "John Kim", "So when I look at the same store NOI per unit in Pounds in the U.K. it was 21,000 per unit this year, last year at this time it was about 27,000 per unit. So it's a bit decline on the per unit basis but you had a 6% increase in the same store NOI in the region. I know some of these is probably mixed, but I just wanted to know why that bit of discrepancy.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, John, it's Scott Brinker. We did a big acquisition in August of 2014 called Critiswa [ph] and those are a very nice private-pay properties, but at a much lower price point than the Legacy-Sunrise portfolio that comprised the prior year's numbers. So that's what you're seeing.", "John Kim", "Okay. Do you know what the same store per unit was if you're like at a comparable basis this year versus last year?", "Scott Brinker", "Can you repeat the question? I'm not sure what you're asking is, John.", "John Kim", "Just the same store pool from last year to this year on a per unit basis. I could follow up later.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. Are you asking about NOI unit?", "John Kim", "Yes.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, we might just follow up with you. I don't have that handy.", "Scott Estes", "Yes and U.S. dollars is going to be impacted by the changing currency rates from then to now, too. So let us follow up with you later.", "John Kim", "Sure, no problem. And Scott Estes, I just had a question on your balance sheet. There's a fairly large receivable balance this quarter of $693 million? What is this in relation to?", "Scott Estes", "That number has actually been pretty consistent over time. It has, boy, there's lot of different items in there - value of derivatives, receivables, intangibles are all in there and it's actually been in that $600-$700 million area pretty consistently for the last couple of years.", "John Kim", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey, good morning, all.", "Scott Estes", "Hey, Chad.", "Scott Brinker", "Hello.", "Chad Vanacore", "Okay. Just a thing about your shop portfolio, can you actually go into the buildup of that? I've seen you're 2% in a quarter to 3% in a quarter percent right now for the full year? That's going to be on rate to assuming not much occupancy changed? Are you assuming some occupancy decline as well?", "Scott Brinker", "Chad, it's Scott Brinker. We're not really changing the guidance that we gave for the data portfolio. We've increased the company's overall same store growth projection for the year and that's of course driven in part by the out-performance on the operating portfolio that we're trying to keep people away from being overly focused on every single segment quarter-to-quarter. This is a portfolio and it out-performed in the first quarter and that's why we raised the guidance. Your question is do we still get about the operating portfolio at the end of the day? The answer is yes, we have much better revenue growth driven by occupancy and rate and we were expecting the beginning of the year. We don't see that changing overnight, but we also don't see a need to continue to update every quarter what the guidance is going to be.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, Scott. I would have expected a leap year expenses to eat in the shop margins a bit. How should we think about that OpEx growth in second quarter compared to the first quarter?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, it did increase operating expenses. Compensation in particular because a lot of the employees are hourly. So our rough guess is the compensation was up about 100 basis points more than it otherwise would have been because of the extra day. That being said, some of our operators charge by the day rather than by the month, so we do get some benefit on revenue.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. Then you had some commentary on the bridge loan genesis. Could you remind me how much was repaid and how much remains outstanding?", "Scott Brinker", "Sure. We have two only secured first mortgage loans with Genesis that they used to complete two mergers last year. In total, they had about $500 million of original principal balance and they've now repaid roughly $120 million. So the balance today is around $370 to $380 million.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. And then just staying with Genesis for a second. It looks like coverage just improved marginally, although if I recall, Genesis had a weak fourth quarter. What do you suppose is driving that sequential improvement?", "Scott Brinker", "Well, remember we report first of all in a trailing 12-month basis, but also one quarter in arrears.", "Chad Vanacore", "That's what we're talking about, fourth quarter\u2026", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, exactly. So they had a week, fourth quarter of 2014 as well and at least some of the issues that they referred to in their fourth quarter earnings release did not impact our portfolio like all the bad debt adjustments they booked for skilled health. That doesn't impact us and reality is we own the best assets and I think we're maybe at least bit less impacted by some of the head winds that they're feeling elsewhere, but there's no question that the operating environment is a bit challenging. So I wouldn't be surprised if coverage was under at least a bit of pressure over the next couple of quarters.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. That would be it for me for now. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors.", "Kevin Tyler", "Good morning, guys.", "Scott Brinker", "Kev?", "Kevin Tyler", "Scott, you've mentioned earlier that senior housing cap rates has been consistent or roughly the same for high and low barrier markets. But are you seeing them up more broadly and then is there maybe a little bit of a faster creep higher in the lower barrier versus the higher barrier markets?", "Scott Brinker", "Hey, Kevin. We haven't really seen senior housing cap rates move at all. It feels like it has been almost a year now where a lot of buyers including us have been trying to push for higher cap rates. But for the most part, especially in auctions without much success and at least the packages we see, the sellers and the brokers don't seem to reduce their expectations if they're trying to sell product that's outside of our core market. So you've not seen us prioritize or allocate our capital for those types of investments because we just don't feel like historically or even today you really get the yield premium that you should to make an investment in those markets.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe to follow on that point on the disposition side. It certainly seems like senior housing be a good place of cap rates of health firms to potentially take some chips off the table. But outside of that, I know there are some debt repayment that's coming through, but where do you see the best value today on the sale side?", "Scott Brinker", "It's probably in skilled nursing. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that despite sometimes wild volatility in the public market, private market valuations and skilled nursing have been remarkably consistent. I've been doing this for 15 years now and it feels like cap rates and the skilled nursing space have hardly moved at all. Maybe inside of a 50-basis point ban plus or minus year, after year, after year, notwithstanding what's happening with investment environment, or publicly traded stocks and today, skilled nursing is only 15% or so of that overall company, so it's hard to say how much it impacts our stock price, but based on the number of questions we get about it, I would say it's a very big and very large negative impact and yet, we see transactions in the private marketplace including very recently at prices that are quite attractive. Really no different than a year ago or two years ago when the public markets loved skilled nursing. I could see a stake in advantage of that if these conditions persist.", "Tom DeRosa ", "They're more inbound calls regarding our interest in selling skilled nursing today than in seniors housing. I think there are a lot of investors out there in the private markets as Scott has said that are seeing the headlines, seeing how some of the misinformation that has been put out there has created some tremendous volatility and they're looking to take advantage of that, or at least it has raised the idea of buying skilled nursing to a higher position in the queue for how they might deploy capitals. So it's an interesting time, a bit of a paradox about how the public market is viewing the sector and how the private market is viewing it.", "Scott Brinker", "Kevin, I agree on senior housing as well. Two of the assets that are in the health for sale bucket are in very much secondary, if not, rural markets and if the sales proceed as planned, we'll be selling those for less than a six cap on rent. We do still feel like this is maybe a good time to exit some non-core senior housing assets as well and the same applies to medical office where we've got about $100 million of assets held for sale on the balance sheet today. Again, at least in our mind very attractive cap rates, relative to markets and asset quality.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. I appreciate the thorough color you got. It's helpful. And then last quick one for me - on the development side, definitely interesting project in New York and looking forward hearing more there, it sounds like there is not a whole lot you can share. But looking for a second at development at senior housing in the UK and I know it dates largely back to some prior arrangements, but as those properties get delivered, how are they performing? Are yields consistent with prior underwriting and for the newly purpose-built product there, is that performing well in today's market?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Kevin. There are really three buckets: we have Triple Net leases with Avery who's now one of our Top 10 operators and they've thought out-performed expectations on everything they've done whether it's the acquisitions or all the new development we funded. We've also got a large development pipeline in arrangement with Signature, which is Tom [ph], ex-President of Sunrise, and they have far outperformed all expectations. We have a mortgage loan program with them where we put roughly 60% of the capital into the development and they fund the bounce with equity and then we have a fixed price purchase option on the building after it opens and those have been remarkably successful and we have quite a few more under way. All of those in the greater London market.", "And then the third bucket is with Gracewell, which was essentially taken over by Sunrise and those have been a bit below the underwriting expectations. I think Sunrise, who's to my point earlier, to John's question, it's just a lower price point than Sunrise is accustomed to operate in the UK and I think they're still trying to figure out what the right cost structure is for that lower revenue building. It's still mostly private-paid, but it is a bit of a different building. So the NOI on those, Kevin, has been a bit lower than we had expected.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, thanks.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Kevin.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Scott Brinker", "Good morning.", "Jordan Sadler", "First question, just more of like a clarification on page eight of the stuff, there is - in the quality indicators, the quality mixed days on a post-acute portfolio - is that just at typo, it says 37.4%? Because I think it was at 57.4% last quarter and a year before. Or is there something else going on there?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, we changed it from being based on revenue to being based on days so that we could get a better industry comparable.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. And then separately regarding New York City, is there anything that you guys can elaborate on in terms of the size of the investment or maybe future opportunities, structure at a JV or is that all?", "Tom DeRosa", "Not at this time. No, we're not at the liberty to tell you really anything more than what I said, or what you've been able to get out of the press.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Can you maybe also just then give us a little bit of color on the acquisition market and the opportunities you're able to successfully source? The couple hundred million this year so far and just curious about what you're seeing in terms of the landscape opportunities on the senior housing side or otherwise?", "Tom DeRosa", "We're seeing very good opportunities from our existing family of operators who still have assets that are very attractive in very attractive markets.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, for the most part in the first quarter, those were not only privately-negotiated with the existing clients, but in most cases they were sort of purchased options, exercised on newly developed assets. For example, signature building in London, the Silverado building in Austin Texas, these are properties that we did not put all the development capital into the project - in some cases very little and then we alongside with our JV partner have the right to buy those either when they open or in this case when they stabilize. It's an example of how we build an attractive acquisition pipeline at favorable prices, but also great modern real estate and good markets rather than what you find on the next auction of assets in Houston.", "Jordan Sadler", "Is it conceivable that that's repeatable at that pace?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. It would be hard for us not to do from $200 million or so of acquisitions. We certainly could if the circumstances required us to because for the most part, these are purchase options, not purchase obligations. But at these types of yields, we thought these made sense given the quality of the markets and assets even we are stuck in the low 60s, now that we're back to the high 70s, they clearly are hugely profitable.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott Brinker", "Sure.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Thanks. Good morning and good quarter for sure. Tom, you said misinformation. What would you say were the one, two or three top components of these misinformation you referred to? Because these things are happening. There are changes going on, there is bundling happening, there is some question marks about how post-acute will be utilized in the future. Where do you think people have gotten it wrong in your communications with both the sale side and the buy side?", "Tom DeRosa", "I'd say in a couple of places. I'd say that you may have seen that there were some wholesale, something of our stock based on maybe misunderstandings about things like RAC audits and if you like us to go through a discussion about that, we're happy to do it. We could do it on here, we could do it off line, but I think there has been a lot - there was misinformation earlier in the year about Genesis that was out there. There was a research before that frankly was just plain out wrong, that caused a lot of activity in our shares.", "I think the supply issue in senior housing which has been a huge overhand on our stock, I think has been overplayed. I think there's wrong information out there, Rich. We disagree we have opportunities. People call us, we are happy to discuss anything, we show up at lots of conferences, we're there, we're telling our story, we're trying to be as clear as possible, we're a very transparent company, Rich, we don't play hide the ball and we're happy to address any questions people have about the skilled nursing industry, about RAC audits, about supply in seniors housing, about where we think healthcare is going - I don't know what else to say.", "Rich Anderson", "As far as the RAC audits go, isn't it true there is a treasure chest map or whatever by which they can work off of with some of the things that have happened at other firms not in your network? Isn't there at least some risk there that this revitalization of RAC audits might actually be a little bit more of a risk this time around than in past years?", "Tom DeRosa", "Okay. Let's take a couple of points here. The concept has been around for 10 years. They were implemented under the Tax Relief and Healthcare Act of 2006 and there are some notion out there that the sniff sector has not been impacted by RAC audits. But if you look at CMS data, almost $86 million of overpayment was collected in 2014. The CMS is limited, the recovery auditor looked back for period of six months from the date of service for patient status reviews as of May 15, 2015 and I think most importantly is that our operator are prepared for this. They have rigorous compliance and documentation procedures. Medical necessity is established with a physician at admission, a care plan is established with a patient and therapy team, and therapy encounters are thoroughly documented.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay.", "Tom DeRosa", "So this is not a random process on the part of our operators. It's one of the reasons why we're very concentrated with Genesis because Genesis has the scale and resources to invest in compliance procedures that help them operate in an environment where they are principally being paid by Medicare and Medicaid.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, so - don't be mad at me, I'm not in order. So\u2026", "Scott Estes", "I'm always mad at you, Rich. This is nothing new. Rich, I just want some more additional context on the rack audits because it's, I don't know maybe it's the medicine name that has everybody all worked up. We're not trying to suggest that it's not an issue, it's just we're trying to put some context around it. Because today as Tom mentioned, roughly $100 million of overpayments were essentially given back to the Medicare program for skilled nursing. Right? That's on a $30 billion denominator. So it's 0.3%, even if that number increases by seven times, right? I mean seven times, it's still just the equivalent of the Medicare inflation update that CMS is proposing for next year.", "So I mean it's not like this is going to bankrupt the industry, and for operators that have great documentation it will have absolutely no impact other than an occasional headache, and it's at the facility level, Rich. This is not something that is levy, there is no, again we don't have a crystal ball but it's not our understanding that they will pick an operator and saying we're doing a rack audit, cut down the hatches we're coming through. I mean this is on a facility basis. It's hard for us to conceit. Our crystal ball is not as good as yours, but it's hard for us to conceit that the entire value of our net portfolio is subject to the dramatic decline in value because of rack audits.", "Rich Anderson", "No, I'm just saying if something, Genesis happens that pivots from preliminary situation to something more defined, that's a headline risk that people at least should be underwriting in their line of thinking. That's all I'm saying. Now can I just quickly switch\u2026", "Scott Estes", "No, we want to talk more about this. No, no, no, come on ask me something else about rack audits.", "Rich Anderson", "I want to ask you something about Genesis. Is it true that coverage this year, at least to some degree, is getting a boost from some of the events in their own recent history in terms of investment activity and that some of that will wing down over future years as the skilled gets merge in and everything else. Is that a fair statement about Genesis and the coverage this year?", "Scott Estes", "They're definitely benefitting from some of the synergies on the acquisitions, they're benefitting from the refinancing of the bridge loans, are there roughly 10%, or is in the low fours, that's a big difference for them. But longer term we actually think the story is very positive. I mean our master lease is 187 properties and that matures in 16 years. They have a lot of individual leases or smaller leases that mature either next year or in the next five years that frankly have very low coverage and either they'll reject them or they will substantially renegotiate the rent downwards. So I think there's a lot of those types of opportunities they could certainly exit some of the lower quality buildings that they've acquired and we support them in that effort, their optimization opportunities in the assets that they acquired because they are premier operator. And if you think long term with bundling, I mean the challenge right now is that hospitals and managed care players are already starting to reduce admissions to skilled nursing, but I don't think they really started the process of targeting the best in class properties in each market. And when that happens I think there actually is an opportunity for Genesis to outperform and take market share, but we're just not in that phase of the funding roll out yet.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, and let me just stay on, thanks for that Scott. And for the final question for me on hospitals. Are you seeing them smalling down their playing field with regards to their relationship with snips, are they cutting back and kind of isolating their relationships post to Q wise, do you have evidence of that and how do you avoid being involved in that side of the business that maybe some of the failed situations on the skilled side?", "Scott Estes", "Rich, at least in our world we see no evidence of that, and let me give you an example of something that we recently saw. The Cleveland Clinic is building a new hospital in Avon, Ohio, about 40 miles West of Cleveland, and this hospital which, actually the project looks a lot like what we did in Voorhees, New Jersey. It's actually going to have a skilled nursing facility attached to the hospital, and Cleveland Clinic isn't running that facility. There's another operator who's going to be running that facility. I believe it's Select Medical. That to me is a good indication of where the future might be going and it validates the fact that the sector is not going away. When you have one of the finest hospital systems in the world now putting skilled nursing, not only on their campus but actually attached to the building. So I think that more and more from our conversations with the leading health systems. We don't spend a lot of time with the non-leading health systems. So all I can tell is you the view from talking to the major players who will survive in the hospital sector that they want to see a strong skilled nursing industry. They know it is part of the future and part of their ability to manage profitably under and ever changing reimbursement environment.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, I'll yield the floor. Thanks very much for the color.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Karin Ford with MUFJ.", "Tom DeRosa", "Hey, Karin.", "Karin Ford", "Hi, good morning. Just going back to your comments on the quality of the real estate and the performance of the senior housing portfolio. Are you seeing any divergence in the performance between the shop portfolio and the underlying fundamentals you're seeing in the triple net portfolio?", "Tom DeRosa", "I think we can say everything was pretty strong across the board.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, Karin, we studied this data for - it feels like years before we made the decision to fill into the days structure six years ago because we do see differences in performance by operator, by market. And I think that's a big reason why you see certain operators in the day portfolio and certain operators in the Triple Net portfolio because our typical increase their in Triple Net is around 3%, and if anything you've seen payment coverage is unfortunately declined a bit or it stayed flat which suggest the underlying NOI of the properties only going 3% and clearly we've done a lot better than that in our [ph]. So there is a divergence. It gets to the point I was making earlier about there is variation and performance by market, by operator, and I don't think that market fully appreciates that yet.", "We're trying to tell the story, I think a longer time history will be helpful. But we have seen that in our data. The industry data just isn't there for people to see. There is an even reliable source of NOI in the industry. I mean, I hate to say it NIC is doing a great job of trying to change that. But as of today the best you can get is occupancy and asking rent at the national level. I mean, man you're talking about a lot of room to go and you compare that with 15 to 20 years of data in our portfolio. That is an excruciating detail for us to look at and help make investment decisions. We feel like it's a huge proprietary advantage that we have.", "Karin Ford", "Thanks, and coverage in the Triple Net senior housing portfolio notch down just a couple of basis points here for the last few quarters. It's down to one. Any concern with the 3% escalators and the supply pressures that that could, a coverage could go materially lower from the one-one level?", "Tom DeRosa", "Triple Net coverage is a bit lower than we like. It frankly is, for the most part driven by one operator. So it was one-one five two years ago, now it's one-one zero, all of that driven by a particular operator unfortunately. So the rest of the portfolio has helped that propel. But the reality is it's the main reason you haven't seen us do a lot of Triple Net lease acquisitions in recent years because I think there is a mindset by some, and this is going back a couple of years that if you could put something in the Triple Net lease it was a low-risk investment, right? So rental coverage, high escalators and, life is great, probably release looks fantastic and it only took sometimes a year for people to realize it. If the asset quality isn't very good notwithstanding that lease structure which on the surface seems to provide protection for the landlord at the end of the day it's a very risky investment. In our every view it always been that the higher risk investment is actually those Triple Net leases with low asset coverage and low asset quality in comparison to doing red [ph] which granted has some quarter-to-quarter volatility in NOI but overtime if you're in the great assets in the right markets, we think that's the lowest risk investment.", "Karin Ford", "Thanks for the color. And then just last question for me. Did you guys push through 3.5% rent escalator on Genesis in April?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, so this is the last of the 3.5% escalators. Next April it goes down to 3%.", "Karin Ford", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thanks for taking the questions and congrats guys on a strong quarter. Just on the red [ph] side, so one of your peers reported that in some of the markets they saw a decline, single-digit decline and their same store NOI while in markets like New York it nearly, it was quite positive, not surprisingly. Just wondering if you can give us some color as to what the range was within your U.S. portfolio.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, I would be to Vik. I mean, we saw a particular strength in Southern California, New York, New Jersey, Washington D.C., these are core markets with NOI growth in the high single digits, and I'll contrast with markets like Chicago and Atlanta where unfortunately we don't have a bid presence but we do have some assets, and in large part because of either weak economies or a lot of new supply, the NOI growth was a bit negative.", "Scott Estes", "Yes, we just always try to sell out of the market that where it's easy to bring new supply. I mean Scott said we do have some exposure, Vik, but in our portfolio it was because of the disposition program that is not exposing as much to those non-core markets. Yes, I mean the resupply is an interesting in this data point, Vik, almost half of the new supply in the U.S. is in six specific markets. I mean that's astounding right? Almost half of new supplies in six markets when you really think about, and only 8% of our NOI in the operating portfolio is in those six markets. So that means 92% of our NOI is in all of the other markets where frankly in a lot of them there is either no new supply or not much, so it really is a market specific issue. We keep saying it and now you're starting to see it in the results I think.", "Vikram Malhotra", "No, they make sense. In the U.K. or maybe even in the U.S. is there a timing difference between when sort of these minimum wages take effect or the increases take effect versus when you sort of get the rent bumps. I'm just trying to see if there's a difference in the U.K. where we see the minimum wages go up 10%.", "Tom DeRosa", "Vik, it's hard to say with a lot of specificity, but for the most part you increase wages on January 1 so you have to recognize that higher expense on day one of the year and with rental rates, at least with existing residence you try to increase rates on January 1 but half of our portfolio, the operators increased rates on the anniversary dates, so they breathe in over the year. So when we, again this is in black or white, but in general you have to suffer due to higher wage growth immediately while the rate growth would blend more over the course of the year.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, and then just last one on the nursing side, wondering if you looked at recent data, see a master list on readmission to hospitals. Sort of in talking to different stakeholders it seems like that's going to be an important metric in determining who maybe preferred vendors or who may see more volume. It's interesting when you look at the story, things which I know there are several components, Genesis being sort of average versus the U.S. but it actually screen very well on the readmission side. Just wondering if you dug into it or have any thoughts around that as to how that could be a future differentiator.", "Tom DeRosa", "We do think that the quality operators in the skilled sector will again have the strategy and program built to minimize readmissions. I think that if you have a random portfolio of mom and pop operators who may be very good at what they do, it's just from our perspective it would be difficult to understand if they do have the structure in place to be a more viable partner to the acute care hospitals. So and we just think that again because of its scale, because of its program strategy, because of technology, we think Genesis is in a pretty good position.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Tom DeRosa", "Okay.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Yes, good morning everyone. Let me also add my congratulations on a really good quarter. Two quick ones for me. First one, Mr. Estes, when I take a look at guidance I understand that the debt raise wasn't in there. Could you just give me a sense of how much dilution that's causing to your guidance number so we can get a better sense of just how better operating results, a really kind of driving growth?", "Scott Estes", "The shortest answer would probably be about $0.03. We had $400 million of the March debt being repaid in our forecast, so the $700 million we raised was $300 million in excess of that, and you think about that for the ten months of the year that it was out there is roughly $0.03. So I think that roughly matched some of the benefits we see from the strength of the same store NOI growth and the performance of the rest of the portfolio.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay, that's helpful. And then Tom or the other Scott, I think earlier on in the conversation there was a comment around Genesis that you thought comfortable where things were heading, there was probably some misunderstanding about the company's fourth quarter results but you also added the statement that you do expect some pressure on coverage going forward, could you just talk a little bit about that and where you kind of assume that's going to be coming from?", "Scott Brinker", "It's Scott, Tayo, I mean the skilled nursing business goes up and down. It's the most difficult business that we invest in, that's why we use the Triple Net lease structure. Genesis has been able to maintain payment coverage the last four years despite the 3.5% escalator which is a testament to their quality, but the environment probably is getting more difficult not easier at least for the foreseeable future. It's certainly nice to have the 2.1% Medicare increase, but there are well-document headwinds on the skilled side of the business as well as occupancy with length of stay. So it wouldn't surprise us if coverage ticked down, but keep in mind where we're starting from, right. The corporate coverage is around 1.3, the facility level coverage is around 1.6, before management fee are in the higher 1.2 after management fees. So and there's a lot of cushion there. We're not talking about will it pay the rent, we're talking about what coverage fee 1.24 or 1.28, and at the end of the day four basis points doesn't really impact well, tell her a whole lot other than a lot of question. They pay the rent, if it was substantially lower payment coverage then I'd be really worried about one or two basis points.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay, that's helpful. And if I just indulge with one more. Just seeing on the skilled nursing side of things, I mean do you know if any of these bundling programs have actually reached a conclusion yet and if there's anything that be gleaned from any of them in regards to where sniff reimbursement maybe heading?", "Tom DeRosa", "I don't think we know a lot about that yet.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay.", "Tom DeRosa", "It's an early base.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Just so I would ask in case something had come through. Thank you very much.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tayo.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "Hi, thanks. Scott Estes, just to go back to the earnings impact this year. How are your loan payoffs impacting guidance and any loan payoffs coming in? Are they in general coming in as expected or they're being repaid, would you say a little early?", "Scott Estes", "No, we had, Genesis is going through the process throughout the year so we had a pretty balanced repayment expectation and I think they would probably stay the same so I would characterize that, Todd, as in-line relatively balanced throughout the year where they should make pretty good head way on the - it's still remaining outstanding as Scott Brinker mentioned, I think it's $372 million currently still outstanding for us.", "Todd Stender", "Any broader initiatives to call in loans? Just to clean up any of the credit issues that happen in your portfolio? Any expectations that the loan book will actually decline as the percentage of assets?", "Scott Estes", "It definitely will, mostly because of the Genesis mortgage loans which is almost half the outstanding balance. We had at least $50 million of loan payments in the first quarter beyond Genesis and I can think of a couple of others that are in process in the balance of the year, but it's not because of credit issues, or because we're calling the loans. They're just being repaid as expected.", "Todd Stender", "That's helpful. And just this take with you, Scott Brinker. You touched briefly on the Silverado asset you purchased in the quarter. Can you talk about what the least expectations were, what they actually were? Looks like the facility opened in 2014. Just wanted to see and get a sense of what the stabilization period was and any anecdotal evidence? You can talk about of how their strategy is performing in the taxes markets.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. That's a property that they built with mostly third party capitals. So we didn't invest any money into that project, but Silverado had a purchase option that included what ultimately was a very large promoted interest as well that collectively, we purchased that property, the typical Sunrise communities around 70 units and it would typically take around two years to fill, but they were able to lease that building much quicker than the expectations, so we exercised our purchase option early and because of the promoted interest, the cap rate would have done even more attractive than what we reflected in the earnings release, which just sort of ignores the benefits of that.", "Todd Stender", "Great, thank you.", "Scott Brinker", "Sure.", "Operator", "[Operator instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi. Thanks for the time. Just hoping to talk a little bit about the senior housing Triple Net portfolio. You talked about Atlanta and Chicago being at risk from supplier, just softer markets in general. Can you help us frame how Triple Net portfolio is exposed to new supply? Is there a certain percentage of the portfolio that maybe is generating that negative NOI that is a very small amount of portfolio?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Juan. We haven't done the level of analysis on the Triple Net portfolio that you see in the supplemental for the operating portfolio. As a general comment, the Triple Net assets tend to be in more secondary markets, so we don't have the same emphasis on really the prime, premier, metro markets and as a result, they probably are a bit more impacted by new supply. Now, we don't have a huge presence in the six markets I mentioned, even in the Triple Net portfolio. We just don't have a huge presence in Houston, or Dallas, or Chicago, or Atlanta. We have assets, it's just not a big concentration.", "But most of the performance decline that you've seen in that portfolio is really driven by one operator who unfortunately is a pretty big percentage of our pool who has gone through some integration issues and hopefully that situation is now right-sized and their coverages can start to pick up again.", "Juan Sanabria", "And I noticed you have - it looks like three different master leases with EBITDAR coverage below 0.95 times. Pretty small, but I noticed they're not necessarily targeted for dispositions. Any reason why?", "Scott Brinker", "That really just means they're not actively for sale. Fair to say that anything on that page could be a candidate for disposition. These aren't big portfolios by any means. It looks like the biggest one is around $10 million plus or minus at annual rent. We only have about $25 million in the outreach of the year so these are very small portfolios. I don't think they'll move much one way or the other.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Just a last question for me. On the portfolio, how should we think about the year-over-year growth as you go throughout the year? I know you've wanted to get away from the quarterly discussion, but is the second quarter tough for a comp, or is it set up as well as the first quarter ended up to be?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. One of our best guess is that the second quarter may be the weakest of the four quarters this year. In February we said as a general statement that we expected growth to pick up throughout the balance of the year. The first quarter surprised us in a positive way, but at least for now we'll maintain our expectation that the second half of the year should be a bit better, which means that Q2 may slow down a bit.", "Tom DeRosa", "And it's also important to know that the first quarter was not an easy comp. I think there are some perception out there that because of a more severe flu and weather last year that that was an easy comp and that was not the case actually.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Market.", "Michael Carroll", "Yes, thanks. With regards to the potential asset sales, Scott, you mentioned in your comments, would this be over the billion-dollar guidance and with regard to those sales, I guess with the skilled nursing facilities, are there any focus on operators? Would it be with Genesis, or Mainstreet? Or do you have different operators you would look at selling?", "Scott Brinker", "On the last question, I'd say all options on the table and we're in a favorable position and that we don't have to sell anything. If again the private market describes you a value or something that's much higher than what we feel the public market is valuing it up, we'd be happy to sell it and because with our landlord position, we've got a ton of flexibility to do what we want with these assets. So we're looking at everything, but we haven't targeted one specific operator to say that they're first on the list. Let's see what the market bares, let's see how the staff performs. We want to be as flexible as possible here.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And would that sales be over the $1 million guidance that is provided?", "Scott Brinker", "It could be. Again, depends on what happens over the next couple of months. We're looking at a lot of things to hopefully create shareholder value.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then Tom or Scott, with regard to the RAC audit, how cumbersome are those audits for the operators? Does it take a lot of their time and will it cost them to I guess focus on the audits versus operations?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, it's hard to answer that because we don't think there's a lot of evidence that our operators have sustained a lot of RAC audits and I think if you're thinking they're buses driving around the country with RAC auditors that are descending on skilled nursing facilities, well then it might be cumbersome. But that's not what we're aware of. Who knows?", "Scott Estes", "Michael, they also have documentation that's off the charts. It's not like they need to increase the level of internal audit, or documentation that they do. They live in a regulated world and it's really no changing practice. So I don't think it's going to have any material impact on what they actually do day-to-day in terms of active property level. They may have to start providing information to these RAC auditors and maybe that's a bit more time-consuming than have some added cost, but the real issue is are you properly documenting the service? Do you have a physician order that supports the services being provided and are documentation on those important topics is at least in our estimation best in class?", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. There's not a lot of information on the RAC audits out there right now. Do we know when they actually started, or if they're ramping up, or if they're just preparing? Do we have any information on that?", "Tom DeRosa", "The only information we have is what you have heard publicly and the information that we do have is that our operators provide these services within the guidelines established. So now we have no idea if on a property-specific level that if some - if one of our operators is doing something that would raise suspicions by a rack audit, but we'll have to wait and see. It is something again, we want to remind you, this has been around for a while. Whenever you're on a regulated business, there's always the additional oversight to make sure that there's no funny business. So again, we don't know specifically, but we don't expect that this is going to be a major problem. Anything can happen, but again, this is on the property specific basis. We have no knowledge that thousands of people have been retained to go out and audit nursing homes now. That would be very costly at a time when there isn't money for that. But please, if you hear something, I'd ask you to give us a call because we might be able to help you out to understand it better.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.", "Operator", "And at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's first quarter 2016 Welltower earnings conference call.

My name is Kaila, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeffrey Miller", "Thank you, Kaila. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Welltower's second quarter 2016 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained.

Tom.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Thanks Jeff. Our strong results this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments. From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6% and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Scotts will take you through a deeper dive on what is driving our performance. But first, let me give you the high points. Overall same-store NOI for all of Welltower was up 3.3% versus last year, this is largely being driven by the performance of our senior housing business.", "The senior housing operating portfolio registered 4% same-store NOI growth versus a year. Despites the industry confirms about new supply and vague expense growth the Welltower family of operators were able to pass along on average, 4% rate increase, while increasing occupancy by 100 basis points. These results can only be realized by from owning A quality real-estate in A quality markets, that is the Welltower story. A key differentiator for Welltower is that 90% of our revenue is from private pay sources.", "You should expect to see our private pay percentage increase through this year. However, we also had a strong history of managing the credit exposure to government reimbursement for our shareholders, so regarding our Genesis assets, we believe Genesis is continuing to strengthen its business platform and financial position. I can only speak to our Genesis portfolio and I can tell you that the operating performance of our portfolio improved during the quarter.", "We are pleased to see a strong final Medicare rate increase, the DOJ settlement that was announced by Genesis yesterday and both Welltower and Genesis shareholders should be pleased to have some clarity around there capital structure. This goes a long way towards adding some ballets to the Genesis story and we believe position for Genesis management team to focus their time and energy on the future of their business.", "Speaking of the future, we are pleased to announce the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition this morning. This is an ideal strategic acquisition for us. It allows us to go deeper into two important core markets, significantly solidifying our number one market share in Los Angelis, gaining the number one position in San Francisco and which by the way adds to our already number one market position in New York, Boston and Seattle, fives of the Section-56 corner markets in the United States.", "The Vintage portfolio will be mange by Sunrise, Silverado and SRG. Three of our operators with a strong position in these markets. The Vintage scene has built a great business with some irreplaceable assets. We expect rebranding and connecting these assets to the brooder Welltower senior care network will enhance their value and capture significant upside our shareholders. I do hope you reviewed the Vintage portfolio side presentation available on our website.", "Our strategy of building scale in A quality real estate in the leading core markets in the U.S., UK and Canada is driving the excellent results, we are reporting today. Our ability to bolt-on a large acquisition like Vintage underscores the dominance of the Welltower franchise and enhances our ability to continue to drive best in class operating results and growth for our shareholders.", "Now Scott Brinker will give you a closer look at our operating performance.", "Scott Brinker", "Thank you Tom. Welltower is known for discipline around high quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter with 3.3% same-store NOI growth. Just above the high-end of annual guidance, the operating portfolio led the way. Same-store NOI grew 4%, rental rates were up 3.8% and occupancy increased 100 basis points all were above expectations.", "To-date, we are proving resilient to new supply and higher labor costs. Our diversification by operator service type and geography is a key attribute. An example is that same-store NOI in Canada last quarter increased 7.1% outstanding work by our partners at Hartwell and Riviera. Their performance offset more modest growth in the UK. Two years ago, the roles were reversed showing the benefit of diversification.", "By design, more than half of our Canadian NOI comes from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa, the four largest markets in Canada. Over the past few years our properties in these four core markets have produced five plus percent annual NOI growth far above any comparative benchmark. We have number one market share in several of these markets and intend to go deeper overtime.", "Same-store NOI in the U.S. grew 3.5% last quarter. We continue to see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets. Those being Southern and Northern California, Seattle, Boston, New York, New Jersey and D.C., Northern Virginia. Including the Vintage acquisition, our six core markets will account for nearly 60% of the NOI in our U.S. operating portfolio. We have always liked the supply and demand fundamentals in these markets and they have rewarded us with consistently higher rate growth, better margins and same-store NOI growth in the mid to high single-digits.", "We very deliberately formed partnerships with the leading operators in these markets, including Sunrise, Silverado, Belmont Village, SRG, Benchmark, Epic, Merrill Gardens and Brandywine. Their operating expertise helps our real estate avoid commodity status. They make our market position even more defensible. Including the Vintage acquisition we'll have number one market share in five of these six core markets and number two share in the sixth and yet our market share is only in the mid-teens living plenty of room for growth.", "The UK operating portfolio produced 2.7% same-store NOI growth last quarter. As expected, labor costs are headwind, to-date thanks to our premium locations we've had pricing power to offset most of those costs. Half of our NOI in the UK comes from the RIDEA structure and the other half is triple-net with 2% to 3% annual rent escalators. This 50/50 mix in the UK gives us a nice balance of upside and stability.", "Outpatient medical results continue to be boring but in a good way with another quarter of same-store growth in the mid 2% range. There is excellent visibility into this income stream driven by low lease rollover and a high retention rate. Also, the vast majority of the leases are triple-net, which gives us reliable earnings growth because expenses are passed through to the tenants.", "Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI grew 2.8% in line with history and our expectations. Payment coverage move higher and we see potential for a slow upward trend overtime. Skilled nursing and post-acute. Same-store NOI increased 3.6%, payment coverage declined to few basis points, primarily due to certain assets being looked help for sale and therefore out of the calculation.", "More important our Genesis properties continue to perform well given the environment. Our master lease saw a nice improvement in 2Q, versus the previous few quarter as Genesis adapts to the new environment. Yesterday Genesis made several positive announcement, including covenant release and a term loan refinancing through Welltower and Omega on a 60/40 basis. For Welltower shareholders this could be viewed as an important first step in a much larger process.", "As of yesterday, we are better positioned to reduce our Genesis concentration. We own their core assets in their core markets, so getting buyers comfortable with our real estate has never done our concern. Three things changed yesterday, one the hospital lender is gone, two the buyers can under write the corporate credit with more clarity and three Genesis can now focus on running their business rather than on inherited DOJ investigations, covenants and debt maturities.", "We had already been seen inbound interest in acquiring Genesis real estate from us and we expect the interest level to a increase over the past 24 hours. We raised $227 million of capital last quarter through this positions and loan payoffs including $61 million of Genesis mortgage loan repayments. The largest assets there was in Canada, where senior housing cap rates are now right at the top of the U.S. When we entered Canada nearly five-years ago the spread to the U.S. was at least 100% basis points. Since then institution of capital is poured into that sector, driving down cap rates.", "We took advantage last quarter by selling a non-core triple-net portfolio in Alberta for $125 million, which is mid 5% cap rate. The price was particularly attractive to us and in light of the weak economy in that province. We closed $356 million of new investments last quarter at a 7.3% initial cash yield. A healthy spread to our cost of capital. Our operating partners continue to be a unique source of high quality investments at reasonable prices.", "And that takes us to our pending acquisition of the Vintage portfolio in California for $1.15 billion. This portfolio is middle of the fairway for us. First 100% of the NOI is in our core markets. We are going deeper into markets where we have any credible footprint and a track record of success. Second, Welltower is uniquely positioned to unlock value here. We chose SRG, Sunrise and Silverado to take over management of the properties. Seniors housing is not a one size fits all business and we have the unique luxury of hand picking among our operating partners for the task at hand. SRG is an expert in large communities, Sunrise excels at mid size properties and Silverado is the memory care specialist and that\u2019s exactly how we allocated the 19 properties.", "The cap rate is expected to improve from about 5% in year one to the mid to high 6s at stabilization. That improvement is driven by occupancy rate and expense assumptions that are based on our partners\u2019 deep experience in these markets. Vintage is a very unique opportunity due to its scale and high barrier markets. It includes irreplaceable properties in San Francisco including one of few blocks from Nob Hill and one of few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Also the timing for a big core acquisition is perfect for us given our pending dispositions.", "And that\u2019s a good segway to Scott Estes.", "Scott Estes", "All right, thanks Scott and good morning everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance that of our portfolio. I would like to focus my comments this morning on how we are thinking about our business from a financial perspective as we enter the second half of the year.", "As Tom and Scott mentioned we will not be shy about looking for incremental disposition opportunity throughout the remainder of 2016. As a result, you should expect us to remain focused around our capital allocation theme this year, which emphasizes the following three components.", "First, we will look to maximize our financial flexibility through enhance liquidity as evidenced by the recent increase in our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Second, we intent to further strengthen our balance sheet by using incremental disposition proceeds to fund announced investments and continue to reduce leverage and strengthen our credit metrics. And third, we intend to further enhance the quality of our portfolio through targeted asset sales which we will remain focused on reducing our skill nursing exposure and in increasing our private pay mix.", "So again, begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and several of the more significant changes made through our supplemental package this quarter. In terms of second quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of a $0.15 per share up about 6% versus last year and normalized that of a $1.4 per share, which increased 9% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $1.9 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters.", "Overall I think this is a fairly straight forward quarterly report, as our net investment volume of $129 million was relatively light, a G&A of $39.9 million was in line with expectations, and tax expenses only quite less than expected. The only somewhat unusual item was on other income line which included an additional $11.8 million related to the receipt of insurance proceeds and the release of an escrow the benefit of both of which were backed out of our normalized earnings results.", "Moving onto dividends, we will pay our 181st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 22nd of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%.", "I'd also like to point out three fairly significant enhancements we made to our supplemental package this quarter. First, you can see at the bottom of page five that we enhanced our CapEx disclosure to include both recurring CapEx that impacts our normalized FAD, but also the other CapEx amounts that are generally the value enhancing larger renovation projects throughout portfolio.", "Second on page eight, we had a detailed trip-net payment coverage data that highlights both EBITDA coverage and duration of the individual leases in our portfolio. And third on page 29, we added disclosure related to our same-store NOI calculation methodology which details the specific adjustments to arrive at our same property count at the top of the page and the adjustments to arrive at the same-store NOI by property type at the bottom of the page. I think our intent here is to be as transparent as possible in showing you how we calculate our same-store result.", "Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, the second quarter was fairly quite from a capital markets activity prospective, I think the highlight of the quarter occurred in May, when we further enhanced our financial growth stability by increasing our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, while extending the units of that improvement at 2020.", "Our new line is priced that LIBOR plus 90 basis points, represents saving of 2.5 basis points from our previous line and carry the one-year extension option and in accordion fees for additional $1 billion. This brings our total unsecured credit facilities at 3.7 billion, when including our U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar term loan which were also extended for another five years.", "In terms of equity, we raised $64 million by issuing 914,000 shares through to our [drip] (Ph) program this quarter and we also generated 227 million of proceeds for dispositions and loan payoff, which importantly included $61 million in Genesis mortgage loan repaid during the quarter. and lastly, repaid approximately $151 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.2% while issuing $87 million of secured debt at a blended rate at 3%. So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.7 billion available at quarter end, with only $745 million of line borrowing and $467 million in cash on balance sheet.", "Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the second quarter remains strong, as of June 30, our net debts-to-undepreciated book cap of 39.2% improved 40 basis from last quarter, while net debt to enterprise value improved 230 basis points to 30%. Out net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.5 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.2 times and 3.2 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 11.9% of total assets at quarter end.", "In addition, we are pleased to receive an upgrade in our senior debt rating from Moody\u2019s to BAA1 in June. In light of the recent Brexit vote, I would like to take just a moment to remind you that we have fairly little financial exposure to the recent weakness in the pound sterling as a result of our hedging program.", "More specifically as of June 30, our UK exposure from a balance sheet prospective is over 80% hedge, through a combination of sterling denominates unsecured debt and other currencies hedges in place, while our earnings that at the UK are approximately 90% hedged, their interest expense on debt, G&A CapEx and cash flow hedge. Since the UK does represent only 8% of our total NOI, each 10% move in the pound against the dollar currently has an annualized earnings impact of less than $0.01 per year.", "I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our acquisition guidance includes those completed during the first half of the year, the $1.1.5 billion Vintage portfolio, and an additional $48 million of investments expected to remain through partnership.", "Moving to depositions, we have increased our dispositions forecast for the full -ear to $1.3 billion in proceeds from the previous $1 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $343 million in proceeds received during the first half of the year. $769 million of proceeds from properties currently held-for-sale, with the reminder representing loan payoff and other potential property sales over the rest for the year.", "Most of the $300 million of incremental disposition proceed and they were added to our guidance this quarter of skilled nursing asset and do to include $68 million from our Genesis portfolio.", "As Tom and Scott mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional Genesis assets above and beyond those included in our current guidance. And just to be clear, our exposure to Genesis has declined by $57 million for the three Genesis related items that have been disclosed over the past two days, which includes the $61 million in mortgage loans repaid during the quarter to $68 million in pending dispositions partially offset by the $72 million new term loan.", "In terms of our same-store NOI growth forecast, there is no change to our blended full-year estimate of 2.75% to 3.25% though I would state that we are attracting toward a higher end of the range at this point driven largely by the strength of our senior housing operating portfolio. Our FAD CapEx forecast is currently $82 million for 2016 comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the senior housing operating portfolio with the remaining $27 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. We do expect CapEx spending to ramp up a bit during the latter half of the year due to the timing of projected expenditures.", "Our G&A forecast continues to track towards the low end of our initial guidance at approximately $160 million for the full-year at this point. Our tax line item is projected to return to an expense of about $3 million to $4 million per quarter during the each of the last two quarters of this year based on slightly higher taxable income forecast. And a result of all of these assumptions we are maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.50 to 44.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results.", "I think our decision to maintain guidance was largely based on the fact that the incremental dispositions added to our guidance this quarter should be roughly offset by the Vintage portfolio acquisitions and continued solid operating portfolio performance through the second quarter. So in conclusion, we remain focused on our capital allocation efforts this year that we will continue to prioritize, maximizing financial flexibility through increased liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet by lowering leverage and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix.", "So that concludes my remarks and I think at this point, Tom I will turn it to you for some closing comments.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Thanks Scott. Before we take your questions, I wanted to highlight a few promotions that were approved by our Board and announced last week. Many of you know Mercedes Kerr as she is an important leader in the senior housing industry. I\u2019m delighted to tell you that Mercedes was named an Executive Vice President and a member of the Well Power Management Committee.", "Mercedes oversees business development and relationship management activities and has relocated to the Mothership here in Toledo. Additionally, Matt McQueen, Senior Vice President of Legal was named General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. I am grateful for their contribution to our success and they have further strength to an already deep senior management bench here.", "Now, Kaila open up the line for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll", "Thanks. Good morning. Guys can you give us an update on the sales process of the Genesis assets I know you touched on that in your prepared remarks and may be you can touch on the depth of the buyer pool that you are currently tracking?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes Michael I will be happy to. The held-for-sale bucket include $68 million in Genesis properties that are already under contract and that should closed in the next 60 days or so. Those are unique and that Genesis is actually existing the operations as well, so we are selling the real estate they exit in operations. And I would say that unusual or unique, because for the most part, we own core Genesis assets that they want to stay in as the operator.", "So would be selling our real estate and Genesis would remain as the operating partners. So I think that\u2019s less complex transaction and trying to sell the real estate and the operations together. In terms of interest level it\u2019s strong and it\u2019s from number of different sources, private equity for sure, overseas capital for sure.", "And we are actually starting to see that private and public REITS show interest again, which we were not have been the case in the past three to six month as the stock prices have come back and the capital rates has improved. So there is actually a pretty deep buyer pool and the lenders continued to be interested in the space as well provided the payment coverage\u2019s reasonable.", "But I would highlight something that Scott said earlier Mike is that based on the Genesis announcement yesterday I think there is even greater interest in owning these assets. Because there were a number of issues that were providing a little bit of a smoke screen in terms of really understanding the true value of the real estate and the future of the Genesis operating platform. I think the lot of that has been taken care of by the measures that we have already talked about.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay then can you touch on the get how much of the portfolio, you would like to sell and would this be done multiple transaction with JV or one single transaction?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Mike, we have always been both buyers and sellers of real estate and we are opportunistic and strategic in both those regards and we again are evaluating opportunities to sell across our portfolio as they come in. I think we are comfortable with what we own today, and felling better about it today then we might have felt a few days ago. So again, just we ask you to stand by and assume that we are seeing a lot of interest and we\u2019ll make the best decision with respect to our shareholders.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay great and last question, can you give us some color on that California portfolio you agreed to buy. I think the release said a stabilized yield in the mid to high 6% range. Why is this a stabilize yield, does that assume some type of redevelopment opportunities or does that see many types of operational improvements for the transitioning your existing operators into those assets?", "Scott Estes", "Michael it\u2019s more the latter, there are couple of properties that would benefit from some CapEx and redevelopment but that\u2019s not the reason for the gap between the first year yield and the stabilized yield. That\u2019s more of that we are going to pretty dramatically change the service profile at the communities.", "I think the service level of the price point is going to change pretty dramatically and you chosen three operating partners to do that with who have extremely deep experience in these markets. So we have underwritten occupancy rates and expense assumptions, they are very much based on their historical experience in these markets.", "And any time you do an operator transition you have to assume that there is going to be a decline in your line, especially if you are increasing the service mix. It's just the way it works is the expenses go up first and it takes time to be able to increase occupancy and rate to match the service level that you implement day one. And no doubt you have staffing changes as well as turnover within the resident population. So the year one is always a bit depressed.", "Michael Carroll", "So what's the in place or initial yield on these assets?", "Scott Estes", "It's around 5% Michael in year one.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Tyler from Green Street Advisors.", "Kevin Tyler", "Good morning. Thanks. Just following up on that point on the Vintage deal, can you give some color on how it ultimately came together I know the portfolio had been roomer to be kind of on and off the market. What brought them to the table ultimately?", "Scott Estes", "Kevin the only much we can say about something like that, I would say that patience is a virtue sometimes and the timing here was particularly well for us given cost of our capital today and may be versus in the past and our disposition proceeds that are pending. So we felt like this is always been a portfolio that we had our eye on. We always had operating partners that we thought could do a great job creating value and at time it came together perfectly.", "Thomas DeRosa", "And Kevin we don't know of another opportunity to be able to create the level of scale in the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets that this acquisition will give to us. So we think it's very a highly strategic move for us to be able to acquire Vintage, we are very excited about it. The Vintage Group, Vintage Senior Living really assembled at excellent portfolio of assets in some extremely high barrier to entry locations that's what we are all about. So this as Scott said down in the middle of the fairway this is exactly the type of growth opportunity that we seek out.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay. Thanks yes I agree definitely some high barrier locations there right in our backyard here in Southern California. In the slides that you put out the occupancy in the Southern California piece of the portfolio I think it was around 83%. I was just curious given the nature of these assets and where they are why that might be a little bit lower kind of the industry average any color there?", "Scott Estes", "We think there is opportunity to bring it up to the industry average. Our occupancy in these markets is in their low 90s SRG, Sunrise, Silverado consistently run at that level and it will take a little time to get there. But we are confident that overtime these properties will be at that 90-ish percent level and that's why we one of the reasons why we see the yield in this investment improving overtime.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, thanks. Just switching gears onto the Genesis and sniff side for a second. As we think about the overall exposure to these new bundling initiatives we are trying to quantify what that means for any particular operator. We try and pencil down what percent of NOI might be exposed to joints broadly and then may be go from there into [Technical Difficulty] 67 geographies that are laid out under the CJR program. I am just curious from you and we've been also talking exact numbers, but directionally Genesis exposure to CJR and in those 67 markets, how do you think about that that and if we are talking about our terms, would you think if that represents in terms of their NOI?", "Thomas DeRosa", "I guess Kevin, the world of healthcare reimbursement is moving towards underlying and it\u2019s hard to answer, you question incrementally, because there is so many unknowns. Genesis is very much preparing for world that looks different than today in terms of reimbursement and I would say as the lowest cost setting with that can deliver the best outcome will be the winner.", "Kevin Tyler", "Okay, thanks for the thoughts guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria", "I was just hoping you could comment on the changes that Genesis announced yesterday with regards to its covenant to get a 20% to 25% better. If you could just comment on what we should expect that imply, does that imply a more pressure, like we had and if you could comment on what the governance want, were they are now relative to the governance and what the change was?", "Thomas DeRosa", "One that answer what I can, Genesis who have their call on Friday, I think they are disclosing particular governance but the point is when these covenants were set three and four years ago, it was a different business environment and they were set in a level that give it cushion to the projected performance and that\u2019s the same thing that we've done here.", "The idea behind covenants is to give you self to see at the table, when things are turning in the wrong direction so that and you can sit down and have a rational discussion by how to proceed and that\u2019s what happened here among Genesis and it\u2019s various capital partners.", "So we agreed to reset the convenient to levels that certainly have all of us being paid and as they disclosed the caution in the 20% to 25% range against the EBITDA projection that they recently provided that\u2019s based on today\u2019s operating environment.", "Juan Sanabria", "And so, is the convenient were for regards to 6 charge or what is the new convenient level, and if you can comment what did you guys get in return for the change for that governance?", "Thomas DeRosa", "So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to talk about specific numbers Juan, but there is the fixed charge coverage, there is an interest coverage, there is a leverage convenient, liquidity, networks, I mean there are number of covenants that hit all the key factors on our corporate credit. And for us there is a master lease payment coverage as well.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay and then on Genesis you talked about the lenders being supportive of potential buyers of any assets that you are looking to sell. What you are seeing in terms of lenders and what kind of coverage levels do they want and may be you can comment on, how that is relative to your expectations? Or how your Genesis portfolio will look as the year progresses, given I think you said that the second quarter were strong, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a one quarter trailing or kind of a as of today.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes Juan One on the payment coverage, we are talking about, because we always report on a trailing 12 month basis but also on a one quarter lag, so the number that you see in our reports is, it can be a bit miss leading. So when I talked about the second quarter being strong I\u2019m talking literally about the three months from April 1 to June 30 and that the performance in those 90 days was a nice improvement over the prior two quarters which is encouraging to us.", "In terms of the payment coverage the lenders are looking for and the same is true of the buyer pool and it tends to be in the 1.3 times coverage range. So, our coverage today is close to 1.25 so we are slightly below but not in any material way, which gives us additional comfort that these are very saleable assets particularly now that the Genesis corporate profile is a lot less uncertain than it was a week ago.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just last quick one from me, you guys have obviously substantially exposure to Genesis and if you were to do call it a $1 billion of dispositions over the next 12 months or whatever the timeframe may be. Are you still ruling out a potential spin of whatever may remain after kind of an initial larger transaction?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes, we are.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS.", "Nicholas Yulico", "Thanks. Just another Genesis question, I mean you\u2019ve said that one of the motivations here to do the term loan to become a term loan there was to remove other lender parties from discussion table make it easier when trying to sell a chunk of the Genesis real estate in deals where Genesis would stay the tenant. So I guess some of that motivation, but it is skeptic to say it looks like no other lenders were willing to step on new term loan besides you and Omega. And then looking at the LIBOR plus 13% rate doesn\u2019t that signal a very weak credit profile and that you were forced into becoming a lender of last reserve here?", "Scott Brinker", "Hey Nick its Scott. It\u2019s interesting that where we thought about the term loan is that it\u2019s not a core business, so 98% plus or minus of what we do is high quality real estate. So you are not going to see us do things like this so often on occasion to accomplish a longer-term bigger goal we will extend a loan and we have a good history of having those loans repaid.", "And in this situation we can\u2019t speak for Omega, but for Welltower we told George and his team to go out and talk to the marketplace see what a third party was willing to lend and we would be going to match it and that\u2019s what we did. Because this is an important security and the Genesis capital structure and we prefer to control it rather than have a hostile third-party be in that position holding the parts even though they have 1% or less of the capital at risk.", "So the situation existed a week ago to us was untenable and was not allowing us to accomplish important goals and was distracting Genesis, but we did not do a below market loan, we didn\u2019t do an above market loan this is a market rate clearly it\u2019s not a AAA credit. So we are being paid for the risk that we are taking.", "Nicholas Yulico", "And then, what is the incentive for Genesis at this point to go out and try to refinance the term loans right and it sounds like you guys want to be the term loan near term because it helps with some asset sales helps short Genesis. But, why if the rate is market what is the incentive for Genesis to go out and refinance this with new term lenders?", "Thomas DeRosa", "So regards with who the lender as one looks at one capital sac, you want to payoff to the highest cost that you can. So I would say that given that Scott said this is market terms of this kind of paper, it\u2019s always going to be the type of paper that management what is to get rid of as soon as possible so.", "Scott Brinker", "And our maturity at December of 2017 to another consideration exactly.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Exactly.", "Nicholas Yulico", "Okay thanks and just going to be the Vintage deal, could you just talk a little bit more about the time, you think it\u2019s going to take to get, from the going yield the 30% NOI outside to get to mid six yield and I forget you said what the occupancy today that portfolio is ?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes Nick the occupancy today is in the 84% to 85% range to bit lower in Southern California, then it is in Northern California and it\u2019s going to take a couple of years. This isn\u2019t unlike redevelopment opportunity and we think given the locations in this scale the 6.5% to 7% stabilized yield is more than adequate return for this type of opportunity and then in longer-term. We think it\u2019s fits right into the profile of inflation plus outperformance. So this is not a [indiscernible] investment for us, this is continuing to built on a really important footprint in great market.", "Scott Estes", "I think that\u2019s what is exciting about this acquisition is that while Genesis has been doing a good job. We think that the scale being that we already have in those markets and the operational efficiencies that being part of the Welltower, Umbrella bring to any asset in our portfolio, was the very reason why you see our performance leading the industry. It\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s hard work and believe, we bring tremendous synergies with the other pieces of our portfolio to the with this portfolio and we think that will benefit our shareholders over time.", "Nicholas Yulico", "Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thank you and you guys have pretty solid central growth in the operating portfolio again this quarter ahead of some of our peers. So you continue to show sort of a result there, I\u2019m just wondering on the expenses side, was anything one-time in that comp expense, I think it was up 6% and what should we assume sort of a good run rate over the next few quarters on expenses?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes Vik, there is always a usual, it\u2019s one reason that we try not to focus too much on 90 days increments of time, well that\u2019s a plus or a minus with this many properties, there is always something that usually going on but. We don\u2019t really move those in or out, the pool is the pool, if there are any adjustments that are particularly unusual, we tell you exactly what we did in the supplemental.", "So the numbers are always going be a little bit was also, let\u2019s say triple that lease. The compensation for sure is escalated this year, particularly in the UK, in the US, we talked about that at length. It\u2019s in our projections for the year and those expectations are being meet. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s good or bad, but we actually predicted the cost would be up quite a bit with respect to labor.", "The fact is we are in core markets that are at the leading edge of the change and the minimum wage like San Francisco and New York and Los Angeles. And the benefit is we have the pricing power to offset that. So we can\u2019t view these things in isolation and our performance to-date is showing that the revenue growth has been enough to offset the cost growth and still deliver really good performance.", "Scott Estes", "Yes, I think just look at the occupancy the fact that our occupancy increased across the portfolio a 100 basis points as we are pushing rate growth that is not what you see across the industry. It is what we are able to do because of what we own, how our operators manage and the benefits that the Welltower platform gives to the portfolio. That\u2019s why we get those results.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Fair point. And just more broadly on the shop portfolio you are now at what 37%, 38% can you may be just give us some color on the opportunity set just going forward for similar types of large transactions that you just announced. And where do you want to see this segment of the business going in terms of business mix?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Vik there aren\u2019t many opportunities of this scale sort of most of what you\u2019ll see from Welltower in terms of investments in everyday portfolio will be select acquisitions that are in core markets and new development and virtually every one of our 10 U.S. RIDEA partners is actively doing new development between two and five properties a year. sometimes they do it alongside of us sometimes we have an option to buy when it opens or when it stabilizes.", "So you are much more likely to see us to one at a time, two at a time acquisition and development to grow that portfolio going forward. But there always a handful of portfolios that are interesting to us or that may be aggregated overtime. But there is nothing else out there like this Vintage portfolio in terms of its scale in core markets.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And then just last one thanks for the Triple-net coverage you have mapped of, realty useful. I am just wondering how what our operators think today when they look at when they look to enter into deals or they look at their own coverages which fits some cases may be 1.1 or below 1.1 on an EBITDAR basis. What are they saying about the level of coverage doing new deals or do you seeing some operator say, hey we need to rethink about structuring the deal?", "Thomas DeRosa", "I think so Vik. When I started doing this 14-years ago the typical coverage for seniors housing was in the 1.25 or higher range and to us that was a structure that made sense for the landlord and the tenant and this has become more competitive the coverage ratio have declined and declined and 1.1 today is sort of the market. And for years operators are going to enter into leases at those coverages.", "Frankly we were not doing many if any acquisitions at those coverages. We have been saying for years now that to us the distinction of risk in focusing on triple-net versus RIDEA was really not the way we think about risk. And we would always prefer to own a Class A asset in class A market and deal with the quarter-to-quarter variation in results and that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019ve seen us concentrate our investments were you have for the past six years.", "We have various yield triple-net investments, when we do it tends to be a new development, were there is an opportunity and enough profit, in the development for there to be strong opinion coverage or a turn on opportunity. We are just, we don\u2019t like the thought of doing big acquisitions to near one coverage.", "It looks straight on the press release because you got great structural protection here so got structural protection, but we seen already that there is don\u2019t always out as plan and, if the deal doesn\u2019t work for both parties, it eventually doesn\u2019t work for either party. And I think you have seen that and to us to market coverage\u2019s ratio is today are not appropriate and there is not enough for the balance between risk and rewards for the tenants.", "Scott Estes", "You have seen often the operators is getting frustrated, when once at the profitability is going into the ramp and we find that it\u2019s much more constructive to have the RIDEA structure where you are both incentivize to try the NOI share in the CapEx and you want to drive the performance as supposed to try and find some means that starching out profitability when it\u2019s right around one, one to one.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes now that the great point and I think the other thing that is, just understand that we have built and infrastructure here over the last five-year that really allows us to maximize the performance along with the operator of the RIDEA assets. So I think that\u2019s a key point that you have to consider, going forward.", "There will be a rare occasion that we will, you will see as acquire seniors housing assets in a triple-net lease structure. You might expect to see some of the triple-net lease assets we own moved to our idea structure, if that\u2019s the possibility in the future I think , we think it\u2019s better for us, we think it\u2019s better for the operator, we think it\u2019s better for our shareholders.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. Thank you guys and congrats on a strong quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Just wanted the follow-up on Juan\u2019s question about, some of the changes to the covenants and if HCN actually received anything in consideration for that?", "Scott Brinker", "Tayo, it\u2019s Scott speaking. There are a long list of projects that we are working on. With Genesis some of them disclosed, some haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s fair to say that the term loan is well as to covenant really were part of a much broader discussion. So we are not prepared to talk about this specific pluses and minuses. I would just ask, you to have patients, give us time, we are clearly focused on the situation and there is a much bigger picture that we are focused on than covenant release and a term loan.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay, fair enough. And then did you do anything similar to what Sabra did in regards to changing the least maturities as well to kind of help Genesis have a staggered maturity schedule?", "Scott Brinker", "Well I can\u2019t speak for the details of what Genesis and Sabra agreed to. I can tell you that all 180 plus reminders of our properties are in one mass release that matures in 2032. So the maturity date is not something we are not worried about.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay helpful. And then last one for me. I know you guys have always kind of be in and out of life sciences for while, we've kind of went off through this [Waxford] (Ph) transaction. I guess that was a little bit surprised to see them do it and probably now you guys have given you already got experience with life sciences and you\u2019ve always kind of expressed an interest in it. But, had expressed frustration you couldn\u2019t grow in the past. So just some thoughts around that transaction, did you look at it and why didn\u2019t you do it if you did indeed look at it?", "Scott Brinker", "Well we will only invest in real estate that\u2019s in core markets, that\u2019s part of our strategy and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard us say that we want to invest in life science related buildings. We told you when we did the deal with Four City in Cambridge that was an opportunistic investments and it was an opportunistic sales. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard us say that we had any interest in getting into the life sciences real estate business.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore from Stifel.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. On that Vintage acquisition what is the mix of stabilized versus reset opportunities? And then what kind of occupancy increases are you assuming to go from that 5% in place GAAP rate for the mix expectation?", "Scott Estes", "Hey Chad it\u2019s Scott. Occupancy today is in the low to mid 80s and our portfolio in this market - pardon me.", "Chad Vanacore", "Did that get to up above 90s to get your in place stabilized assumptions?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, that\u2019s right Chad in the low 90s which is where we are today in these markets with our operating partners.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right and then what kind of a break assumptions are we making there?", "Scott Estes", "Yes in terms of the percentage stabilized versus unsterilized, I would probably think about it a little bit differently. There are properties that we think have the opportunity to grow senses pretty materially. And almost across the board we feel like there are opportunities to change the service mix, the service level, and change the value proposition pretty dramatically for the residence. So that\u2019s in addition to the occupancy upside it\u2019s really on the rate and service level that we see the portfolio changing the most over the years, but that will take some time.", "And it is a drag in the earlier years because you\u2019ve got to put the new service platform in place before you can charge for it. All right, people need to see it before they will pay for it and it takes time turn over the population. So this is a long-term investment for us, the 5% cap rate is accretive day one, but the fact is where cost of capital is today it\u2019s probably is accretive 5% this is very much a long-term play for us.", "Thomas DeRosa", "You said differently the way I think about it Chad you really do have the opportunity for four to five years for mid to high-single-digit NOI growth for the year after spending those additional dollars.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, thanks. And then just one more. So, Scott you made a comment that increasing private sale reduced exposure with the priority I think a quarter or two ago you guys may have made a comment that that Sniff actually look like the best value at the time to you. Can you reconcile where we are today?", "Scott Estes", "I don\u2019t recall anybody saying that Sniffs were an area that we wanted to invest in. We said that we are comfortable managing our Sniff portfolio that\u2019s operated by Genesis, but I don\u2019t think you have heard us\u2026", "Chad Vanacore", "Probably kind of the general pricing environment on\u2026", "Scott Estes", "I would just say Chad that the skilled nursing environment is still one that is attracting in investments dollar, it\u2019s just as we think about the direction of our company, it\u2019s probably does not in Welltowers portfolio. So that is the population that uses those properties, it\u2019s going to double in size over 20-years and the supply of properties is declining.", "So when you think about the longer-term rather than the next three quarters or the three months. I think the supply demand dynamics are still quite favorable for that business despite the headwinds that exist. And in a world with yield that are pushing zero percent in most developed economies. You can still price skilled nursing in the high-single-digits unlevered, and get attractive financing.", "And it generates an awfully attractive return on equity immediately and the payment coverage is unlike seniors housing, were they are awfully low with 1.3 times coverage, it\u2019s a pretty stable yield, particularly if you own good real-estate with two good operator. So look it is actually still is a good investment. It\u2019s just not for us.", "Thomas DeRosa", "I would even remind everybody, I think it\u2019s important, where everyone is still focused on Genesis, we actually and even today we just announced an incremental progress on disposing a skilled nursing assets. So within our 1.3 billion of projected disposition proceeds about 60% or so of that is skilled nursing and pro forma for what we have announced through today, we are already at 90% private pay.", "So Genesis is just a little bit of part of those numbers currently, but we are actually seeing those reasonable prices, we have 760 some million of potential proceeds, some asset held-for-sale in that low 9s kind of cap rate. And that\u2019s kind of, I think a good example of how we are continuing to improve the quality of the portfolio.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right guys. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi thanks. I just wanted to ask you about how you are thinking, if any change is about your investment in the UK, if you want you may be bring that down, given their pending exit from the EU or does it change the way you think about in investing there going forward or is it too soon to tell?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes, I think that you just answered the part of the question. Yes I think it is too soon to tell, I think we have seen a very different view of the impact of the Brexit over the couple weeks. The thing you have to understand as 99% of the population in our building are UK residence. So they are not leaving the UK, because of Brexit. The UK is not going to be building new assisted leaving assets for its population. More and more of the UK residence will have to turn to a private pay alternatives to local authority funded elder care.", "And the bulk of our assets are in the London Metro Politian area, which I don\u2019t think you bet against London long-term. I think London has had a 30-year head start on building an irreplaceable infrastructure, an economic machine that will prevail regards what of what happens here. So I don\u2019t think we are losing sleep over it. I think there are some challenges, you have heard us talk about on the wage side in the UK, but we continue to manage through that again for the same reasons why we are managing through that in the U.S. I said we have the best located real estate with the best operators and people want to live in this portfolio. So at the same time, we are watching what is happening in the UK and Europe very closely. But at the end I would tell you that we have assembled a really great portfolio of assets there.", "Smedes Rose", "All right that makes sense. I think you guys did the rest of them so thank you. I appreciate it.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Thanks.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord.", "Paul Morgan", "Hi good morning. Just a couple of quick things. So on your, you mentioned that you are trending towards high-end of your full-year same-store NOI guidance and I think that still implies may be around 50 basis points of deceleration, if I have that right. Would you think that\u2019s accurate and if so are there any factors of markets that might be driving that in your outlook?", "Scott Estes", "First quarter I think it 3.8% blended to 3.3%, averages to about 3.5% and I think in short we like to keep a little bit of conservatism in there and are attracting toward the higher end of the range. So really the only variable is again around the operating portfolio, but we feel like it\u2019s doing pretty well. So we are hopeful we would again be able to come in toward the high end of that range at this point or may be in a little better.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay. Great and then on Genesis I think you mentioned that one of the reasons for coverage decline was based on held-for-sale assets and so I might have thought that the sale assets would have lover coverage is that just specific to the deals or is there anything - kind of is there any color there you can offer?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes, it\u2019s more because among the assets that are being sold are in-patient rehab hospitals that have particularly high values in extremely high payment coverages. So that\u2019s what is driving it and it\u2019s not a huge portfolio at the end of the day. So if you sell a $60 million, $70 million property that has three times payment coverage unfortunately impacts the portfolio about two or three basis points and that\u2019s what happens.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly going back to bench, sorry if you mentioned this and I missed it. But is there anything in terms of a contribution to the ramping yield to stick to the stabilized level that\u2019s coming from the cost side as you roll those assets into your platform in those markets or is it all really occupancy in REIT?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Yes, it\u2019s more driven by revenue in this case one property 13 taxes have a impact immediately, the minimum wage is an issue in a lot of these markets so we have budgeted for that and our operating partners expect to increase of the service level and not decrease it. So it\u2019s not like we are assuming big expense cuts, it\u2019s really just the opposite here.", "Paul Morgan", "Yes. Okay. Great thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Muller from JP Morgan.", "Michael Muller", "Spent a little bit of time, Tom I think at the beginning of the call talking about performance in the core markets and hitting at and talking about how after Vintage I think core markets are going to be 60% at the end of NOI for senior housing or for the operating portfolio. And I guess just given the disconnect in terms of performance that you are seeing between the six core markets and everything else. Should we expect ramp up asset sales in those non-core markets over time?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Well Mike, we like what we own across the portfolio, but that\u2019s how it\u2019s changing. What today is the good market may not be a great market in the future, so expect that we are always looking for opportunities to recycle capital and constantly improve the quality of the portfolio. I would say that we are laser focused on building scale in the top markets in the country.", "You know Scott mentioned that the six of the sexy six is DC where we are number two, but expect that we are very focused on building scale in DC. And a number of our operators have development properties being the constructed in the greater DC market that\u2019s an important market for us.", "But you have heard us say this before, we are looking to go deep in the top core market in the three country, in which we operate and get as close to the centre of the core as possible, which is not typically where you found senior housing assets. So that speaks to what we are doing in New York city, which we talked about on our last call.", "And it speaks to some of the things; we are doing in market quite Toronto very much in the centre of the urban market there. You will see on assets, we are either own today or developing in Los Angelis. So it\u2019s very much our strategy, expect you are going to continue to us to follow that strategy and the other piece of this, which you will be hearing more about in the future is, how we are connecting what we do to the major health systems in those core markets.", "Scott Estes", "The one thing I would add - Mike its Scott Estes. I think it\u2019s important that, because what Tom just said, we have here at visits, investing methodology and I think we see less variability between the portfolio, I think we start talking about the six core markets that\u2019s used is generally in industry. But, I remember when Scott Brinker had some color during the first quarter think about our same-store RIDEA NOI growth was 5%, 5.5%. The best markets were 7%, 8%, the low were 2% or 3% all positive. And around the 4% this quarter, we don\u2019t see why variability and no big negatives or anything, we don\u2019t dislike any market. I think it\u2019s important that we feel a pretty about the market we are in.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes when we talk about performance, we talk about the entire portfolio, we are not bifurcating our portfolio. We generally like the markets we are in, we are skewed to the core markets. It\u2019s not a 100% of what we own, but we have edited the portfolio, over many year and that\u2019s why our performance is better. Because we don\u2019t have a lot of weak links in our portfolio, that is one of the key differentiators of the Welltower business mode. Again, it\u2019s not magic, that our same-store numbers are what they are, it\u2019s because we have better assets and much fewer lower quality assets", "Michael Muller", "Got it and just one quick follow-up on the Vintage, the $1.5 billion investment does that capture everything as you go through this, you know $5 billion yield ramp up to $6.5 million or is there is an incremental spend above and beyond that to get there?", "Scott Estes", "Yes Mike it starts at $1.15 billion and there is some capital that needs to be put into a couple of buildings in particular, but that\u2019s accounted for when we talk about a stabilized yield in the 6.5% to 7% range.", "Michael Muller", "That number is fully loaded. Okay.", "Scott Estes", "Yes, correct.", "Michael Muller", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of [Andrew Rosawitz] (Ph) from Goldman Sachs.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey thanks. It\u2019s late so I will talk really fast. On Genesis, I wanted to ask about the [facility] (Ph) EBITDA coverage. Because it\u2019s interesting if you look at 1.57 it\u2019s actually being constant for over a year and does that imply that basically the operator property level EBITDA on a same store basis has been flat over the last year which would appear to be a lot better than the overall commentary for the skill nursing industry and also Genesis\u2019 portfolio overall?", "Scott Estes", "Yes Andrew this is Scott speaking. We have commented in the past and we\u2019ll do it again. Our properties have performed quite well over the past four years there is a 3.5% lease escalator in our master lease that\u2019s a high bar for Genesis to climb over every year now next year that goes to 3% so a bit of relief from their standpoint. But our coverage is other than in 2011 when Medicare cut reimbursement substantially have been very consistent over the past four years. And we think\u2026", "Unidentified Analyst", "I guess a follow up is how are they able to do that and one thing I thought about it there is a difference between because you are not in the ex-Sun asset right, you are not in the ex-skilled assets is that kind of legacy Genesis doing better?", "Scott Estes", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just curious, is there a reason why?", "Scott Estes", "They have huge geographic scale in these markets so we are concentrated in New England in the Mid Atlantic they have been there for decades they have their referral networks the brand, the staffing and it\u2019s good real estate. So I don\u2019t know as much about the Sun portfolio or the skilled health portfolio we don\u2019t own those assets.", "We do own their core legacy assets and they have held in quite well, which is why keep saying we are confident that there will be interest for our real estate. And the issue was clearing up the corporate credit situation, because they have done three or four big acquisitions in the past three years that on hindsight may be not all the assets were perfect and they did use a lot of debt to finance them. So the corporate credit isn\u2019t as strong as it could be despite strong performance in our real estate.", "Thomas DeRosa", "But Andrew thanks for noticing.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Any time. Thanks for taking the question guys.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "Did you talk about what types of leases you will enter into sort of Vintage deal just across the three operators and maybe it is a mix of RIDEA or a triple-net?", "Scott Estes", "Hey Todd its Scott. These are all RIDEA structures, so no leases.", "Todd Stender", "Okay. Thanks. And about the rent coverage, can you tell us what the rent coverage was in a trailing basis and that what you underwrote it at?", "Scott Estes", "For the Vintage portfolio Todd?", "Todd Stender", "Yes and may be bifurcated between independent living and assisted living if you can?", "Scott Estes", "So There may be some confusion, we are using the RIDEA structure, so this is just management contracts there is no lease or payment coverage in place.", "Todd Stender", "Okay, can you tell what it was covering at?", "Scott Estes", "It was owned by a different operator and a different owner. Sorry I\u2019m not sure even how they deal with structure...", "Scott Brinker", "We are just looking at from how we underwrite it and we are happy to help walk you through that offline if you would like.", "Todd Stender", "Got it okay, and how the funding sources, I know disposition proceeds are going to be factored in having any assumed debt?", "Scott Estes", "There is real small amount of that we have seen that like $35 million in the low force, with a eight year maturity, so there was its cash.", "Thomas DeRosa", "And we are in a good place from a cash position Todd, with almost a billion of pending dispositions and $467 million of cash on balance sheet currently.", "Todd Stender", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question come from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Thanks good morning. I was wondering if you could provide some on color on the asset held-for-sale as were as composition, skilled nursing, senior housing and MOB?", "Scott Estes", "I have that, John now are you doing? Its Scott Estes. I would say it is about half skilled nursing and then the other 25% is about evenly split between 11 medical office buildings are in that pool and some triple-net seniors housing. Probably it will happen more heavily into the third quarter as well.", "I didn\u2019t comment too much on that, but again our guidance was flat. You have $300 million of incremental disposition largely in the third quarter, about evenly offset by the benefits of the vintage acquisition that\u2019s probably more towards the later part of the year, end of the fourth quarter, plus some better operating performance kind of netted each other.", "John Kim", "Great and then a couple of follow ups on the Vintage acquisition, can you discuss a number of units in this portfolio, average age and also if there any development expansion opportunity?", "Scott Estes", "There are 19 properties, 2600 units, there is excess land at particular properties, but we will focus for on selling the buildings that we have and was there another question John?", "John Kim", "Average age and development expansion?", "Scott Estes", "Most of the buildings are in the 10 to 15-year range, there are couple of other buildings that have been completely redeveloped and renovated including one in San Francisco that technically is 100 years old, but if you walked in it [indiscernible] so. It\u2019s sort of material those off the average, but most of them were built in sort of the late 1990s early 2000s.", "John Kim", "And development?", "Scott Estes", "Oh sorry, I thought I covered that. There is excess land at particular campuses, but that\u2019s not part of our expectation right now, we want to focus on maximizing the value of the existing buildings.", "John Kim", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson -from MUFG Securities", "Richard Anderson", "No Mizuho, but anyway. What doers Vintage get you to from a RIDEA prospective, as you are 38% now where do you get to?", "Scott Estes", "Well I guess it depends how many dispositions we have, but it could easily be in the low 40\u2019s Rich.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay and. And what would you comment be just in terms of the elevated profile risk profile that that would suggest in an uncertain economic environment and so on. How would you respond to that?", "Scott Estes", "We don\u2019t think it elevates the risk profile, because we have very seasoned operators and an infrastructure to manage RIDEA assets that\u2019s unparallel and we feel much more comfortable in our ability to manage our RIDEA assets than we might with certain triple-net just by the nature of how the ownership is structured. We think that not that we would say that triple-net is necessarily riskier, but we think we know how to manage risk and enhance value through a RIDEA structure better than anybody.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay. I would be quicker. I would like to talk about rack audits. so but I do want to talk about Genesis and is it first of all true that whatever else you may sell after the $68 million that kind of have on under contract will be just real estate, it will be areas where Genesis plans to stay and continue to operate those buildings, is that correct?", "Thomas DeRosa", "That\u2019s mostly correct Rich, there may be handful of properties 10 plus or minus they would prefer not to be in. So there are some states like Ohio and Kentucky where they have got a very small footprint and prefer to exit. We are the landlord on those and we would be happy to participate in a complete exit from those properties otherwise, yes, they will remain the operator.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay. So if that\u2019s true and by the way did you give a cap rate that you are expecting on the $68 million is it in the nines or tens?", "Thomas DeRosa", "No, it\u2019s lower than that, but what Scott gave is the blended yield for the entire held-for-sale bucket is in the low nines.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay. So my question is if Genesis plans to stay in the majority of the stuff that you may sell in the future. That would indicate that these are pretty good assets and I think you probably are going to agree that without any question. So like if you were a private investors as oppose to a publicly traded REIT, could you see yourself sort of taking a shot and committing more to Genesis and working with them through this. Particularly since these assets that may be sold or assets they are big welcomed to maintain operations in. I\u2019m just curious like is the publicly traded element of your story at all driving your decision to be a seller and what can be argued a pretty inopportune time right now at this point in the cycle?", "Thomas DeRosa", "That was also an opportune.", "Richard Anderson", "Well, it\u2019s not a great time for skill nursing, we can all agree with that.", "Thomas DeRosa", "I haven\u2019t seen it that much from when we bought it. I mean I guess the point is the cap rates and the payment coverages haven\u2019t really changed over the years. So we can talk about it when we actually announce something Rich, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that when you compare the cap rates hit the property level when we entered portfolio six years ago to what we think we can exit at, they are awfully similar. So I\u2019m not sure what is happening elsewhere whether it\u2019s in the [indiscernible] or inside Genesis, but our properties I think are quite valuable and we are seeing a lot of interest from buyers.", "Richard Anderson", "Then why sell them?", "Thomas DeRosa", "Well, today we announced another fantastic quarter and we spent 90% of the call talking about Genesis.", "Richard Anderson", "Sorry.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Let\u2019s now talk about rack audits.", "Richard Anderson", "Okay. That\u2019s all I have. I won\u2019t keep it going. Thanks very much.", "Thomas DeRosa", "Thanks Rich.", "Operator", "We have now reached the end of today\u2019s call.

My name is Holly and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir.", "Jeff Miller", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower's third quarter 2016 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release that's distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at Welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call which may be accessed through the Company's website.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call maybe deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, our CEO. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thank you, Jeff. I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflect solid operating performance across all business segments as well as strategic capital allocation decisions. Normalized FFO and FAD were up 4% and 5%, respectively. These excellent results were driven by core growth, same-store NOI was up 2.6% and our track record of making accretive investments. Our Class A healthcare real estate concentrated in major markets has consistently demonstrated resilience. And in a year where wage pressures of challenging operators across the senior care industry as well as new supply coming into many secondary markets, we are confident in our position and we are raising 2016 same-store NOI guidance to 3% to 3.25%.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at our senior housing operating portfolio. Year-to-date same-store NOI growth in this business is averaged 3.9% relative to our initial guidance of 2% to 3%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, these assets saw a strong occupancy increase of 70 basis points and rental rate growth of 4%. Offsetting these strong top line results has been wage increases, which have been growing at 6% plus year-to-date. Our focus on major markets allows us to pass along much of this expense growth to the consumer and same-store NOI growth for our operating portfolio resulted in an expected 2.2% increase for the quarter.", "Wage inflation is not unique to the senior care industry. Its impact has been felt across all sectors of healthcare. This creates particularly unique challenges for government reimbursement focused models that do not have the same ability to pass along increases in operating expenses. This is another reason behind Welltower strategy of focusing on private pay sectors. You all know the aging demographic wave were positively impact utilization across all sectors of healthcare. Welltower, however, is capitalizing on this demographic trend by investing in healthcare assets where commercial forces determine price and where market forces limit supply.", "Given that let me make a few comments regarding our capital allocation strategy and the press releases we issued this morning. The execution of the announced asset sales will have the effect of meaningfully reducing our government pay exposure and significantly lowering our leverage in order to create future capacity and seize opportunities that may result from unpredictable central bank actions and expected interest rate increases. Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet were rewarded this morning by S&P with an upgrade in our credit rating to BBB+.", "We are delighted with this news as I'm sure our bondholders are as well. We are a long-term investor in healthcare real estate and believe that skilled nursing, while historically a more volatile asset class will remain an important component of the healthcare delivery continuum. Given our strategy to increase private pay sources of revenue, we indicated that we would explore interest we were seeing from private real estate buyers looking to establish position in this sector.", "We listened to and considered the views of our shareholders and undertook a thoughtful and measured approach. This led to numerous discussions that have resulted in a series of transactions that will take out private pay revenue mix up to 92.4% and long-term post acute care concentration from 19.9% down to 13.5% of NOI. Combine this with our sector leading balance sheet and you have a stable shift that is positioned to seize external growth opportunities as they arise and drive continued sector leading operating performance.", "I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in allowing us to take a patient approach to unlocking significant value for these dispositions. Welltower takes great pride in the capital partnership we established last year with CPPIB. This partnernship not only diversifies our source of funding, but also validates healthcare real estate as a true institutional asset class.", "Today, we welcome our first China based institutional partner, Cindat, to the Welltower family through our joint venture investment in post acute long-term care and seniors housing. Cindat\u2019s vision and significant interest in the U.S. healthcare real estate sector exemplifies the natural fit between long-term investors seeking returns driven by unmatched demographic trends. We could not be more pleased to be working with these fine partners.", "With that I will pass the mic to Scott Brinker to shed additional light on our operating performance and acquisition and disposition activities. Scott?", "Scott Brinker", "Okay, thank you, Tom. Good morning to everyone. Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September, we closed the $1.15 billion vintage acquisition, highlighting our focus on best-in-class real estate. The acquisition solidifies our number-one market share in Northern and Southern California. Both of these markets have outstanding supply and demand fundamentals.", "We chose to bring in three existing operating partners, SRG, Sunrise, and Silverado to add their unsurpassed local market expertise. Together we will create a lot of value in these communities.", "And second, this morning we reported a number of dispositions. We've always been an active portfolio manager. That includes selling nearly $1 billion of skilled nursing over the past few years.", "Those efforts continued last quarter as we sold a non-Genesis skilled portfolio in the Southeast for $300 million. We realized $140 million gain on sale and a 13% unlevered IRR. We have also substantially repositioned our relationship with Genesis in a way that is beneficial to both parties.", "So far in the fourth quarter we have closed on the sale of $1.2 billion of real estate previously leased to Genesis in two separate transactions. We've also signed a definitive agreement to contribute a third Genesis portfolio into a joint venture with Cindat and Union Life.", "Cindat is a China-based institutional investor specializing in overseas real estate and Union Life is one of the leading insurance companies in China. Together they will contribute cash for a 75% interest in the venture and Welltower will retain the other 25%.", "The joint venture also includes 11 seniors housing properties that we currently leased to Brookdale. Those 11 assets are being contributed at a $45 million gain above our original purchase price for the properties.", "The joint venture is valued at $930 million, roughly 70% of which represents Genesis assets. This is another example of us bringing first-time cross-border capital into the sector to accomplish our strategic objectives.", "These three Genesis sales aggregate to $1.7 billion in proceeds to Welltower and have a blended cap rate of 9%. The sale price is $180 million above the price we paid for these assets in 2011 and will realize a mid 9% unlevered IRR.", "Importantly, our long-term post-acute payment coverage will improve because we're selling properties with low coverage. Genesis credit will improve because the leases within new buyers have lower rent and escalators that exist today. The terms of our remaining Genesis master lease will not change, including 3% escalators and at 2032 maturity date.", "To further strengthen the relationship we\u2019ve also signed a letter of understanding that has two components. First, Genesis will have the right to buy back certain properties from the Welltower master lease. Second, we will jointly market the real estate and operations of 14 non-core properties. These two transactions should generate 600 plus million of additional proceeds to Welltower in 2017 and further improve out private pay mix and tenant diversification.", "Below the headlines our unique relationship-based business model continues without interruption. We are known for owning high-barrier real estate, which is true, but it's the breadth and depth of these relationships that make our strategy so hard to replicate.", "More than 20 of the leading operators in the sector come to us first when they find an opportunity in their local markets. More and more institutional capital is flowing in the sector, so the ability to get a first look is invaluable. As an example, last quarter we exercised purchase options on two recently stabilized senior housing properties developed and operated by a longtime partner for an attractive 7.25% cap rate.", "Turning to operating results, we delivered a solid quarter, given the environment. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio was 2.2%, rental rates were up 4%, and occupancy increased 70 basis points over the prior year. This allowed us to offset higher labor costs, which were a headwind as expected.", "Pricing power is critically important right now and that means owning a lot of real estate in markets like California. It's also important to understand that, unlike many other real estate sectors the new supply in seniors housing is more heavily concentrated in low-barrier markets. In fact, the percentage increase in new supply in our core markets has been less than the remainder of the country in every single year that NIC has tracked the data.", "To that point, the industry data shows the broad-brush commentary about the sector is misleading. And quarter after quarter in our own portfolio we see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets.", "Turning to medical office, we\u2019ve been allocating capital to this business for the past 10 years. Today we are one of the largest owners in the sector. We have always liked the outpatient business because of its convenience for customers and its low cost for payers and providers. We shelf manage virtually the entire portfolio.", "Mike Noto and his team are invaluable when underwriting new investments, as their market knowledge is unsurpassed. They also do a terrific job creating steady, predictable growth. Last quarter same-store NOI grew 2.5%, consistent with prior quarters. That platform is also scalable, evidenced by increased operating margins as we've grown the portfolio.", "Moving to triple net seniors housing, same-store NOI increased 2.6% and payment coverage continues to move higher through improved operating performance and active portfolio management. The long-term post-acute portfolio had another strong quarter. Same-store NOI increased 3.4%. Payment coverage should improve by roughly 10 basis points upon completion of the 2016 dispositions, creating an even more secure income stream for Welltower.", "I want to wrap up by sincerely thanking the Welltower team as well as our operating partners. The past few quarters, in particular, have required trust and perseverance. It was exhausting but also a lot of fun to watch them together rise to the challenge. The true test of a relationship.", "And now, over to Scott Estes.", "Scott Estes", "My comments today focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are the culmination of the capital allocation plan we've been discussing with all of you throughout 2016, which should importantly provide the following three benefits.", "First, we will significantly strengthen our balance sheet, with leverage and credit metrics improving to the strongest levels in the modern history of the company. Second, we will enhance the quality of our portfolio, increasing our private pay mix in reducing our long-term care exposure. And third, we will improve our liquidity and financial flexibility in 2017 with our full $3 billion line of credit available, virtually no near-term debt maturities and an expected improvement in our cost of capital.", "I will begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our third-quarter financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rate and one addition we made to the supplement this quarter.", "In terms of third-quarter earnings, we did our normalized FFO of $1.16 per share and 4% versus last year and normalized fit of $1.04 per share, which increased 5% versus last year. The results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $2.6 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters. The highlight of the quarter was closing the $1.15 billion vintage portfolio acquisition earlier than anticipated.", "G&A of $36.8 million for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. We recognize the significant $162 million of gains on sale. We did have $9.7 million of impairments associated with three small assets that are held for sale based on current price expectations. I think otherwise this was a fairly straight forward quarterly report.", "Moving on to dividends, we will pay our 182nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 21 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our sizable disposition expectations were a significant consideration as we set our dividend policy for 2017. Based on the strength of our platform and confidence in our longer term earnings growth potential beyond 2017, we are announcing a 1.2% increase in our 2017 dividend payment rate today that will commence with the February payment.", "We also made one notable addition to the supplement this quarter, which is on the bottom of Page 16, where we are now providing the NOI contribution from the 13 core markets that comprise 57% of our idea portfolio.", "Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, the most significant capital event this quarter was our decision to opportunistically raise a total of $358 million of equity through a combination of our ATM and the RIP programs, where we issued a total of 4.7 million shares at an average price of $6.98 per share. We also generated $489 million of proceeds, through $60 million in loan payoffs and $429 million of property sales, which included $162 million in gains on sale.", "Last, we did repay approximately $191 million of secure debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and we issued our assumed $79 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.7%.", "However, really the biggest story today is how we expect to improve our balance sheet upon completion of our portfolio repositioning plan. Importantly, we expect to use $2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion in disposition proceeds expected in the fourth quarter to pay down debt and preferred stock. This will greatly strengthen our balance sheet on a pro forma basis. More specifically, net debt to underappreciated book capitalization will decline by roughly four percentage points to the 34% area.", "Net debt adjusted EBITDA will decline to approximately 5.1 times and interest and fix charge coverage will improve to 4.4 times and 3.6 times respectively. Most importantly, these balance sheet enhancements should improve our cost of capital, allow us to be entirely self funding over the near-term and provide considerable financial flexibility and optionality for the company over the next several years.", "I was also excited that S&P recognized our improving balance sheet strength with the rating increase this morning which brings Welltower to the BBB+ equivalent rating with all three agencies.", "I\u2019ll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our 2016 guidance does include an addition of $314 million of acquisitions and loans, at a 7.2% blended yield expected to close in the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t normally provide future acquisitions in our guidance, but we\u2019re doing so this quarter to allow us to provide the pro forma detail for the expected use of disposition proceeds that\u2019s included in our portfolio repositioning press release.", "In regard to dispositions we\u2019ve increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $4.1 billion from the previous $1.3 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $832 million in proceeds received through the third quarter, plus the remaining $3.3 billion detailed in our portfolio repositioning release.", "As the $3.3 billion is comprised of approximately $1.9 billion of proceeds from long-term care postacute assets, $1.2 billion from senior housing triple net assets, $51 million from senior housing operating assets and 151 \u2013 excuse me $150 million in loan repayments.", "In terms of our same-store NOI growth, as Tom mentioned, we increasing the low end of our full-year guidance to a range of 3% to 3.25% from the previous range of 2.75% to 3.25%. And I think while you always see some variance from quarter-to-quarter, in our same store results we think it\u2019s increasingly important that everyone focused on the consistency and stability of our same store results on an annual basis. I would note that our senior housing operating portfolio in particular has again demonstrated its consistency this year, generating meaningful occupancy and REVPOR increases in the phase of significant industry supply and expense growth headwind.", "We continue to effectively mange our G&A expenses and now anticipate that we should come in at or slightly below the low end our original 2016 guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. And with only one quarter remaining in 2016, we\u2019re revising our 2016 normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.50 to $4.56 per share. And normalized FAD guidance to a range of $3.99 to $4.05 per share, representing 3% and 4% increases respectively at the mid-point. The slight reduction in our FFO mid-point is primarily a function of the increase in our disposition guidance, while the FAD increase is primarily a result of lower CapEx in previously projected.", "So in conclusion we look forward to the continued execution of portfolio repositioning plan and will provide additional detail on asset sales and debt repurchases as they occur over the next several months. Most importantly, our portfolio repositioning efforts will significantly improve the long-term growth profile of our portfolio while dramatically improving the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility heading into 2017.", "So with that Tom, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for some closing comments.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks Scott. So before we open up for questions I like to leave you with the following thought. The announcements that we made this morning further enhance Welltower\u2019s unique opportunity to deploy real estate capital behind the most compelling demographic trend we have seen, the aging of the population.", "We have fresh capital, we institutional partners of sector leading balance sheet and an unmatched relationship investment model. We could not be more excited about our future.", "Now Holly, please open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Juan Sanabria", "Hi, good morning, guys. Congratulations on getting a lot done during the quarter maybe I think the first question for Scott. If you could just give us sense of kind of the run rate for FFO post the sales. And you talked a little bit about the dividend, but what the pro forma payout ratio is and why you feel comfortable with that reset number.", "Scott Brinker", "Sure, Juan. Thanks for the question. I do think we provided quite a good bit of detail in regard to sources and uses to provide the pretty good run rate. You can see the disposition proceeds of $3.274 billion and then the specific uses. That's really the numbers I think everyone should use to start thinking about 2017. We will provide guidance in February. Once we get all the models and everything done at that point.", "The one thing that will benefit 2017 are a couple things beyond what's just in this press release, though. As a reminder, obviously you should model same-store NOI growth. We are going to have some development conversions, and obviously it doesn't include any acquisitions as well. So we give you a fourth-quarter number effectively with our guidance this year and I think I would just model off the in-place NOI from the numbers we give you in the release.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay. And then on the SNF dispositions, is the cap rate you guys quoted, 9%, is that affected at all by any rate cuts that the buyers have received, or is that the cap rate, i.e., loss NOI to Welltower? And if you would give us a sense of the delta on the reset rents?", "Scott Brinker", "Sure, Juan. It's Scott Brinker. Thanks for listening today. So the cap rate that we quoted is based on the in-place rent that exist today under the current master lease divided by the purchase price from the third party, so pretty straightforward. In terms of the rent adjustment that Genesis received, a goal all along here was to create a better relationship, stronger relationship between Welltower and Genesis and to improve Genesis credit.", "So I think we were able to come up with a pretty creative way to accomplish that in that we agreed with Genesis and the third-party buyers to essentially reduce the rent going forward by about 5% on both portfolios, so that's about $8 million of year one rent. And in exchange for that, Genesis gave us a note with a four-year term that bears interest at a 10% rate, but a good part of that is payable in kind versus in cash. They have a sizable cash flow benefit in year one from this transaction, not to mention materially lower increases going forward.", "So one of the challenges in the Genesis portfolio has been a 3.5% lease escalators for the last five years, which George and his team frankly have done an amazing job of keeping up with because our payment coverage has been basically flat for five years now after the big Medicare cut. But it's tough; I mean Medicare and Medicaid rates are growing 1-ish percent per year at best, plus the occupancy challenges in the business \u2013 it's tough to keep up with that kind of an escalator.", "So when the new leases with the new buyers, they have agreed to 2% or below escalators for the next 15 years. So that over time there's a meaningful benefit to Genesis.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just to wrap that up, did you guys \u2013 there was no reset to your remaining rents or changes to the escalator; correct? If you wouldn't mind giving us any price per bed that was implied by the transactions?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. On your first question, that's correct. The remaining Welltower master lease is unchanged, so no change in rent, no change in escalator, no change in maturity date. And the price per bed \u2013 in the aggregate it was probably $160,000-plus per bed. I know it by portfolio but I don't have the aggregate number off the top of my head. But it was in that range. And these are high quality properties and generate a lot of cash flow, so the price per bed is quite high.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great. And maybe just one last question, if you don't mind, for Scott Estes. Obviously, a much lower levered balance sheet and a position to grow. How should we think about the target range of where you could re-lever to and where you feel comfortable and maybe just where you think acquisition cap rates will be to think about using that firepower?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. The reality is I think we've reset the balance sheet to some extent. I feel really good about those new leverage metrics, the 34% to 35% area is a great one for net debt to underappreciated book. And they like the lower fives on the debt to EBITDA. So obviously resulting fixed charge and interest coverages are good.", "And at the end of the day, we will capitalize on acquisition opportunities first and foremost with our existing partners but don't have to. And the key word here is really optionality, in my opinion. I think we have great optionality where the balance sheet is.", "And maybe, Scott, I don't know if you want to comment on just cap rates and what you are maybe seeing in the current market in terms of pricing?", "Scott Brinker", "Juan, I would just say at the beginning of the year we told people that this was a year to be extremely disciplined, just given where the market is from an operating environment and where we believe our cost of capital is relative to our NAV.", "So we have been pretty selective about what we bought. Our acquisition volumes are lower this year than they have been as long as I can remember. But that's not because of lack of opportunity, that's because of conscious decisions we've made.", "And even though, we now have a substantial free cash flow on our balance sheet, I don't think our mindset is going to change. There are deals that make a lot of sense, virtually all of them with existing partners in our core markets. Some of that is in the fourth-quarter acquisition guidance that we gave this morning.", "But outside of that I don't think you should expect us to change our approach that we shared in the last three quarters, which is to be really, really disciplined in this environment.", "Juan Sanabria", "Thank you, guys. Congrats on getting all this done.", "Scott Brinker", "Thanks, Juan.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord Genuity.", "Paul Morgan", "Hi, good morning. Maybe give a little bit of an update on what you're seeing in terms of your external growth, your acquisition pipeline looking forward. Obviously it's been a very busy quarter or two in terms of structure in these asset sales. But now you have closed Vintage. And as you look into 2017, what does the opportunity set look like? And I think, based on your comments, we should think about post-close the 2017 external growth being on a leverage-neutral basis?", "Scott Estes", "Yes. The outlook is favorable in that we have 20-plus operating partners in senior sizing alone that are regularly coming to us with opportunities. Right now a lot of that is actually redevelopment where we may provide a portion of the capital to help them get the project up and running and then we have a purchase option when the project stabilizes. That is a run rate volume of $500 million plus of modern, purpose-built properties that we get the first right on. And then occasionally we have an opportunity like Vintage that we work in tandem with one or more operating partners to fill out their existing core footprint.", "And you should expect us to look to do more of those types of investments. There are a few, handful of operators in our core countries in U.S., Canada and the UK that we're still looking to establish as new partners and bring into the portfolio. So we have our targets and we are building those relationships.", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, just picking up on Scott's point Paul, one thing we consistently remind people of is that this large portfolio of operators that are part of the Welltower family still own real estate that we don't own. And that provides us somewhat of an annuity stream of high-quality investment opportunities.", "And again, our operators are typically the dominant regional players in the best markets in the country. And those markets behave differently than a lot of the secondary markets where a lot of the new supply is coming into. So they still see good growth opportunities. Our strategy we talked about on the last call is to continue to go deep in the top markets in the U.S. And so we still see very good opportunities in the senior care business.", "Scott talked about some development opportunities because there are markets like Manhattan, where the product does not exist for us to acquire. So we are developing it. And I think we will see some interesting opportunities that will come from other sectors of healthcare delivery, where we like the medical office business and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow that business because not only are we a good acquirer, we also have an excellent management company based down in Jupiter, Florida.", "Paul Morgan", "Thanks. And then just my other question. You've obviously spoken to a lot of kind of new institutional capital investors in looking at healthcare real estate over the past few quarters as well as your ongoing relationships. But, I mean, do you have any kind of takeaways from the disposition process with respect to Genesis and kind of the conversations you had? How deep and kind of how broad are the pockets that are increasingly looking at healthcare real estate right now?", "Scott Brinker", "We see lots of interest. As I mentioned in my remarks, we received significant inbound interest by private investors in owning post-acute long-term care assets as well as senior housing assets. So we are seeing continued interest from private capital sources to build positions in healthcare real estate.", "Scott Estes", "Maybe the one addition would be is the foreign institutional capital comes into U.S. healthcare real estate for the first time, almost across the board their first question is, do you have a portfolio or an opportunity on the East or West Coast? They always ask that question. You never hear that question from U.S. buyers, especially in seniors housing, medical office. Nobody cares, right?", "And that's why we've said it for years, there is no \u2013 very little differential in cap rate when you look at differences in asset class, building quality and particularly location. Everything is sort of the same. And our view is that that's going to change pretty dramatically.", "You've seen that in other real estate sectors, where there's a huge difference in cap rate among building in New York/New Jersey, in California or secondary location in middle America. There's no question that healthcare real estate is going to move in that direction in our portfolio and operating partners are going to benefit from that because the foreign capital is coming in a major way, and that's the thing they care about. You see, again, huge pricing differential in other real estate classes. We don't yet see that in our sector but it's coming.", "Scott Brinker", "The other point on foreign capital coming in, which I'll make with respect to Cindat, China has the same aging demographic issues that we have in the United States except it's amplified there because of the size of the population. We believe one of the reasons that Cindat was attracted to forming this joint venture with us is that they want to learn how to invest in this asset class because it has relevance to what will happen back in their home country.", "And the other piece of this is that Genesis has a business in China. And so that's also important here. So, there are lots of synergies at play here for Cindat forming the joint venture with Welltower and acquiring an interest in Genesis assets.", "Paul Morgan", "Great. That's great color, thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Hey, good morning everyone. I just want to stick with the Genesis asset sales. I guess, can you just talk about a little bit about how the decision to include certain assets was in the disposition pool versus the key pool? And what does the profile look like for the stuff that will remain going forward?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes, Vince. Hey, it\u2019s Scott. That's a great question. I think we spent more time on that particular topic than we did in picking the buyers that we chose to go forward with. So the concept with all the buyers that we talked to is that the properties that they bought would be a representative pool of assets. So we decided to keep all nine powerbacks in the Welltower master lease, so those are not included. But the traditional Genesis long-term-care properties have been allocated among the Cindat joint venture, the Lindsay Goldberg purchase, the Genesis buyback portfolio and the remaining Welltower master lease in a way that everybody gets a broad cross-section of assets.", "So nobody cherry picked for the positive and nobody got cherry picked to the negative. And we all looked at a very comprehensive asset quality scoring metric that included things like building age, operating margin, occupancy, quality mix, star ratings and clinical outcomes so that everybody felt like they got a representative sample of assets.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, thanks for that. And of the 7% that remains, how much is that \u2013 does that break down between power backing and traditional?", "Scott Estes", "Well, the percentage would be \u2013 I\u2019ll have to get back to you with the exact number, but the percentage is probably roughly 20% power back, 80% long-term-care, if we are able to execute on the $600 million plus of additional 2017 dispositions that we talk about in the press release. But I\u2019ll get back to you with the specific percentage.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, that\u2019s great. And maybe another question just on the sources and uses \u2013 that was very helpful in terms of outlining exactly how that breaks down. But I was just curious; on the debt repayments and some of the preferred stuff, how should we think about timing of that? Are you going to be able to do that all at the end of the year? And I guess should we expect some FDA prepayment penalties?", "Scott Estes", "We are going to do it as quickly as possible, as the proceeds comment. And we will keep you updated, I think, probably just modeling-wise most of it you can generally assume at the end of year in terms of the run rate. The one piece for sure, the preferred stock redemption, is in March 2017. And the reason we put the $48 million of aggregated debt extinguishment and other costs in there \u2013 that\u2019s the number you asked about. So that ties that to the same uses as the proceeds.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Yes. ", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Market.", "Michael Carroll", "Yes, thanks. Scott, was there a difference in the cap rate among the three Genesis portfolio sales? I believe it was announced the Lindsay Goldberg purchase had an initial cap rate of about 9.4%. I mean how does that relate to the 9% that you guys quoted?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, there was some differential. I can\u2019t comment specifically on what Omega reported; I\u2019ll leave that to them. But in terms of the cap rate as we view it, there was a differential, and a couple of things drove that. One, the asset quality was the same, so that was not the issue. But there was a timing issue in that Lindsay Goldberg was the first to step up. That\u2019s why they are the first one to close. They bought a bigger portfolio, which was relevant. It wasn\u2019t easy to finance; that\u2019s a lot of money to raise in today\u2019s environment. So that was meaningful to us.", "And the last thing I would point out is that they bought 100% interest. So it was a free and clear purchase versus a retained interest. But frankly, we\u2019re pretty happy about the joint venture with Cindat because it gives us a lot of optionality. After five years, either party is able to create a liquidity event that we could either take more or exit the portfolio. And we are going in with the expectation we are going to grow the partnership with Cindat and Union Life. But it\u2019s nice to have that optionality. So I think that mix of structures is actually quite beneficial to our shareholders.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And what about the potential Genesis sales in 2017? Is there a type of an agreement you have with the tenant about the $120 million of non-core sales and the cap rates that you would give them for the rank credit? And is there a discussion on the cap rate for the $500 million of potential buybacks that the tenant has?", "Scott Estes", "There is, and it would be in line if not a bit below the 9% cap rate that we reported today on the dispositions.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then finally, can you talk a bit about the remaining exposure you have to Genesis in the post-acute care facilities? Are you comfortable with your exposure now or would you like to reduce that further?", "Scott Estes", "We have very publicly stated that it is our intention to grow our private pay mix. So you should expect to see us continue to grow that by acquisition and in some cases by disposition.", "Michael Carroll", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thanks for taking the questions and my thanks as well. I\u2019m sure you guys did a lot over the last quarter do get this done, lot of moving parts. Just first question, just picking off of the last comment about growing private pay, can you maybe just update us? I think the portfolios out there for the large caps are probably more different today than they have been in recent past. And I\u2019m just trying to understand, having post-acute in your portfolio, how do you view that, whether it\u2019s even smaller for me or not but just your view on is it important to be part of a diversified portfolio like you guys have?", "Scott Brinker", "We believe that it is still important to have some investment in the post-acute care space. If you talk to the leading hospital systems in this country, they will tell you that they are very interested in having a viable post-acute care option to work with as they look to their futures because post-acute care is a much lower-cost setting than the inpatient hospital setting. So we believe this is not going away. And we also believe that post-acute care in the future may look different than the historic skilled nursing model that you are familiar with.", "So Scott used a word that we often use around here called optionality. We are a long-term investor in healthcare real estate. And we want to maintain optionality to be opportunistic and deploy capital across the spectrum if we believe it\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, great. And then just on senior housing triple net sales, the 6-3 cap was pretty impressive. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us some flavor of type of assets, what percent were maybe below uncovered and sort of what prompted the sale overall.", "Scott Estes", "Sure. It\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. One is that we think this is an opportunistic time to be a seller in the seniors housing market. And secondarily, these are portfolios that are not a perfect fit for our strategy at this point. They are operators that, generally speaking, we are not growing with and therefore we are probably better off freeing them up to grow their business with a different capital partner. And it helps to have an existing portfolio to bring to the table for that. And for the most part these have quite low payment coverage. So we are optimistic that the triple net senior housing portfolio that we have left will have improved credit metrics and payment coverage than what we had before.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Do you have a pro forma coverage post this?", "Scott Estes", "Vik, it\u2019s not going to move materially, in any event, when you think about just the size of that denominator. But our hope would be that it\u2019s moving up 1, 2, 3 basis points, which it has been the past couple of quarters. After a number of years of steady decline, driven by one operator in particular, we are now finally trending up because we have some development projects stabilizing and we have been able to remove some of these lower covering master leases.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, thanks. And just a last quick one on the shop portfolio \u2013 within expenses there\u2019s an all other bucket that includes, I think, 8%. Can you give us some sense of what\u2019s in there and what led to that increase?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, I can. One is management fees. So we generally pay a base 5% management fee to our operating partners. And there are always incentives up and down based on their performance. It\u2019s also things like insurance, professional fees, workers compensation.", "So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve said this before, including the first quarter, when we reported 5.5% NOI growth, and I\u2019ll say it again this quarter, when we generated 2.2% NOI growth, is that 90 days is just too short a period of time to make conclusions about performance of the portfolio or trend or trajectory.", "It just \u2013 $1 million is not much money in the scheme of things, and yet it moves the same-store growth rate by 50 basis points. So small accruals, adjustments that typically happen and, they are unpredictable, move that number a lot.", "So by the same argument I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that other line item this quarter. The fact is operating expenses are driven by labor; that 60% or so of the total operating cost. And we have been saying for over a year now that labor costs are the headwind. That\u2019s the biggest challenge that our portfolio is facing. And today, our operators, our properties have done a remarkable job offsetting that cost pressure.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay, great. And this is for Scott Estes but also the whole team. I think it\u2019s just a comment from my side. It\u2019s pretty impressive, given all the portfolio activity you\u2019ve had, to take the dividend up 1.5% for next year. So congrats, guys.", "Scott Estes", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Another very busy quarter for you guys \u2013 so to anyone in the room, if you had done this Genesis sale two, two and half years ago you probably would have gotten an A cap on it. And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a precise number, but clearly things have gotten \u2013 question marks have come to the table and it has resulted maybe in a little tougher sell there.", "And I\u2019m wondering if anything about this is a teaching moment and if you kind of should be thinking a few more steps forward on a go-forward basis. For example, it seems -- you mentioned the escalators coming down on the sold Genesis portfolio but yours are staying at 3. Is there any reason to think about that more proactively and saying maybe we should be re-assessing our escalator for the next 16 years with Genesis or anything like that, that you think is more on the forward thinking docket for you now, having had this experience with the Genesis situation?", "Scott Brinker", "Well, I\u2019ll just start off by saying that I think we are a very forward-thinking organizations. And we take a long-term view of our investments, and we own and manage a diversified portfolio of healthcare investments. So that will not change. We don\u2019t have crystal balls. We try and make as sound investment decisions as we can, and I think we have a pretty good track record of that.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And so \u2013 and no argument on your process. I\u2019m speaking just specifically on the Genesis sale and if \u2013 again, how does Genesis produce a situation where they will do better than 3% growth over the next 16 years versus your escalator? I\u2019m just curious if you are giving that any thought at all.", "Scott Brinker", "One of our goals in selling assets out of the portfolio was to have a remaining Genesis portfolio that had better coverage so that there was a broader cushion. And to the point earlier, they have actually kept up with the escalator to date. So the rent payment to HCN is going to be more than cut in half as a product of these transactions. So we are confident that they will continue to pay us the 3% escalator.", "Rich Anderson", "All right. To Scott Estes, you gave some guidelines about timing of use of proceeds, the preferred redemption maybe in the first quarter, but everything else kind of back end with the exception of the acquisitions and dispositions this quarter. You kind of do that math and you get to some meaningful dilution at least in the short-term and you\u2019re raising the dividend. I\u2019m not going to ask you to put a number on that dilution, but your I\u2019m just curious, are you looking at payout ratio being temporarily at the very high end of a comfort level next year and expecting a returns a more normalized level in 2018 and beyond. Is that the way you\u2019re thinking about the dividend.", "Scott Brinker", "I think, it\u2019s fair, Rich, like again, I would go back to the answer of we [indiscernible] that you hear that does get you to the run rate, net sources and leases. My point would be that as you start to think about 2017, we have normal same-store NOI growth acquisitions development, conversions et cetera, that will offset some of that potential dilution. But you\u2019re absolutely right. We don\u2019t want to do a need your dividend policy reaction what\u2019s based on an awesome long-term growth potential for the company.", "The balance sheet just made a few humongous forward, full line of credit available you can think about all the optionality again that we\u2019ve been talking about. When we talked [indiscernible] over the next three years, let\u2019s look at what the earnings power of the company is and we think it\u2019s very significant. So we concluded that a slight increase was right for next year and I think, it\u2019s more important to think about that context in the bigger picture.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, and then, another maybe one for Mr. DeRosa. The increased exposure now almost entirely private pay, you another has are kind of jumping on this private pay than [indiscernible] I\u2019m just curious what are the risks in going so, far field in that direction when you think about a very uncertain economy, you become much more kind of tethered to worse case some of type recession or something like that. What do you doing for managed that issue given going so far deeply into the private payroll.", "Tom DeRosa", "I think you have to look at the markets where we concentrate capital and I think that that\u2019s the markets where population is moving, where there is job growth. We see that strategy as \u2013 in terms of concentrating our assets in centers of wealth as a mitigant. But we are also what the opinion that healthcare will be moving much more in a private pay direction, that, in the future, those who can pay for their health care will be shouldering a bigger percentage of their healthcare costs. We know that Medicare is quite challenged and not prepared for the aging demographic that we are going to see over the next \u2013 over the coming decades.", "So we believe that the markets that we are focused in, delivering a product that is a premium product for the upper end of the market who will have no choice as they age other than to seek alternative residential setting to live productively. So we see this business as not a nice-too but I must-have enrich.", "We don\u2019t know what that world looks like, we\u2019ve never experienced a world where the 85-plus percentage of population will start to dominate. And so we think that staying at the top end of that market is a good place to be long-term.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And then last question for me \u2013 and Brinker touched on this when you talked about optionality in the joint venture. Is it a fair way to think about this is so post-acute skilled is going through a week uncertain patch right now, but longer term it could be a great business again, depending on how it evolves. And so if you get down to 11% or 12% of your portfolio is post-acute skilled but giving yourself the optionality to get back, are you timing this in some ways where you think ultimately this is a good business and don\u2019t want to leave it, and that\u2019s the mindset that you might have to take a few steps back and then a few steps forward? Is that how you are thinking about post-acute on call it a 10-year horizon type of time frame?", "Scott Brinker", "Yes. We\u2019re trying to look forward, so I think you just summed it up well.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.", "Mike Mueller", "Hi, thanks. I just had a couple of quick follow-ups on asset sales, Tom. I heard your comments about trying to reduce further exposure via acquisitions and maybe some asset sales. But can you help us try to put some brackets around dispositions for 2017? It sounds like you have another $600 million here of skilled nursing tied to Genesis. In the past you\u2019ve talked about normalized calling of call it maybe $300 million-$400 million of just normal-course stuff. So should we think of a base case for 2017 as being that $600 million, because it\u2019s highly likely, plus a few hundred more to get you to $1 billion or so? Is that reasonable?", "Tom DeRosa", "Mike, that sounds like a reasonable assumption. I think we are giving you a little bit more clarity than we normally do because we\u2019ve talked about the Genesis portfolio. So we are constantly looking at our assets. We own about a little over 1,500 buildings today, and we have very dedicated asset management, a very dedicated asset management function here. So we are always looking at the real estate we own and the markets that we are in and trying to make as educated a decision about which assets we want to own for the long-term because that could change every year.", "So we do the best we can here. I think you\u2019ve seen some of the systems that we\u2019ve built here to better assess the long-term viability of the assets we own in the markets that we are in. So I would say we will always, as we have in the past, dispose of assets in a year. And we will continue to do that in the future. And I think that your assumption is probably a good one.", "Mike Mueller", "Got it. And last follow-up on this \u2013 for the $500 million option for Genesis, what do you think would cause them not to exercise that?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, they have to raise the capital to do it. So with this announcement and continued stable operating results, their stock price recovers. One of the benefits at the time of going public two years ago was that they would have liquidity to raise equity to buy back assets. So that clearly hasn\u2019t gone as planned today, but our expectation and hope is that the stock will start to rebound as they announce important transactions like this one and stabilize the operations.", "And they may raise joint venture capital. I think they have a number of options, but that would be the biggest one. They clearly like the buildings, so that you diligence and underwriting isn\u2019t a problem; they just need to raise money. But clearly, a major institution\u2019s choosing to own Genesis real estate doesn\u2019t hurt the story that Scott just outlined. That should all be a positive reflection on Genesis.", "Scott Estes", "And they can finally turn their attention to that opportunity. They have been bending over backwards to help us, and we will forever be grateful, to help us get these transactions done. They can only do so many things at once. They are an operating business, not a transaction business. So they have been super helpful and cooperative. This is a good deal for both companies. And now they will be able to focus on the $500 million buyback, which is a great opportunity for them.", "Mike Mueller", "Okay, thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Thank you. I had a question on the changing landscape in senior housing. So over the last couple days there have been at least two new private capital sources entering the senior housing market, acquiring at about the 7% cap rate. But at the same time, when you look at Brookdale\u2019s share price, it suggests a dislocation between public and private market values. And given they are one of your major partners, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something that you could do bigger with Brookdale.", "Scott Brinker", "Brookdale has a large footprint in senior housing in this country. And they are dealing with challenges that relate to the emeritus transaction. We are always looking for opportunities in the senior care space, and there may be opportunities that come from Brookdale or some other senior care operators in the U.S. that are not currently part of the Welltower family of brands.", "We like the space. We believe in the long-term viability of the space. And we, every day, look for opportunities to make smart investments in the space.", "Scott Estes", "And I would just add -- I think it\u2019s important the way we look at transactions always would be like the Genesis. We would want transactions that would be a win for Welltower as well as a win for our partners. That\u2019s the way we would approach any operator relationship.", "John Kim", "And I think Tom mentioned Cindat's interest in Genesis assets, and that's partially due to their business in China. But what about their interest in Brookdale? Was that specific to Brookdale? Did you bring those assets forward to them, or do they want an interest in the national operator like Brookdale?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, I think, like Genesis, I would say that again Cindat's and Union Life's investment here is to understand how to invest in this sector, and that's not just skilled nursing; it's also seniors housing. If we have a need, a long-term need for good quality senior care in this country, they've got it. They've got it on the multiply higher perspective. So, Scott?", "Scott Brinker", "That's exactly right. They want to invest with a best-in-class capital partner and high-quality, well-known operating partners. And Brookdale and Genesis clearly fit that bill. These are 11 high-quality properties, mostly on the West Coast, that have continued to perform well. So they have not been as challenged as some of the other, maybe, portfolios or properties that Brookdale is working through right now. So that's the background.", "John Kim", "Okay. And given the joint ventures you have established in the past year and, I think, your focus on increasing scale, will you be more focused on AUM growth going forward rather than balance sheet asset growth? Or is balance sheet asset acquisition still a major part of your strategy?", "Scott Brinker", "It will be both.", "Operator", "All right. And our next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Chad, your line is open. Okay. And our next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "Hi, thanks. Just on the theme of the joint venture, can you share some of the details about the exit or buyout options that exist for you guys within the JV?", "Scott Brinker", "I don't want to get into the details of the joint venture, but it's pretty straightforward. After five years there's a mutual right to seek liquidity rights. So going in with the expectation we are going to do more with Union Life and Cindat, but it's nice to know for both of us that that's there if we choose to change our exposure to the postacute space five years from now, one way or the other.", "Todd Stender", "And then on acquisitions, is it limited to just the U.S.? Is this something that you could enter China with one of the partners or both? What constraints or what opportunities exist?", "Scott Brinker", "We see tremendous opportunities in the markets that we already have a foothold in. One of the things we've said \u2013 we're not prepared to go into markets unless we are prepared to put significant boots on the ground like we have in the UK and like we have in Toronto. And actually we are putting significant boots on the ground in Los Angeles, because of the percentage of assets that we will own that are in Southern California.", "So we see lots of opportunities in those markets and we are not very actively looking for opportunities outside of those markets.", "Todd Stender", "Okay, thanks, Tom. And then just to stay with you, Tom, if you don't mind, you've touched on Brookdale's large national footprint. In that theme and consistent with how you allocated operators to certain markets around the country like you did with the recent California acquisition, do you see operators becoming more sharpshooters like the Silverados or the Brandywines, as opposed to more national operators?", "Tom DeRosa", "That's a good question, Todd. I do think so. I think that you will see some of these operators may be expandable a little bit across state borders. Some of them were just in one given state with great concentration. I think you'll see some of them expand regionally. But I would say, other than Sunrise and Brookdale, we don't see any of our operators having great aspirations to develop a national footprint.", "We think there are a lot of benefits in having a deep position in quality markets, and that's what we like to see.", "Todd Stender", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi Research.", "Michael Bilerman", "It's Michael Bilerman with Smedes. Scott Estes, I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit more clarity in terms of the run rates. And as you said, the fourth quarter implied we can get to, which is about $1.05 to $1.10, $1.11. But obviously the timing of the dispositions and the reinvestment of those proceeds has a significant effect to where you are, sort of December 31, on a quarterly basis.", "And so what would be really helpful is just to understand what that quarterly number is, where our starting point is from an annualized perspective heading into 2017.", "Scott Estes", "I understand the desire for clarity. I think I've got to stick with our numbers. We have a blended yield on disposition proceeds right there at 8%, you have a blended yield you can calculate. I would assume that all of the proceeds come in right at year-end and then, obviously, we are going to work as fast as we can. So you could make some general assumptions on some of the things like secured debt may take a few months to pay off, and the preferred stock, as I mentioned, is March.", "But that's really the way you are going to get the run rate from the number you just cited for the fourth quarter. And I would tell you, more importantly, the first quarter really isn't that important. We're going to get all these things done. We have all the benefits attendant. We are going to work as fast as we can to give you updates and there's a lot of things that will help 2017's earnings that I mentioned like the same-store NOI growth and development in acquisitions. So we'll give you the full update in February.", "Michael Bilerman", "So again, just doing simple math, you have about $0.09 of quarterly dilution. So how much of that \u2013 it sounds like most of that $0.09 is not in the $1.05 to $1.11 in the fourth quarter.", "And the only reason I'm asking \u2013 the Street is at $4.70 for next year. Clearly, with almost $0.40 of dilution from doing this and potential other dilution from these sales into next year, again putting aside all the benefits you will get from the development coming online in the same store, there's a significant amount of earnings that will have to come off.", "And I think I just want to better understand how much of that $0.09 of dilution is actually in the $1.05 to $1.11 in the fourth quarter. It sounds like it's nothing.", "Scott Estes", "I would say the way to answer that is we talked about closing $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion of the Genesis transaction that was just announced today, so you have about that amount that's already in the numbers. So assume November 1, and then I would assume the rest of the numbers are roughly at the end of the quarter.", "Michael Bilerman", "Okay. And then from a balance sheet perspective, that's the other part of it in terms of the deleveraging. It sounded like you would rather stay at these levels \u2013 five times debt to EBITDA, mid-30s from a debt to unappreciated book, so that we should expect any future investment should be funded either by increased about all, so leveraging that, or through additional sales or new common equity.", "Is that a fair way to characterize it? Or do you want to have the ability to go back up to the mid-5 debt to EBITDA and towards the 40s debt to unappreciated book? How should we think about the goalposts?", "Scott Estes", "I would think that modeling for everyone generally on a leverage-neutral basis, based on these new numbers, is the way to go. And we obviously would have those options available to us if we saw good options and have always been pretty conservative. But modeling-wise I would say assume leverage neutral, based on these new numbers.", "Michael Bilerman", "And then can you just review a little bit -- the loan receivable book, at least at quarter end per page 20 of the supp, is at $950 million. If memory serves, that excludes the development loans you have outstanding. You have another $150 million coming in, in the fourth quarter, $75 million of which was the note you took back from Genesis. So you're going to be at $1.1 billion.", "Can you review the chunks of that in terms of cash pay versus PIK and any large sort of borrower orders in that $1.1 billion?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, Michael. I'm happy to try to give some color. This big picture is that we rarely, if ever, make loans as a standalone business model. It's always done to support an important real estate relationship.", "In many cases, the loan is secured by real estate and is reflected that way on our balance sheet. The loan balance is a bit higher than it has been in the past at roughly $1 billion. We are actually expecting substantial repayments in the fourth quarter from Genesis and others.", "So I think you will see that loan balance decline going forward, even though we are taking back the $75 million of loans from Genesis. And it should meaningfully decline if you take a longer term view, meaning into the late 2017 time frame.", "Michael Bilerman", "So what's the current yield on that $1 billion? How much is cash pay versus PIK? And if -- because my assumption is if it's producing higher than average earnings, right, so pretty high yield, the reinvestment as that loan balance comes down is another diluted effect to earnings and cash flow.", "Scott Estes", "Yes, that is definitely the case. The yield on most of the loans is in the high single digits, if not 10%, on average. The vast majority, Michael, is cash pay. There are a couple that have PIK interests, including these takeback notes from Genesis. But that's the exception.", "Michael Bilerman", "And is there any concentration within that $1 billion in terms of to a certain borrower? Like what are the top two or three borrowers in that? And how much is real estate versus non-real estate? There's a footnote that says some of it is not real estate.", "Scott Estes", "Yes. By far the biggest amount is with Genesis. So there's the $330 million or so of first mortgage loans on our books as of September 30. That number will continue to decline going forward. And then there's the $72 million term loan that we made to Genesis last quarter that's not secured by real estate.", "And then we will add this additional $75 million note to Genesis here in the fourth quarter. That's by far the biggest component of the $1 billion.", "Scott Brinker", "And the difference between the two you can just see right on the face of the balance sheet. $630 million is the number that's real estate loans with the remainder being the non-real estate loan component.", "Michael Bilerman", "And so there's another $230 million to other operators as loans outside of the $72 million to Genesis?", "Scott Estes", "Correct.", "Michael Bilerman", "Okay. It would be helpful just \u2013 if you like about supplementing disclosure, and we do certainly appreciate the continued improvements in the supplemental, just having, now that it's a much bigger balance at $1 billion relative to your enterprise value, having that level of detail in terms of yields, amounts, borrowers because it is really lacking both in the 10-Q as well as the supplemental.", "Scott Brinker", "That's a good point, so we can look into that. Michael, I'll just give you one example of the loan portfolio that is the $40 million note that was repaid in September, a number of years ago. We had made a loan to an important operating partner to help buying out the old ownership group. And as part of the disposition of that skilled nursing portfolio last quarter, for $300 million they've also extinguished the $40 million note receivable.", "So that's the type of situation, generally speaking, where we have used loans. And we have a very good track record of having them repaid.", "Michael Bilerman", "Yes. Okay, thank you so much.", "Operator", "And our final question today will come from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.", "Karin Ford", "Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the 1.45 times coverage level that you are going to have on the Genesis portfolio post-disposition. Would you consider that to be market coverage and do you feel good about the cushion that you will now have, considering the challenges that are probably ongoing in the industry?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes. I want to start by clarifying a couple of things. One is the coverage that we've talked about is after a management fee. So not everybody reports that way. That's important because the coverage before a management fee is often 40 basis points higher.", "The second verification is that that coverage ratio that you talk about, Karin, is for the entire long-term postacute portfolio. It's not for Genesis in particular. And then as to your specific question, it's 10 basis points higher than it is today, so we are definitely happy about that. We would like it to be higher, but at this point I would say it's above market, not below market.", "And the evidence for that would be two very sophisticated and knowledgeable investors, Lindsay Goldberg and Omega, just bought Genesis assets at roughly 1.3 coverage, plus or minus. So we feel good about having 1.45. We hope it keeps going higher, but it's certainly not below market.", "Karin Ford", "Thanks for that. And then my last question is, were the Genesis notes receivable calculated as part of the 9% cap rate?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, we include those as proceeds in terms of the sales price. That's right.", "Karin Ford", "At the $70 million number?", "Scott Estes", "Correct.", "Karin Ford", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's Welltower third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, Sir.", "Tim McHugh", "Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's fourth quarter 2016 results and outlook for 2017. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and Scott Estes, CFO.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com.", "Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I want to highlight four significant points regarding our 2016 results. One, we realized full-year total portfolio average same-store growth of 3%, at the high-end of our original guidance. All four of our business lines achieved average full-year growth of 2.4% or greater.", "Two, we completed $2.8 billion of dispositions during the year, including $2 billion of postacute facilities which decreased our exposure to postacute as a percentage of total portfolio NOI by 750 basis points since January 1 of 2016 and as a result increased private-pay share of total Company revenue to 93%, the highest level in the history of the Company. Three, we finished the year with under 5.4 times of net debt to EBITDA and a net debt to book capitalization ratio of 37.4%, a reduction of more than 200 basis points during the year. And four, we attained credit ratings upgrades from both Moody's and S&P to BAA1 and BBB+ respectively.", "And, with that, I will have call over to Tom for some remarks on the year and the quarter. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tim. We were pleased with our 2016 results, particularly as it was a transition year. While delivering results at the top end of our most recent guidance, we disposed of $2.8 billion in non-core assets, rebalanced our operator exposure thereby improving our risk profile and we significantly delevered our balance sheet. We began 2017 with a corporate reorganization that is rationalizing and reinventing the way we do our business. This plan is expected to realize a $30 million reduction in G&A from our 2016 guidance. You see we need to adapt the way we do business to respond to the extraordinary opportunity that is before us. It is well-known that healthcare delivery is transitioning from an acute care hospital-focused model to broader outpatient subacute, postacute and senior care networks that can deliver better outcomes at lower costs. In order for this transition to be successful, real estate needs to have a seat at the table. A key element of Welltower's strategy is to be the partner of choice for the major academic and regional health systems across the U.S. As they invest in building more advanced and robust outpatient networks, we intend to be their partner and connect our leading senior dementia and postacute care platform to these systems to help them better manage their patient populations and provide them with a competitive advantage to grow market share and profitability across the healthcare delivery continuum.", "So today we announced a strategic collaboration with Johns Hopkins Medicine, the world-renowned patient care research and teaching institution. Mercedes Kerr will tell you more about this first of its kind collaboration, but what I will say is this healthcare REIT is being recognized as best-in-class by the top health systems in the world and we're using our real estate and service platform to position ourselves to capture the next level of accretive investment opportunities for our shareholders.", "We see our healthcare real estate platform as delivering value well beyond the brick and mortar. Our proprietary leading regional operator bench is critical to managing growing population of frail to demented elderly. We're in the early days, but this should help explain why Welltower's senior housing operating portfolio consistently outperforms the industry. This, plus our more efficient operating structure, should drive earnings growth, despite fears that our performance is only a factor of interest rates.", "I will stop here to turn the mic over to my colleague, Mercedes Kerr, who will give you a closer look at Q4 investment activity and our view for 2017. Mercedes?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Good morning. I am pleased to provide you with an update on our market activity and the opportunities that we're driving from Welltower's best-in-class platform. I'll start with fourth quarter 2016 investments and dispositions. Our operating partner relationship has been and will continue to be a source of differentiation for us. This is evidenced by our ability to repeatedly source off-market investments and by our consistent track record of follow-on transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we invested $878 million at an average yield of 6.7%. 73% of these investments were with existing Welltower partners, a series of hand-picked operators with whom we enjoy close working relationships. We were pleased to welcome our new notable partner this quarter, the Northbridge Companies and we have long admired Jim Coughlin and Wendy Nowokunski's work in New England. They share Welltower's commitment to high-quality service offerings in top markets and we look forward to growing together.", "We also made significant progress towards our stated goal of selling non-core assets this quarter. This included the completion of our previously announced Genesis dispositions which generated $1.7 billion in proceeds at an effective cap rate of 9%. These transactions demonstrate a significant institutional appetite for our real estate both locally and abroad. Our 2016 market activity reflects our highly targeted capital allocation strategy aimed at improving portfolio quality and reducing single tenant concentrations which we believe will enhance our value to shareholders. Turning to our plans for 2017, I want to describe how we will execute on one of Welltower's key objectives, to maximize the value of our existing platform. This is a theme that you are going to hear from me often.", "As a result of our improved organizational structure announced in January, I lead an integrated team responsible for domestic and international dealer origination and relationship management, outpatient medical portfolio management and asset management. This new structure is designed to optimize portfolio performance and to seize external and organic growth opportunities. Let me explain what this will look like. First, we remain very optimistic about Welltower's opportunity to source top-quality investments through our existing partner network and our experienced business development team. We have created a partnership-focused investment strategy that is very difficult to replicate. Our focus in 2017 will be on seniors housing and outpatient medical opportunities. We will continue to prioritize high barrier to entry markets and high-quality sponsorships. We will seek to enhance our business by adding younger properties and sometimes developing irreplaceable assets. In select cases, we may also partner with important health systems to deliver next generation postacute real estate solutions at their request. We feel better about high-quality opportunities now than we did at this time in 2016. Next, we will find new and improved ways to drive same-store growth and operating efficiencies. Our scale, data, knowledge of best practices and ties to expert operators, including our own self-managed outpatient management group, position us for superior performance. The quality and resilience of our portfolio should become increasingly evident in less favorable operating environments and we're building tools to differentiate ourselves even further. For example, the room turn and box program which affords our seniors housing operators lower negotiated prices, rebates and a process to reduce the time required to refresh a vacated room.", "Early adoption in a six property pilot suggests that we may achieve as much as $500,000 in annual savings at these sites alone. We will look to expand this program and other performance-enhancing tools in 2017. In addition, we will include our full-service outpatient medical group in our marketing asset and portfolio management programs. We're one of the largest owners in the medical office sector and we plan to increase growth in our top-quality portfolio through even more active management. Our goal is to deliver improved performance through enhanced leasing structures and by combining the service offerings of our seniors housing and outpatient medical portfolios which are often in the same market. I'd like to wrap up my comments by reiterating the value of our integration strategy. As you heard from Tom, healthcare delivery is shifting toward more efficient, higher impact and more consumer friendly settings. Welltower and its operating partners are well-positioned to benefit from this evolution in care. I can offer an example.", "Welltower introduced one of its most successful memory care partners to one of its key patient medical tenants which happens to be the leading health system in the region that they both share. The health systems quickly realized that this expert in seniors housing could improve care outcomes for its patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In addition to developing a referral relationship, the two groups work together to create training modules for hospital staff and information resources for local seniors. Since the outset of their relationship in 2016, the two Welltower seniors housing communities that are in that market have increased occupancy by 200 basis points combined. The improvement added to an already high occupancy level and can be tied directly to this alliance. This is just one of the ways that we're driving performance. Earlier today we announced a strategic collaboration with Johns Hopkins Medicine, one of the world's preeminent patient care research and teaching institutions. Together we will explore best practices and design infrastructure alternatives to offer better care at lower costs. This arrangement will give Welltower and its partners direct access to Johns Hopkins' vast network of experts as we seek to innovate and advance healthcare delivery models together. Our work will benefit Welltower's operating platform and enhance shareholder value.", "We look forward to demonstrating our exceptional value proposition and our performance and now over to Shankh Mitra who is going to walk you through our operating results.", "Shankh Mitra", "Thank you, Mercedes. Good morning, everyone. I'll review our quarterly operating results, reflect on our full-year 2016 operating performance relative to our initial expectations and provide you our preliminary assessment after 2017's operating environment. Before I add the specifics, one element I trust you will take away from my comments today is our best-in-class assets located in the most affluent market and run by the premier operators have and will continue to drive superior relative and absolute performance. This is a direct result of a disciplined capital allocation strategy over many years, including our unique relationship investment strategies and a surgically targeted disposition program. Modern physical plants run by great operators have pricing power because the consumer wants to live in that environment or the modern healthcare can be effectively delivered in that setting. Our same-store portfolio grew 2.3% in the fourth quarter, bringing the total same-store NOI up to 3% for 2016, meeting the high-end of our initial expectation of 2.5% to 3%. This outperformance was driven by 3.4% growth in our short duration seniors housing operating portfolio where we originally guided for 2% to 3% for the quarter. 1.7% same-store NOI growth in Q4 was in line with our budget. Strong revenue growth of 3.8% was dampened by an elevated 4.8% increase in expenses for the quarter, mainly due to high labor costs. I will come back to this topic in a moment.", "We have enjoyed strong pricing power throughout 2016 in the U.S., UK and Canada and finished strong Q4 RevPAR growth of 4.3% with the highest contribution coming from our U.S. portfolio. We did lose incremental occupancy in the U.S. in Q4, but saw strong occupancy growth in the UK and Canada. As a reminder, we set an initial expectation of flat occupancy for the short portfolio in 2016 and ended the year up 50 basis points Looking forward to 2017, we're projecting 1.5% to 3% same-store growth for our senior housing operating portfolio, our short portfolio. This reflects our confidence in our asset quality, superior execution of our operating platforms and our asset management capabilities that are driven by our unique data and analytics platform which, as most of you know, is unmatched in the industry.", "Our operating assumptions include a solid RevPAR growth in the 3% to 4% range, offset by a flat to slight reduction in occupancy as a result of new supply in select market and recent food trends and a 4% to 4.5% increase in expenses, including a 5% to 5.5% increase in labor costs. While labor costs remain at elevated levels, we hope we have seen the worst of this cost item in 2016 as contributing factors such as living wage growth in the UK moderate in 2017. Though we do not and will not provide any quarterly guidance, I will remind you that 2016 was a leap year. We estimate the extra day in last February will negatively affect our Q1 2017 growth rate by roughly $1.8 million or around 1% for the short portfolio. We will not normalize this item and the negative effect on our growth rate is already baked into the full-year projection. The medium duration outpatient medical portfolio continues to produce steady and predictable growth driven by low lease turnover and high tenant retention. This dynamic led to a solid quarter with 2.1% same-store growth, right in line with our expectation. We had outstanding tenant retention of 92% in the quarter, offset by an 8.1% same-store operating expenses growth, driven by mostly taxes and other maintenance-related expenses. For the full year of 2016, same-store NOI was up 2.4% at the high-end of our initial guidance up to 2.5% for the year.", "Our exceptional operating team led by Mike Noto, combined with great assets, 95% of which are affiliated with highly regarded health systems, provides us excellent visibility into this income stream. As such, we're projecting 2% to 2.5% growth for this portfolio in 2017. The long-duration triple net portfolio continues to produce stable and reliable performance. This has the benefit of counterbalancing potential volatility in our short duration portfolio in certain parts of the cycle. Senior housing triple net NOI was up 2.8% in Q4, capping the year at 2.8%, squarely in the middle of our guidance range of 2.5% to 3% for the year. As a reminder, we don't include fee-related income in our same-store metrics. We think this provides a more accurate picture of underlying performance. We're projecting 2.5% to 3% for the segment for 2017.", "Turning to postacute and long term care which now represents only 13% of our portfolio, same-store NOI grew 3.3% for the quarter, capping the year at 3.4% relative to 3% initial guidance for 2016. We're projecting 2.5% to 3% NOI growth for the segment in 2017; however, the story here more than the numbers is our significant effort last year to reduce single tenant risk. Our remaining portfolio is now even more secure with coverage at 1.7 times before management fee and 1.4 times after management fee. This is a sequential improvement of 7 and 5 basis points respectively. As a reminder, management fee of operators are subordinate to our rent. To conclude, we expect another good year of steady growth in 2017. Our portfolio is diversified by geography, product type, operators and duration which helps to drive resilient growth through cycles. We'll continue to focus on highly targeted capital allocation strategies to finetune our portfolio. This will drive sector-leading operating performance and superior full-cycle returns to our shareholders. Before I pass it over to Scott, I want to touch on a topic of interest, senior housing supply. We will continue to emphasize the importance of local market and submarket exposures when evaluating the supply picture. Compared to national numbers, in 2016 our top 10 U.S. markets experienced 30% less inventory growth and at year-end has 200 basis points less construction as a percentage of existing inventory. Looking forward, based on construction start data which peaked in the third quarter of 2015 and using a four quarter, six quarter lag, deliveries are expected to top out in the first half of 2017. This could shift later in the year due to potential construction delays. We're not in the business of predicting macro supply, but the client development cycle attests to the strength of our high-quality portfolio and the advantages of having the patient and perspective of long term investors, investing in one of the biggest secular teams of our generation.", "With that, I'll pass it over to Scott Estes, our CFO.", "Scott Estes", "Thanks, Shankh and good morning, everybody. Throughout calendar 2016, our corporate finance team articulated a capital allocation team that had three primary goals, to enhance the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintain a strong balance sheet and low leverage and to retain ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improved. Well, I'm happy to say we delivered on all three fronts. First, we enhanced the quality of our portfolio, minimized single tenant risk and drove an increase in our private pay revenue mix to 93%. Second, we reduced our leverage by over 200 basis points to 37.4% at year-end, strengthened our credit metrics and received ratings increases to BAA1 and BBB+ from Moody's and S&P respectively. And third, we renewed and extended our line of credit through 2021, ending the year with nearly $3 billion of liquidity.", "As we enter 2017, our balance sheet is positioned to support our strategy as we intend to focus on three major financial objectives during the upcoming year. First, we'll maintain the strength of our balance sheet. Second, we'll become a leaner, more efficient organization as our 2017 G&A expense is projected to come in $30 million below our original 2016 forecast. And third, we'll drive incremental cash flow growth by both enhancing the performance of our existing portfolio and through potential acquisitions. I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our recent financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rates and several minor changes we made to our supplement and earnings release. In terms of fourth quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.10 per share and normalized FAD of $0.99 per share. G&A of $32.8 million for the quarter came in below our expectations. We recognize significant gains on asset sales of $200 million and we incurred $13 million of impairment, primarily associated with three properties based on current valuations.", "For the full year of 2016, our normalized FFO and FAD per share increased 4% and 6% respectively. This annual growth was primarily driven by solid same-store cash NOI growth as net investments totaled the relatively modest $244 million in 2016 as a result of the significant $2.8 billion of dispositions completed this year. Now moving to dividends, we paid our 183rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 21 of $0.87 per share, representing a new rate of $3.48 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.2%. Now we did make one notable addition to the supplement this quarter where on Page 19 we provided both the effective interest rate and cash interest rate on our loan portfolios and I would also point out that in our earnings release, we no longer intend to provide FAD guidance due to its potential perception as a liquidity measure, although we will continue to provide the component parts as detailed in our 2017 outlook section in Exhibit 4.", "Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, I think the most significant capital event this quarter was the $1.93 billion in proceeds generated from dispositions through $125 million in loan payoffs and $1.8 billion of property sales which included $200 million in gains on sale. A portion of our net proceeds were used for the early payoff of our $450 million in 4.7% senior unsecured notes maturing in September of 2017, as well as reducing our line of credit borrowings by $705 million to a balance of $645 million at year-end. We also repaid approximately $92 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.9% during the quarter and we assumed or issued $280 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 2.5%. So, as a result, we have nearly $3 billion of liquidity entering 2017 based on $2.4 billion of credit line availability and $557 million in cash and 1031 exchange funds on balance sheet.", "One of the most important achievements during 2016 was emerging at year-end with an even stronger balance sheet. As of December 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization has decreased to 37.4% and net debt to enterprise value declined to 31.1%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.4 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter was strong at 4.2 times and 3.3 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets at quarter end. Importantly, we anticipate further strengthening our balance sheet in early 2017 by using near term disposition proceeds to reduce preferred stock by $288 million and secured debt by over $700 million during the first quarter.", "I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2017 guidance. In terms of investment expectations, there are no acquisitions included in our 2017 guidance. Our guidance does include $323 million of development funding on projects currently underway and an additional $544 million in development conversions at a blended projected stabilized yield of 7.7%. In terms of dispositions, we've added $400 million of incremental loan payoffs and property sales this year to $1.6 billion of dispositions that were previously disclosed in our December 2016 portfolio repositioning release. This brings our calendar 2017 disposition forecast to $2 billion at a blended yield on precedes proceeds of 7.6%.", "As a reminder, the $1.6 billion of dispositions previously disclosed are comprised of $1.2 billion that were expected in the fourth quarter and a Genesis buyback of $400 million. At this point, we anticipate that virtually all of the $1.2 billion of carryover dispositions have closed or will close during the first quarter. In terms of same-store NOI cash growth, as Shankh detailed, we're forecasting blended growth of 2% to 3% in 2017 as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio. Our G&A forecast is approximately $135 million for 2017. This would represent a significant $30 million reduction relative to our original 2016 guidance. As our leadership team discussed on today's call, we do believe we owe it to our shareholders to maximize efficiencies within our cost structure. The vast majority of incremental savings in 2017 are projected to come from reductions in compensation and professional service fees. Our compensation-related savings are a result of our more efficient management structure and emphasis on leaner, high potential teams throughout the organization. We've also worked to minimize the cost of external professional services fees by bringing capabilities in-house where appropriate and leveraging technology wherever possible.", "So, finally, as a result of these assumptions, we expect to report 2017 FFO in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share detailed in our press release. In conclusion, I will reiterate that our strong balance sheet remains the backbone supporting our strategy as we look to drive operating efficiencies and cash flow growth within our organization and across our portfolio in 2017.", "So, with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for your closing comments.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott. As you've heard from Mercedes, Shankh and Scott, we cannot be more excited about the opportunities for us. We've taken the last few years to assemble what is widely regarded as the largest and best located premium seniors housing operating business in the world. Yes, headlines of senior housing oversupply and the continuing saga of weak senior housing operators with poorly managed real estate make for bad headlines. As you've just heard, this is not our story. With respect to assets subject to government reimbursements, there is uncertainty and, as we've seen before, the potential for volatility. As you know today, these assets represent a much smaller percentage of our NOI. But we believe we know how to manage this volatility and our shareholders can trust us to work hard to capture the value of remaining in the postacute care sector even though admittedly the road can be bumpy. Nevertheless, it is clear to us that major academic and regional health systems do require a postacute care solution. Given that, we're exploring how we can best deploy capital side by side with these high quality, strong credit systems to address this need.", "Nothing more to share on this now, but we're looking into this opportunity. You see we're laser focused on driving shareholder value and we're not afraid to make tough decisions when we believe it's all for the long term benefit of our shareholders. Welltower prides itself on having the most experienced and talented team, the lowest cost structure, the best senior housing real estate and operating platform, an outstanding national outpatient medical management business and unmatched global access to capital to realize the many opportunities to own the real estate that will drive healthcare delivery forward.", "And with that, Holly, please open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Todd Stender, Wells Fargo.", "Todd Stender", "Hi. Good morning and, Shankh, thanks for the details on the U.S. and Canada. As far as senior housing, I wonder if I could hear more on Canada? You certainly addressed the supply in the U.S., but maybe we could hear something about Canada just in specific markets if you can?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Sure. We actually are developing a couple of assets in Canada - again, part of Toronto, something that as we talked about before, highly targeted location market. So we're not really seeing any pressure in our individual local markets from new supply that is anything to speak of. In fact, we had very solid performance in the past year in that particular portfolio.", "Shankh Mitra", "And I will add to that. Canada is primarily an independent living market, right? So you are seeing some construction that we're bringing in with our partners, Chartwell and Nuvera and some very high barriers to entry locations in Canada, but there's not a lot of macro supply to speak of at least that's impacting our portfolio.", "Tom DeRosa", "And Todd, it's Tom. The other thing to know about Canada is there are provinces in Canada that have greater acceptance of independent living as an option for particularly the 65- to 85-year-old active senior. This is a concept that is actually promoted by the government as a very good alternative for this older population. It's lower cost and actually allows - at some point when people have health issues, it allows a national health service like you have in Canada to more efficiently deliver healthcare services to this population because they are living in settings that range from 100 units sometimes over 800 units.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll", "Thanks. Tom, can you talk a little bit about your investment strategy going forward? How has that changed or has it changed with the announced restructuring of the management team?", "Tom DeRosa", "That's a good question, Mike. Nothing has really changed. I mean I think we've been pretty articulate about how we deploy capital across healthcare real estate. I think we've been pretty consistent. Again, we see in senior housing the majority of the capital we will deploy is behind our bench of leading operators. Occasionally like we did this past year, we brought a new operator into the mix. I think you know that we've looked to decrease our postacute care exposure, but we've also been quite vocal about the fact that we're not abandoning the sector because we think there will be opportunities to deploy capital at good returns in the future. The model by which we deploy capital may be different and we're continually looking to deploy capital around our outpatient medical business.", "As you know, we own 17 million square feet. Today this is a business that is scalable. We think we're best in class. We drive tremendous performance out of that model. So, again, you will continue to see us looking for opportunities to grow that business. With respect to outside the U.S., you should continue to see us look for good opportunities in Canada and for good opportunities in the UK where we have resources on the ground. We have infrastructure in order to properly own, underwrite and manage those healthcare assets.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Excuse me, I just wanted to add one more thing. Our relationship strategy is actually very deeply rooted. We have eight folks in our business development team altogether and Tom just said, some of them are actually in Canada and the UK. But the relationship strategy that I touched on earlier and that Tom was just highlighting is very deeply rooted from the organization. So we continue to see the same momentum that we always have and expect to continue to have that going forward with our shallow pipeline.", "Michael Carroll", "Great. And then are you in the market for larger transactions with new relationships or should we think about your investments going forward would be more focused with your existing relationships?", "Shankh Mitra", "Mike, we're always - we're never in the market for new relationships. We've been in the business for a very long time. We're outstanding professionals who have been in the market and the industry for a very, very long period of time and you have seen we have been following some of these leading operators a decade plus. Northbridge is a very good example of that. They happen when they happen. But as you have seen from other investments, previously most of the investment volumes will come from existing relationships. Do we have a list of operators that we would absolutely love to have in our family of brands? Absolutely but it will happen in that time when the opportunity comes.", "Tom DeRosa", "And, Mike, the other thing I would add is we're very snobbish about the quality of our portfolio. So we're not looking for opportunities to dilute the quality of what we own.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin, Barclays.", "Joshua Raskin", "First question just again on the investment front, I know you guys have historically not included any investments going forward in any of your guidance. I understand the prudence there. Is it fair to say, though, this year is a little bit more of a - we should take a little bit more of a serious consideration of that in light of the commentary you've made around supply and focusing on existing investments, et cetera. Should we sort of dial back our expectations, not within guidance, but just broadly as to deployment of capital this year?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Well, you're right in that we don't typically give any guidance on that, but I did touch on the fact that we're actively in the market with our existing platforms and are actually optimistic about some of the opportunities that we see could materialize for us and for our investment.", "Joshua Raskin", "Okay. All right. I think I understand. And then just on the G&A savings, if I look at the 4-Q run rate on your G&A levels, it looks like you've got a majority of those savings already in place. Is it fair to say that the $30 million of savings is extremely high visibility that you've recognized a large majority of it? How much of that is left to go?", "Scott Estes", "We're highly confident in our ability to get there. Your run-rate point is right on and as we look at our budget for the teams as we think about them, as well as just contractually what we're thinking in terms of legal tax and consulting, we already have a good feel for what those numbers are going to look like this year.", "Tom DeRosa", "Josh, we're questioning everything about the way we do business and I think that is something you should demand of us in any company. We're always reevaluating how we can do what we do better and more efficiently. So this is not a one-time plan. This should be something you expect from us longer term.", "Scott Estes", "And it really started this year, frankly, in 2016 because that's why we wanted to point out our original guidance was for $165 million in 2016. So this is something we've really been driving last year 2016 and 2017 and beyond.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore, Stifel.", "Chad Vanacore", "Just thinking about your commentary about reducing your postacute exposure, but not leaving out the option to invest more in the future. Can you give us a little more color on why you're selling your Mainstreet debt and the options to acquire the properties there?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, Chad, we're looking to rebalance our postacute portfolio. We're looking - our postacute portfolio was highly concentrated. That is something that - we've been very upfront about saying it's something that we needed to address. So when we think about redeploying capital to postacute, we're thinking about it, as I mentioned, in respect to major health systems and helping them to address their postacute care need. If we do not have a model that institutions like Welltower can invest in, then we have a bigger problem because it means many people will remain in hospital beds. So we're working very hard with major healthcare providers to rethink how this postacute care model will work in the future.", "Chad Vanacore", "So how does that Mainstreet model, how does that fit in with the hospital systems?", "Shankh Mitra", "And to specifically answer your question on Mainstreet, Chad, Mainstreet was not aligned to the whole health system strategy that Todd was talking about. As you know, as we've told you last quarter, we have ended our relationship with Mainstreet and to specifically answer your question on Mainstreet debt, they paid us a premium on face value and we absolutely - what we did to sell them our debt that we owned at a higher price than face value. So, if you think about Mainstreet which was not in any of the COS states going forward, we ended the relationship. So that's the answer to that question - that anybody would pay us at a premium we're happy to sell them.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right. So sticking with postacute for a second, can you actually give us an update on your loans to Genesis? You've got a bridge loan out there. You've got some mezz financing. Just let us know where they are and as far as the HUD refinancing goes?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. I Think it's important just to take a step back on our loans big picture. As a reminder for everyone, loans are only 3% of our total portfolio. We actually project them to be down in the 2% range by year-end and we've actually already decreased the loans by about $100 million year to date. We've disclosed the three different components really of the Genesis loans. You're right they aggregate to about $464 million. I think it was the bridge loans are $317 million of that and it really was a part of a bigger solution that provides a little more time to pay those off at a reasonable rate and it was, again, contemplated as a part of the all Genesis transactions that we've been working on.", "Chad Vanacore", "And then just one last one. This may come from you, but how about some guidance on CapEx and income tax expectations for 2017?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. The CapEx number is in that Exhibit 4. It's $71 million for 2017 and the income tax line we're projecting roughly $2 million to $3 million per quarter in 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott", "A question for you on your 2017 senior housing operating NOI growth guidance. Can you give us any color on what you would expect between the breakout between U.S. Canada and the UK? Obviously you have quite a bit of divergence there right now with the U.S. I think under 1% and NOI growth in the fourth quarter. So just any color you can provide and how that breaks out for 2017 would be really helpful.", "Shankh Mitra", "Michael, it's Shankh. I will tell you that we're expecting roughly similar growth in U.S. and Canada next year and what is driving - we're expecting significantly higher growth for on a relative basis in our UK portfolio next year. So relatively same U.S. and Canada and higher UK is how I will describe it on a [indiscernible] perspective.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. And then just one other quick one. The Johns Hopkins announcement today, just curious as you guys go forward and think more about health system relationships, particularly as it pertains to any future investments in skilled nursing and postacute that you might make, just curious how many of those types of relationships in the future would be made explicit like this one is or how many would just be in the background the way your outpatient medical business runs today? Just curious how many of those will become more explicit in the future?", "Mercedes Kerr", "I expect them to become more explicit, Michael. One of the things that we're going to be working with Johns Hopkins on is real estate infrastructure and our objective is to find ways to innovate to become better partners, if you will, for health systems as they are expanding their ambulatory strategies. Naturally those ambulatory strategies will have real estate implications and so that is certainly a focus for us.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. So I guess another way of saying my question was for those systems where it does become more explicit, is it a different type of relationship than what you've done historically in outpatient medical, for example?", "Mercedes Kerr", "That's right. Because historically it has been a landlord and tenant relationship that we have had with them and what I'm describing is a partnership much like the kind that you've seen us have with senior housing operators.", "Tom DeRosa", "Michael, one of the things that we're seeing is these large superregional and academic medical systems are taking a very keen look at the senior housing space. So we talked little bit about postacute and why that is - for them is an issue that needs to be addressed. But they are also looking at how they can connect to the senior housing operators, particularly around the conditions of high levels of frailty and dementia Alzheimer's. Mercedes talked a little bit about one of the large regional systems where we have effectively brought our operator together with the system. And it is not only benefitting that health system, it's benefiting Welltower by seeing a 200 basis point increase in occupancy. This is very early days. We were invisible. Senior housing was completely invisible to hospital systems. Why? Because it's outside the reimbursement framework. But increasingly, these systems need to see senior housing as part of effective healthcare delivery networks because the people that live with us are the largest risk population for those health systems. They are seeing how our sector can help them manage that risk, so I would say more to come on this.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. So you think MOB-type relationships will be more important in the future if you can bring the health system relationships or expertise, not only in the MOBs but across senior housing and postacute as well?", "Tom DeRosa", "I think it gives us a competitive advantage versus all the capital out there that would like to invest in the MOB space. What that capital doesn't bring is all the benefits which I just articulated.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Karin Ford, Mitsubishi Securities.", "Karin Ford", "In the operating seniors housing portfolio, it sounds like you're getting good pricing, but expenses are keeping the 2017 growth a little below the long term trend. If memory serves, it's closer to 3% to 4%. You mentioned potential moderation of supply and maybe even expense growth later in the year. Any chance you could see NOI accelerate in the portfolio in the back half and maybe get back up to the 3% plus level in 2018?", "Shankh Mitra", "So, Karin, it is very hard to comment on 2018 at this point in time. But if we look at the NIC information, you will see that most of the supply - the sort of peak of the supply will be delivered in the first half of 2017 and you also have in - you obviously are following the flu situation - the impact will also be sort of the first quarter. So our focus was the first quarter. So you will see that, relatively speaking, you will see a little bit of acceleration in the back half of 2017 from a numbers perspective. Now if supply doesn't really pick up, you can see at least in our portfolio, our U.S. portfolio still has occupancy upside left. And obviously the expense growth moderates, stays at that elevated level but at least moderates from a year-over-year perspective, you can see some acceleration in 2018, but we're not prepared to talk about that just yet.", "Karin Ford", "Fair enough. Okay. My second question is on postacute. Are you guys on track to hit the pro forma coverage level of 145 that you had talked about on the disposition - following the dispositions? And I saw you took out the Genesis disclosure. Can you just tell us on a same-store basis what happened to coverage and occupancy for the retained Genesis facilities?", "Scott Estes", "Hi, Karin. It's Scott. I think first in terms of the coverage you can see there was a nice improvement this quarter, but that really was largely the result of those Genesis dispositions that affected the occupancy and affected the coverage that you see on the first Page of the supplement. It's almost the same answer to your question as why I can't get more color - why did we take out our disclosure? We were reporting Genesis information on a one quarter lag like we do with everybody else. We don't do that for anybody else and since they are a public company, what would've been in the supplement was what they reported four months ago. So you can continue to see their dot and their bubble page in terms of their coverage overall which is a little above 1.2 for the data that we reported, but we're just going to keep reporting on this basis going forward.", "Karin Ford", "Okay. And are you on track to hit the 145 level?", "Shankh Mitra", "If we continue to sell Genesis, as Scott said, that obviously Genesis buyback is in our guidance, that coverage you should see should continue to go up.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan, Canaccord Genuity.", "Paul Morgan", "Just to go kind of go back to the Hopkins relationship, I know it's obviously early days here. But just maybe is it possible to kind of set expectations on what we should expect to hear next out of the venture and kind of both in terms of the sort of relationship type stuff and hard investment in 2017 and 2018 or is it kind of a longer term situation then?", "Mercedes Kerr", "The relationship is expected to be a long term one, but we will be updating everybody certainly as we make progress on the multiple initiatives that we're undertaking. We're actually already working on a quality measurement tool that we think will illustrate the value in assisted living and memory care that Tom was describing before. Obviously the information can be shared with existing and potential customers. It could also help to pave the way for other mutually beneficial partnerships between health systems and our seniors housing operating partners. So there will be a number of different fronts that we're going to be working on together and we'll bring updates as they become available on the progress that we're making.", "Paul Morgan", "Okay. Great. And then just a quick question. Is there any update you have on the vintage portfolio relative to your kind of initial pro forma and how things are shaping up?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Certainly, as you know, we announced a closing in October and since then our operators have jumped in and they are very focused. They are executing on their plans. So it's early days, but they're doing everything that we would expect them to do hiring staff and working on renovation plans and such. The property is obviously a great fit for us - our Sunrise in Silverado and they are great operators. So if anybody can deliver on a plan, it would be them.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra, Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Just two quick ones on RIDEA. First, you kind of mentioned I think overall occupancy was down about 40 bps in the quarter. Can you give us a bit more color on in the U.S. markets where you're seeing supply how occupancy and maybe NOI growth trended there relative to markets where there is very little supply? Maybe just rake up the growth profile in the U.S.?", "Shankh Mitra", "Tim, our head of asset management will give you the details. But overall obviously, as you know, we provide very detailed disclosure. We're not prepared to give you even more than the occupancy projection in different parts of our portfolio. But, as I said, the U.S. we lost occupancy and we gained in UK and Canada. Relatively that's what I want to think about.", "Tim Lordan", "Yes, Vik. This is Tim Lordan. The story is the same there. So we saw weakness in Chicago, Atlanta and Kansas City, but the core markets held up well.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And just on as you think about making future investments in senior housing and RIDEA in particular, with incremental capital potentially foreign capital also chasing, have you tweaked or changed anything in terms of your underwriting parameters or any other factor that you are focused on more so today than you were maybe over the last two years?", "Justin Skiver", "This is Justin Skiver, SVP of Underwriting. I would say that we really haven't changed our perspective on what we're looking for from an underwriting perspective. It's the core markets and most importantly it's the top operators. So I would say that the fundamentals there from an underwriting perspective have not changed. Obviously, on a deal by deal basis, you are evaluating the individual characteristics of that deal related to the real estate, the acuity level of the residents. So I would say nothing has changed, but obviously deal by deal you are looking at it more deeply.", "Scott Estes", "The one thing I would add to that is every day we're driving more value from our expertise on the operating side and helping these smaller regional businesses operate on a higher level. We've been very focused, as you know, on helping them drive down expenses and driving the benefits of scale that they get from being part of the Welltower family. We're now looking at ways we can help them on the revenue side, so stay tuned on that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Sheila McGrath, Evercore.", "Sheila McGrath", "Could you give us an update on the New York City developments and your expectations of timing? Is that a project you would envision some strategic alliance with a major medical entity might make sense?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes. Thank you for that question. In fact, it is one of those locations that is prime for the innovation that we've been trying to describe and we're in conversations with the health system about how we can collaborate in that market to bring more value to the population. We continue to make progress on the project. We're on track. The properties that we're actually going to demolish are now vacant. So we're going to start our pre-demolition work here probably by next week. So we're excited to see that kind of progress. We've also actually increased the size of the project slightly because we found some efficiencies. So more value enhancing our returns. And, believe it or not, are already fielding phone calls from prospective residents who are quite interested in living in the community and have actually offered to become almost ambassadors on our behalf and getting the message out about the property. So the schedule continues as we have always advocated for now and we're starting to make progress.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital.", "Jordan Sadler", "I just wanted to flesh out the opportunity in outpatient medical. It sounds like that's an area of focus for 2017, but I guess, if I think back or look back over the last several years, it's not really been an area of focus in terms of incremental investment. Maybe you've invested a few hundred million dollars over the last three years. Can you maybe talk about what it is about the opportunity set that's presenting itself today that you're sort of directing us as that's an area of opportunity we should expect you to be investing in?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, Jordan, one of the things I said earlier was that the major academic medical systems and regional health systems are really taking a very close look at their outpatient ambulatory care strategy. It's going to require a lot of capital for them to build the networks they need to grow their patient population base. One of the key strategies of major health systems is they've invested significant dollars in generally their Center City acute-care facilities where research and teaching and technology are driven from. In a world where length of stays are decreasing every day in hospitals, how do you keep those beds filled? You need to build a broader feeder system to that acute-care hospital so you can maintain your competitive edge and they are going to do that by building larger ambulatory care networks.", "This is something that because of our relationships with these systems is an area that people are looking very closely at. One of the reasons why you haven't seen the business grow perhaps the same rate as senior housing is it's rare that there are large portfolios to acquire in this space and if they come about, in many cases they haven't been of quality that reach our screen. So we're always in the market, we're always looking and we're a big player. Again, we own 17 million square feet of outpatient medical and we're a full-service outpatient medical management. So this is an area that has always been import and we're seeing some of the changes that are helping across healthcare delivery perhaps bringing a new set of opportunities that we have not seen in the past.", "Shankh Mitra", "And, Jordan, I'll add to that. As you know, medical office business has been very, very competitive from a pricing perspective and you know our investment philosophy is more offmarket relationship driven. So every time you saw opportunities, obviously the option tends to run very crowded and that's not how we invest capital. So obviously now what you're hearing from Tom and Mercedes and the team that we're replicating the same relationship investment strategy from the senior housing that we have been very successful and trying to go and replicate the same idea and same strategy in the medical office business and that's what you're hearing from us. The relationship that we announced today is just the beginning of that. But we do not want to deploy capital for the sake of deploying capital. We want to deploy capital when we think we can make money for our shareholders.", "Jordan Sadler", "That's helpful. And then one other. As it relates to Brookdale with all due respect to the ongoing process and your relationship, I'm just curious if the margin - this is one of your top operators listed in your supplemental, would you be inclined to increase exposure to an operator like Brookdale or decrease at the margin?", "Mercedes Kerr", "So I'll start off, we're not actually looking to expand our relationship together. So consequently we're actually not participating in any process there. What I can tell you about our properties with Brookdale is that we have a solid group and I will say that we're not in the habit of giving individual portfolio statistics. But just to illustrate my point, I can tell you just this one time that our portfolio there covers 1.2 times. So we have a solid relationship, but it's not one that we're expanding.", "Tom DeRosa", "And think I think that's pretty similar to what HCP may have announced in the last week or so, that their coverage was about 1.2 times just like ours.", "Shankh Mitra", "I'll add - Jordan, I'll just add from the Q4 numbers that we released this morning, our Brookdale exposure, as we said this morning, is lower because we have closed the Brookdale as part of our Cindat joint venture yesterday.", "Jordan Sadler", "What's that pro forma number?", "Shankh Mitra", "I don't have it off the top of my head.", "Jordan Sadler", "That's okay. I can calculate it. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Juan Sanabria", "Maybe this one is for Scott. With regards to the dispositions that are scheduled and planned for in 2017, how should we think about the use of proceeds? Is the plan mainly to delever over and above kind of what you've committed to for development funding?", "Scott Estes", "I think that's a good way to think about it. So I think really in two phases at least. The first phase I can give a good bit of detail on. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is about $1.2 billion of dispositions that carried over from last year. Those are largely seniors housing triple net deals that have basically happened or should happen within the next few weeks. So the use of those proceeds which are about at least $1 billion of that $1.2 billion, would be to pay off our $288 million of preferred stock. Plus, we've targeted about $700 million of secured debt. So I think the rest of it is a little bit wait and see. We still have some line borrowings available, but hopefully we'll have some success in ongoing acquisitions and development funding. But I think the net reduction probably comes in the first part of the year.", "Juan Sanabria", "You would like to keep that level lower leverage going forward?", "Scott Estes", "Yes, I feel great about the balance sheet. I mean it's been very helpful, I think, in terms of how we're thinking about the business. It just gives us a ton of flexibility. So the $3 billion of liquidity I articulated did not even account for the potential $2 billion of dispositions. So we really have an opportunity to take one more notch down here and that just puts us solidly in the range we're at today.", "Juan Sanabria", "And then just on seniors housing CapEx, I know you gave kind of the gross guidance for 2017 for the Company, but kind of what are you expecting on a dollar per bed spin basis? And how should we think about that going forward? I think Tom mentioned in his intro remarks that you would like to kind of focus on newer product as you grow and just trying to think about how CapEx should change given all the new supply being added to the purpose built just to keep the existing stock relevant and competitive?", "Shankh Mitra", "One, we'll follow-up with you on the exact number on CapEx. I want to make one point, though. As you know, we have the youngest assets in the industry in our portfolio, as you can see in those numbers. So we're not particularly worried about as they put CapEx in existing facilities to drive performance. But if your question is more focused towards the industry, that is definitely something that you should probably see or will see from the industry. As far as we're concerned, we have the youngest assets asset pool in the business and we think -", "Scott Estes", "In the best locations.", "Shankh Mitra", "In the best locations and we think that we'll be fine.", "Juan Sanabria", "And just one last kind of question for me. So you talked about the MOB opportunities and kind of the Johns Hopkins relationship being the first step. What exactly are you thinking about in terms of the actual product type when you say ambulatory turn networks versus how we traditionally think of MOBs? Is it the same or is that kind of a different, more purpose built product or if you could just elaborate a little bit on that?", "Tom DeRosa", "I think you're going to see more buildings that are designed to drive procedures out of the acute-care hospital into an outpatient setting. So what you're essentially seeing is it a transition from the old doc in a box to basically day hospitals.", "Mercedes Kerr", "And we have actually many examples of that in our portfolio already because we identified this trend quite some time ago and it's actually the reason why we talk about our portfolio as an outpatient medical portfolio and not a medical office building portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.", "Michael Mueller", "Two questions. One, wondering can you comment on development trends for the portfolio in terms of what's coming online? How long it's taking to stabilize versus expectations? And then, Tom, one of your comments again about possibly growing postacute, how should we think about that from big picture? Is it once you sell the $1.6 billion that's identified now, you are probably not going to see anything more meaningful and then just selectively grow it? I mean do you think the percentage allocation will change dramatically?", "Tom DeRosa", "No, Mike. I think we're going to be very selective. And I hope that came across clear in my remarks. We're going to be very selective about how we deploy capital into postacute. We're not looking to roll up existing supply of postacute that is out there. We're looking to help drive the next generation of postacute where we can feel the opportunity to deploy capital will provide our shareholders with the right risk return scenario. Next question.", "Shankh Mitra", "And, Mike, I just want to add, as you heard from Scott, we have the Genesis buyback of $400 million or so built into our guidance. So, if anything, net net you might actually see our exposure go down. But we're definitely not looking to bulk up in that space.", "Tom DeRosa", "Now, Mike, you also asked a question about development - our development pipeline and occupancy there.", "Michael Mueller", "Yes, fill-up trends.", "Tim Lordan", "Mike, this is Tim Lordan. As Shankh mentioned, it takes about six quarters to develop these projects and if you do them in the right markets, you develop a nice waiting list or a list of residents as you go through that process. So fill-up could take anywhere from a year or 18 months after that.", "Scott Estes", "The only thing I would add, Mike, is that we have a good - most of our fill-up assets are in our triple net or postacute portfolios. So we're collecting rent from day one on those. I don't think I've noticed any material change in the time it's taking these assets to fill up. And I would also note that about 80% of that fill-up, again, is in a master release.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson, Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "On the outpatient medical discussion point, do you see that as kind of a slow kind of process of developing assets here and there or something that could require quite a bit of time that by the time it's done, we'll all on this call be retired? Or is it something that could happen in kind of quick spots through large types of bulky investments, more of a rapid pace to the end game?", "Tom DeRosa", "One of the things that we're hoping for, if you follow the progress of some of the major regional and academic medical systems, they are acquiring other hospitals. This gives them large portfolios not only of additional hospitals but also ambulatory and outpatient assets. We're hoping that at some point these systems will look to sell some of these or partner some of these assets. That's where most of the high-quality outpatient opportunities lie. They are sitting in the hands of these major health systems.", "Rich Anderson", "And so we're talking $1 billion type dollar deals.", "Tom DeRosa", "This could be one of the biggest pools of potential investment opportunities that the healthcare REIT space has ever seen, if you think about it, if you look at the amount of real estate that is owned by these major systems. And that's why we have limited our strategy to these major systems. We believe they will wind up growing and essentially pushing a lot of weaker systems either out of business because they will be increasingly marginalized or pushing more and more acute-care into the safety net business of caring for the uninsured and Medicaid population. And that's not where we intend to be.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Interesting. And so buying another medical office REIT is not the strategy that you have in mind here?", "Tom DeRosa", "We don't comment on M&A and like anything, Rich, if the stars line up and that's the right thing for the shareholders, we would always review any opportunity. But that's not anything we're laser focused on at the moment.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. And then second question is you talk about G&A savings and rightsizing the leadership. Mercedes and Scott have numerous functions reporting to them. They may actually need an eighth day of the week to do their job at some point. How long can a company the size of this operate without an Chief Investment Officer or Chief Operating Officer or is that in the game plan down the road, just not right now?", "Tom DeRosa", "Rich, when I stepped into this role a little under three years ago, I inherited a bloated inverted pyramid organizational structure. Since then, without fending off any major players, we got it to a rectangle. And as of January 3, we get it to a functional pyramid.", "Rich Anderson", "So it's not a trapezoid?", "Tom DeRosa", "No, it's not a trapezoid. It's a functional pyramid. So when you look at the way we're organized, the Company is now organized across three verticals. So one of those verticals reports to Mercedes, one of those verticals reports to Scott and one of those verticals reports to me. Those verticals create a much enhanced internal management structure, functional oversight structure and internal governance structure. So those structural enhancements allow for us not to have a Chief Operating Officer role because it is those aspects of that role are filled by the structure. Same thing with not having a Chief Investment Officer. So that is - the role of the Chief Investment Officer is fulfilled by a functional structure. This is something we can talk to you more about at any time, but we think it's working really well. And you know what? We all work 24/7 and that's what you should spec of any management team.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from the line of John Kim, BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "I think Shankh referenced the flu season. We're about two-thirds the way through this winter. Can you just comment on how you see the impact of the flu season this year versus last couple of years in your shop portfolio?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Sure. You probably have heard this from others already and seen the numbers yourselves and there is, indeed, a spike in 2017 in the incidence of the flu. Obviously we monitor that very closely and we're always in very active dialogues with our operators about this sort of thing. Naturally they have protocols to contain the flu and other such epidemics. These are the kinds of things that we're in dialogue with them about and their use of those kinds of tactics to try to stay ahead.", "Tim Lordan", "John, this is Tim Lordan. I would say in summary we see the flu being a little bit more impactful than last year, but not anywhere near the historical flu season we saw a couple of years ago. We're seeing trends like that elevated in the UK. Fortunately to date we're not seeing a lot of exposure to flu in our communities in the UK and in the U.S., as Mercedes said, our operators are all over that. One of the lessons they learned from the historic flu season a couple years ago is how to improve their protocols to deal with that more effectively. So we had seen some impacts of flu in Connecticut and some other areas but nothing widespread.", "Shankh Mitra", "And just as you think about - John, as you think about the numbers, if we have an outbreak of the flu that is greater than what we're talking about today, that probably gets us towards the lower end of the guidance and vice versa. So if you thought about the flu trend, it is one of the things we're thinking about. That's why we sort of created a range. That gets you from one side of the range to the other side of the range, depending on how it plays out.", "Tom DeRosa", "I can tell you we've all been passing the flu around here in Toledo. That should be an area of concern, but we continue to come to work every day.", "John Kim", "I can definitely relate to that. Moving on to Brookdale, hypothetically speaking, if another REIT were to acquire an ownership stake in the company, Brookdale, would that materially change how you view that relationship?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Well, look, as you can imagine, our agreements have consent rights and the like that might apply in different scenarios. So a process that would require our input and we always seek to be constructive. We always seek to protect our shareholders' interests.", "So we really have no particular idea of what to play out if anything at all. It is speculative. But just know that we will have a seat at the table if ever it's required.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott", "Just a couple of quick ones. Sorry. I know it's been a long call. The $1.2 billion, I think it is, of dispositions that will close in 1Q, I thought those were going to close by the end of 2016. Just is there anything noteworthy in terms of why that was delayed a bit?", "Tom DeRosa", "No, it was just timing and closing process which is why they are happening early in 2017.", "Shankh Mitra", "Michael, they were actually supposed to close in mid-February is what we thought. And one of them, as I said, closed yesterday. I thought it was going to close in two or three weeks, but they were never supposed to be closed by that year end.", "Michael Knott", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then I'm still a little bit unsure how to think about your acquisition stance for 2017 and sort of how to sort of reconcile the fact that your guidance is zero but at the same time you had a surprisingly large fourth quarter of activity? And then also I think, Mercedes, you mentioned that you feel better about some types of relationship opportunities than you did a year ago. So just curious how to really think about all that together. I know you historically don't really guide on the acquisition side, but still having a little trouble figuring out your stance on how you are thinking about acquisitions in 2017?", "Mercedes Kerr", "And I can appreciate that, Michael. I maybe I'm just repeating myself, so I apologize for that in advance. But it's what we said. We have a strong relationship network. We have a very strong business development team. We've described to you some of our initiatives with respect to the new business and how we're looking to replicate our success in outpatient medical. We feel that that is going to yield us off-market opportunities. We have - again, I'm repeating myself a little bit, but it's all to say that those are some of the reasons we feel optimistic about this coming year and our opportunities.", "Shankh Mitra", "Michael, I'll just add to that that, as you heard from Mercedes, that we feel better about the opportunities as we sit right here. However, we'd never include acquisitions in our guidance and it's hard to do that, right? I mean you don't know when they are going to close, you don't know when you are going to shake hands, what your cost of capital will be, how much you want to keep, how much you want to JV. So all of these things play, but what you should remember is we have - opportunity is never constrained and the second point is we're seeing better opportunities. The third is we feel pretty good about the business. So, if the stars align, you should see strong acquisition opportunities from us as you have seen in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Knott", "And then just last one, if I may. Tom, your comment about next-gen postacute, if I can use my words, not yours - is kind of where it's at in terms of skilled nursing. Just if I can ask a devil's advocate question of why in the long run keep the existing SNFs that you have now if the next-gen is where it will be at in the future?", "Tom DeRosa", "Michael, it's because I think there's always going to be a broad need for skilled nursing. So, remember, our business is more aligned with the top end of the market and the top end of the market has a skilled nursing need. But the broader market won't always have a skilled nursing need. So when you can own skilled nursing with the right operators in the right markets, that should remain a reasonable asset class to invest in. It has been challenged because of all of the issues, whether they be from Medicare or Medicaid and we're in a period of uncertainty now because we don't know how the repeal of the ACA will affect particularly Medicaid reimbursement. There's a lot of questions about that. All I can tell you is, if this administration can address the fact that Obamacare expanded Medicaid to include able-bodied adults - so some people believe that of the 20 million of newly insured, 6 million were able-bodied adults that were added to the Medicaid ranks - that is a problem for everyone because Medicaid is for the elderly children, the blind and the disabled.", "So we're hoping for some clarity there and maybe that provides some relief to SNF operators that rely on Medicaid to get reimbursed for their services. But, you know, it's been a tough go and we're trying to be optimistic but we maintain skilled nursing cannot go away.", "Shankh Mitra", "And, Michael, adding to Tom's point, if you think about it, we're very focused on capital allocation as our main job, right? Tom said, as you heard from him three times today, we want to maintain flexibility. And environments change. Investment opportunities change. If we see really good risk adjusted return opportunities with great health systems, we'll explore that. On the other hand, we think that there is a huge demand for these assets coming from foreign and domestic investors. If we think that we should crystallize the value for our shareholders, we'll go that way. You have seen us doing both and we want to be flexible and remain open and change as the market changes.", "Scott Estes", "Final important point, Michael. This is Scott. I think we've actually been making this shift already. Not only is the postacute portfolio getting to about the 10% to 12% range which is right sized, but we've been selling the more Medicaid-centric skilled nursing assets for really the last five to seven years. And even with Genesis as well, we've been growing our powerbacks and the assets there - Medicaid centric and private pay, not even Medicaid certified assets. So it's actually happening already.", "Operator", "And, at this time, we have no further questions. We would like to thank you for dialing into the Welltower earnings conference call.

My name is Dorothy, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim McHugh", "Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's second quarter 2017 results.", "Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and Scott Estes, CFO.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances as projected results will be attained.", "Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com.", "Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I wanted to point out four highlights regarding our 2Q 2017 results.", "First, we reported 3.5% year-over-year same-store growth in our seniors housing operating portfolio, driving total portfolio same-store growth of 3% for the quarter.", "Second, we increased full year total portfolio same-store guidance to a range of 2.25% to 3% lifted by first half seniors housing operating performance at the high end of our additional expectations.", "Third, we paid down a $182 million of debt in the quarter, bringing year-to-date retired debt and preferred securities to $1.275 billion at a bundled rate of 5.6% and a cost of less than 3% of principal.", "Finally, as a result of this stable core operating performance and efficient balance sheet management, we finished the quarter with debt to adjusted EBITDA up 5.17 times.", "And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for further remarks on our quarter.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tim, and good morning.", "We are pleased with our operating results for the second quarter, as well as the success of our efforts to further improve our balance sheet and drive operating efficiencies across the Welltower platform.", "The strong year-to-date performance of our seniors housing business, which has resulted from strong rate growth, focused asset management and a rebound in our UK business gives us the confidence to announce the increase in our same-store NOI guidance for the year to 2.25% to 3%.", "We are broadcasting to you this morning from Welltower's offices in Beverly Hills, California. When you walk the streets here and see scores of four Lee signs, over the windows of high-end shop space, you cannot help, but be reminded of the disruptive impacted ecommerce has had on traditional retail real estate.", "There are clearly disrupted forces at play in healthcare as well, but, Welltower's real estate portfolio stands to benefit from this disruption. As healthcare delivery moves from a high cost acute care hospital centric model to smaller, more efficient disease management sites of care connected to ambulatory, post-acute, seniors housing, memory care and home. Our current real estate assets become even more consequential and valuable. Further, this phenomenon calls for a new class of real estate to be developed.", "Welltower has uniquely positioned itself at the table with the leading providers, payers, distributors, data and technology companies that are transforming healthcare, so that we can deliver a next-generation class of real estate. This potentially represents the largest capital deployment opportunity we have seen in decades.", "I'll come back with some closing remarks, but it is now my pleasure to hand the mic over to my colleague, Mercedes Kerr.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone.", "The Welltower team completed $292 million of investments in the second quarter of 2017, as we remain disciplined in our approach to the market. This amount consisted of a $110 million of acquisitions at a blended yield of 6.5%. A $163 million [ph] of development funding with projected yields of 7.8%, and $20 million in loans with a blended rate of 6.6%.", "Our investments continue to be made with existing operators such as Legend Senior Living, Sagora Senior Living and Ascension Health. But we were also pleased to welcome a new partner to the Welltower's family, the University of California Irvine Health through the acquisition of an outpatient medical office building less than a mile from the highly regarded Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, California.", "This acquisition advances our stated strategy to increase our participation with the Academic Medical Center Community. In addition, we put 10 high quality development properties into service during the quarter, representing total invested capital of $273 million and a blended stabilized yield of 7.6%.", "These properties operated by well-known Welltower partners such as Sunrise Senior Living, Brandywine Living and Kisco, will enhance our operating results for years to come. We remain committed to working with our partners to fund development and acquire best in-class properties on a more off-market basis across our countries of operation.", "This relationship focus strategy delivers its highest value during market periods like the one we are currently experiencing were widely auction portfolios generally don't seem to offer a shareholder's acceptable rates of return.", "We completed $160 million of dispositions in the quarter. This activity consisted of $43 million of loan payoff at an average yield of 8.9%. And a $117 million portfolio sale of 11 skilled nursing facilities with a yield of 9.3% and unlevered IRR of 11.4% and a gain of $42 million.", "To provide some context for our investment decision making process and how we behave across cycles, I would like to share a glimpse into our multi-disciplined eight-member investment committee and how it works.", "When we scrutinize underwriting results, we focus as much ongoing in-cash yield as we do on the long-term growth potential of an investment opportunity and the CapEx required to sustain that cash flow growth. This results in a total return or unlevered IRR driven investment process. As we review new investments and dispositions, the committee also focuses on diversification of operators, asset type and geography, which we believe enhances the stability of our portfolio returns.", "The rating agency seem to agree as evidenced by our recent upgrades after the reduction of our concentration in certain operators. Our often-used RIDEA structure gives us opportunity to optimize operating performance more directly. You have heard us speak about our initiatives around this before.", "We have invested in the people, systems and infrastructure to actively manage our RIDEA portfolio and we have Welltower boots on the ground, enhancing our shareholders' interest in the markets where we have strong concentration such as London, Toronto and Beverly Hills.", "Our market leadership position ensures we see the vast majority of what is marketed and we consider each opportunity carefully, relative to our cost of capital and standard real estate metrics such as replacement cost.", "In periods, where we don't see a positive balance between the market's pricing of risk and return, we may report modest - at least when measured Welltower's own history. We may also monetize selected investments opportunistically during these periods to crystallize value for our shareholders. And importantly, we always seek to drive value from our existing portfolio.", "We feel confident that our approach and discipline through these cycles will prove to be the correct strategy to drive the period shareholder value in an enduring way. Our off-market investment pipeline for the balance of the year is promising and we will fit in - we'll fit the criteria that I have described. We look forward to sharing our news of progress.", "I will now turn the call over to Shankh Mitra for a discussion on portfolio performance.", "Shankh Mitra", "Thank you, Mercedes, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results with an emphasis on our outpatient medical and seniors housing business.", "We're pleased with our operating results and increasing our - for the overall portfolio to 2.25% to 3%, which we believe is appropriate given the strength of our shop portfolio.", "I'll remind you, we do not - our outlook on segment level NOI growth through the year, but we are tracking towards the top of our original 1.5% to 3% guidance for the shop portfolio.", "Our overall same store NOI increased 3% for the year. Our Triple-Net portfolio continued its reliable performance. Our seniors housing Triple-Net segment grew 3% and long-term secured portfolio grew 3.1%.", "Our outpatient medical portfolio reported 1.6% NOI growth in Q2, which was below our expectations. New leasing is ahead of our expectation for the year, but we had some later than expected rent commencement due to delays and tenants fit outs and few move-outs in the quarter that are shifting economics to later quarters.", "Despite this quarter's performance, our expectation for the outpatient medical segment remains unchanged for the year. We remain confident in our team's ability to execute and expect growth to bounce back in the second half.", "Our seniors housing operating portfolio is the highlight of this quarter with meaningful outperformance relative to our budget. Occupancy trends were lower than expected. However, those were significantly offset by our pricing power, which resulted in strong rate growth, 3.9% year-over-year and better expense trends 1.7% a year.", "Our operating partners are constantly optimizing rate, occupancy question to maximize revenue at this point in the cycle. We're very proud that they have achieved this growth, while keeping expenses in check. While labor cost remains elevated. They continue to moderate from the highs as our partner strike the right balance between excellent care delivery and efficient staffing model.", "Our group purchasing power and other cost initiative being realized through expense savings in food, professional services, insurance, utilities and incentive management fees.", "Geographically, the U.S. and Canada were neck-and-neck from a performance perspective contributing solid growth, 2.6% and 2.8% respectively with UK being the clear winner as we continue to benefit from our UK team significant asset management effort in last 18 months. We continue to - UK outperformance for quarters to come.", "Overall, growth was driven by our core markets which bounce back as we hoped and discussed last call. So Cal, No Cal Toronto, London, Seattle were significant drivers. Following up on our conversation from last call, the New York MSA has started to demonstrate beta results, but New England continues to be challenging though it is improving.", "With respect to different product types, we have observed significant outperformance of both revenue and NOI in assisted living versus independent living this quarter. Much has been written about the supply stats in AL versus IL which is appropriate and relevant, but as long-term owners of class A real estate we have observed greatest thickness of demand in AL versus IL, when new competition opens around a given asset. We would also like to point out the recent absorption metrics for both product types as reported by NIC.", "For Map 31 and Map 99 respectively, absorption for AL was 4.3% and 4.2% for the quarter and 2% and 1.9% for IL for the quarter. These absorption numbers are more than 2X of current 85 population growth signifying a greater acceptance of this need based product and validating the value proposition that community based care provides to our resident versus the alternatives or receiving care at home.", "This above population demand growth indicates the true long-term growth potential of our asset class as that growth in acceptance of the asset class augments the acceleration of 85 population growth in the decades ahead.", "Overall, we are very pleased with our operating performance of our portfolio. We allocate capital across geographies product types and operating partners, so that you as our shareholders can enjoy sector leading inflation plus growth through the cycle. We believe our results so far this year is proving out that strategy.", "With that, I'll pass it over to Scott Estes, our CFO. Scott?", "Scott Estes", "Great, thanks Shankh and good morning, everyone.", "From a financial perspective, I think the highlight of the first half of the year has been our ability to maintain our capital allocation discipline. Most importantly, it's allowed us to take advantage of the current market dynamics to both sell assets and raise equity optimistically to further enhance our balance sheet. As a result, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on high quality investment opportunities as soon as they become available in the future.", "I'll start my comments today by emphasizing three financial highlights from the second quarter. First, our strong total portfolio same-store NOI growth is 3% and $292 million in growth investments allowed us to report a solid normalized FFO result of $1.6 per share.", "Second, we utilized disposition proceeds in the equity capital raise to further strengthen our credit metrics and reduce our un-depreciated book leverage at 35% at quarter ends.", "And third, we ended June with over $3 billion in liquidity providing considerable financial flexibility as we move into the latter half of the year. By more detailed remarks, we'll begin with some perspective on our segment financial results and dividends.", "As second quarter, financial results did exceed our expectations, generating normalized FFO of $1.6 per share versus $1.15 per share last year. A year-over-year earnings were supported by our solid same-store cash NOI growth and $2.8 billion of growth investments completed over the last 12 months, but declined as expected due to the $3.7 billion of dispositions completed over the same period. Importantly, these dispositions in equity raise allowed us to significantly lower our leverage by over 4 full percentage points over the last 12 months.", "Our G&A came in at $32.6 million for the second quarter. This represents a significant 18% year-over-year reduction from $39.9 million in Q2 2016, as we continue to enhance our operational efficiency.", "Based on our strong first half of the year, our G&A forecast is now tracking closer to the $130 million to $132 million range for the full year versus our initial guidance of $135 million. We recognized significant gains on asset sales of $42.2 million during the quarter. This was partially offset by $13.6 million in impairments on several seniors housing properties currently held for sale and some minor charges related to secured debt extinguishment and loss on derivatives during the quarter. And in terms of dividends, we will pay our 85th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 21st of $0.87 per share, representing a current dividend yield of 4.8%.", "Turning now to our picture on balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $160 million in proceeds from dispositions through $117 million of property sales and $43 million in loan payouts, which included an additional $28 million of Genesis loan repayments.", "In terms of equity, we generated over $190 million in net proceeds under our ATM program during the quarter. We did use the majority of our net proceeds to reduce our line of credit borrowings by $137 million and to extinguish $182 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.4% during the quarter, while we issued or assumed $172 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.1%.", "So, as a result, we sit today with over $3 billion in current liquidity based on $2.6 billion of credit line availability and $442 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet continued to strengthen during the second quarter. As of June 30th, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization declined another 80 basis points on a sequential basis to 35%, while net debt to enterprise value declined 160 basis points to 27.2%.", "As Tim said, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.7 times, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage for the quarter increased to 4.5 times and 3.7 times respectively. Our secured debt declined by 10 basis points to 9.5% of total assets at quarter end.", "That conclude my comments today with a brief update on the key assumptions driving our 2017 guidance. I think in short there are relatively few changes this quarter, in terms of same-store NOI growth, as team said based on the solid performance across the portfolio that really highlighted by the seniors housing operating portfolio in particular, and increasing our blended growth forecast 2.25% to 3% from the previous 2% to 3% range for the full year. And consistent with our normal practice there are no acquisitions other than those completed during the first half of the year and our 2017 guidance.", "Our guidance does include an additional $173 million of development funding on projects that are currently underway and an additional $143 million in development conversions at blended projected stabilized yield of 8.8%.", "In terms of our full year disposition forecast, we continue to anticipate a total of $2 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.6% based on $1.3 billion completed year-to-date and $700 million of incremental proceeds through the remainder of the year.", "And finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share.", "So, in conclusion, I think we're in an excellent capital position with an even stronger balance sheet in over $3 billion of current liquidity providing us the significant financial flexibility to execute upon our plans as we move into the second half of the year.", "So, at this point, Tom, I'll flip it back to you for your closing comment.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Scott.", "Since the start of our call, the sun has now come up on the West Coast and we can see outside our windows which are just one block from Boyega [ph] drive, many of those empty Beverly Hills Street retail store fronts, I mentioned at the top of the call. So, like you, we wonder about the future demand for this premium retail space.", "Our street retail space here on Bedford and Brighton Way formerly leased to traditional clothing and jewelry retailers is about to be occupied by a next-generation pharmacy within fusion therapy capabilities and a surgery center walking clinic for one of California's largest academic medical centers. This major health system realized, they need to have a more consumer-friendly retail facing ambulatory care strategy.", "They chose Beverly Hills and they chose to be at the Welltower. Yes, the four buildings we own in Beverly Hills are branded Welltower. And people here talk about seeing their doctors at the Welltower.", "In one of the world's most sought-after retail destinations, the new anchor is Welltower. This is an important indicator of where healthcare delivery is headed, and we cannot be more excited about the opportunities before us.", "So, now Dorothy, please open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.", "Michael Mueller", "Quick question on development, it looks like you have about $1.6 billion of unstabilized developments and out of curiosity, how long is the average property staying in that bucket and are there any changes in terms of the trends staying in there longer or shorter period of time?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Traditionally, our development projects might take roughly 18 months to complete and we traditionally also expect anywhere between 18 and 24 months for lease up and I'm talking now about seniors housing, as you probably know in outpatient medical when we develop property, we find large, they are 75% or more pre-leased before we even commence construction. So, I hope that gives you some rough estimates of how we see our fill up and so on.", "Michael Mueller", "Okay, but nothing is really changing or it's taking longer or shorter period of time, it's fairly - is that right?", "Mercedes Kerr", "No, nothing has changed in those kind of - those are very standard assumptions I think to prove out consistently.", "Michael Mueller", "Got it, Okay. And one other question in terms of shop same-store occupancy ended the quarter at about 89.5%, can you talk a little bit about where you see that going through the balance of the year and even into 2018, if you could?", "Shankh Mitra", "So, without being too specific, Michael. As you know there is a seasonality in the business, right. So, if it's purely thinking sequentially we would expect some occupancy improvement through the year, as I mentioned before that occupancy trends have been lowered than what we expected.", "And to be honest with you, we're not trying to optimize or maximize occupancy, we're trying to maximize revenue. So, we will see as you sort of think about the revenue maximization, we'll see what market gives us, but we're constantly playing occupancy versus rate game and we will see what market gives us. But definitely, you will see sequentially as you see in the business slight improvement sequentially through the end of the year.", "Michael Mueller", "Okay. That was it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.", "Steve Sakwa", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess just wanted to talk, I know you guys have been very active with overseas partners and investors and the Chinese in particular and I'm just wondering if you've seen any change in terms of their appetite given all of the - I guess rhetoric that's come out of the country about deploying capital overseas?", "Shankh Mitra", "That's a great question, Steve. If you think about from the two or three categories of overseas investors, we have seen a material increase in the larger companies or larger insurance companies with a very large balance sheets in overseas operations, including the sovereign wealth funds, very, very active. I have never seen this active before, but if you look at sort of the smaller insurance companies and asset managers, their capital control might have some effect on the private equity with most of the money is in Hong Kong, there has been no change not an increase or decrease that capital seems to be pretty steady and interesting in U.S. healthcare assets.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay, thanks. And then, I guess maybe a question for Scott just on sort of the issuing of equity. Obviously, the balance sheet was in great shape before your tap the ATM. How are you guys thinking of the usage of the ATM raising equity capital at these levels and what is the kind of primary drivers that make sure it's FFO accretive, NAV accretive I mean how do you guys think about that and what should we think about going forward?", "Scott Estes", "Sure. I think NAV accretion is a good benchmark but you think about it, we were just opportunistic really. If you think about it, we did complete about $300 million of gross investments this quarter. We have a pretty active development pipeline, we have about $540 million in projects underway and there are some more coming. So again, I think in small amounts if it's NAV accretive that's how we've chosen to deploy the ATM.", "Steve Sakwa", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chad Vanacore", "Hey, good morning, all of you. So, just thinking about the seniors housing occupancy trends, which have been getting lower. Are you seeing anything that indicate the change in the trend of rising any acceleration or deceleration?", "Shankh Mitra", "No, Chad as I said that sequentially we would expect the improvement, but year-over-year, I think you will still see a decrease obviously I'm talking about U.S. We're seeing significant improvement in occupancy in UK. So, we're trying to maximize revenue, not occupancy. I cannot emphasize on that enough that how we are thinking about this.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yeah, Chad from a leading indicator standpoint, I think you'll have to look at capital availability for construction in seniors housing. The supply you're seeing today has a lot to do with capital availability that started back in late 2013, 2014, 2015, that has driven the supply that's really coming on - that started coming on the market last year.", "Anecdotally, we've been told that capital availability for new construction in seniors housing is back to 2009 levels, which means that's minimal, So, if you think about that with the aging curve, the 85 plus cohort starting to accelerate in just about 2.5 years from now, you would have expected that the supply of capital would be today to meet that demand, so - but that's not the case. So, we think actually there'll be - there potentially is a supply demand imbalance when the - really when the demographics when start really propelling our business.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, so capital availability getting tighter - and absorption is pretty in the street.", "Tom DeRosa", "We're pretty encouraged. Yeah, I would say that it's very market specific. We keep harping on the fact that we have and I'll use Mercedes word, curated our portfolio. It's concentrated in high barrier to entry. More resilient regions of the U.S., Canada and the UK and that is what is behind our performance.", "There you can't paint the U.S. or any of the other markets with one brush. So, we are now - we also had said, we were seeing spikes in labor costs in the major markets earlier than you were seeing in smaller secondary market.", "So, in a way - we always believed we were seeing the spikes last year and to early this year. Now we started to see that moderate. It's hard to predict that. But I think the major markets that Welltower is focused in are behaved differently and it's what's driving our performance.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, so now I'm going to ask a granular question that hopefully either you or Mercedes can answer, which is if you're talking about the MSA that are you are in. Are you seeing any difference in what NIC map is recording in those MSAs and then your performance in those MSAs?", "Shankh Mitra", "Chad, if you don't mind me answering that question, we definitely - as you know that we have very significant concentration in great submarkets. So, when you think about NIC map, you think mostly MSA.", "We do not think about business in MSA terms. We think about our business in submarket terms, even more granular than that. And we are in a very wealthy location in the markets, so obviously their reports are significantly higher than average MSA. So, we're seeing outperformance, but I would not just attribute that to very difference of - sort of MSA position like it's just a submarket and wealth locations driving that, but we're definitely seeing very significant demand growth and many, many locations that I mentioned So Cal, No Cal, Seattle and everything else.", "From another - there are one place that we are not seeing that. I think I had mentioned that is New England is under - there is some supply in New England, so their MSA is under pressure, we're seeing that too and New York MSA the same thing. New York MSA is starting to bounce back in our portfolio. We are hoping to see that New England follow very soon.", "Chad Vanacore", "All right, thanks for taking the questions.", "Shankh Mitra", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Thank you. Shankh, just following up on the RIDEA side. Would you be able to give us what the change in occupancy was across regions?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, if you look at, we usually don't do that, but I want you to think about a business as a diversified portfolio where we allocate capital, not just U.S. or UK or Canada. Our focused on one particular country because it's doing well and also doing well. But just throughout, for this I'll give you the numbers, the occupancy in U.S. is down 180 basis points just 1/4, Canada is down 120 basis points and UK, 180 basis points.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And just sticking to an RIDEA, you obviously - you had great cost control, can you maybe just elaborate a bit on that and like what for the exact drivers that I saw on the other bucket that was down about 6%, could you just give us some color for what that was?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, so I think I try to mention that in my prepared remarks, if that bucket, if you look at consist of A, first is we saw a very significant cost control success in raw foods and utilities by moving to the other buckets, we are seeing some very significant improvement in worker's comp, insurance, marketing, professional services and also our internal management fees.", "So, we have seen that pretty much across the board. We now enjoyed the fruits of our efforts for group purchasing and others that we have been talking about for years to come. And very significant and focus asset management efforts in this area. So, across the board there is not one-line item that I can talk about, that is driving that but we're seeing it across the board.", "Tom DeRosa", "No, go ahead.", "Vikram Malhotra", "No, I was just going to say no, it's actually very strong performance across the board. So, congrats on that.", "Tom DeRosa", "Vik, this is a business that really requires the real estate partner to be very hands on. And I know Mercedes mentioned this in her remarks. I mean we have over a number of years made significant investments on the asset management side here.", "Our UK turnaround has a lot to do with the people that work in our UK office. We have 10 people in London, they are very hands on. There were a number of management challenges that were negatively affecting performance of our UK portfolio. Those issues would not have been address had Welltower's team really been on the ground there. And making sure that the right initiatives were being implemented, so we can turn that performance around and that is the same - that's the same story across Canada and the U.S. This is a rollup the sleeves real estate business. And we feel that because of that investment we've made we take some level of risk out of this business.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Tom, I want to include that operators I think overtime at some of these initiatives I was trying to play through have really grown more and more comfortable with our ability to collaborate in some of these projects that Tom was describing. And so, it's an evolution that we feel very comfortable about and I just want to make sure that I mentioned that our operating partners naturally are an important component of it.", "Vikram Malhotra", "So, that make sense. And Tom, I have to ask you since you talked about Beverly Hills and Welltower, when you changed the name of the company, did you think people would be going to the Welltower store.", "Tom DeRosa", "Of course, they would - they would think about it, but it's very interesting here. At some point, we'll bring some analysts to see what we have here. What we are doing is in a sense creating a wellness district through the real estate that we are own here in Beverly Hills. And now the retail, which again if you came here, five years ago, you would have seen typical retail in medical office buildings. What's happening is we are starting to drive a new class of retail here. And your people even on the - I think in the mall and shopping center, sectors have been talking about how they want to drive healthcare to the traditional mall or street or strip center, we're actually doing it here.", "And I think the fact is, I was very surprised how quickly people have grabbed on to the Welltower name, but it's interesting again looking at our windows, I see Neiman Marcus in Fifth Avenue on top of buildings and across the street our four buildings that say Welltower, so people are starting to recognize this name and what we hope it stands for is quality real estate that if you are in healthcare, if you're a healthcare - being in a building it says Welltower stands for quality and stability.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Good morning. First of all, congrats on the really solid quarter, it's good to see. I have two questions. First of all, the shop portfolio, could you talk specifically about the outperformance in the UK like what are markets kind of fundamentals doing in UK that making it kind of have this consistent outperformance versus the other market?", "John Goodey", "Yeah, hi there. It's John Goodey from the International team. So, it's a good question. Morning. The market dynamics are relatively benign right now is the only stance or so, we have a in UK a rough balance between supply and demand in the sector that we care about which is the first in business class and equivalent of the industry. The big difference I think is the partnership as Mercedes said, we have with our operating partner Sunrise that run the Sunrise and Gracewell branded buildings there.", "So, we've been working diligently with them for the last 18 months. so on how to maximize the performance of those buildings in the complex of the markets and Shankh used the time neighborhood, this is neighborhood relative business.", "And it's been just real diligence hard work, hard work on cost, hard work on positioning those buildings on the revenue side as well and seeking to maximize the overall revenue from the buildings not just occupancy or rate growth. So, because of the superior locations and you'll see it in some of our supplemental disclosure, our ability to drive the revenue per occupied room in those buildings has been international this year, it was good last year, it's been very good this year and that's just aligned with overall occupancy growth of nearly 2 percentage points across the portfolio.", "So, it's just the hard work element seem to be becoming together now and it's just driving performance and it's durable, it's not water change at least not for now until the basis of performance changes, we feel good about H2 as well.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Okay. But how do you end up measuring kind of incoming supply versus in the competitive kind of property side versus your assets?", "John Goodey", "Yeah, so unfortunately, we don't have a NIC database in the UK, but as you can imagine we have our A's to the ground on performance all across the portfolio of - that is also around what our competitors are doing and what's coming on and there are local clusters where there is strong supply growth, because there's strong demand growth as well.", "So, we have - Welltower is not operating in a vacuum. We people doing what we do in the UK. I think we do it best, but we are imbalanced in many of the markets and what we are seeking to do and I think I said this before we own a small fraction of the facilities back in the UK but a very high fraction of the quality that Welltower likes.", "So, what we're doing is selective info acquisitions small time, but also acquire a lot of construction and that takes hard work like we did in Manhattan another high wealth areas this is where the operator relationships in the Welltower capabilities come together to build buildings in areas of London, for example they're really hard to access, they take multiple years just to find a site and then to construct.", "So, that's the competitive advantages is finding these high barriers to entry markets with real resilience to entry as well and then working hard to plant the Welltower flag there.", "Shankh Mitra", "And I'll just add one more point to that, if you think about our UK business is primarily London focused. London is probably the toughest market to build that we operate in maybe other than the West side of LA. So, it's significantly harder to build in London than in New York MSA for example, so you're seeing the UK, I don't want you to think just as UK results. This is more greater London centric results.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Got you. That's helpful. And one more from me Shankh, MOB portfolio - you did talk about a turn around and performance in the back half of 2017, what specifically are you looking as that are you looking at that's going to end up resulting on acceleration in same-store NOI growth for the MOB portfolio?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, I mean as I said if you think about the quarter, obviously we're not so pleased with 1.6% NOI growth. But it's just a question of timing. If you think about every quarter is a snapshot of 90 days. Right we as long-time owner real estate, we don't run our business for 90 days increment.", "So least thing, as I said has been pretty strong and running ahead of our expectation. But there has been couple of unexpected move-outs as well as it's taking longer for tenant [ph] and other things. For this, tenant to come into the space and commence it. So, it's just a question of timing, you will see the economics have shifted from quarter-to-quarter. We don't really focus too much on that, but given from here you would see the acceleration, of course.", "Scott Estes", "Yes, Tayo, the MOB portfolio has been unbelievably consistent for years and years and years. The occupancy has been 94.5% to 95% and we very consistently generated the 2% to 2.5% growth. So, that's what we continue to expect in short-term here.", "Omotayo Okusanya", "Got you. Thank you very much.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tayo.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital.", "John Kim", "Thanks, Tom. I think with your balance sheets, the strong has it's been for a while in getting strong in the near-term. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of investment opportunities as far as the investment type and the timing.", "Mercedes Kerr", "So, we have been working for some time. I think I mentioned earlier that we are reticent to participate in widely auctioned sort of processes where there seems to be some exuberance and little bit of a flossy market, not enough growth for what we think our shareholders deserve. And so, what we have been working on instead is this off-market more proprietary type of a pipeline.", "We are actually very encouraged by what we see. Some of that we will take a longer to materialize because the relationships for example with top health system are ones that we are building from scratch and but we have some real momentum in that case.", "And then there is what we sometimes have referred to as our shadow pipeline, the ongoing business that we get from our own existing operating platform from our partners, which is very consistent again largely off-market. So that we're not knocking ourselves up, trying to compete in the market with others and so. There is a very solid pipeline ahead. It is - in some cases, I think we'll be able to talk about it this year and in some cases, these are through opportunities like the ones that Tom was describing in the disruption of healthcare real estate that may take just a little longer to materialize that will be significant.", "John Kim", "Mercedes, you've mentioned increasing your exposure to academic and medical centers. Is life sciences at the class you would consider entering back in again?", "Mercedes Kerr", "It's not something that we're considering at this time. It is such a unique and different asset class even though I know sometimes it's considered into healthcare category, I supposed I understand why, but from our perspective with respective to how it is underwritten, how it is managed, it's just such a different animal from what we're focused on right now.", "John Kim", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.", "Smedes Rose", "Hi. Thanks. So, I'm going to a follow-up, you mentioned your sort of Welltower health district in Beverly Hills and I was just wondering could that kind of strategy of creating a consumer-friendly healthcare facility for consumers. It's actually you could formally be targeting other U.S. markets to create a similar kind of concentrated healthcare facilities.", "Tom DeRosa", "Definitely, Smedes. We think that it's really important that healthcare and the concept of wellness is hard to be really come to mainstream and that's what we are seeing here in Beverly Hills and we clearly think there are other markets for that.", "The concept of wellness is finally rising to a priority, not only for major health systems but also for the healthcare industry at large. And if you think about the only institutionalized wellness model that we now, exist in senior housing industry.", "So, and when I wellness I mean nutrition and hydration and physical movement on social comment of engagement safety usually elements that we deliver to the 85 plus cohort but the fact is other populations need that wellness model as well.", "So, we think that there is an opportunity in partnership with health systems and partnership with major health insurers to start to take wellness and bring it to mainstream, bring into the consumer. So, we are very excited about that.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay, thanks. And I just want to ask one more on your shop via comparisons, I know there is some fitness here but I should be starting if you could provide a little more color around the adjustments to last year's number, let's say healthcare to bring 60% growth for the U.S. portfolio. Could you just walk through that a little bit more?", "Scott Estes", "Sure Smedes, this is Scott. It sounds like you're just referencing the normalizing adjustments and again I would - for everyone's benefit. We have a strict policy that we review with the audit committee every quarter and these are just really unusual item. So, actually a lot of the things that happened in 2016 were benefit that we didn't take like we received some insurance reimbursement proceeds of almost $8 million that out of last year's number.", "There is some minor adjustments like a worker's comp and a payroll approval that we didn't take the benefit of. So, they're all listed there and the footnotes on page 24 and if you wanted to spend more time, we would be happy to do it, that is pretty straightforward. But we're not - this quarter, there were more things that we did more in our supplement in 2Q 2016.", "Smedes Rose", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Scott Estes", "Sure. Thanks, Smedes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Market.", "Jordan Sadler", "Thank you. Good morning. So, the next data suggest that the under-construction pipeline continues to win and HCN's portfolio looks relative good on this basis? And it seems to show up a little bit in your sequential performance year-over-year at least. So, do you believe that show fundamentals have bottomed here and who are we setting up into 2018?", "Shankh Mitra", "Jordan, it's too early to comment on 2018, but we definitely paying that the show fundamentals for the year have definitely bottomed last quarter. So, I can tell you that, overall, I mean I will not - if you think about the numbers as we said, starts our peak in Q3, Q4 of 2016 and they are coming down, if you think about average it takes as of the 18 months to 24 months impact.", "I still think we have few quarters to go through a tough operating environment, we're very pleased that kind of performance we are generating even in that environment. But I would not be saying that from the supply impact has bottomed just yet. But we hope to see it in next probably 12 months. It's very hard to predict but definitely in our time horizon, we are very excited that is in near-term.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. And then on the - this is complete [indiscernible], but on the acquisition of the on-campus MOB in the quarter, I guess in Austin, Ascension Health asset, it looks like a pretty good yield. I'm wondering one if that's stabilized number and two - or if it's the going in number. And two, if you see significant incremental one-off opportunities for outpatient medical purchases?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes, that's actually there is - it's a multi-tentative building but there is a gap master lease if you will, to support master lease from the health system in place that is for now bridging frankly a very small difference between what the actual occupancy or the real occupancy of the building is and what we would consider stabilized. So, we have a support mechanism in place, but soon to probably be of no need because have the same occupied with the final users. So, that's sort of but the property that you're asking about in Texas, the Ascension property.", "And you're right, we are - so Ascension is a system with which we have large relationship, we have actually many of those and to the extent that we can be helpful to them even on a one-off basis given the existing of relationship, the nature of existing contract, et cetera. It just makes it efficient for us to - from time-to-time to a single property, a single development or acquisition whereas sometimes we might look to try to move the needle faster.", "But this is a more efficient that you said it's a good yield, there is no reason why we wouldn't be doing a follow-on business here and so, we really enjoy that that's part of the shadow pipeline that I was referring to earlier.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay, so that seller provided the master lease?", "Mercedes Kerr", "No, it's actually the health system, that's it and like I said, it's a really small amount space, I'm talking about maybe 5000 square feet or something like that, I think that largely that space is now occupied, I don't have the number in front of me, but if you would like more details about that we can speak separately.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay. Thank you for the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.", "Vincent Chao", "Hi, good morning, everyone. Shankh, maybe just question for you back to the optimization of the show seems the revenue growth 2.3% in the quarter mysterious how close you think, you are to opted more at this point or do you think there we could see occupancy dip maybe even more below where we're used to seeing most real estate have price and power?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, so I think, thanks for your question, Win. If you think about its we've to say this is not something we do sitting in front of a computer and deciding more in our optimized revenue occupancy or rate should be. You have to see what the market gives you, right? You have to see what the demand is and you are doing this on a daily basis and obviously our operators are very sophisticated, they understand the market and they are doing it on a daily basis, this is the way asset management in sense of business, right?", "So, you have to see that, I can tell where things are going sitting today, I'll tell you how things have played out.", "Sequentially, we should expect some occupancy improvement and as I said that year-over-year the occupancy is down or can we see that it will be down more, we absolutely can see. We're trying to maximize the revenue not occupancy and but sequentially we'd probably see improvement from here from an occupancy perspective and it's too early to talk about 2018.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. And then maybe a question on the pipeline Mercedes, it sounds like there is a pretty healthy pipeline there, but investment volumes as you said are below by historical standards for yourselves. What you think is the delta, the pipeline is strong, is it just seller expectations are too high at this point?", "Mercedes Kerr", "I hope that not in the pipeline that I'm talking about. This is off-market pipeline we think is going to bring adequate returns. I would almost as we sit in our table and talked among ourselves, we sometimes think that as we continue to remain disciplined as I described before, we are likely to do much better even with the lower investment volume than others will, who might be putting more dollars to work with a lot less storks if you will.", "We actually do feel like this proprietary - that we are describing, it's going to not only show an opportunity for us to put money to work, but then for us to put money to work really above average.", "Vincent Chao", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question...", "Tom DeRosa", "We know you all have to get on another call in 2 minutes, we're just going to have time from one other question of, we'll be happy to take, those of you who are in the queue, who did not get your question answered, please reach out today. So, final question.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll", "Great. Sounds like I just made it this time. For Shankh, could you go real quick, I think last quarter you talked about you had three term sheets out for the Genesis portfolio or at least portions of the Genesis portfolio, can you give us an update on that?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, we are still negotiating a lot of this term sheet and we see very significant demand as I said from overseas as well as domestic sources. It's too early to comment you know these things obviously take a long time as we have told you last year that we have a steady hand on the wheel here and we will continue to execute, but as you know unfortunately real estate transaction takes longer than 90 days period to get done, but we have lot of interest from a lot of investors including those three.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. And then just last question on the remaining portfolio is there much differences between what you have left versus what you sold in the prior quarters?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, absolutely. So, if you think about our crown jewel in our Genesis portfolio that's our power back asset. We have retained all those assets, most of those assets in the remaining portfolio.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks. So, we're going to wrap up here and please reach out to us with any questions you have. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for dialing-in to the Welltower earnings conference call.

My name is Dorothy, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim McHugh", "Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower\u2019s third quarter 2017 results. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and John Goodey, CFO.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance those projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, and from time to time in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com.", "Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I wanted to point out four highlights regarding our third quarter 2017 results. First, we reported 4.1% year-over-year same-store growth in our senior housing operating portfolio, supported by greater than 3.5% growth across all three of our global geographies; second, driven by senior housing operating performance, we reported total portfolio same-store growth of 3.4% in the quarter, allowing us to raise full year total portfolio same-store guidance for the second time this year to 2.5% to 3%; third, as a result of the continued strong property performance, we are increasing normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.19 to $4.25 per share from our prior guidance range of $4.15 to $4.25 per share; and fourth, we finished the quarter at 5.19x net debt to EBITDA, representing a half-turn reduction in year-over-year leverage.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom for further remarks on our quarter.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tim. As Tim just highlighted, we are pleased to report a strong quarter characterized by industry-leading results from Welltower\u2019s premier seniors housing portfolio, which is concentrated in major metro markets. The REIT sector appreciates the resilience of A-quality real estate in most industry categories, and our performance supports the fact that health care real estate is no different.While the overall environment remains challenging, our same-store seniors housing operating portfolio registered 4.1% growth, with the U.S. posting 3.7%.Keep in mind that we have 423 properties in our same-store operating pool, which is by far the largest same-store operating portfolio in the industry. So our numbers are statistically significant, consistent from quarter-to-quarter and financially reliable.", "The unique hands-on operations and data and analytics-focused approach we employ in the senior housing space is validated by our continued outperformance, and we continue to attract top-quality operators to the Welltower family.", "Together, Welltower and our premier operating partners deliver premier results. I\u2019m proud to announce that Sagora Senior Living, a resident-first centered operator based in Fort Worth, joins our bench of RIDEA operators. Donny Edwards, Bryan McCaleb and Robert Bullock have built an outstanding business with some of the highest quality next-generation assets I\u2019ve seen in this industry.", "For Sagora, we used the security of a triple net lease to incubate this exceptional team and their business plan. Now as Sagora has achieved critical mass, we employ the RIDEA structure to share the future upside in the value of Sagora and the real estate. This new joint venture better aligns Welltower and Sagora to grow and enhance investment returns.", "We also welcomed Encore, a U.K.-based operator of assisted living and independent living, this quarter. Many of you know, Welltower dominates the high-end private pay senior housing business in the U.K., and Encore further solidifies our position there.", "Welltower is quite bullish about the future of health care real estate, so in the current environment, we are taking every opportunity to enhance and derisk our business platform, so that we can take full advantage of the significant strategic opportunities to deploy capital we see in the future. We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing leverage to 5.19x net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter. We continue to sell assets in noncore markets and assets where CapEx investment does not offer an appropriate risk-adjusted return.", "Further, we have continued to look for ways to limit our exposure to assets subject to government reimbursement. And while we work with our operating partners to better manage expense growth, we also continue to tighten our own belt. This quarter, you saw us donate our headquarters building in Toledo to the University of Toledo, which will allow us to maintain our corporate headquarters on this bucolic campus, while lowering our annual operating expenses by several millions of dollars per year going forward.", "Along with other efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our business model, we are tracking overall G&A to decline from $155 million to below $130 million for the year. Keep in mind, we are undertaking these initiatives from a position of strength, all with an eye toward driving growth and shareholder value in the future.", "I\u2019ll now hand the mic over to my colleague and friend, Mercedes Kerr.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Well, thank you, Tom. I would like to start today by describing the organization\u2019s resolve, which we witnessed from our operating partners and Welltower\u2019s own property management team last quarter.", "Hurricanes, floods and forest fires put many people at risk, and it put about 100 Welltower outpatient medical properties and senior housing communities in the path of these natural disasters. We saw first-hand what great team preparedness and good property maintenance can do to minimize losses and protect our residents, tenants and buildings. Our property management team ran around the clock surveillance during the worst of the storm, and without hesitation, our seniors housing operators took in dozens of residents who had to be evacuated from other area communities.", "There was an impact to our quarter earnings resulting from these storms. However, we viewed this as a cost of doing business and the numbers are included in our financial statements as an ordinary expense. We are grateful to Welltower\u2019s and our operators\u2019 staff for keeping our tenants and residents safe and our properties in good order.", "Turning to Welltower\u2019s investment activities in the third quarter. We continue to expand our existing partnerships and also added a new one, which I will describe in a moment. 95% of the $381 million of new investments that we reported involved existing relationships. We acquired $304 million at a blended yield of 6.5% and funded $70 million of construction, with an expected stabilized yield of 7.9%. We also funded $7 million in loans with a combined yield of 7.8%. Dispositions of $84 million included $51 million of loan payoffs at an average yield of 8.3% and $33 million of property sales, with a blended yield of 8%.", "Welltower\u2019s relationships continually produce desirable off-market opportunities with above average returns and a reduced risk. It makes our repeat business model exceptionally valuable. As we look to 2018, and we study the specific transactions available with our partners, we\u2019re optimistic about the new business opportunities that we will source for our shareholders. In addition, some of our investments in 2018 will also bring in new relationships. It is something that we do selectively, but consistently through the cycle. A good example of this is Encore Care Homes in the UK, which we added to our family of operators in the third quarter of 2017. Our first investment with this quality operator marks the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship, which we expect to expand significantly over the coming years. We are pleased to have joined forces with this innovative team, and are excited to grow our platform together.", "Lastly, on the asset management front, we continue to drive efficiency wherever possible by supporting our operating partners so that they can perform even better. We recently hosted 12 operating companies for one of our Welltower collaborative events, where we share proprietary lead generation tool and presented new technology to help reduce employee turnover. This work, combined with our operator strength and willingness to participate, is the great differentiator which drives Welltower\u2019s superior performance.", "I will now turn the call over to Shankh Mitra, who will provide more color on our portfolio results.", "Shankh Mitra", "Thank you, Mercedes, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results for different segments of the business, and provide you with an update on our continuing portfolio repositioning efforts.", "We\u2019re very pleased with our results and are increasing our same-store NOI guidance for the overall portfolio to 2.5% to 3% on the back of significant outperformance on our SHO portfolio, which grew 4.1% year-over-year. I will remind you that we do not update our outlook for the segment level NOI growth throughout the year, but we are tracking towards the top end of our original 1.5% to 3% guidance for the SHO portfolio. Same-store NOI increased 3.4% year-over-year for the entire portfolio. The triple net portfolio continued its reliable performance as our senior housing triple net segment grew 3%. The payments stream remained secure despite a 2 basis points of optical decline in coverage. This decline was primarily driven by the removal of Sagora portfolio, part of which was converted to a RIDEA joint venture as Sagora had higher coverage than the overall triple net portfolio. While industry debate is often focused on RIDEA versus triple net, we have combined the best of both worlds in structuring this relationship. Newer assets in the best of markets are now structured as RIDEA joint venture, while more middle-market assets where we can earn reliable and consistent returns are part of a triple net portfolio. Alignment of interests and downside protections were two of the most important pillars of restructuring. We\u2019re extremely confident in Donny and Bryan\u2019s ability to drive significant value here. The outpatient medical portfolio reported 2.4% NOI growth in Q3. Growth rebounded from Q2, as we expected, due to strong leasing and high tenant retention.", "Our steady performance and continued growth demonstrates why institutional investors are flowing into this asset class. Our post-acute portfolio, which constitutes 13% of our NOI and approximately 7% of our value, grew same-store NOI at 3.1% for the quarter. Our payments stream remained secure at 1.55 times on EBITDARM and 1.24 times on EBITDAR basis. I would like to remind everyone that management fees are subordinate to rent as defined in our master leases. This decline in coverage was driven by our skilled nursing portfolio as well as our small LTAC portfolio. Specifically focusing on Genesis, it is no secret that skill mix and occupancy have been materially impacted by the evolution of reimbursement model over last few years. However, we are really encouraged by the sequential stabilization of EBITDAR in a majority of our Genesis portfolio. We are confident that Genesis will be a winner in the new value-driven landscape because of its superior clinical abilities. We and other Genesis-graded parties understand the current capital structure is suboptimal.", "As you know, we\u2019re going through a disposition program that will provide a substantial deleveraging event for Genesis. We have select the counter party -- we have selected the counter parties, and largely negotiated the economics and structure and are currently working towards documentation. Given the current status of this transaction, we cannot further comment on this topic other than to say that upon successful completion of these deals, Genesis will receive approximately $25 million of rent credit and reduced escalators, as you have seen from our last two Genesis transactions. This meaningful deleveraging of Genesis will put the company in a sustainable capital structure and accelerate market share gain, which will help our joint venture partners and our retained interest, while crystallizing value for our shareholders today. As a reminder, we own real estate assets, loans and some equity interest in Genesis. While we cannot guarantee any outcome, we\u2019re confident in our ability to execute and hopeful that you as our shareholders will keep the same faith in us as you did last year to maximize the value of our total capital deployed with Genesis. We are encouraged and grateful for your support in our path of maximizing value for our existing shareholders rather than the short-term temptation of solving fund equation -- exposure equation only to attract the new ones. Our senior housing operating portfolio is the highlight of the quarter, with meaningful outperformance relative to our budget. Occupancy trends were slightly lower than we expected, about 20 basis points, weaker in Canada and U.K., but better in the U.S. This favorable occupancy trends were significantly offset by our pricing power, 30 basis points above budget, which resulted a strong rate growth, up 3.9% year-over-year, and significantly better expense trend, up only 0.8% year-over-year. Both Canada and U.K. outperformed expectations in terms of rate growth. As we mentioned before, our premier operating partners are consistently optimizing the rate and occupancy equation to maximize revenue. We\u2019re very proud that they have achieved this growth while keeping expenses in check.", "As our operators strike the right balance between excellent care delivery and efficient staffing model, our labor cost continues to moderate from the highs, up 3.6% this quarter versus 4.1% last quarter relative to a peak of 7.4% in Q1 of \u201816. Our group repurchasing and other cost consolidation initiative are been realized through expense savings in food, professional services, insurance, utilities and incentive management fee. We believe our data and analytics-driven asset management approach will continue to help us produce superior results in the long term. Southern California, northern California, Toronto, London, Vancouver and Seattle were significant drivers of growth this quarter. The greater New York MSA has bounced back and produced better-than-portfolio result for the first time in handful of quarters. New England continuous to be challenging, though it is improving sequentially for the second quarter in a row. With respect to different product types, we have observed significant outperformance of both revenue and NOI growth in assisted living versus independent living this quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the greater stickiness of residents in assisted living and memory care assets.", "So overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the operating performance of our portfolio, innovative structuring with Sagora and progress on our disposition efforts in the post-acute segment of the business.", "With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to John Goodey, our CFO. John?", "John Goodey", "Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our third quarter, and I\u2019ll take you on our guidance for the remainder of the year. ", "Our strong Q3 2017 financial performance once again shows the superior quality of our real estate and operator relationships as well as the strength of the Welltower platform to allocate capital and deliver results. We continue to produce resilient same-store growth, maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position and improve our own corporate operational efficiency. The highlight of our quarter was the performance of our senior housing operating portfolio, which saw same-store NOI growth of 4.1%, driven by REVPOR growth of 3.9%, aligned with good operational expense control.", "Growth was delivered across the three countries of our operations, with the U.S. recording same-store operating NOI growth of 3.7% against a challenged overall market backdrop. This growth, combined with good results from our senior housing triple net and outpatient medical businesses, augmented with in-quarter growth investments of $381 million, have enabled us to report a solid normalized FFO result of $1.08 per share.", "In addition to this quarter\u2019s acquisitions, we completed three seniors housing developments at $48 million of total costs, bringing year-to-date deliveries to $506 million. We expect an additional $76 million in conversions through the remainder of the year at a stabilized yield of approximately 9.3%.", "Although Q3 was a slower period for dispositions with only $84 million realized, we continue to see strong investor interest in our sectors, and we will continue to derisk our portfolio through targeted dispositions. In alignment with this, today we announced an increase in our disposition guidance for 2017 to $2.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. This represents an expectation of a further $1 billion of dispositions before year-end or soon thereafter. We anticipate a blended disposition yield of 7.4% for the year overall.", "Welltower continues to focus on our own corporate operational efficiency by optimizing systems, processes, people and physical infrastructure. Our G&A for the quarter was $29.9 million, a 19% reduction over Q3 2016. As such, we have further reduced our full year G&A expectation to be below $130 million, this being below the bottom end of our already lowered range of $130 million to $132 million. Clearly, we have systemically and durably reduced the cost base of Welltower\u2019s corporate operations, and we will continue to implement further initiatives to improve our efficiency.", "Our balance sheet remains in great shape, and we will continue to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. We ended the quarter with cash of $236 million and $2.6 billion of credit line availability. Our leverage metrics remain at historically low levels, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.19 times and net debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio of 35.5%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio remains strong at 3.65 times.", "All metrics have improved significantly over 1-year ago. Our strong liquidity affords us significant flexibility to pursue value-enhancing acquisitions, development opportunities in core metro markets such as Manhattan, London and Los Angeles, and to reinvest in our portfolio to drive growth.", "On November 20, 2017, Welltower will pay its 186th consecutive cash dividend of $0.87. This represents a current dividend yield of approximately 5%.", "I will conclude my remarks with our outlook for the rest of the year. Given our strong senior housing\u2019s operation performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year same-store NOI guidance, again, to 2.5% to 3% from 2.25% to 3% prior.", "We are also increasing our 2017 full year guidance for normalized FFO to $4.19 to $4.25 per share from $4.15 to $4.25 prior. This being based on the strength of our same-store NOI growth, our G&A focus and reprofiling of divestiture timings. As usual, we do not include unannounced acquisitions in our forecast but we do include expected dispositions.", "On that positive note of upward revision, I will hand it back to Tom for his closing comments and look forward to seeing many more of you in person before the close of the calendar year and continuing our open dialogue. Thanks, Tom.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thank you, John. Before we take your questions, I\u2019m proud to tell you that the Welltower Foundation and our community relations fund donated approximately $100,000 to a number of our operators to help support their employees whose lives were profoundly impacted by the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, and the fires in California. We hope that life there gets back to normal soon as well as in Puerto Rico.", "Now Dorothy, please open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel.", "Chad Vanacore", "Just picking up the Sagora conversion from triple net to RIDEA. You converted 11 properties. What was the coverage on those properties? And then, was this always in the plan or is this opportunistic? And then should we expect them to convert more of these remaining leases to RIDEA over time?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes. It\u2019s Mercedes. Let me talk to you a little bit more about Sagora. So we started this relationship in 2010, and as Tom mentioned, this triple net structure rather was somewhat of an incubator process, if you will, but there were a group of properties, these 11 properties that we converted to RIDEA, which stood out from what is otherwise a very solid portfolio, a very consistent performing portfolio, as a group of properties that had outsized growth. And so those were the ones that we decided fit very well in this RIDEA model. As you probably know, we are very selective about what we want to own in that kind of a joint venture structure. We try to, I suppose, manage volatility by really picking properties that we think have the opportunity for outsized growth and performance. So in any event -- the rest of the portfolio, which we thought was very suitable for the triple net lease structure because they are, by all accounts, cash cows for Sagora but don\u2019t have the same growth prospect. It\u2019s kind of the decision that we made with them. You saw, what we\u2019re calling kind of our version 2.0 of RIDEA joint venture, structuring tools, and by that I mean with respect to alignment, with respect to management contracts. So Sagora was very instrumental in us sort of designing some of these new found tools that we think are going to be very useful for us going forward.", "Chad Vanacore", "Mercedes, the outsized growth expectation, is that because these were in process of stabilization? Or they\u2019re outperforming in some other way?", "Shankh Mitra", "No, these properties, Chad, are in the best of markets in the footprint, and so we expect this portfolio that we have in, in RIDEA outperform because they\u2019re in the best submarkets as well as the best demographics.", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, Chad. It\u2019s Tom. Let me just make a comment regarding your broader question you asked. We built our business model around owning RIDEA assets. For Welltower, we see that as a lower risk structure because we\u2019ve built the full complement of skills, tools, technology to maximize the value of real estate in a RIDEA structure. So you will continue to see us look for operators that we may incubate in a triple net lease format to transition eventually to a RIDEA structure. And you\u2019ll see us likely move away from operators where we don\u2019t see the opportunity to transition the operator or the real estate into a RIDEA structure in the future. That is -- this is -- Sagora is a great example, and I\u2019m sitting here looking at my friend, Joe Weisenburger, who is very much responsible for this relationship and helping this business grow to where we could affect this transition. That\u2019s -- this is such an example of what this company does, and you\u2019ll -- you should expect to see more of that.", "Chad Vanacore", "And then, just thinking about your SHO fundamentals. They\u2019ve pretty much outperformed the industry. Do you think fundamentals have bottomed here coming into the fourth quarter of \u201817? Or should we expect more pressures in 2018?", "Shankh Mitra", "It\u2019s too early to comment about 2018. As you know, we don\u2019t know what exactly the flu seasons will look like. We are receiving the operator budgets now and, obviously, we have a huge process that we go through with every one of our operators. So it\u2019s really too early to comment on 2018. But what I can tell you is, we remain very optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to outperform the industry as well as our peers because of where we are and also the asset management and systems and processes that Tom mentioned. Because if you think about the supply impact, you will see, obviously, 2017 was a deliveries peak. But you also -- if you think about what that means for next 12 months, right. So this will impact operation, but we absolutely believe that we will -- our property, our property and our -- properties in our portfolio will hold up better than the industry and better than peers.", "Chad Vanacore", "So if we can\u2019t take about 2018 yet, fourth quarter 2017, what occupancy and rate assumptions are baked in your guidance?", "Shankh Mitra", "We do not give quarterly guidance on rates and occupancies, but we are pretty optimistic about rest of the year as far as our SHO portfolio is concerned.", "Chad Vanacore", "So one more for me. On the disposition guidance, you raised it from $2 billion to $2.4 billion. What asset classes are you expecting in that increase?", "Shankh Mitra", "That in the senior housing, triple net portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.", "Mike Mueller", "I guess, looking at the Sagora acquisition cap rate of 7.3%. Can you just use that as a starting off point to talk about where you see cap rates for SHO assets at this point? And kind of how that fits into the mix?", "Justin Skiver", "So this is Justin Skiver, SVP of Underwriting. Just to give a little color on cap rates. And obviously, there is many factors involved, but generally speaking, we see Class A seniors housing trading at a 6% cap, plus or minus 50 basis points. And Class B seniors housing is trading at a slight discount to Class A, probably by about 25 basis points. But we view that delta as being too small, and there should be a larger spread between A and B class properties.", "Mercedes Kerr", "And I want to add to that. That\u2019s the beauty of this Sagora transaction, is the fact that we were able to have this relationship and build the trust and build the structure together that I described before, allowed us to take what we consider to be terrific assets with a lot of upside potential at a great price compared to market.", "Mike Mueller", "Got it. And how new are they? And how occupied are they? The ones that were acquired for the 7.3%?", "Justin Skiver", "Yes, the -- three are about three years old, on average, with occupancy in the low 60s. And I think, an important point to make here is that, we are acquiring these at below replacement cost. So we see a tremendous value upside in making this acquisition with Sagora.", "Shankh Mitra", "And Justin is specifically talking about the three new assets that we bought in Texas.", "Mike Mueller", "Yes, okay. And then just last question for me. Just any sort of update on the Manhattan development?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes. I can tell you that we continue to make progress. I think our assumptions continue to be validated, both on the cost side as well as with what we see happening in terms of a lack of supply and demand. So we feel very good about the progress. The construction, I think I already reported this last quarter, is underway with a demolition and so on underway. So just things continue to progress, and like I said, our assumption is validated.", "Mike Mueller", "Okay. So demolition is occurring. And when do you see it coming out of the ground?", "Mercedes Kerr", "We\u2019re still on the same timeline, that -- late 2019, early 2020 or so is the timeline that we have been indicating.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "I think, Shankh, you referenced the disposition program that went through Genesis assets. Can you maybe comment on the magnitude of the sale as far as what percentage of your Genesis exposure you\u2019re looking to sell?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, John, as I said, you can appreciate this is a live situation, right? I mean it\u2019s very hard to comment on the quantum as well as sort of what will be our retained interest right now. I can tell you that we\u2019re pretty much set on who we think that we\u2019ll go with. We\u2019re set on the economics and the structure and retained interest. But because it\u2019s a very live situation, I just don\u2019t want to comment on it anymore. So -- but we hope that we\u2019ll be able to talk to you about this particular situation in a lot more details soon.", "John Kim", "But this is separate from the $1 billion of dispositions for this year?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes.", "John Kim", "Right, okay. And then you also referenced the $25 million rent credit. Is that an annual figure? And when does that start taking place?", "Shankh Mitra", "That will take place at the close of the deal. So when the deals close, that\u2019s when we get the rent credit.", "John Kim", "Is it a onetime or an annual figure?", "Shankh Mitra", "It\u2019s a onetime.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "On the expense side, you\u2019ve now had two quarters of pretty strong expense controls. Can you give us a bit more details on sort of the moving parts? And I know, Shankh, you\u2019ve mentioned the comp control there. Just some more details, and just how sustainable are -- is this control? Is there more to go from here? Or is this sort of a good run rate?", "Shankh Mitra", "So I would not consider 0.8% as a good run rate. I just wanted to mention that, obviously. Look, we have heightened labor cost growth for last few quarters. As you know, we have talked about -- like we know, sort of the -- all the deliveries are lining up. There\u2019s been also the law of large numbers [indiscernible], right? So when you -- what happened in 2000 -- late 2015 and \u201816, labor cost went up but also the year-over-year comparison was very low. So year-over-year numbers growth was extraordinary. Now we\u2019re getting to more of a stabilized numbers, where you will see the labor cost will remain elevated but not to the extent that we have seen before. The other expense line item, as you can see, utilities, we\u2019re doing a lot. I mean there\u2019s a lot of very focused retrofit program here that\u2019s driving that lawsuit. You know we have a GPO. We\u2019re focusing a lot on our property taxes. Our asset management group is highly, highly focused on that. And then, it\u2019s the other expense bucket, the all other buckets, where we have seen, this quarter, a significant decrease. As I told you, last quarter, there\u2019s a huge focus on bringing down the professional management fees -- professional fees, lawyers and accountants and consultants, et cetera. There\u2019s significant decrease there. We have seen a significant decrease in the workers comp area as well in the workers comp insurance area, so it\u2019s across the board. We\u2019re looking at everything and trying to retool the business. Not much different from what you\u2019re hearing about our corporate. We\u2019re trying to say, \"Okay, where the business is? What is the sustainable cost model going forward?\" I cannot guarantee you that everything will continue to come down, but we think a lot of these savings are not onetime in nature.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just on the dispositions, I wanted to clarify, I think to an earlier question, that the $1 billion that you are expected to close by year-end, that includes any Genesis sales as well? Or is Genesis over and above that?", "Shankh Mitra", "Genesis is over and above that.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Okay. And then just maybe last one for me. Any update on some of the legal proceedings that you outlined last quarter? Any update on sort of where we are today? And anything on economics?", "Tom DeRosa", "Vik, you know what I\u2019m going to do? Let me have our General Counsel, Matt McQueen, answer that question for you.", "Matt McQueen", "Sure. Vik, as you know, it was disclosed that Welltower filed a lawsuit against Scott Brinker, alleging that he had breached his separation agreement with us in connection with the announcement that Mr. Brinker would start at HCP on January 4, 2018, which was the end of his non-compete period. So we\u2019re pleased to report that we\u2019ve recently reached the settlement of this lawsuit. Some of the terms are confidential, but I can say that under the terms of the settlement, Mr. Brinker is not permitted to begin work as the Chief Investment Officer of HCP before the date that we issue our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending in December 31, 2017, which will be on or around March 1 of 2018.", "Tom DeRosa", "I don\u2019t want to say anything further about this matter beyond what Matt said, but let me add that the first principle of how we approach everything at Welltower, including litigation, is that we do everything we can to protect our shareholder. That\u2019s what we will always do as a company, and you should not accept anything less than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "Shankh, did you give the -- if you said it, I apologize. Did you give the Genesis\u2019 rent coverage -- EBITDAR rent coverage today?", "Shankh Mitra", "No, we didn\u2019t. You will find that it\u2019s disclosed in our supplemental.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. I was searching for it and I didn\u2019t -- but can you give a sense of how that\u2019ll change post sales or is that too much information at this point?", "Shankh Mitra", "No, it\u2019s not. I think I said this before as well that the market is about 1.3 times coverage going forward. So it will be reset to 1.3 times coverage going forward.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay. Bigger picture, maybe for Tom. You guys have an interest in staying invested in Genesis for the couple of reasons you cited earlier in the call. Can you make that same comment about Brookdale?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Well, let me talk to you a little bit about Brookdale. Obviously, they\u2019ve put out their numbers as well. And so we\u2019re always concerned about any one of our operators that\u2019s having any trouble. And I think it behooves everyone, and it would be good for the industry for them to do well. So we\u2019re hopeful that they will do well. But having said that, we\u2019re not actually worried about our own portfolio with them. Their triple net EBITDAR coverage is actually above the Welltower average at 1.15 times. We have some possible type of protections in our portfolio, and we\u2019re always in discussions with Brookdale about performance and also around strategic alternatives. We have a good collaborative relationship with them. But like Tom just said, we\u2019re always looking to protect our shareholders\u2019 interests. So we\u2019re looking always at our alternatives, and we take, actually, comfort in knowing that two thirds of our portfolio with Brookdale is either in California or in Washington or a CON state, and we have excellent operators in every one of those regions who could step in and take over the building, so if we need ever -- if it were ever to arise.", "Tom DeRosa", "So Rich, just from my perspective, and you\u2019ve always heard us say this, Brookdale is not one of our operating partners. We\u2019ve never looked at Brookdale as an operating partner. That has always been more of a financial transaction. Our Brookdale exposure largely arose from the fact that Brookdale acquired some of our smaller operators. Look, we are cheering for Brookdale. We hope they can turn their business around, because the fact is, their issues affect the view of the entire industry. Never say never. But, they are not one of the operators I was referring to beforehand. So ones that we will come in and grow with, grow out of that triple net lease structure into a RIDEA structure longer term. They\u2019re very different situation for us, they always have been. So again, never say never. But, likely, we\u2019re not looking for growth opportunities there.", "Rich Anderson", "So if I\u2019m using how you describe wanting to move most -- anybody into RIDEA or maybe exit the relationship, is this ultimately as you see it today? It could change, but as you see it today, Brookdale is somebody or an operator you would ultimately part ways if everything stayed the same today. Is that a fair statement?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, we will continue to do what we can to optimize the value of the real estate. And we have lots of ways to manage this. If Brookdale\u2019s performance turned around, we might be happy to keep Brookdale in a triple net lease structure for the time being. The fact is, we have good real estate, as Mercedes said, in good markets. I think anyone who has looked closely at Brookdale knows that the Welltower leases are the best leases, because they are structured around a good portfolio of real estate, which gives us lots of optionality. So we\u2019re continuing to be in discussions with Brookdale -- we have been in discussions with Brookdale for years, and we will maximize whatever value option is in the best interest of our shareholders. That\u2019s the best thing I can say, Rich.", "Rich Anderson", "Through the press release today, several items related to UK investing, is that just coincidental timing? Or do you, as a firm, looking to expand there?", "John Goodey", "It\u2019s John. I\u2019ll take that one in my prior hat on, if I may. And I think the answer is, yes, we continue to expand in the UK We have a number of ongoing construction projects with...", "Rich Anderson", "John, let me just interrupt. Expand disproportionately more than where you\u2019re at today?", "John Goodey", "Well, I think law of numbers, that\u2019s quite hard to do, because we\u2019re sort of 8% of our portfolio relative to the overall portfolio is there. So obviously, we\u2019ve got a leverage -- a multiplication equation to overcome. But I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve had great performance in UK As you know, we\u2019ve got some great operating partners there that we continue to grow with. Mathematically, to grow it as a proportion is relatively difficult compared to the growth of the U.S. right now. But I think overall, are we looking to put more dollars to work in the UK? The answer is, absolutely yes, and we are doing that, as you can see, both through a conversion of construction projects into operational assets. We\u2019re bringing Encore as a new development partner, who we hope to grow very significantly with going forward, but also to back our existing partners like Avery, Sunrise and Signature.", "Rich Anderson", "And then last one for me, the $95 million of noncapitalizable transaction costs, what is that?", "John Goodey", "Well, essentially, I\u2019ll take that one on as well with my new hat on, I guess. And because we already owned the real estate, so we didn\u2019t buy any new buildings from them, U.S. GAAP, if you\u2019re very interested in such things, under ASC 805-10-51-21, allows us or means that we cannot capitalize those extra proceeds to Sagora for the transaction onto our balance sheet. We\u2019re not allowed to. The one statement I can make, which is the truism. If we had bought those assets, clean and clear as a first off transaction, that number would\u2019ve just been on our balance sheet. We\u2019d have had a capitalized rate on those RIDEA assets. That\u2019d been very attractive to Welltower, and there would have been -- literally would have been a nonevent. It\u2019s only because of the GAAP accounting.", "Tim McHugh", "Before the next question, I just want to clarify. This is Tim. I was intending to clarify something from a question earlier. In our current disposition guidance, we have a $1 billion in dispositions for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve kept $400 million in there, as most of you know, from a Genesis purchase option, that was an option going into the year. And we kept it in there to communicate to the market the intention to sell Genesis after that option expired. That $400 million is still in our guidance from a nominal dollar amount, and Shankh, I think, was intending just to stay that the scope of what he described in his opening comments goes beyond that. So there are Genesis dispositions in our guidance for right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One.", "Daniel Bernstein", "I just wanted to go ahead, and given Tom\u2019s earlier comments about the business platform being built around senior housing operating, and then with Sagora, the increase in NOI from seniors housing operating, should I read anything into that in terms of how you think that the seniors housing industry will recover from the down we are in now? Without specifics, obviously, on 2018, that you don\u2019t want to give out, but how should I be thinking about where you think fundamentals will be in a couple of years? And how much RIDEA you want in your portfolio going forward?", "Tom DeRosa", "Well, I\u2019ll start off the answer to that by saying, we\u2019re very optimistic about the senior housing industry and we\u2019ve been taking this opportunity to lighten up in markets and around operators that we do not see strategic to our business model in the future, and we invest behind operators and markets that are strategic. We have a core Metro market strategy in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And it is no secret that it is our intention to dominate those core markets. We believe the demographics, starting in about two years, are all in our favor and they\u2019re not going to reverse.", "Shankh Mitra", "And Dan, I want to add. If you look at the numbers even today and you look at the population growth -- nowhere in the demographics as a law, if you will -- the population grows 75-plus-years old. In that category for the last seven years, you\u2019ll see map 31 and map 99 is about 1.5%. If you look at the absorption of assisted living and memory care product, you\u2019ll see its five plus percent. That tells you how the products, the absorption is significantly growing above the population growth. And then you add what Tom just talked about, the population growth itself, we\u2019re extremely bullish about the industry.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay. And I should expect RIDEA to become a larger part of the portfolio generally from your 42% or so now it\u2019s...", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Okay. Is there a top limit of that?", "Tom DeRosa", "Hard to say.", "Daniel Bernstein", "Not to corner you.", "Shankh Mitra", "We are opportunity driven, not necessarily equation-driven that we\u2019re trying to sell for.", "Tom DeRosa", "I mean, look, if there was some phenomenal triple net lease opportunity that had really strong coverage in the right markets or with the right operator, we wouldn\u2019t turn that down. So as you keep hearing us say, we\u2019re opportunistic and keeping all our options open. But clearly, Dan, for us, we have built a model around maximizing the returns that wanted to derive from this operating lease or RIDEA structure. That is, if you don\u2019t have the infrastructure and the systems and the right people, that means it\u2019s riskier than a triple net lease. But we\u2019ve made those investments, and we\u2019ve seen, as you\u2019ve seen in our results quarter-over-quarter, particularly this quarter, we\u2019re able to get a return on that investment because we have the system. But it\u2019s not magic. We don\u2019t make it up. It doesn\u2019t come out of the air. It\u2019s real. And it\u2019s real because we roll up our sleeves and we work hard, alongside our operators, and that\u2019s what drives our results. And if you\u2019re not willing to do that, you should own this top category of real estate in a triple net restructure.", "Daniel Bernstein", "No. I can appreciate that. One more quick question regarding Brookdale. Could you talk about the trend in their lease coverages? And do they have any purchase options that can be exercised in, say, the next couple of years, two years?", "Mercedes Kerr", "With respect to trends, I think, sequentially, we\u2019ve seen them sort of stabilize a bit. We\u2019re seeing -- as you\u2019re looking at their corporate performance, which is probably emblematic of a lot of what\u2019s going on in their portfolio, which is some pressures on occupancy and the like. In our portfolio specifically, I think that they\u2019ve been very capable of maintaining cost. So that\u2019s been a very helpful tool for them. And so sequentially, I think they feel relatively stable to us. And with respect to purchase options, they\u2019re out in the future. At the end of some leases there might be 1 or two purchase options that are still left from old structures that remain.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll", "With regard to Sagora, did you disclose how much compensation you provided to the tenants who moved those 11 assets into the operating structure?", "John Goodey", "No. We haven\u2019t disclosed that.", "Michael Carroll", "Can you discuss it?", "John Goodey", "I think it\u2019s part of the contractual negotiations. I believe that\u2019s not disclosable. But as I said, I think the -- if you take a step back and look at the overall income from the triple net lease revised and the additional net operating income from the excess coverage of the triple net lease, the rate there is probably 50 to 100 basis points better than the present in [ph] the market if you were to buy this quality of assets with this quality of operator. I mean that\u2019s the sort of guidance I can give you. It was a -- overall a good transaction.", "Mercedes Kerr", "And the other thing that I could add is, we reinvested -- they\u2019re saying in the structure of the -- on the -- both on the lease side and the RIDEA side. They\u2019re staying in as joint venture partners with us. And so they have basically reinvested a book of whatever it is that they\u2019ve received in proceeds.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay. And then how much I guess of an ownership stake do they have in the JV? And is there any desire from them or you guys to transition the remaining assets into that structure too?", "Mercedes Kerr", "We have -- as we continue to add assets to this portfolio, and I think Justin talked earlier about some new assets that we just added to the portfolio. So yes, indeed over time, there might be properties that transform into RIDEA.", "Joe Weisenburger", "Yes. To give clarity, Sagora has a 10% ownership in the operating entity, and a 45% owner in the OpCo entity, and they\u2019re reinvesting $33.5 million into the transaction. So we\u2019ve had a strong alignment of incentives. We think this trend -- this transaction was transformative, because it fit the portfolio of RIDEA assets, which has an average age of 5% as well as 90% occupancy and has a strong growth profile. And the triple net portfolio, while it has a strong occupancy in the 90% range, it\u2019s an older portfolio, older than 15 years. So we think it was the best of both worlds to provide a great transaction for us and for Sagora.", "Tom DeRosa", "And that was Joe Weisenburger who manages the Sagora relationship.", "John Goodey", "I think -- Michael, it\u2019s John. The one thing I would say is, you\u2019ve seen us systematically segment the market of those assets that will grow with the market and those that\u2019ll grow faster than market. If it grows faster than market, generally we would love it to be in a RIDEA format of partnership. If it\u2019s going to grow with market, then a triple net lease. And you see that actually in the structuring of Sagora. We\u2019ve had to do it with one partner to stay actually within the portfolio profile. They have a different profile of assets, and we put those together in the different categories of triple net lease and RIDEA to be, I guess, mirroring the way we see the market more generally.", "Michael Carroll", "Okay, great. Just one last question. I guess a bigger question, maybe for Tom. I mean how is your conversations going with the major health systems right now? And are those organizations any closer to partnering with REITs to grow their real estate footprint?", "Tom DeRosa", "Yes, thanks for asking that. Yes, they are. And stay tuned, we may be discussing something between now and the end of the year.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes, but you know you asked if they\u2019re closer to partnering with REITs, and I just want to be very clear, they\u2019re closer to partnering with Welltower, which is very different. Building relationships here has been a very, very specific focus of ours, as you know. And the kind of progress that we have made is really very specific to what Welltower can deliver in terms of a value proposition.", "Tom DeRosa", "And I would tell you that we are likely planning an Investor Day in the first quarter of next year, and expect you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear a lot about this strategy and how it\u2019s being put into practice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from UBS.", "Nick Yulico", "Just going back to Genesis. You mentioned the $35 million rent credit. So is the way for us to think about this that, versus the current rent you receive, it looks like it\u2019s about a 25% rent cut. So what you\u2019re doing here is, you\u2019re trying to create market level rent coverage for the assets in order to sell those assets outright or in a JV?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes. I\u2019m not agreeing to your exact numbers, but that\u2019s the idea that if you have coverage below 1.3 times and the market is 1.3 times, then you have to give Genesis the rent credit. And so that going forward, whether it\u2019s a joint venture or the owner will have a sustainable rent coverage. This would only happen upon sale, right? At transaction.", "Nick Yulico", "Right. And then in the senior housing operating segment, you gave the breakdown of your same-store expenses. You talked about this a little bit, but you have this line item for all other expenses. That number is down year-to-date. It\u2019s causing, it looks like the bulk of the reason why your expenses are low. Is any of that year-to-date decline due to a lower management fee that you\u2019re paying operators?", "Shankh Mitra", "So I think I answered that question earlier. But if you look at before all other, you will see utilities is down. You\u2019ll see raw food is down. So you\u2019ll see our NIM is down. You\u2019ll see property tax is down. So I\u2019m not 100% sure where you\u2019re seeing that the -- all the expenses are coming in the all other bucket. But as I mentioned, the all other bucket, it\u2019s a catch-all, right? It has what is comp, insurance, marketing, professional fees, bad debt as well as incentive management fees. This particular quarter, we have seen a significant decrease in the workers comp area as well as professional fees, which is sort of the lawyers and the accountants and consultants, that bucket.", "Nick Yulico", "Okay. But that number is down almost 5 million year-over-year. Is there any lower management fee that you\u2019re paying operators?", "Shankh Mitra", "So I think I answered that question earlier. But if you look at before all other, you will see utilities is down. You\u2019ll see raw food is down. So you\u2019ll see our NIM is down. You\u2019ll see property tax is down. So I\u2019m not 100% sure where you\u2019re seeing that the -- all the expenses are coming in the all other bucket. But as I mentioned, the all other bucket has -- it\u2019s a catch-all, right? It has what is comp, insurance, marketing, professional fees, bad debt as well as incentive management fees. This particular quarter, we have seen a significant decrease in the workers comp area as well as professional fees, which is sort of the lawyers and the accountants and consultants, that bucket.", "Nick Yulico", "And so but the -- but, so that number -- I mean again, that number is down almost $5 million year-over-year. Is any of that -- is there any lower management fee that you\u2019re paying to operators there? I\u2019m just trying to understand if that -- because if that\u2019s the case, whether that\u2019s a onetime issue this year, does that benefit reverse next year?", "Shankh Mitra", "There\u2019s lower incentive management fees there, because of an underperformance of a particular portfolio. If that portfolio bounces back, we\u2019ll be more than happy to pay a higher incentive management fee.", "Nick Yulico", "And what\u2019s the dollar amount of the lower incentive fee?", "Shankh Mitra", "This is a -- Nick, as you can imagine, this is -- obviously, I don\u2019t want to talk about any specific operator or any specific relationship, but it is not significant relative to rest of the expenses.", "Nick Yulico", "Yes, I\u2019m not asking about any operator. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it\u2019s a onetime benefit this year to your same-store expenses. It\u2019d be helpful to know what the level is.", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, I totally understand the question. The way to think about it, it could be onetime event, if the topline from -- how the operator is performing comes back. If it doesn\u2019t come back, it will be a recurring event. We\u2019ll much rather have this specific operator perform, so that we don\u2019t have to lower that number.", "Tom DeRosa", "So in other words, if it comes out, it\u2019s a good outcome. And if it stays in, you can see that it\u2019s -- will be relatively consistent in, in there again. But we\u2019re not talking about a big number.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria", "Maybe this first question is for John Goodey. You\u2019ve commented previously about Canadian senior housing supply kind of trailing the U.S. I was just hoping you could help us frame that as a percentage of inventory. What is the supply? When do you expect that to peak? And does that make \u201818 growth maybe more challenging?", "John Goodey", "Yes. So I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is new building going on in Canada. We\u2019re responsible for some of it with our partners. This is a good thing. And what you do see, though, is a very much market-by-market segment outcome for new-build versus existing supply. Unfortunately in Canada, we do not have the equivalent of a NIC, so we don\u2019t have a very reliable -- near enough real-time basic gathering points where we can show all the trends and talk about it the way we do in our supplement for the U.S. What I can tell you is, it feels imbalanced. So when you look at the historical data of gross demand and gross new supply, it looks to be roughly imbalanced. So you end up a little bit with aligning with our strategy that the core urban market seems to be undersupplied and new builds there seems to be slow relative to demand growth, which is again where we\u2019re focusing our capacities in places like Toronto and Vancouver and others. And in the easier to build, suburban markets or country markets, you\u2019re seeing people a bit like with the U.S., building more supply. Again, we are more concentrated in the urban and suburban market, so we\u2019re a little bit less exposed, we believe, than the average of the industry. But again, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the equivalent of NIC in Canada to give you the deep data analysis that we do here in the U.S.", "Shankh Mitra", "And Juan, if you think about overall year-to-date performance, I mean U.S. and Canada is actually not that much different. On a NOI perspective, Canada is slightly better NOI, but U.S. is better in terms of revenues. So if your question is, when will supply impact Canadian numbers? I will say it is impacting, as we speak. So I don\u2019t assume there will be sort of disproportionate impact next year or the year after. There is some supply in Canada, like you have seen in everywhere else, and that\u2019s sort of flowing through our numbers.", "John Goodey", "Yes, and it is market-by-market. Calgary is quite tough right now, as an example, because of new supply. But Vancouver, Qu\u00e9bec, British Columbia, Ontario, these are mostly in pretty good shape. So it is a market-by-market. Again, it comes back to -- we strongly believe the demand -- there is great demand in the core urban markets. That\u2019s where we\u2019re concentrating our new-build activities, like we are with Chartwell in The Sumach in Regent Park in Canada, and so that\u2019s, again, going to be core to our strategy, where we deploy new capital for new builds, it\u2019ll be in these core urban markets.", "Juan Sanabria", "That\u2019s helpful. And then, I was just hoping you could speak to, again, on the seniors housing on the RIDEA side for the U.S. What you guys are seeing from a leasing perspective on the increases to in-place versus the new leases? And how we should be thinking about that? Brookdale talked about declines year-over-year on new lease rates. If you can give us a sense of how did you -- your U.S. portfolio, that difference is between new and renewals?", "Shankh Mitra", "I think as we mentioned to you last quarter as well, we actually don\u2019t see a huge difference between sort of the new lease as well as the renewals. Remember, like half of our portfolio tons of news on January 1, and rest of the portfolio sort of goes through the year as you have the anniversary. We don\u2019t see a huge difference. It depends on, obviously, market, but on average, we don\u2019t see a huge difference.", "Juan Sanabria", "The rent bumps to your existing is equal to what the increase you get on new versus the old?", "Shankh Mitra", "Relatively the same. It\u2019s a very large portfolio in different markets. Some markets, you see -- the markets that you have weakness, I mean you see the reverse, right? I mean you see weakness in the U.S. and then as well as in New England, you see that. In markets where you have strong demand, such as Southern California, you see just the opposite. But when you blend that -- all that in, in your huge portfolio of 423 properties that Tom talked about, you see relatively the same.", "John Goodey", "When you think about the math of this, the average length of stay means that residents only on average see a couple of increases in their stay. So it\u2019s not that you have a very long cycle of resident increases with in-place, and then a different rate -- a significantly different rate in the new leases because of the dynamic of the numbers -- the number of resident occupancy turnover dynamics. It\u2019s not a, as Shankh said, often the market\u2019s maybe a small fraction difference, but it\u2019s very hard to see them be dramatically different.", "Juan Sanabria", "Great. And just one last quick one for me. Vintage will be added, I think, in the same-store numbers next year. Do you see that additive to the growth of the overall pool? Or not necessarily?", "Shankh Mitra", "Vintage will be added to the pool in fourth quarter actually. And that will take -- that will not be additive to the growth, at least in the fourth quarter. Actually, it\u2019ll be 10 basis points hit to the overall growth for all the new assets we\u2019re adding to the pool, not specifically talking about Vintage. We\u2019re yet to give you -- we\u2019re yet to do the budget on next year, so I\u2019m not going to talk about \u201818, but I just wanted to give you a sense of what\u2019s going on.", "Juan Sanabria", "Can you give us a sense of where that occupancy for the portfolio is?", "Shankh Mitra", "I don\u2019t have it with me right now. I can follow it up with you.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Juan, keep in mind that the -- I think we made this remark when we first made the investment. This is about a lot of opportunity. We saw an opportunity by way of switching the operator, and we brought in three operators that we feel very good about, in particularly in the markets where we put them in. And then we also talk value added opportunities from the repositioning of the assets which require some CapEx work and so on. So what we\u2019re doing right now is actually undertaking that kind of execution and everything is working as we had planned. CapEx is on the way, and so on. There was an element of restaffing that needed to happen and things of that nature. But we always knew that this was going to be a portfolio that we saw tremendous value in but we needed to actually create that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "My question is really is around the SHO portfolio. Again, in the past 12 to 18 months, you\u2019ve really seen some very strong rent growth, not just in your portfolio but for some of your peers. Just trying to understand when you take a look at your residents -- again, many of them are well retired. A lot of them are on fixed income. How is it that you still kind of have this ability to push rent as hard as you have without really impacting occupancy that much?", "Shankh Mitra", "So Tayo, I would characterize it, of course, a little bit differently. We are seeing the impact on occupancy, right? Occupancy is down 170 basis point. So it is a question of optimizing rates versus occupancy. It is a need-driven business. As you know, that there\u2019s a huge part of our senior housing operating portfolio is the living memory care. It\u2019s a need-driven business. We\u2019re eyeing markets where we are usually the best provider of care with the highest reputation, and people are willing to pay for what they consider the best quality care for their parents or their grandparents. And does that mean that everybody is willing to pay? No. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the occupancy decline. So we\u2019re confident that, you know, the -- it\u2019s a game of optimizing rate as well as occupancy. We\u2019re trying to maximize revenue, and if we come to a point where we feel we get more traction by getting more occupancy and attractive terms rate, we\u2019ll do that. But this is a -- as we know, we run a SHO which is fundamentally driven by data analytics and numbers, and we\u2019re trying to optimize and maximize our revenue, not one part of the revenue. So we\u2019ll see what market gives us next year.", "Justin Skiver", "And Tayo, this is Justin Skiver. I\u2019d just like to add to that, that you have to remember that the average length of stay in these building is 18 to 24 months. So it\u2019s not as though these people are getting increases upon increases for 5 to 10 years. It\u2019s a set amount of time. Then new residents are turning over.", "Tom DeRosa", "Tayo, and also -- let me just add to that. A point that I started the call out with. We have 423 properties in that portfolio. You should line up other portfolios to have -- to better understand the numbers that are being reported. We have a large sample that\u2019s very consistent. And I think that is important when you want to understand what\u2019s happening in the industry.", "Tayo Okusanya", "Okay. Are you finding when you\u2019re qualifying residents to live in your facilities that their children or other dependents are having to kind of contribute more towards the payments now?", "Shankh Mitra", "I don\u2019t think that has changed. I mean when you think about -- I think you said that they live mostly on fixed income. The fact of the matter is, our communities are in extremely well, sort of, wealth locations, if you will. Obviously, they have fixed income, but they also have significant wealth in terms of asset. So we haven\u2019t really seen or heard about much changes.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Tayo, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the report that we commissioned not long ago about aging in cities. It corroborates a lot of our strategy, the reason why we focus on these urban centers is that what is attracting, engaging population at double-digit rates into this core centers. That alone, the demand and the desirability, for all the reasons that we found out in our survey, are the reasons why our pricing is more consistent. That\u2019s why people really feel like there\u2019s a value proposition that they\u2019re willing to pay for, and so we don\u2019t have that sort of slippage that maybe you hear others talking about on rate or having to lock rates for life or whatever other people might have to do.", "John Goodey", "I think, Tayo, the only thing I would say is, if you look at Page number 8 of our supplement, where we talk about quality indicators, we tried to give you -- obviously, we have a much larger demographic scorecard than this, that we run our analytics off of as we invest our capital. As you can see there, generally we\u2019re trying to go for areas where there is significantly more wealth than average for the country, and that means wealth of income, because if you do need support from the children, then the wealth is there. Or capital wealth that someone will have accumulated primarily through their primary residence, that they\u2019ll invariably be monetizing as they come into this environment of senior care. So it\u2019s again, generally, for the most part, we\u2019re sighting our capital into high wealth, high-income locations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler", "First, I just wanted to clarify, the rent abatement that Genesis will receive at close will be 25 million or 30 million? I\u2019m sorry.", "Shankh Mitra", "$35 million.", "Jordan Sadler", "35 million, okay. Plus there\u2019ll be a reduction in the existing escalators, correct?", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes. Just like you have seen in the $1.7 billion total transaction we have done, it went down from 2.9% to 2%, and we\u2019ll just replicate that structure.", "Jordan Sadler", "That\u2019s perfect. And then on transaction activity, so you\u2019ve laid out the dispositions here plus, obviously, there is some incremental potential dispositions if they\u2019re to close from Genesis. I\u2019m trying to think about, as we look forward, how we should be thinking about your leverage, which remains very low, and whether or not these dispositions will be offset by incremental investment or if we should just expect leverage to head further south?", "John Goodey", "Yes, thanks. This is John. I\u2019ll take that one. So you\u2019re right, we have very significantly strengthened our balance sheet, nearly 0.5 turn deleveraged over last year or so. Look, we continually look at our capital structure to refine that, to provide shareholder value and to remain well capitalized to take advantage of, I say in my script, of acquisitions or new developments. And you\u2019re right, I mean we will look to redeploy capital, clearly, to drive our earnings growth as we dispose off of assets and realize that capital. I think we\u2019re very comfortable in the sort of ZIP Code where we are right now, and we\u2019ll navigate around that sort of area going forward. So no significant sort of major changes, but we would say that we\u2019ll look to redeploy the majority of the funds that we do see coming in through the dispositions that we have ongoing.", "Jordan Sadler", "And is it safe to say at this point that new investments will continue to be pretty focused around seniors housing and senior housing operating, in particular? Or are there -- or you\u2019re seeing opportunities that are of greater interest in the other segments?", "Tom DeRosa", "What we\u2019re seeing opportunities in both the senior housing space as well as in the outpatient medical space. So we\u2019re -- right now, we seem to have a fairly robust pipeline of opportunities to evaluate in both sectors.", "Jordan Sadler", "And what is your appetite for the outpatient medical business in the 5% or mid-5% cap rate range?", "Tom DeRosa", "We are interested in assets if they are strategic, which means either that they are assets that are associated with health systems that are in markets that are strategic for us or there\u2019s ability for us to bring our very experienced outpatient medical management processes to these assets to create upside. So that\u2019s how we look. We\u2019re not just looking to grow that outpatient medical portfolio by acquiring low cap rate assets where there\u2019s no upside or strategic value for us. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve not seen us participate in a number of the auctions to date.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Eric Fleming with SunTrust.", "Eric Fleming", "I wanted to follow-up actually on that medical office comment you just made. So in terms of talking about your strategic markets there, is that -- you\u2019re going to -- kind of what you\u2019ve hinted at with the Johns Hopkins relationship, where -- is there -- is it more looking to add medical office into areas where you already have senior housing and post-acute facilities that you can leverage across those operating sites?", "Tom DeRosa", "That is -- you get our strategy. Our strategy is built around major metro markets where we have senior housing assets, and that is where we will likely see -- you\u2019ll likely see us try and accumulate outpatient medical assets.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.", "Michael Knott", "Is the eventual migration that was talked about earlier from triple net senior housing to RIDEA, is that going to be more of an opportunistic endeavor that will still take quite a long time? Or is there something a little bit more systemic or something that happens more quickly on that front?", "Shankh Mitra", "It is going to be opportunistic, and it will be dependent on one asset at a time. So I don\u2019t want you guys to take away from this call that we are looking to convert our triple net senior housing portfolio into RIDEA. It depends on, as we describe, at least in the Sagora transaction, we found a subpool of assets that we think have tremendous growth opportunity going forward because of the submarket they\u2019re in. And as John said, if we think that the assets will grow with the market, they\u2019re likely to be in triple net portfolio. If they are -- we\u2019ll get market-plus growth, they\u2019re likely to be in a RIDEA portfolio. But there is no effort inside our company to convert all the leases to RIDEA going forward. Asset by asset, operator by operator, market by market.", "Tom DeRosa", "When it makes sense.", "Shankh Mitra", "When it makes sense.", "Michael Knott", "Right, okay. And then last one from me. Are you willing to give any guidance on where your skilled nursing, post-acute, NOI percentage of the portfolio will land after these planned dispositions?", "Shankh Mitra", "Stay tuned. As I said, I hope that we\u2019ll have a very robust conversation about this topic soon. But as you can appreciate, Michael, it\u2019s hard to comment on live transactions.", "Michael Knott", "Sure, okay. And then, maybe that same comment will apply to this one, but do you plan or expect that there\u2019ll be further SNF dispositions later in \u201818 after this current round is finalized?", "Shankh Mitra", "So we -- as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re very focused on asset management and focused on optimizing our portfolios. A portfolio of this size will always have disposition, but we believe that if we can get to sort of the level that we are trying to get at with different asset class, different product types, different operators, we\u2019ll probably hit more of a stabilized in our portfolio soon, and from there, it\u2019s opportunistic going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call.

My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer-session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tim McHugh", "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 results and outlook for 2018. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Investments; and John Goodey, EVP, CFO.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance those projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, and from time to time in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company\u2019s website at welltower.com.", "Before handing the call over to Tom, I want to highlight a few significant points regarding our 2017 results. One, we realized full year total portfolio average same-store growth of 2.7%, at the high end of our original guidance, driven again by the consistent outperformance of our senior housing operating portfolio. Two, we continue to opportunistically take advantage of favorable capital markets through disposing of 1.5 billion of non-core assets and raising over 600 million through our DRIP and ATN programs at an average stock price just above $71 per share. And three, we have redeployed that capital in a very disciplined manner, extinguishing 1.4 billion of high coupon debt in preferred securities and recycling 1.2 billion into high quality acquisitions and developments, finishing the year with a well capitalized balance sheet and a 94.2% private pay mix.", "And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the year and the quarter.", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, Tim. In the most challenging environment we have seen for weeks in a number of years, I am pleased to report Q4 2017 financial results, our outlook for 2018 and some important strategic initiatives that all speak to our optimism about the power of the Welltower platform. We run this business to be the most effective global capital and operating partner to the broad healthcare delivery landscape including senior housing and have not been afraid to make bold decisions regarding people, capital deployment, asset mix and operator alignment to ensure our ability to drive our strategy and deliver shareholder value for years to come.", "Here are some highlights. Despite headlines of oversupply and flu, our seniors housing operating portfolio continued to deliver solid growth throughout 2017 and the outlook for 2018 remains positive. We delivered on our strategy of tying major health systems to our business platform as is evidenced by our Mission Viejo JV with Providence St. Joseph's, the third largest health system in the U.S. and Simon Properties, the world's most prominent mall owner.", "We announced 1.2 billion of gross investments for 2017 and by month end we will have closed on a 0.5 billion of accretive new investments in 2018. We negotiated a successful restructuring of Genesis Healthcare that has significantly enhanced the credit quality and sustainability of the Genesis business model. I am sure you are all waiting to hear more about that from our friend, Shankh.", "Now, Mercedes Kerr will give you an overview of new operator relationships, new relationship investments in Q4, and her view on how we expect to grow in 2018. Mercedes?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Thank you, Tom. As detailed in our earnings release, we completed $334 million of growth investments in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the form of acquisitions, development funding, and loans at a combined average yield of 6.6%. For the whole year of 2017, our investments totaled $1.2 billion and had a combined average yield of 6.9%. Consistent with prior period more than two-thirds of our investments in the fourth quarter were completed on an off-market basis and 80% of the transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 or repeat business. Our focus on off-market relationship based transactions is possible because we have purposefully assembled a roster of best-in-class partner with scalable business model.", "Our unique operator alignment features incentivize us to grow together, so our partners often help us to find off-market opportunities themselves. This was true into fourth quarter when we expanded our relationships with new perspective, Sagora Senior Living, Florida Medical Clinic and Ascension. As well as our recently announced acquisitions with Sunrise Senior Living where we are buying four rental CCRC communities for $368 million at an above market yield of 7%. These project returns are especially noteworthy given the highly desirable markets where these properties are located such as Washington DC and Miami. I should add a note of congratulations to Chris Winkle and the rest of the team at Sunrise Senior Living which was recently ranked the highest in customer satisfaction among Senior Living communities in J.D. Power's first ever Senior Living satisfaction survey. It's great to see them recognized for their hard work.", "Every year we selectively identify new operators and healthcare providers to bring into our fold. In the fourth quarter, we were proud to introduce Summit Medical Group to our portfolio. This is the oldest and largest physician-owned multispecialty medical practice in New Jersey. We also announced a new collaboration with Mission Hospital, part of the Providence St. Joseph health system, a formidable and progressive healthcare provider. Our project together at The Shops at Mission Viejo speaks to the evolution of delivery of care model and how Welltower and premier health systems can partner to bring state-of-the-art infrastructure solutions to the market.", "Since the start of 2018, we also expanded our relationship with Cogir Management Corporation by bringing them into our partnership pool. We are extremely pleased to have created a joint venture vehicle with this important next generation Canadian operator and look forward to working with Mathieu Duguay and his team in this new construct. I want to take a moment to speak about the flu, which can impact senior housing revenues and expenses through a voluntary and mandatory additions spend, higher than average move outs due to illness or death and also with higher cost anytime that caregivers are temporarily replaced by agency labor when they are sick.", "We monitor these trends closely and we know of individual cases where flu has impacted our communities. This year's flu season has been the subject of headlines due to its severity and wide spread nature and its mostly in report, the CDC is calculating a 130% increase thus far this season in outpatient visits related to influenza-related illnesses for individual 65 and over in the United States when compared to last year, and a 92% increase when compared to the difficult 2014, 2015 period. The season is not over, so it's hard for us quantify the precise impact of the flu at this time.", "Having said this, we\u2019re satisfied with the work our operating partners are doing to care for their residents and staff and also to minimize the financial impact the flu may have on our communities. Finally a quick comment about Brookdale Senior Living's announcement this morning, we hope that their decision to end their strategic review process which has been the focus of much of management attention for a protracted period, will now allow them to get back to the basics. That we\u2019ve said before, we're satisfied with our portfolio holdings with Brookdale and we will continue to collaborate with them going forward just as we have before.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Shankh Mitra.", "Shankh Mitra", "Thank you, Mercedes, good morning everyone. I will review our quarterly operating results reflect on our full year 2017 operating performance relative to our initial expectations and provide you with our preliminary assessment of 2018 operating environment with a specific focus on our SHO portfolio. Our same-store portfolio grew 2.1% in fourth quarter bringing the total average same-store NOI growth to 2.7% for 2017 towards the high end of our initial expectation of 2% to 3%.", "Our senior housing operating portfolio grew 1.5% in fourth quarter, which was below our expectation for the quarter. Late quarter occupancy declined due to flu, contributed to this performance. This has tempered our outlook for 2018, despite that we believe will have a year of positive same-store NOI growth in that business representing a significant relative outperformance due our best-in-class assets and affluent markets run by premier operators.", "Specifically our 2018 outlook for SHO portfolio is flat to 1.5%. As you know actual results will be driven by a combination of rate growth, occupancy and expense growth. Low 3% rate growth, 50 to 100 basis points of occupancy decline and a 3% to 4% expense growth built to our same-store NOI growth expectation. We set our initial expectation of 1.5% to 3% growth in SHO portfolio for 2017 and achieved 2.5%, however, this was done through a different combination of rate, occupancy and expense good then we thought. Rates were better, occupancy was lower so were expenses.", "In addition to our operator focus relationship strategy, our heavy investment in data and analytics capabilities are starting to bare fruit. We\u2019ve outperformed in the up cycle and was continued to outperform in the more mature part of the cycle. We\u2019re confident that this superior relative and absolute performance over the entire cycle every year on a consistent basis was ultimately a result in significant differentiation in cost of capital at some point in time. Another important update for the quarter is regarding Genesis, as we started this journey our focus was to maximize shareholder value on our total capital committed to Genesis.", "Since we last spoke to you in November, we are continued to be encouraged by the relative stabilization of cash flow in our retained portfolio. Additionally important changes have taken place in this relationship. As Genesis announced last night, they have come to a restructuring agreement in which all of the credit parties have come together to recap Genesis' balance sheet and put the Company in a position of strength. A key element of this structure is an injection of $555 million of fresh capital into the Company by Midcap Financial Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global Management, a strong vote of confidence in Genesis and the industry.", "This recapitalization is a critical step in Genesis' previously announced broader effort, which is expected to result in 80 million to 100 million of annual fixed charge improvement through the combined effort of the multiple credit parties. Our main contribution to this restructuring is a reduction of $35 million of annual cash rent as I mentioned in the last call. However, we also negotiated a five year lease extension and an option to reset the rent to after five years to recoup that $35 million. Genesis also committed to payback $105 million of loans by April 1st.", "So, so far we have sold $1.9 billion of Genesis loans and real estate with a realized IRR of 10.3% and with today's restructuring Genesis is now 5.2% of in place NOI with a pro forma trailing 1.34 times of EBITDAR and 1.7 times EBITDARM coverage at the profit levels, with the corporate guarantees that is significantly stronger. As with any asset in our portfolio we retain the complete optionality with this high quality PowerBack heavy portfolio in the future. Since the $400 million Genesis purchase option expires in March of last year, we have been communicating multiple possible path of action while negotiating with the public tenant that has been in clear need of a recap for last two years.", "We have aim to keep our investor attuned to all possible outcomes while maintaining a public negotiation posture that ensure our optionality in order to maximize our shareholder value. We feel strongly that our approach with Genesis has substantially enhanced our flexibility and providing the highest value outcome for our shareholders while minimizing reliance on any one operator. Today we have a maturely strengthened corporate credit standing behind a well covered lease which is in the stark contrast of what you're seeing in the industry.", "A recapitalized Genesis refocus on its core market is forced to win market share, more broadly in context of shrinking supply and a pending demographic surge, demand for skilled nursing bids is projected to surplus inventory by 2025. While the $35 million income loss is not ideal though necessary in the short term, we will participate in this positive trend through our rent reset provision occurring in year five of the restructured master lease.", "We'd like to thank you our shareholders for supporting us in this transformation journey, as dispassionate capital allocators we change when facts change. It is important to summarize that we're noticing the following changes. Operating performance is stabilizing in our retained Genesis portfolio. Two, a material credit improvement as a result of Genesis recap has happened. Three, we feel a tectonic shift in the sentiment of smart investors towards us for secured space, all publically announced deals you have noticed the Humana, Welsh, Carson, TPG in case of Kindred and now MidCap forward in case of Genesis. We believe you'll see more. Number four, we preserve full optionality going forward.", "With that, I'll pass it over to John Goodey.", "John Goodey", "Thank you, Shankh, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 and our guidance for 2018. Despite the challenging U.S. senior housing market conditions you have heard about from others, our portfolio delivered solid financial results for Q4 and in 2017 overall and we are positive on the prospects for 2018. Once again our superior portfolio, excellent operator relationships as well as the strength of the Welltower platform to allocate capital and asset manage have enabled us to outperform our peers. In addition, it is noteworthy that our 2017 financial results are being delivered in a year where we've also continued to refine our portfolio and lower our financial leverage.", "In 2017, we generated $1.5 billion of dispositions with a gain of $344 million realized and a realized IRR of 11.3% and further improved our balance sheet to be one of the lowest leverage in the REIT industry. These actions placed us in a strong financial position to pursue our strategic plan in 2018 and beyond. As detailed by Shankh, our show portfolio grew by 1.5% in Q4 2017, with seniors housing triple net and long term post acute both growing at 2.8% and outpatient medical growing at 2.0%. Overall same-store NOI growth was 2.1% in the quarter and averaged 2.7% for 2017 overall. This quarter's growth was augmented within quarter acquisitions and joint ventures of $223 million along with a $142 million of divestments and loan payoffs. They've enabled us to report a normalized Q4 2017 FFO result of a $1.02 per share.", "Overall, we delivered $4.21 of normalized FFO per share for 2017 in total. In addition to this quarter's joint ventures and acquisitions, we've completed $42 million of developments bringing full year deliveries across all operating segments to $548 million at a stabilized yield of approximately 7.3%. We're truly excited by the future earnings growth potential of these new state-of-the-art buildings. In Q4, we normalized a number of items including allowance for $63 million relating to a Genesis loan restructuring. We also normalized $58 million of non-controlling interest in unconsolidated equity impairment, the majority relating to write down to certain non-consolidated JV investments.", "In addition, we also normalized $60 million of other expenses and transaction cost, $41 million of which related to the donation of our Toledo headquarters and $18 million of which is a mark-to-market impairment against our Genesis public shareholding. Additionally, we normalized $17 million related to a deferred tax and valuation allowances including the impact of a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Welltower continues to focus on our own corporate operational efficiency by further optimizing systems, processes, human capital and physical infrastructure.", "Our G&A for the quarter was $28.4 million a 13.5% reduction over Q4 2016. For 2017 overall, we reduced our G&A by nearly 21% compared to the year prior. We continue to implement further initiatives to improve our operations and efficiency in 2018. Our balance sheet remains in great shape and leads our peer group. We will continue to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. During the fourth quarter, we extinguished the $137 million of secured debt bringing our full year retirement of debt and preferred securities to $1.4 billion at a blended average rate of 5.4%.", "We ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $244 million and a $2.3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our line of credit. Our leverage metrics remain at or near historically low levels with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4 times with a net debt to un-depreciated book capitalization ratio of 36.3%, and our adjusted fix charge cover ratio remains strong at 3.4 times. Based on announced 2018 acquisitions and planned dispositions for the year, we see year end 2018 leverage being in the low five times net debt to EBITDA area.", "Our debt maturity profile remains well controlled and we will opportunistically access bond markets in 2018 to further manage our profile. As we previously noted to you, our deep liquidity position affords us significant flexibility to pursue value enhancing acquisitions, development opportunities and to reinvesting in our portfolio to drive growth. I will conclude my remarks with our outlook for 2018. As noted in our earnings release, we have adjusted our overall same-store NOI and long-term post-acute growth outlooks for the impact of the $35 million Genesis Master Lease restructuring.", "Starting with same-store NOI, we expect average blended same-store NOI growth of approximately 1% to 2% in 2018, which is comprised of the following components. Senior housing operating approximately 0% to 1.5%, senior housing triple net approximately 2.5% to 3%, long term post-acute care approximately to 2% and 2.5% and outpatient medical approximately to 2% to 2.5%. We anticipate funding developments of approximately $297 million in 2018 relating to project underway as of December 31, 2017. And we expect development conversions during 2018 of approximately $413 million, which are currently expected to generate stabilized yields of approximately 8%.", "We\u2019ve incorporated approximately $1.3 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.2% in our 2018 guidance. This includes approximately $553 million of proceeds from dispositions previously expected to close in 2017 and $741 million of incremental proceeds from other potential loan payoffs and property sales. We also replaced the 2017 Genesis disposition placeholder of $400 million in proceeds with $225 million of expected dispositions and loan paying downs this year. This comprises of $120 million of non-core property sales, representing approximately 10% of our portfolio, which are in advanced negotiations stages and $105 million of expected loans payoffs tied to the Genesis restructuring recently announced.", "Moving to G&A expenses, we anticipate 2018 general, administrative expenses of approximately $130 million in 2018. This level remains significantly below our G&A spend for 2015 and 2016. Based on the above, the aforementioned Genesis restructuring and other items discussed, we anticipate 2018 normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, with normalized net income in a range of $2.38 to $2.48 per diluted share. As usual, earnings guidance excludes any additional acquisitions beyond those which have been announced, but does include our planned dispositions.", "I am pleased to announce the Board of Directors approved the 2018 quarterly cash dividend at the maintained rate of $0.87 per share being $3.48 per share annually. As such on February 21, 2018 Welltower paid its 187th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, the current annual dividend represents the yield of approximately 6.4%. Based on our overall outlook for 2018, strong liquidity position and our high quality portfolio poised for growth through operational gains, accretive acquisitions and development pipeline delivery, we remain comfortable with our dividend at this level.", "With that, I'll hand back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom?", "Tom DeRosa", "Thanks, John. When I became Chief Executive Officer, almost four years ago, it was the tailwind of a rapid asset accumulation period. I knew that was not sustainable nor was asset accumulation a viable long-term business strategy. Since then, we've taken advantage of strong asset pricing, and by year-end 2018, we will have sold nearly $5 billion in real estate at an IRR of 10.5%. While radically improving the overall asset quality, we also massively de-levered the balance sheet.", "You now know about the plans for Genesis. Three years ago we made the strategic decision not to abandon the post-acute sector. This is a critical component of the healthcare delivery continuum and we see a role for Welltower in reinventing how this sector operates and is capitalized. From here Genesis has a stronger capital structure and a refocused business strategy on its core markets, to effectively participate in value-based care.", "It feels like we're coming to the end of our asset optimization journey, and I believe both sides of the balance sheet are now positioned for growth. I want to thank the shareholders who have stood by us through this process. We benefit from a business construct based on an operating platform that is focused on delivering real estate settings that promote wellness and provide healthcare at lower costs than acute-care hospitals. This platform is built upon our unique alignment with the leading senior housing companies operating in major urban markets in the U.S., Canada and the UK and health systems like Providence St. Joseph's.", "I am also now proud to say that I work with the smartest, hardest working, most diverse and highest integrity team in this business. This team is now completely aligned around the objective of driving long-term shareholder value. On February 28th, we shared our old stock symbol for one that speaks to the strategy, W-E-L-L, now WELL will bring wellness to the attention of the global financial markets as well as Welltower. Now, Nicole, open up the line for questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Shankh or maybe Tom, just sort of stepping back on your last call, you talk about sort of providing a rent cut and simultaneously doing an asset sale, the size obviously was not known, but at least I took it as being a fairly large chunk of the portfolio. You sort of walked through some of the components of maybe what's changed, but maybe if you can elaborate what has changed between then and now, and more specifically on the outlook given, what you're seeing right now, should we expect potentially more dilution from any further asset sales on Genesis?", "Shankh Mitra", "So, Vikram, I'll tell you the few things have changed, right. If you think about Genesis management has done an extraordinary job of bringing all its credit parties together, just not real estate owners, but all the credit parties together to get to a point of a sustainable capital structure, that's extremely important which we thought basically they're making progress. But they have really surprised us on the positive side for bringing $550 million -- $5 million of fresh capital into the business. So, that's something financially puts the Company in a position of strength going forward. But more importantly for our retained portfolio as you can see our portfolio now is obviously is a much smaller portfolio that is much more focused, it\u2019s PowerBack heavy and we see for us a long time as I mentioned and stabilization of cash flow in that portfolio.", "So that's one of the other things have changed. So operating performance has changed, credit quality has changed. Now as you can imagine that as capital allocators we look at every asset in our portfolio on sale, right. So, we're looking at this asset quality that we owned, we know the coverage we know what the operating -- really the operating outlook for those buildings and we're thinking at these prices is a buy, is it a hold, is it a sell. And I don't know the answer to that question like every asset that Genesis assets are also for sale at the right price. We retain complete flexibility and are slightly going forward. I'm not going to tell you that we'll not sell further I'm not also going to tell you so those assets will not be sold. So that sort of the messaging is we change when information change when facts change. And Genesis today is drastically a different operator that it was 90 days ago.", "Tom DeRosa", "And Vik, let me add to that that we always look to enhance optionality in terms of how we manage this business and the strongest statement I can make to you is because Genesis is a dramatically stronger credit based on this restructuring going forward it means that Welltower is a stronger credit going forward.", "Vikram Malhotra", "Got it and just to clarify that I think you alluded to the fact that you're now in a position to sort of grow cash flow, grow earnings. Would it be safe to say that assuming there are not too many changes from here on and you keep things intact? Would you be in a position actually grow cash flow AFFO and see very little dilution, if any from Genesis?", "Tom DeRosa", "We hope so Vik, that\u2019s how we run the business.", "Shankh Mitra", "Vik, as Tom said, like we like we\u2019re at the towards the end of that journey, whether we\u2019re in the seventh inning or eight inning, I can't tell you that, but definitely as everybody else seems to starting that journey which feel like we\u2019re at the very end of that journey. We always looked to asset manage our portfolio. There will always be something for sell, but we feel confident with our balance sheet and with hopefully where we're in the cycle that we will be able to deploy capital as you've heard from Mercedes and Tom.", "Tom DeRosa", "So, I\u2019ll emphasize the fact that we made a number of tough decisions when the wind was at our back. We\u2019ve never felt the wind less at our back then we do right now. And I'm very glad and you should be glad, we did take those tough decisions when we did them because this is not the time to be starting that. So I want to emphasize, we do believe we're kind towards the tail end of this journey, and we're -- that is what speaks to the optimism that you've heard from everyone here on this call today about the future. We\u2019re very optimistic about the role that Welltower will play in fixing healthcare delivery. And if you red line certain sectors of the healthcare space or at least the non-hospital healthcare space, you reduced your ability to participate in this change which we believe will drive significant shareholders value in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JP Morgan.", "Michael Mueller", "Couple of questions, so on the same-store NOI growth, if you would go in and I guess not adjusted for the 35 million ramp reduction. What\u2019s the post-acute same-store number and the overall same-store growth?", "Tom DeRosa", "So that was the question, if we've adjusted -- not adjusted, if we just as per the January 1 rent cut rate, I think it's at the midpoint it's minus a 12.25%.", "Shankh Mitra", "And for the total portfolio Mike it's positive 0.5% to negative 0.5% midpoint of flat year-over-year.", "Michael Mueller", "And then, you talked about the pro forma Genesis coverages. What where the coverages beforehand? So how much improvement is there with all the transaction that had been announced?", "Shankh Mitra", "If you look at our coverage, we will give you a range. And if you look at the range and the sub, which you will see that it was close to one. And it's very important question Mike, because if you think about the history of rent cut in this sort of rent free profile in this sector, you will see that majority of the times, the landlords have taken the tenant back to sort of one coverage, did not give them flexibility investment in the business, did not give them flexibility to actually grow their business. And that's why they went back to where they started, right. So we absolutely did not want to do that. As Tom said, we\u2019re never afraid to take bold decision. This was needed and it happened. So, we feel like going forward that you can feel a very significant assurance that we have taken where we didn't kick the can down the road.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Jordan Sadler", "So, today's news doesn't sound exactly like you're recommitting to the skilled nursing business or to Genesis per se, but it does sound at the margin that you are willing to hold today rather than be a seller at an excessive discount. I am wondering; one, if it's a fair characterization; and then two, would you be willing to invest in incrementally in Genesis beyond the incremental term loan piece you are lending?", "Shankh Mitra", "Jordan, if you think about a triple net lease is a credit, right. So, with our credit significantly improved at the property level from a coverage perspective, as I also said the most important thing is the, EBITDARM coverage of above 1.7, and remember, management fee subordinate to the rent payment, right, and it is guaranteed by the corporate. So at every level you look at it, the three levels of stratification is materially improved.", "So, I want to reemphasize that point, and I also want to reemphasize the point the rent reset that I talked about. So, if you look at the demographics and negative supply, if you believe in the demographics and you believe that nothing is going to change from a utilization perspective, there's going to be crisscross of demand and supply, not too -- in a not too distant future. And we'll be able to recoup that $35 million of rent as I said.", "Will we invest in Genesis going forward? We are, already are. If you look at, we have a PowerBack development, that's in progress and we believe in that model, so if there're other opportunities to invest in that PowerBack hub and spoke model that Genesis drives its business from, we'd be happy to do that, that's no change from what we have done.", "Tom DeRosa", "Jordan, you've heard me say consistently that we are not going to abandon this sector. Why do I say that because when you interact with the leaders of healthcare in this country, which are the CEOs that run the major regional health systems, they all say, they need a viable post-acute care option. The problems that the REIT sector has been dealing with were capital structures that were not sustainable given some of the changes that occurred in reimbursement.", "And as Shankh said and I say a lot, you can continue to kick the can down the road, until you just keep kicking the can at the wall and it keeps coming back at you. What we've announced last night and what we've -- are talking to about this morning is a fix that needed to happen years ago, but the industry kicked the can down the road. We have fixed the Genesis' capital structure, not just Welltower, it was every one of their capital partners, and we brought in a new capital partner.", "I think that says something about the future of Genesis, so we are in the business of maintaining and enhancing optionality. Optionality for where we deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders. And so, nothing has changed, you've heard me say this, consistently, and I took a lot of stones and arrows for saying it. But I think our strategy will prove out to have been in the best interest of our shareholders.", "Jordan Sadler", "Yes, no that's consistent I think with the messaging you've relayed over time. So my follow-up is really on Genesis again, I don't know if this is for John, but specifically as it relates to guidance. What is the total loan forgiveness that you either recognized in 4Q and that you expect to recognize in '18 of the $400 million plus or so that you've got to Genesis, you had to Genesis? And then what's the embedded total interest income that's in the $4 FFO guide?", "Shankh Mitra", "Jordan, I'll answer the first part of the question, the answer is zero. We have not forgiven loans. We have reserved against those loans. So there is a significant difference in that and that you know and two hidden in your question is, something that I saw a lot of confusion about, if you go back and look at our financials for the last two quarters and see what we said our entire Genesis loan book was in payment in kind, we gave them as they were doing the whole restructuring for last few months. We did not go through a part cash, part payment today. We went from a complete pick to a part cash tactic payment today. And with that, I will pass it over to John.", "John Goodey", "And so I think on the penny front, Tim's got the answer for you on the actual pennies recognized in FFO from Genesis loan.", "Tim McHugh", "So part of that answer is and this is important to know this on a few notes this morning, we are just recognizing cash interest on Genesis in 2018. So in our FFO guidance, this morning is just the cash and as noted in both Genesis' release and that's prior to this, there was no -- these loans picked from 11/15 to the November 15th of last year through February 15th of this year. So if you look at the full year of 2018 important to note from January 1st to February 15th it was all pick and we did not recognize that through FFO. That's roughly a penny on a cash basis income that if you went full year for recognition we would have recognized and then for the rest of the year the pick component represents about five pennies that we have not recognizing through FFO. What we are recognizing is about $20 million of interest income in our 2018 numbers.", "Jordan Sadler", "Okay so on the forgiveness piece, did -- I guess I'm confused because I'm reading the piece about the bridge loans, the 275, they have you want them to repay no less Genesis can do to make progress they've to pay no less than a $105 million of obligations. What happens to the 170?", "Tim McHugh", "As part of the announced restructuring for both Genesis and ourselves this morning is a commitment based upon contingency of having a financing partner step up in that $105 million of refinancing. The remaining piece is assumed to be outstanding for the rest of 2018. That 170 will be current cash paying, it is current cash paying right now because after February 15th, it went back to cash paying. And the assumption in our model is that $105 million is paid back around midyear and the remaining piece of that real estate loan and the term loan remain outstanding for all 2018 and are cash paying.", "John Goodey", "I don't think I'll just reiterate, Jordan, what Shankh said. We have not forgiven them loans we have taken a reserve again because some of this is collateralized that we have to test the collaterals that's underneath the orders as you can imagine make us do that. And that was the reserve that we have to take relates to the collateral, not to a write down of the loan, but Genesis will therefore be forgiven. So, there is big difference to Shankh that we've not forgiven the 60 million write down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One Securities.", "Daniel Bernstein", "I just want to make sure I understand the 5.2% exposure to Genesis, is that including further loan pay downs or just where it is today?", "Tim McHugh", "The 5.2% is, so the way that we calculate our employees NOI is off of just our property NOI, so if you think about as of the end of the fourth quarter, what's currently in our supplement, pre rent cut is a 7% exposure to Genesis. The 5.2% is pro forma for the rent cut. So it's just\u2026", "Shankh Mitra", "As well as the asset itself.", "Tim McHugh", "Yes as well as the health for sales assets as 12/31 that 5.2% is essentially as our pro forma NOI exposure to Genesis after rent cut and asset sales.", "Daniel Bernstein", "You see if the change in view in Genesis so much the improvement of credit, but also the improvements at the property level, I think you mentioned that a little bit in your comment. So just want to understand a little bit of better. What's changing at the property level or operational level or Genesis, that makes you a lot more confident in the company there in your assets?", "Shankh Mitra", "If you look at again I want to emphasize the fact in our retained portfolio. There is a portfolio that and obviously we're selling now that is transitioning out of Genesis an operator, Genesis has sold and in process of selling lot of none core space. It is important to understand they are refocusing on the core markets, core markets where Genesis always has done very well. In our retained portfolio, which is as I said is very power back heavy we\u2019re seeing cash flow stabilization after long-term and we believe that if you think about how this plays out that we will be able to grow cash flow in the future.", "So that\u2019s one of the points and credit is obviously very self explanatory if you can look at the coverage and you look at the EBITDA coverage and EBITDA coverage, that significantly improve above market coverage and the corporate guarantee is extremely important here, which is today with the Genesis -- if we look at the Genesis debt to EBITDA got almost that in half, that definitely an improvement in the credit. So that\u2019s where why feel optimistic again that sound say we can all of our optionality as in any part of our portfolio.", "Daniel Bernstein", "And just real quickly on the demographics, I mean that you talked about in skilled nursing, it sounds like you would apply to seniors housing. Last quarter, you talked about may be looking for opportunities to move some more triple net, leases perhaps RIDEA is that still something you\u2019re thinking about working on?", "Mercedes Kerr", "This is Mercedes. Hi, we look at that obviously just selectively with our operators, I mean there is a lot of things that we might take into consideration as you know, we like to invest in RIDEA when we think that there is a lot more opportunity for upside then downside risk. And so yes, from time to time there might be portfolios that we're seasoning and the triple net structure that might actually become candidate for a conversion to a partnership and we don\u2019t have anything to talk about right now but that something that we obviously look at all the time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.", "Tayo Okusanya", "My first question is around your same-store NOI outlook for the Shop portfolio. You guys do have an outlook that is positive, your peers have outlook that are generally negative. I am just curious, if we just talk a little bit about why your outlook is much more bullish than theirs?", "Shankh Mitra", "So, Tayo, I mean it's a very good question. I would like you to look at our performance relative to or peers, every year for last seven plus years that we've been in the RIDEA business. That will give you the answer, but it is really -- it speaks to the quality of the portfolio and the operators and micro markets. So, you know, we have invested -- so if you think about how this industry has evolved, if you are mostly triple net investors, right, I mean you are investing in credit, investing in RIDEA invested in real estate equity that requires a different type of skill set.", "And we're the ones who have invested in technology, in people, in data analytics and asset management. So, you've seen the impact of that pretty much every year probably every quarter and that outperformance should not be surprising, but we're obviously as I said that if you look at over a period of time we hope that will give a better cost of capital, that hasn't happened yet but hopefully people will accept that we have a much better quality portfolio.", "Mercedes Kerr", "And I do have to add that it also has a lot to do with the operators that we have partnered with, so it's a combination of great locations, a high barrier to entry markets, asset quality, but it's also of course having to do with the operators that are in the trenches and that are also willing to collaborate with us and the initiatives that we are trying to source for their benefit and for the benefit of the residents who live with them.", "Tom DeRosa", "A lot of it comes from not being a passive owner of senior housing real estate. We see ourselves truly as an operating partner, and that drives better results.", "Tayo Okusanya", "And then just to confirm with Genesis it's as a result of the recapitalization plan that these zones are now casting rather than the status that we're at back in November, correct?", "Tom DeRosa", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities.", "Rich Anderson", "If I could step back to November, December timeframe, could you describe what was going on there? Did you kind of have some sort of clairvoyant moment where heck, we better keep the Genesis assets and that's what rolled up to where we are today? Or did you -- was it, you kind of backed into the situation where you weren't getting the pricing you wanted, you weren't feeling like the rent cut in asset sales were going to protect your dead investments, and so the market worked against you and now you're kind of like woo, I'm glad we didn't sell at that time because of all everything you're saying on this call. I am curious the chain of events that got you to this point, was it luck or skill?", "Shankh Mitra", "Probably a combination of both; if you look at what happened is it we always said that you know you think about what we're doing, right, effectively Genesis management as I said pulled off an out of code restructuring with all its credit parties that you never know that will actually be able to get to the finish point, right, finish line. Second, we absolutely did not think they'll be able to get fresh capital of the size that they did from the entity that they did. So there's one point you know, you are always interested, Rich, as an observer as a long term observer of the industry, how the tea leaves are changing. I would like you to see what happens in that time frame with Kindred and Humana, Welsh, Carson.", "You can see today what happened with you know obviously fresh injection of capital, I can talk about a lot of other things because they're non public in nature but things that are happening in the industry, so going back to way specifically to your question do we have the ability to do a transaction, absolutely. Did you get the price that we wanted, absolutely? Is that counter party still around for us to do a deal? The answer is absolutely. So the question is today as we are thinking about it at 134 coverage with a company that has leverage has been cut in half right, from the 7 to 3 is this group of assets we have culled a part of the portfolio you heard from John right, the 10% of the portfolio. At that price is this a buy sell or hold.", "That's what we think about for every asset class. I share the enthusiasm of the market participants have about 4.5 cap asset classes that grows 2% but think about at the end of the day we are here as a capital allocator to make money, despite all the noise around Genesis our unlevered IRR is double digits. The math that I just mentioned which you know in low 4% mid 4% cap rate going in with a 2% growth with a 12% or 15% you know CapEx you will never even get to 7. We're here to make money for our shareholders and every time we are making a decision on group of assets to see is it a buy, hold or sell. That's what we did.", "Rich Anderson", "Okay, follow up question is you know essentially what are shareholders paying for you know this Genesis lifeline and I'm not saying that tongue in cheek, clearly the fortunes of your tenants accrued to the REIT. So it is what it is. You did what you had to do but going forward you know you kind of get into this risky thing where we don't want Genesis, we do want Genesis, we don't want Genesis sort of if you ultimately were to sell more you know it kind of changes the narrative. So is there some risk that you kind of put yourself into a corner and almost have to commit going forward? Or you don't feel that way?", "Shankh Mitra", "That is precisely what we did what we did. Tom said every call that were not getting out of the post-acute business right, triple net lease is a credit commitment right, we're happy to make that commitment if we get the right price investing in real estate is all about basis. So if we get the right price we'll sell, if we don't get the right price we think this is something that our shareholders can enjoy the cash flow growth we'll do it. But we absolutely believe it is de-risked not only from the position of coverage but all the escalators are downright from 2.9% to 2%, that should be appropriate for the business in the footprint that they are. So you know we have never flip-flopped should we sell Genesis, not sell Genesis. We're looking at all of our assets and thinking is it a buy, sell or hold at the price that the market is willing to bear.", "Tom DeRosa", "We actively manage our business and like any business things change and we have to be able to be flexible to do what's in the best interest of the business which is ultimately in the best interest of the shareholder. The public markets were screaming at us to have taken a different approach with Genesis. I think we took the right approach. You may want to debate that with us and we're happy to debate that, but I think we took that we did the responsible thing for Genesis and for our shareholders. And I think that will prove out versus other roads we could have gone down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Carroll", "Tom, I wanted to dive a little bit on your comments on the prosecute phase. What is your outlook on the reimbursement changes? Where do you believe we're in this transition and are the major shift from the prosecutor space, now behind us?", "Tom DeRosa", "I think it's very difficult to predict what will happen in Washington, the only thing I can say is that you've seen the current administration look for ways to take some pressure off, suppose to space with respect to litigation. So, I think that we take some comfort in the fact that there is a recognition that we have to drive individuals into lower cost settings. If the government continued to try and put the skilled nursing business because of their reimbursement programs, then we would have a much bigger problem in this country because people would be stuck in very expensive hospital beds.", "I think there is a changing view in Washington and we hope that a rational thinking will prevail here. We need to drive people into lower cost settings. The health care industry, the hospitals are still trying to deliver valued based healthcare and fee for service build real estate that doesn\u2019t work. We're will our economy will ham bridge, if we continue to think we have to keep hospital beds sold, we need to drive people to lower cost settings and so that is why we have never abandon this skilled nursing sector and it will be bumpy but we think now with the restructuring of Genesis, we have the right coverage and credit profile to would stand potential choppiness.", "Shankh Mitra", "And so Mike that\u2019s the most important point, there has been a lot of restructuring change, I mean lot of your reimbursement changes, other than RUGS-IV, none of them had been huge, they have been small, that 500 cut for sure, but why that has been amplified on a industry something that you know I would encourage all of you to think about, because of the massive leverage in the system, right.", "If you think about what happen 10 years ago, people got really excited about ill chase and massively levered all these entities. And what we have seen this cycle is unwind of that. Has there been -- would have been choppiness even if you let equity finance all these deals, absolute -- probably would be, but this operators would be a in a much stronger positions. And that\u2019s the key is post-acute industry like any other industry, but post-acute industry is a very interesting point in its lifecycle where they needs to be remained and recapitalized in a different way.", "Michael Carroll", "And I just want to clarify, your guy's stance on the post-acute care space. When you say you're committed to it, does that mean you just fund to kind maintain your exposure to Genesis and maybe for good deal pops around, you could grow with them? Are you underwriting new deals or you're looking for new investments outside of Genesis? Or do you just happy with your Genesis exposure right now?", "Shankh Mitra", "We look to capital like, deploy capital, to good quality real estate in the right markets with good operators, in sustainable structures. So if all those pieces line up, and it's an interesting new post-acute operator for us, we will consider that, we would consider that if we think it's in the long term best interest of our business and the long term best interest of our shareholders. But no, we will not red line the space, because of some confusion about what's happening in the industry that was largely due to bad capital structures. Certain people made a lot of money, when these post-acute care companies found their ways into the hands of REITs, and REITs until RUGS-IV had well covered real estate, the world changed. And what you've seen us do is fix what was the problem that we've been dealing with for years. We think we've largely addressed that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.", "John Kim", "Turning to Page 11 on your SHO statistics, it looks like CapEx increased this quarter to 24% of NOI versus 22% in the third quarter. And I'm wondering A, why that occurred? And B, what is in the other CapEx, is that renovations or is that redevelopment CapEx?", "John Goodey", "So, the answer is quarter-by-quarter it does vary, we tend to historically understand our budget in the first couple of quarters, an overspent relative to the pro forma in the second quarter, that comes out roughly where we think. And so I think we do see some reinvestment in portfolios I think we've said on a number of calls, part of having a great balance sheet as we can, drive growth out of existing buildings through CapEx.", "So as Shankh was saying, how do we look at capital, we look at the existing buildings on the buy wholesale mentality, for investing more capital, the capital doesn't come for free as you're well aware, so I think we do address capital requests in that way, and now the capital just -- it is added as other CapEx in those buildings in terms of our -- as I described, our I guess our significant reinvestment capital, as I described it I think.", "Shankh Mitra", "Yes, and plus all the Vintage CapEx spent in the fourth quarter.", "John Goodey", "CapEx is above all, so we expect more normalized run rate sort of back towards normal, next year we don't have a substantially different view of CapEx need, this coming year than last year. Because there are number of projects we wanted to drive growth, but I'd say it again, we do that on a sort of ROI based model.", "John Kim", "So, redevelopment CapEx is a separate bucket, this is more kind of renovation type work?", "John Goodey", "No, both.", "John Kim", "You guys referenced Brookdale, the major announcement this morning. Can you just update us on your relationship with them going forward? Do you plan to reduce your exposure and sell assets or maintain it and also the rent coverage because I think last quarter you were mentioning that's 1.15 times just wondering given the outlook?", "Mercedes Kerr", "Yes, our portfolio is very steady, so like I said in my comments earlier, we are satisfied as that we're holding. We are always in conversations together. We have a lot of business together, so we feel very close to one another, so I expect that to continue. Other than that I guess I could just -- there isn't any -- anything that is glaring right now. We -- as you know always have options with respect to our portfolio, I mean that\u2019s one of the real strengths of Welltower that we have such a diverse and geographically as well as in terms of different kinds of platforms you know operator based. And so we always have a lot of alternative, we feel always like we have a sort of a maybe a headstart in that perspective from that perspective compared to others so nothing here to report right now.", "John Kim with", "And when does your lease expire with them?", "Mercedes Kerr", "We have a couple of leases, few leases, three of them actually that are expiring later this year. We're not in a notice period with them yet, we again have had conversations with them about extending them. We have once again opportunities to put some properties with other operators and considering that the properties are you know -- these are covering of assets. We don't feel like there's any sort of friction that would come of it, if we had to move them to somebody else.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.", "Juan Sanabria", "First question Vintage, what was the contribution to same-store NOI in the fourth quarter? What's the impact for 2018 guidance?", "Shankh Mitra", "The answer to your first question is negative 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, I don't have the '18 guidance with me but I'll give that that to you later, I'll give you a call. The Vintage was a drag for fourth quarter because as I said -- and John said, that we spent a lot of capital on the renovation projects are going on in fourth quarter.", "Tom DeRosa", "There's a lot of reams active commission in the capital store as well.", "Mercedes Kerr", "Which was part of our plan, Juan, let me just add something here we're talking about Vintage because if we're looking at this, we have to you know one of the value of that one portfolio was always kind of our long term outlook for the strains and the opportunities of having those really select markets, really markets that can be irreplaceable in some cases. And so just as they come in one of the things, even though we're working through all of the CapEx and [indiscernible] might be out of commission while we're working through all of that, I can tell you that the rate of growth in the Vintage portfolio actually exceeds the average Welltower growth rate which as you probably know exceeds the market average as well. So the cities themselves are the -- they're almost tenants holding out hopefully and that we think is an important driving decision for that investment.", "Juan Sanabria", "So it's a benefit in '18 but it was a drag in the fourth quarter. Why was it a drag in the fourth quarter given the low occupancy starting point?", "Shankh Mitra", "It\u2019s a lot of CapEx as I said is being spent on Vintage right now, their renovations are going on. I would not necessarily think it will be a benefit to '18, it will be a drag in few quarters and benefiting few quarters right. I would be hopeful that Vintage as its run rate starts to help the portfolio growth starting '19. But as you can see from the CapEx page most of the CapEx started to get spend in the fourth quarter. So that's been a drag in Q1 and Q2 and you will probably see the impact of that in towards the fourth quarter of the year.", "Juan Sanabria", "On the dividend what are you guys thinking about going forward, it looks like on your fad guidance it\u2019s in the low to mid 90% payout ratio. So how should we think about that any risk of dividend cut at any point if you decide to sell more Genesis assets for whatever reason or are they high yielding assets?", "Shankh Mitra", "No I think, when you look at our FFO pad ratio you know we feel comfortable with that, I think we\u2019ve done a great job in the last, we think about it this way I guess Juan which is given in our output not an input and I think there is component to that, the first component is the quantum of your income stream to pay them and second is the quality of your income stream and obviously our FFO guidance for this year is down, by roughly 20 penny to the midpoint but the quality of that income steam is gone up very dramatically elements that refining our portfolio through 2017, elements of taking the rent restructure and genesis excreta.", "So we feel very comfortable with the quality of that FFO given the stream which gives us comfort around paying the dividend that we proposed on both approved going forward. So we feel very comfortable with that, the other thing is we got a great deal of balance sheet flexibility, as you know we got a pretty much the lowest leverage balance sheet in the sector, so we have the financial flexibility on the balance sheet side as well.", "Tom DeRosa", "I just amplify that in a very long-term based on the quality of the business model here because of the changes that we made, the asset quality, the improvement in the balance sheet and the strong cash flow from the decisions we made to improve the overall quality of that business, the dividend has never been more secure.", "Juan Sanabria", "Okay just a quick question on genesis, is there any discussion with genesis with that formation with regards to dam tipping any equity or was part of this restructuring?", "Shankh Mitra", "We talk to formation all the time, so I'm not going to get into any specific conversation about what we might and might going to have discussed with formation but you should assume that as majority on our sub genesis where in constant that information.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James.", "Jonathan Hughes", "I don\u2019t think I've heard this yet, but could you break down to your Shop guidance assumptions in terms of occupancy RUG-IV for and operating expense growth? And then may be how that occupancy comp should strength throughout the year given the strong flu season to start?", "Shankh Mitra", "So I did -- I'll reiterate that for you. We\u2019re expecting a low -- no, we're modeling, a low 3% rate growth that\u2019s obviously we did, a 4% rate growth in '17, low 3% rate growth, 5,200 basis points of occupancy decline and a 3% to 4% expense growth. But as I said we will give you the, obviously this assumption at the beginning of last year, but we got to the same result, actually better than expected results using a different combination.", "So I would not -- if I were you, I would not assume these are all independent variables, right? And see where we end up like we feel comfortable, they will be in the range probably through different combination, the rates could be better or they could be worse, maybe occupancy we're thinking down 50 to 100. It could be worse than that or better than that but expenses will be better.", "So there are three levels that drive that number, so that\u2019s how I would think about and now focus on one variable. And your other question was about, how occupancy will trend, obviously given the flu, you will see low occupancy at the beginning of the year, hopefully which will ramp back into the end of the year. That\u2019s how, usually that\u2019s how seasonality was in this business, anyway, so you will probably see that more pronounce this year because of flu.", "Jonathan Hughes", "Okay that\u2019s helpful and then just one more on Shop. So with the national average U.S. renter I guess REVPOR like 4,000 a month in yours is north of 7. Is the new product under construction really even they're competitive to your properties? I mean I am assuming most of the newbuilds are going to price it about, 125% of markets that would be roughly 5,000 a month, just curious as to your use on how serious the new supply thread is to your U.S. Shop assets?", "Shankh Mitra", "There is absolutely no doubt that the new supply is impacting our performance, but obviously it's impacting our performance lot less, than the market average and our competitors and one of the reasons is what you outlined, the another one is what Mercedes talked about is the quality of our operator. We have the best assets in the best submarkets, not only the markets, which is not only difficult to build, but also they're premier assets, obviously the quality of care and reputation of those assets in those markets matter, and -- do we think it's competitive? Absolutely, do we think that we're positioned better than our competition, rest of the market? Absolutely, yes.", "Shankh Mitra", "Think about what Mercedes said earlier about Sunrise, and J.D. Power, there're six categories, they rank number one in five of the six, and the one they didn't rank number one in was price, which means they're probably a little bit more expensive than others, so they didn't get the number one ranking there, but that is very significant, you've never seen J.D. Power the most respective research house for consumer research every rank senior housing operators, and it's pretty extraordinary that Sunrise was by far the number one name in the business. And I would tell you if you haven't seen that ranking, we'll send it to you because I think it'll be interesting to see where some of the other names have ranked.", "Operator", "Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call.
